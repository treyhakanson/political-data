His reputation for lawyerly inaction may never recover. Obama's critics have said that he is a weak leader in general and in particular does not understand what must be done to combat terrorism. ""They are very much giving up that center of attention and focus that's required,""  said former Vice President Dick Cheney in March 2009, in a typical remark. Yet what emerges from the details of Bin Laden's killing (offered, like the heroic accounts of the Bush years, entirely by officials who work for the sitting president) is that from early in his administration Obama was focused on killing Osama Bin Laden and that he was involved in the process throughout. In June 2009, Obama directed his CIA director to ""provide me within 30 days a detailed operation plan for locating and bringing to justice"" Osama Bin Laden. By August 2010 intelligence officials had identified the suspicious compound where Osama lived.  Thirty-five miles outside Islamabad, the walls were up to 18 feet high and topped with barbed wire. * The largest structure, a three-story building, had very few windows. Though the house was valued at $1 million, it had no Internet or phone service. Its residents, unlike their neighbors, burned their trash. Detainees being held at Guantanamo provided some of the strongest information about those who were trusted by Bin Laden. They identified a courier and his brother who lived in Abbottabad, Pakistan, an affluent suburb where a lot of retired Pakistani military officers live. The final phase of the painstaking process started in mid-February. Intelligence officials started to get good information on the compound. A series of meetings were held in the White House to develop aggressive intelligence gathering operations. A family lived at the compound that matched the description of the Bin Laden family. By mid-March the president was chairing the national security meetings on the operation. (In all he would chair five such meetings, including the ones on the day the operation took place.) Early Friday morning before departing to view tornado damage in Alabama, the president gave the order to initiate the operation to kill Bin Laden. On Sunday, he met throughout the day in the Situation Room, making final preparations and receiving updates. The assault team arrived by helicopter. Administration officials were vague about what happened next.  Bin Laden ""did resist the assault force"" and he was killed in a firefight, which leaves plenty of room for details to come out in the screenplay. Bin Laden's oldest son and the two couriers were also killed. One woman, whom a senior administration official said was used as a shield by one of the men, was killed. Two other women were injured. At about 4 p.m., the president received first word that his orders had very likely led to the successful assassination of the architect of the greatest attack ever on America. No other country, including Pakistan, knew of the attack, but the president in his remarks was clear that the operation couldn't have taken place without the help of the Pakistani government. ""Our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to Bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding."" The president went to sleep to the sound of cheering outside the White House. At Ground Zero in New York and towns across the country, people gathered to sing the national anthem and chant ""USA! USA!"" It was a flicker of the post-9/11 unity that the president had referenced in his remarks earlier in the evening. In his remarks announcing the operation, the president sought to rekindle that feeling, but he went further. He made the latest in a series of paeans to the American spirit. Under assault from conservatives who say he does not believe in the idea of American exceptionalism, Obama took the opportunity to reiterate his belief in the unique qualities of his countrymen:"	Osama Bin Laden dead: How Obama's focused pursuit paid off.
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/exceptionally_thin.html	"Rick Santorum doesn't doubt that President Obama was born in this country, but he does doubt whether he believes in it. In a wide-ranging foreign policy speech Thursday, the likely presidential candidate argued that because Obama does not believe America plays a special role in the world, he is unfit to lead America. Santorum's speech offered a 10-point plan for reviving American foreign policy, including protecting defense spending from cuts, support for Israel and better intelligence capabilities. At its heart though, the speech was guided by the notion that America can prosper only if its leader promotes the belief that it is a unique moral force in the world, promoting freedom and fighting evil in countries like Iran, Venezuela, and China. One of the problems with Obama, Santorum says, is that ""he doesn't believe America is exceptional."" This is not a new charge. Several conservatives have made it (Mitt Romney has even reduced it to a bumper sticker: ""Believe in America""). But when I talked to Santorum after his speech, however, the clear bright distinctions about ideas of freedom and America's role became less clear. As a political critique, the American exceptionalism claim is powerful. Upon examination, however, it loses much of its force. Obama, who has spoken regularly since the early days of his campaign about the unique qualities of the American character, thinks America is exceptional. It's just that his definition of exceptional isn't the same as conservatives'. This is a legitimate debate--but it's not the same debate as whether the president believes in the idea at all. ""He was asked point blank whether he believed in American exceptionalism and his answer was people of every culture think they are exceptional,"" Santorum said of the president. A host of conservatives have cited this passage from an answer Obama gave at a press conference at a NATO summit in April 2009. The part of the answer they cite--and leave it at that--is when Obama says, ""I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."" So I asked the senator about the rest of Obama's answer, starting with the next sentence, in which he said: ""I am enormously proud of my country and its role and history in the world."" Obama then listed the sacrifices Americans had made to make the world free, and concluded by saying that ""America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world."" I asked Santorum about his claim that Obama believes ""America had nothing to offer the world"" given that, in the answer Santorum cites, the president also said: ""I think that we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our body of law, in our democratic practices, in our belief in free speech and equality, that, though imperfect, are exceptional."" ""Those are processes,"" said the former senator. ""Yes those are processes, and I would agree that those processes are important, but what I talked about was the core concept of American exceptionalism not being in the Constitution but being in the Declaration of Independence. Which is the idea of limited government. And that the purpose of government is to create an opportunity for people to be free."" Santorum also said that Obama had apologized for America, though he couldn't cite a specific instance. Conservatives sometimes cite a line from Obama's speech in Cairo in June 2009. ""We sometimes make mistakes. We are not perfect."" (There are other instances.) Yet Santorum himself, when talking about America as a ""moral force,"" makes clear that America has not always been perfect. He pointed me to ""caveats"" in his speech when he talked about America as a moral enterprise. ""It's a moral enterprise, but like any moral enterprise, you know we all fall short. ... We don't always live up to those principles, but I think we have an obligation to strive to do so."" Substantively, if not rhetorically, this view is no different than the president's. Where Santorum and other conservatives disagree with the president is the instances in which America has fallen short. But that's a disagreement less severe than the broad charge that America is a failure. By the end of our interview, Santorum had all but abandoned his textual analysis of Obama's remarks. ""Politicians always give some sort of platitudes,"" he said. ""What American president isn't going to say America is a great country? Of course he is going to say America is a great country. Or, America is an exceptional country."" He suggested that Obama be judged on whether his actions were consistent with the idea that America should play a moral role in the world based on ideas of freedom that Santorum had outlined in his speech. Hadn't the president just launched a military operation in Libya based in part on the same kind of moral imperatives Santorum had discussed in his speech? ""There will be times ... when our safety is not directly threatened but our interests and values are,"" Obama said in March. He talked about ""our responsibilities to our fellow human beings,"" universal rights, and the core principles Americans share with those fighting Qaddafi. He cited America's unique history--""born, as we are, out of a revolution by those who longed to be free."" Santorum dismissed the idea. ""Why didn't he get involved when there was an opportunity four or five days into this conflict, when they were asking for our help; why didn't he get involved if freedom is the watch word?"" He also wondered why, if the president cared about freedom, he stopped short of finishing the job and overthrowing Qaddafi. Santorum's foreign policy vision, despite his talk of America's moral force and the obligation to support freedom, is a realist approach. He said he wasn't sure he would have intervened in Libya. The freedom of oppressed Libyan citizens was not reason enough. He also criticized the United States for not sticking with its longtime ally, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Substantively Santorum may be right, but if Obama failed in those cases it was in part because he put too much emphasis on supporting the aspirations of the protesters demanding freedom. He behaved like the kind of president Santorum said he would like to be. Watch John Dickerson's Interview with Rick Santorum: Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/born_identity.html	"After President Obama released his birth certificate this morning, he appeared in the White House briefing room to prove that he was indeed born. Still, the robot rumors persist. It was a day for wild exaggerations, or at least the woozy feeling from straddling the two poles of the news moment. At one end: The president named his new national security team, at a time when the country is engaged in combat in several countries. The chairman of the Federal Reserve was scheduled to give a long-anticipated press conference about the state of the economy. Peaceful protesters were being gunned down in Syria. At the other end: There were so many news cameras in New Hampshire to cover Donald Trump's visit there you might have thought that the royal couple itself had planned to honeymoon on Lake Winnipesaukee. This isn't the end of the world as we know it. But it's not a great moment. And it's worth asking, before we arrive at the next Most Embarrassing Moment in American Political Discourse, how we arrived at this pass. If we're going to apportion blame, then let's be clear about who gets what. So, then: Donald Trump. Is all this his fault? Not really. He's just producing the show. We're the ones watching, and we're the ones sending the cameras there. And some of us are too lazy to spend time with Google or Dave Weigel's reporting to understand the claims about Obama's birth. According to the Gallup poll 24 percent of respondents in a recent poll have doubts about Obama's being ""natural born,"" the constitutional requirement  for a president. What is the danger of Trump? That a man with money, the ability to attract news coverage and a crusading ignorance of the facts will hijack the political conversation? You might argue that's pretty much already happened. Sure, Trump has elevated this to a kind of Dada performance art, but for a lot of people the political system is already a joke. It's only those of us in the political class who are just now waking up to this. Part of Trump's appeal is that he is a giant middle finger to the political system--the politicians, the press, all of us. This is all very postmodern, of course. Trump is not a champion of those who have lost faith in the system. He's a champion of himself. His views are not well-known. But he is a place for the faithless to park their feelings. It's also worth asking what, exactly, Trump is defiling. The political system in which candidates are pressed repeatedly on their views on side issues like evolution? The political system in which candidates spend most of their time and energy fixated on raising money from a group of people with extremely narrow interests? The political system that routinely allows candidates to give meaningless answers to questions that they simultaneously claim require an adult conversation? Which brings us to the White House. The White House strategy has long been to focus on ""important issues"" and not get distracted by the news cycle. But it is not above using the very distractions it decries to call attention to the issues it cares about. The birth-certificate issue was a distraction, but it was also a bedevilment that could flare up at any time in the future. It was also a political opportunity. In this way the president's visit to the press room was not so much a deviation from his long-term political strategy as an extension of it. The president wants to present himself as the only adult in the crazy political world: I am focused on important issues that you care about. This gave him a chance to do that. He called out the ""carnival barkers,"" but he also called out the media for its obsession with shiny objects like his birth certificate at the expense of more ""important debates."" Politicians in Washington weren't going to have any time to address the serious issues, he said, if they were distracted with side issues like this one. ""We're not going to be able to do it if we spend time vilifying each other. We're not going to be able to do it if we just make stuff up and pretend that facts are not facts."" Obama has struck this pose before, during the fight over extending the Bush tax cuts and the threat of a government shutdown. (One suspects that, if there hadn't been a crazy distraction upon which the president could play out this theater, the White House carpenters would have erected one.) That the president sought to make his stand on the day that Trump was visiting New Hampshire showed that while he may disdain the political media, he isn't above taking advantages of its appetites. The president was right, of course, that the media eats this stuff up, though he overplayed his hand by claiming that the birther story was the ""dominant"" one in the week that he gave his big budget speech (National Journal checked his math). So why did he say it? There are at least three reasons someone would hold this view: You're fibbing to make your position look better, you're so totally obsessed by cable that it defines your world, or you're in a defensive crouch. None of these reflects well on this president, even in a moment when there are other throbbing targets worthy of our condemnation. The risk for the White House in releasing the long-form birth certificate is not that it would elevate Trump. The White House would dearly love it if the GOP became the Trump Party. It makes Republicans look loopy and unserious to the voters that will decide the general election. The issue also creates tension within the party, as more earth-bound Republicans (who, like Obama, claim that they are adults focused on serious matters) try to kill discussion of the issue. For Donald Trump, however, the overriding issue has always been Donald Trump. ""Today I'm very proud of myself,"" Trump said in New Hampshire. One of the great benefits of the Tea Party movement has been to reacquaint some Americans with the nobler qualities of some of our founders. Humility was key among them. Washington took to the new presidency with reluctance. Trump would have put his name in gold leaf above the first presidential residence in Philadelphia. Putting aside Trump mockery--difficult as that may be--and taking him seriously for a moment, this episode has revealed yet another reason he is so spectacularly ill-suited to the presidency. The most important task for a president is knowing how to set priorities and maintain a sense of perspective. By founding his candidacy around the question of Obama's birth, Trump fails this basic test. Trump has moved his focus to questioning whether Obama was qualified to attend Harvard. (Obama graduated magna cum laude and served as editor of the Harvard Law Review, trinkets not just distributed at the bookstore.) One of the evils of racism is that it locks in the idea that no matter how well you do, your achievements will never be considered legitimate. Because of the color of your skin, someone will always be raising doubts about you. The only way Trump can top himself now is to attack Obama for not serving in Vietnam. Maybe he's saving that for the fall campaign, along with the dancing lions and flaming acrobats.

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/youre_all_nuts.html	"Good news, everyone! We have survived the latest flare-up of the conspiracy theory generally known as ""Trig Trutherism""--the discredited hypothesis that Sarah Palin's youngest son is not hers. Last week,  The Lies of Sarah Palin author Geoffrey Dunn published a lengthy piece--spiked by the Huffington Post, then acquired by the traffic-hungrier Business Insider--going over the same turf. His argument was blown to smithereens by Justin Elliott at Salon as well as by other reporters who sighed and decided to engage with one of the duller conspiracy theories of all time. (A serious conspiracy theory should seem less like a General Hospital subplot.) Much less dull was the explanation Dunn gave for writing his piece. ""This past week Palin had the gall to giggle and smirk her way through an interview on Fox News in which she supported Donald Trump's investigation of President Obama's birth certificate in Hawaii,"" Dunn wrote. ""The hypocrisy is staggering. There is one person who can put an end to the Trig matter immediately and instantly, and that is Sarah Palin."" It's a familiar rationale for conspiracy theorists: They investigate as much in sorrow as in anger. They are always just one confession away from the truth. This kind of logic is much more understandable, if no more sensible, after reading  Among the Truthers: A Journey Through America's Growing Conspiracist Underground, a smart and serious new book by Canadian journalist Jonathan Kay. His book shows why Americans are becoming so willing to believe lurid fantasies about the government or politicians they don't like or vaccines or the theory that the federal government was behind the attacks of 9/11 (these believers are the ""truthers"" of his title). And you realize that the world of conspiracies is only going to get larger. There are basically two reasons for this, and they're entwined. The media, as Kay points out, is more fragmented than ever. Information is easier to come across, and bogus information has a way of jumping to the top of Google's search pages. That fragmentation is happening at a time of intense partisan anger and economic angst. All of those facts are well-known, and thoroughly studied. The Gallup Poll asks an annual question about whether voters trust the government. In 2010, only 19 percent said they did, and only 43 percent--a record low--said that they trusted the media. That same year, the Pew Research Center found that 61 percent of Americans got most of their news online, 54 percent got it from the radio, and only 50 percent got it from newspapers. The more people read news online, the easier it is for them to find news that jibes with their ideology. Kay's book is half reportage and half evidence. Both halves demonstrate that mistrust in institutions--which aren't doing the best job of running things right now--is driving a wave of conspiracy-mongering. To a man, the leading 9/11 Truthers that Kay interviews say that they found their obsession because they didn't trust the government and they sought out information from some samizdat source. Richard Gage, the best-known member of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, tells Kay that he tuned into the lefty KPFA northern California radio station one day and caught a terrifying, authoritative-sounding--and bogus--interview with 9/11 Truther icon David Ray Griffin. ""How come I'd never heard of any of this?"" Gage remembers thinking. ""I was shocked. I had to pull my car to the side of the road to absorb it all."" Robert Balsamo, a co-founder of Pilots for 9/11 Truth, has a similar story. He turned on the news one day and saw Glenn Beck trying to debunk conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon with new, grainy video. Balsamo wasn't convinced, and he ""started poking around on the Internet, seeing if he could find a clearer version of the video. Instead, what he found were Truther sites."" The Truthers who Kay quotes here are the leading lights of the movement. They're dug in more than the average Web surfer. But they started to dig because they felt uneasy, and they surfed the Web, and they found a whole alternate history (and occasionally, alternate science) that looked and felt more comfortable than the one they were living through. And so did a lot of other people. They were motivated by mistrust in their ""leaders."" And the motivations weren't always wrong. Look at the 9/11 conspiracy. Some of Kay's sources have tenuous connections to reality. Most of them got interested in the conspiracy because something else seemed ... wrong. As Kay points out, ""Trutherism"" didn't really take off until 2003, when it was clear there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. If you were already inclined to think that George W. Bush had been unfairly put into office in 2000, if you had read the Project for a New American Century's letters from the end of the Clinton years, well, this was enough to drive you nuts. A  2006 poll conducted by the Scripps Survey Research Center at Ohio University famously found that 36 percent of all Americans, and more than half of Democrats, suspected that ""people in the federal government either assisted in the 9/11 attacks or took no action to stop the attacks because they wanted to United States to go to war in the Middle East.""* There's some room for misunderstanding here. After all, most Americans are now aware of the intelligence failures that preceded the attacks. But the numbers remained high when respondents were pressed on other, darker conspiracy theories. They found that 21.1 percent of Democrats, and 18.5 percent of liberals, said it was at least somewhat likely that ""the Pentagon was not struck by an airliner captured by terrorists but instead was hit by a cruise missile fired by the United States military."" And 24.8 percent of Democrats, and 21 percent of liberals, said it was at least somewhat likely that ""the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York was aided by explosives secretly planted in the building."" You can see what they were thinking. You can see what a large number of today's conservatives are thinking when they admit to pollsters that they've got some doubts about Obama's citizenship. Kay sums it up: ""If the mainstream media isn't willing to investigate the dirt about Obama we do know to be true ... who knows what other dirt is out there?"" How and when do people stop thinking like that if they don't trust the media, and if ""unreported facts"" about their obsessions are a click of the ""I'm feeling lucky"" button away? They don't stop. Kay's research is reassuring, in its way, because by taking all these obsessions seriously, he can diagnose their origin. The problem of the conspiracy theorist is the problem of the ""failed historian."" Kay gives an example. For a while, Sigmund Freud believed that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet after his father died. When Freud wrote The Interpretation of Dreams, he cited the play as a key Oedipal work. But in 1919, historians discovered that Shakespeare wrote the play before his father died. How did Freud respond? He became obsessed with the conspiracy theory that the 17th Earl of Oxford had written the plays credited to ""William Shakespeare.""Are the paranoid Democrats of 2006 and the unhinged Republicans of 2011 following in the footsteps of Sigmund Freud? Maybe. They might even argue that the stakes are higher for them: All Freud had to do was defend a thick chunk of his book. They're on the cusp of losing their country. In that sense, these modern-day political conspiracy theories may actually be comforting: They assume that our political leaders are hyper-competent. They've developed, then covered up, Rube Goldberg designs to get what they want and maintain their power. This is no small achievement. If, on the other hand, the conspiracy theorists are wrong, well, that means the world is random, and the people who wield power or influence can screw up like everyone else. No one wants to believe that. Correction,  April 26, 2011: This article originally misstated the university that hosts the Scripps Survey Research Center. It is Ohio University, not Ohio State.

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/wanted_angry_liberals.html	"These are good days to be a member of Congress. Your job is not popular, per se, and neither is the institution you work for. But at least you're not getting yelled at. A controversial Republican budget just passed the House, you're home in your district, and the anger that curdled town hall meetings for members of the last Congress is really nowhere to be seen. Take the case of Rep. Pat Meehan, R-Pa. He's a freshman who won an open Democratic seat last year--a seat that John Kerry won by six percentage points and that Barack Obama carried by 13. He's the subject of a muckraking blog, The Meehan Report, which has video from before the election of the congressman being asked about Rep. Paul Ryan's plans to privatize Medicare. ""That's the agenda I'm not voting for,"" said Meehan. He proceeded to vote for it. Yet the reaction at home has not been ugly. Today, Meehan held a widely publicized town hall in the town of Radnor. Twenty people showed up. They were not all happy, and there was one constituent annoyed that Meehan ""never answered the question"" about the budget. But there was no reaction worthy of YouTube, nothing for cable news. That, for liberals who enjoy nailing Republicans to the wall about their votes, was an opportunity missed. The town halls of 2009--dry runs in June, and really volcanic ones in August--changed the way that Washington talked about the law that would become the Affordable Care Act. And there was a science to them. Democrats took a long, lumbering time to figure that science out. But they haven't copied it. Not yet. Have there been town halls with a little more anger and vigor than Meehan's? Of course. On Thursday, the Huffington Post's Jason Linkins pointed to four local stories about gruff congressional meet-and-greets. Three of the four were held by new members who'd won districts that had been Kerry/Obama turf before. At his town hall, Rep. Charlie Bass, R-N.H., took question after question about his vote for the Ryan budget from a voter who'd voted for Obama, then voted for Bass. These are nice stories for Democrats, but they don't endanger Ryan's budget. The lack of anger on display leaves an impression: Perhaps Ryan's Medicare plan isn't inducing mass panic as the Democrats' Medicare plans did. (That would be something, because the Medicare spending cuts in ""ObamaCare"" and the reforms in Ryan's bill are not worlds apart.) If that impression sticks, Republicans will return to Washington in May with the knowledge that the polls are a little overheated and Ryan's budget is a go. Where are the liberal protesters? Is there a brilliant rope-a-dope strategy in place, some plan to get Republicans even further out on a limb before hammering them in the August recess? Possibly. Labor strategists say that there'll be a much bigger focus on generating turnout at town halls come August; Ben Smith has been reporting on their plans to nationalize the actions they pulled off in Wisconsin. There really is no larger plan in effect for now. ""We're focused on educating our members [on] the budget,"" a spokesman for the AFL-CIO told me, ""and not showing up at Republican town halls."" Democratic strategists say there is no larger strategy at work right now. Linda Christman, a Pennsylvania activist who started one of the only videotaped arguments with a member of Congress, was basically an independent operator. Meanwhile, the American Action Network, the think tank and campaign shop run by former Republican Sen. Norm Coleman, is making Ryan budget talking points and questions available for conservatives who want to buck up their members. How did Republicans get so much better at this stuff? In 2009, after all, they were basically copying the Democrats--or what they thought were Democratic tactics. That was the year when sales of Saul Alinsky's  Rules for Radicals surged. FreedomWorks, Dick Armey's Tea Party group, handed out the book to new employees, who went on to train activists. Bob MacGuffie, a Rhode Island Tea Partier, wrote a two-sided tip sheet for his peers that called for them to ""use the Alinsky playbook of which the left is so fond: Freeze it, attack it, personalize it, and polarize it."" Obviously, not everyone who made life painful for a soon-to-be-defeated Democrat was trained in Dick Armey's living room. The town halls were overflowing; Republicans returned to Washington after recesses claiming to have survived the biggest crowds they'd ever seen. And that was because all of this was going viral. Talk radio told people where to show up. The town-hall partisans used smartphone cameras and inexpensive video setups to record the damage. If Democrats actually did invent that strategy, they've since managed to forget it. The immediate reaction to the protests was dismissive. Nancy Pelosi called the disruptions ""un-American."" White House spinmasters were convinced they would backfire. They didn't backfire. So Democrats need some hot video of real, live Americans getting angry about Paul Ryan. How are they doing so far? For two days, a ThinkProgress video reporter tailed Paul Ryan in his district. The chairman of the budget committee talked to constituents. The reporter taped it. He talked to more constituents. The reporter taped it. It was at only one event, in the town of Milton, that one of Ryan's constituents grilled Ryan about taxes and ThinkProgress' reporter Scott Keyes got the video; according to ThinkProgress' editor-in-chief, Faiz Shakir, it was the best clip from two days' reporting. ""You have to lower spending,"" said one constituent. ""But it's a matter of there's nothing wrong with taxing the top because it does not trickle down."" ""We do tax the top,"" said Ryan as he is drowned out by boos. It's hardly incendiary. But for Democratic activists looking for some anger, it's a start."	If the Ryan budget is so unpopular, where are the town-hall meltdowns?

One: Hammer home a message until it's embedded in the brain like a Rebecca Black track. Two: Make it clear that there will never be a new answer to an irksome question. Republicans have latched on to a very good talking point, and it's been all over the place in the run-up to Tax Day. On April 14, when asked why Republicans wouldn't consider tax increases as a way to reduce the deficit, Speaker of the House John Boehner explained: ""Washington does not have a revenue problem. Washington has a spending problem."" That same day, Majority Leader Eric Cantor got the same question. ""The fact [that] I think most Americans get, Washington does not have a revenue problem. It's got a spending problem."" Also on the same day, speaking to an annual event put on by Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, Orrin Hatch completed the loop. ""We don't have a revenue problem,"" said Hatch. ""We all know we have a spending problem."" If you teleported to three different parts of the Capitol Building and talked to three different Republicans, you would have gotten the same answer. How did Republicans develop this line, and how much sense does it make? The first question's easy. When Republicans start Xeroxing a pleasant-sounding aphorism, odds are that they got it from Ronald Reagan. On March 28, 1982, Reagan addressed the National Association of Realtors in Washington. His first tax cuts had been passed into law. The economy was still in the dumps. Unemployment was 9 percent. The eggheads wanted to know why, during a recession, they shouldn't worry about shrinking tax revenue when defense and entitlement costs were ballooning. ""We don't have a trillion-dollar debt because we have not taxed enough,"" said Reagan, ""but we have a trillion dollar debt because we spend too much."" That was where the spending/revenue line began. It got shortened by a decades-long game of telephone and focus-grouping, and only a few Republicans, like Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, try to credit the line to Reagan. Perhaps it shouldn't be credited to him. When Reagan spoke to Realtors, taxes were far higher than they are now. The top marginal rate--there were then 12 rates--was 50 percent. The bottom rate was 12 percent. But Reagan's tax cuts didn't shrink the debt, and they didn't increase tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. In 1981, tax receipts were 19.6 percent of GDP; outlays were 22.2 percent. For the next six years, as Reagan agreed to some tax increases, revenue stayed lower and outlays stayed higher. It wasn't until 1987, the year after a massive tax simplification that cut the rates and the number of brackets, that outlays fell below where they had been in 1981. It wasn't until 1998 when revenue got back to that level. And what about the debt? Oh, yeah. The ""trillion-dollar debt"" Reagan told Realtors about was about $994 billion when he took office. When he left office, it was $2.87 trillion. Democrats love to point that out. Republicans love to punch right back and say that Reagan had to wrestle with a Democratic Congress, so his ability to cut spending was limited. Of course, politics in 2011 are a mirror image of the politics of 1982. One party controls the White House and Senate; one party controls the House. But when Reagan riffed on revenue and spending, there was no real panic about the debt or the deficit. Now there is. And the ""It's a spending problem, not a revenue problem"" line is intended to close off one response to the debt panic, the response that has always made supply-siders sweat: raising taxes. Republicans are fighting that off with a combination of honesty and audacity. The honesty began with Paul Ryan's budget rollout. It's true that Ryan's budget doesn't balance the budget until 2035. But it does voucherize Medicare and turn Medicaid into a system of block grants. That would do some good, as far as the deficit's concerned. Earlier this year, when the International Monetary Fund assessed ways for America to tackle its debt, its economists decided that doing so would mean ""raising all taxes and cutting all transfer payments immediately and for the indefinite future by 35 percent."" Allowing the pre-Bush tax rates to return would balance the budget, eventually--the budget would be balanced even faster if that was combined with entitlement reform. But the Ryan budget cuts spending and taxes, lowering the top marginal rate to 25 percent. How does the Ryan budget handle the apparent paradox? Go to Page 17. ""The U.S. government is not running sustained deficits because Americans are taxed too little,"" the authors write. ""The government is running deficits because it spends too much."" A few paragraphs later, we get the short version. ""Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem."" Say it enough, and maybe it'll become true. On Monday, S&P revised the outlook on American bonds to ""negative"" because its analysts feared there'd be no serious deficit-reduction plan by 2013. Republicans jumped all over the report. ""Today's announcement makes clear that the debt limit increase proposed by the Obama administration must be accompanied by meaningful fiscal reforms that immediately reduce federal spending and stop our nation from digging itself further into debt,"" said Cantor. Curiously, no Republicans (and, to be fair, no Democrats) highlighted this piece of S&P advice:""Standard & Poor's takes no position on the mix of spending and revenue measures the Congress and the Administration might conclude are appropriate."" There's a simpler way of putting that: We have a spending problem and a revenue problem. And if you talk about one, and not the other, you're not taking either problem very seriously."

Paul asked as he watched in his threadbare temporary Senate office on Wednesday afternoon. ""Didn't he just release a budget a month ago?"" The president was in fact revising himself, upping his commitment to deficit reduction from the budget he put forth in February. ""He's reading the tea leaves,"" Paul said, grinning at his pun. ""Or they're hearing the polls which say we're winning all the battles."" Obama was not speaking to Paul. But if not for the Kentucky senator and the Tea Party movement he represents, the president might not have been speaking at all. Obama was playing catch-up, showing that he could at least keep pace with the government-cutting leaps performed by conservative Republicans. But he was also yelling, ""Stop,"" issuing his strongest indictment to date of budget policies he says would hurt America if enacted. This was a battle cry in the great budget debate to come--or as near to a battle cry as the pragmatic and careful Obama can offer. The president took a moral stand based on the idea that Americans must maintain their commitment to help the poor and unlucky or else trade away greatness. He defended the good that government can do, putting this speech in the same category as the appeal he made to House Democrats on the eve of the vote on his health care program. The speech was sweeping in scope and clarified the terms of the debate we'll be having until the 2012 election. It is the discussion of big issues the president and his aides have been waiting for. White House aides have long been saying that Obama did not want to wade into the smaller fight over last year's budget so that he could preserve himself for the bigger fight to come. Obama claimed that Republicans didn't just want to shrink the budget but wanted to change ""the basic social compact."" Republicans offer a vision of America in which government gets out of the way to unleash the power of the free market, which in turn allows prosperity to spread for all. Obama acknowledged that this was a part of the American character, but argued that in pursuit of this goal Republicans were abandoning an equally fundamental and historic commitment: to the American belief that ""we are all connected."" Republicans have accused the president of insufficiently heralding America's greatness. Obama's aides have long seen the grand budget battle as his opportunity to turn this accusation against Republicans. Obama started the effort in the State of the Union, arguing that his vision was in sync with the concept of America's exceptional qualities. In this speech he turned the idea into a weapon, accusing Republicans of insufficient hope in the nation. Calling the United States ""the greatest nation on Earth,"" the president said the cuts Republicans posed ""paint a vision of our future that's deeply pessimistic"" in which the less fortunate and the investments in growth must be abandoned. ""We are a better country because of these commitments,"" he said. ""I'll go further--we would not be a great country without those commitments."" ""He is so out of touch he just doesn't get it,"" said Paul after the speech. ""If you care about poor people and you care about senior citizens, you can't accept the status quo."" Paul's argument is that the budget crisis threatens the government's ability to honor its commitments. Paul would allow the retirement age to rise and would also allow means-testing benefits for the wealthy. Obama tried to define a framework for a budget agreement, but he also tried to define the political context in which the budget debate would take place. He heralded three previous budget agreements during the last several decades, that were bipartisan and based on shared sacrifice. Several times the president drew lines he would not let Republicans cross when it came to changing the nature of Medicare or Medicaid or lowering taxes for the wealthy. He savaged Paul Ryan's budget as forcing seniors and the poor to pay more for their health care while giving tax cuts to the wealthiest. ""They want to give people like me a $200,000 tax cut that's paid for by asking 33 seniors to each pay $6,000 more in health costs?"" he said. ""That's not right, and it's not going to happen as long as I'm president."" The president called for bipartisan talks to reach a debt deal to finish by the end of June. He also offered $4 trillion in savings over the next 12 years. $1 trillion will come from tax increases. If the $4 trillion number sounds familiar, that's how much the Ryan budget cuts (though it does so in 10 years). It's likely the Obama savings come from budget tricks (Ryan's uses plenty of tricks, too) that we'll learn about as details become available. Rather than slashing benefits, the president said he would preserve entitlements by restraining their growth. He also promised unspecified defense cuts. If Congress doesn't follow through, he proposed a ""fail safe"" mechanism that would require debt as a percentage of the economy to decrease by 2014 or trigger additional spending cuts and tax changes. This has been tried before. These fail-safes have a way of working as well as the ones on the BP oil well. In the 2010 election the White House often complained that the president and Democrats were being judged in a vacuum. They wanted the election to be a choice between two visions, not a referendum. They never quite got what they wanted. By allowing the Republicans to take the first bold move on significant deficit reduction, the president was making a calculation that any points he lost for not showing leadership would be won back when voters were presented with two stark alternatives. Liberals will love the president's defense of the welfare state. But Obama's political posture was still aimed at the middle. As the Washington Post's Ezra Klein points out, this is not a liberal budget. The president's approach is founded on the suggestions of his Deficit Commission, which received several Republican votes. Obama also challenged his own party to be serious about deficit reduction. If Democrats believe that government can play a beneficial role in people's lives, he said, they had to prove it first by showing that government could be ""smarter, leaner and more effective."" The president concluded his speech with the story of a letter from a Florida man who, as a swing state voter with qualms sounded almost identical to Ed from North Carolina, a character in the video produced for Obama's re-election campaign who fit the same description. The man said he hadn't voted for Obama and didn't always agree with him but that he still believed in the American Dream and that it would require cooperation to achieve it. The president said he agreed. For the next 18 months Obama will try to convince that man from Florida that he is a good steward of that dream--and that it needs to be protected from people like Rand Paul.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/youre_under_arrest.html	"Vincent Gray found out about the details of the budget deal the same way that everyone else did. That was sort of a problem; Gray is the mayor of Washington, D.C. On Monday afternoon, Gray arrived at a rally outside the U.S. Senate offices, sponsored by DC Vote, a nonprofit with the thankless task of lobbying for representation in Congress. Gray moved slowly through the crowd, alternating between hugs for activists and polite answers for reporters. ""I sent a letter just a couple of days ago, on Friday, to Speaker Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid,"" said Gray. (As he spoke, an activist named Harry Wills hoisted a sign reading REID: TAKE THE RIDERS OUT NOW.) ""I was making the case, once again, and asking again for their support, to give the citizens of D.C. the wherewithal to spend their own money."" How'd he find out that the city didn't get it? ""I found out through the media,"" Gray said. Was he surprised by that? ""I think we deserve a response to our letter, from the speaker and the majority leader,"" he said, diplomatically, as news crews swarmed him. The news crews were there to capture what came next. Gray, joined by most of D.C.'s city council, delivers some stemwinders from on top of a small soapbox, then walked onto Constitution Avenue to block traffic. They stood there as patient police redirected traffic. They eventually sat down and talked among themselves as police gave reporters a choice between moving to the sidewalk or joining the mayor in a paddy wagon. What, exactly, were Washington's civic leaders so angry about? They thought they'd been sold out. They were not wrong. In the short-term budget negotiations, President Obama faced an impasse over some of the policy riders that Republicans had battled hard to get--a ban on funding for NPR, a ban on funding for Planned Parenthood, a measure to hamstring the EPA. The riders were traded away for deeper cuts and a few shining baubles--the D.C. riders. The city's needle exchange program would be defunded. A ban on reimbursing poor women for abortions, lifted in 2009, would be resurrected. And the school voucher program, which had expired under the Democratic Congress, would be funded again. According to the Washington Post, the president offered the abortion and voucher riders to John Boehner--they were two of his top priorities--and said, ""I will give you D.C. abortion."" The quote started circulating on Saturday. It had the expected effect, and by Monday, it was already being altered in an angry game of telephone-- most people at the rally thought Obama said ""I'll give you D.C.,"" or something similar. ""When I read those words,"" said Iler Zherka, executive director of DC Vote, ""I felt like someone punched me in the gut. I still can't get them out of my mind."" There is no nice way to write this, so here goes: Obama picked the right guts to punch. The selling out of D.C. was classic, and predictable, realpolitik. Start with D.C.'s negotiating position. It's an awfully weak one. Since 1973, D.C. has had home rule, a certain amount of control over its budget and institutions--as long as it doesn't do anything Congress doesn't want it to do. Starting in 1995, when Republicans took over the House for the first time in the home-rule era, Congress really took advantage of this. The abortion funding ban sailed through Republican committees. When D.C. voters approved a medical marijuana ballot initiative, Congress forbade the city from certifying the results. There was a glimmer of hope for D.C. liberals in 2009, when Obama took office and a Democratic majority held Congress. Congress reversed the GOP's policy decisions, but they fumbled legislation that would have given the district a vote in Congress. The bill was hung up, then killed, because Republicans successfully attached a measure that would have reversed all of D.C.'s gun laws. It seemed shortsighted for Democrats, with a two-year legislative window, to give up on more home-rule laws because Republicans would attach some policy riders to them. As home-rule activists told me last year, this was the kind of stuff that would probably pass a Republican House anyway. And so it is. ""We knew in our hearts that when the abortion funding ban was lifted, it wouldn't last,"" said Tiffany Reid, a director at the DC Abortion Fund, which helps pay when poor women need the procedure. ""We knew it would be the first thing to go if Republicans won. We planned for this to happen."" What effect does this have on D.C.? According to Douglas Johnson, the legislative director of National Right to Life, the pro-life rider could prevent one-quarter of the abortions that happen in the city every year--that would prevent, by loose estimates, from 600 to 1,000 abortions. On Monday it inspired a rally of around 100 people, most of them Democrats, newly pissed off at their party. ""I just don't support the president as much as I used to,"" sighed Lenore Serk, who carried one of many signs portraying Harry Reid as a sleazy gambler using the city as a chit. ""I'm retired, so I'm not looking for a job from anyone and I'm not afraid to say that. I can't believe he's doing this."" But it's not hard to see why Obama would do this. Obama can trade away D.C.'s laws for the same reason that Republicans don't want to give the city a vote in Congress: The city votes for Democrats at more or less the rate Egyptians used to ""vote"" for Hosni Mubarak. (The vote count is more accurate in D.C.) If we're willing to be cynical for a moment, Obama has even more room to move because a D.C. sellout is good for the city's political class. The stars of the Monday rally and arrests were Gray and City Council Chairman Kwame Brown, both of whom took office in January and started long, slow public meltdowns. Gray spent weeks explaining why he'd hired unqualified and underqualified political allies to vital city jobs, a process that reached its nadir when he gave a six-figure job to a fringe candidate (from the We Love D.C. Party) who'd been useful in his 2010 race. Brown's offenses have been pettier and flashier, none more so than the saga of two ""fully loaded"" Lincoln Navigators he'd leased on the city's dime. (The second car was ordered because the interior wasn't black, as requested, in the first car.) On Monday, Brown and Gray got to stand in front of cameras and hollering protesters, present their wrists to the police, and get slapped with plastic handcuffs. Before that, Gray got to lead the crowd in a series of cheers. ""Are you tired of being a pawn in a political game?"" asked Gray. The protesters cheered. Really, it was all they could do."

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/whats_the_big_deal.html	"Imagine a restaurant, Chez Polis, in which the chef and the manager are bitter rivals. One evening they bicker and almost come to blows over a meal. Their one patron is about to walk out but moments before he does, they declare a truce and deliver the smallest of three courses. They put the plate on the table and immediately start patting themselves on the back. This seems strange to the patron, who thought delivering a starter course was a restaurant's basic task. This is the metaphor that comes to mind after leaders in Washington announced they had reached a hard-fought deal to avert a government shutdown. The fighting was rancorous and each side had to exercise restraint, which is rare in Washington. Making choices in a time of large deficits and a fragile economy is hard. Cutting government spending affects real people. It was an accomplishment. But it's also their job to do these things. Not all accomplishments achieved with heroic effort require heroic praise. Given the economic conditions in the country, it would have been lunacy to shut down the government, which all participants knew. So the voters might be forgiven if they view the self-congratulation with a little curiosity. In evaluating the moment, though, we have to keep in mind that the politicians in Washington made it far harder for themselves than necessary. Democrats wimped out last year by not passing a budget. They decided making tough choices would have been too political in an election year. The president agreed with this strategy. This year, as members of Congress tried to clean up last year's unfinished business, conservatives prolonged the process by insisting on too many cuts in too short a time period. House leaders warned their most conservative members that they were in danger of overreading their mandate from the last election. Republicans hadn't won as much as Democrats had lost. Going on a ""spending jihad,"" as one senior GOP aide put it, would repeat the overreach that undid the Gingrich Congress the last time the GOP was in control. If John Boehner had more wiggle room from his right flank, the process might not have been brought to the brink. On the other hand, it's hard to argue with the tactical success of the Tea Party position. It's a classic negotiating ploy. Ask for the moon, act like you're willing to do anything to get it--including harm yourself and all around you--and the other side will come your way. In the end, Democrats agreed to more cuts than even House GOP leaders had first proposed. House Speaker John Boehner won those concessions from Democrats while also teaching his raucous absolutist members the benefit of taking yes for an answer. We're going to see if this strategy works when it comes to the fight over raising the debt ceiling in May and the fight over the larger budget. Paul Ryan, the House budget chairman put out a plan that looks as unworkable and doctrinaire as the spending cuts that Republicans wanted at the start of the budget negotiations that almost caused the shutdown. If Republicans get two-thirds of what they want on the budget, it would be a big success. Republicans lost on some hot-button issues like defunding Planned Parenthood. In the accounts of the negotiations, the valiant intervention of the president and Joe Biden on that issue was amply represented. Democrats may wonder, though, if removing the most restrictive provision of all the ones Republicans offered was something worth getting that excited about. The president and Harry Reid also protected other Democratic priorities by replacing GOP cuts to education with cuts to defense and other areas Democrats care less about, but the process was a fundamentally defensive one. It was John Boehner's world, and they were playing in it. The president didn't want to get dragged into the funding battle for this year. When he did, he maintained the posture of the reasonable man in the middle helping the two sparring factions come to an agreement. For independent voters who want to see compromise and government trimmed with balance, Obama's role as benevolent overseer was probably appealing. The president has cast himself in a slightly different role for the larger budget fight to come. He has already taken sides. In the State of the Union and in a series of speeches in the last several months, he has made the case for balancing the need for deficit reduction against the need for investments in education and infrastructure and energy innovation. When Obama was criticized for not engaging in the budget fight that just ended, his aides said he was saving his powder for the one to come. Now it's here. The landscape has changed now. Will Obama manage a process driven by the House of Representatives as he did in this case, or will a larger process call for a larger public role from the president? The best that can be said for the dramatic near-shutdown is that it's the best that can be expected as politicians switch from the easier task of giving voters things to the harder one of taking them away. Compromise in a time of political extremes is also encouraging. But all the bickering left little time or public oxygen for the larger issues that might have been debated about the underlying economic and moral benefits of the cuts being made. If this process is replicated for the remaining courses in the meal, the product that winds up before the voters might not be something they can stomach.

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/hostage_negotiations.html	"On Wednesday night, House Speaker John Boehner walked out of a White House meeting, stood in front of microphones with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and said that Republicans and Democrats had inched a little closer to a shutdown-preventing budget deal. About 12 hours later, Boehner announced that things had changed. ""We were closer to a number last night than we were this morning,"" he told reporters at his weekly press conference. He didn't offer too many details. Democrats claimed that the process was sidetracked by policy riders, amendments to the funding package that weakened the EPA and banned federal funding for Planned Parenthood, NPR, and the implementation of health care reform, among other things. In other words, they were arguing over liberal priorities that moonlight as conservative bugaboos and vice versa. ""What we've seen each day,"" said Washington Post reporter Paul Kane to Boehner, ""is that the morning and afternoon start with a lot of bravado, and at nighttime you guys seem to get back to optimism. When do you make these decisions? At what point--"" Boehner interrupted him. ""I'm glad you recounted that history for me."" That was snark, and it got laughs. ""It's the third straight day that started off with heated rhetoric,"" said Kane. ""Oh, really?"" asked Boehner, shrugging. ""Look, we do public policy here in Washington, and we do it in a political setting. This is what makes America different than any other country in the world."" The congressional budget process usually doesn't rank that high on lists of Things That Are Great About America. In most parliamentary systems, budgets get passed. In this system, there are multiple veto points that can stop or shred legislation. House bills die in the Senate. The president's budget proposals are sent to the House and arrive without a pulse. At midnight on Friday, if there's no continuing resolution, the government shuts down. From all appearances, negotiators in the House, Senate and White House are working to prevent that--everyone talks about a face-saving compromise that makes more sense than a shutdown. For there to be a compromise, however, every actor needs to prove that he made as few concessions as he possibly could and that the other side played in bad faith. This is what was happening on Thursday. First, Democrats and Republicans disagreed about what was being said in key meetings. This isn't unusual, but in the eleventh hour before a shutdown, it's really something to hear. In the morning, Boehner was asked if the policy riders were preventing a deal. He said that they were not. ""There are a number of issues on the table,"" said Boehner, ""and any attempt to narrow this down to one or two would just not be accurate."" Shortly after this, Democratic leaders in the Senate called a press conference in order to blister Republicans for holding the budget hostage over policy riders. ""When the speaker says there's no agreement on the number or the cuts, he does not mean that we're far apart,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' policy chairman. ""He just means he isn't ready to say so publicly yet."" ""He has to tell his Tea Party rough riders to put this horse in the barn,"" said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin. ""Save these policy riders for another day."" After this, Schumer headed outside, talking to more reporters about Boehner. ""If he is willing to buck some of the Tea Party people, we will have a deal,"" said Schumer. ""I know exactly what's been going on in those negotiations, and the number and what to cut is not standing in the way. Speaker Boehner does not want to sign off on it, because he'd just be focused on the riders, and it's the riders that are the whole issue."" Republicans had proposed a solution to this, sort of. Earlier in the week they proposed a one-week funding measure that would cut spending by $12 billion, fund the Department of Defense budget for the rest of 2011, and include just two policy riders--a ban on abortion funding in the District of Columbia, and a ban on funding that would close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. The first rider is an easy Republican win, something that has passed in previous budgets. The second was basically a dead letter. Schumer would not answer, specifically, why these were a problem and whether the Senate could take up the Republicans' measure and amend the stuff they didn't like. ""Our focus right now is to try and get a deal,"" he said, ""because this short term, short term, short term, doesn't work."" Republicans saw a trap here. Their $12 billion-cutting CR was a dead letter--the president had said, twice, that he would veto it--but it was an excellent distraction from the Democratic attacks on policy riders and the Tea Party. By bringing it to the House floor, they could put their members on record funding the Department of Defense, and attack Democrats for caring more about a budget win than about giving paychecks to troops. In a series of floor speeches, that was exactly what they did. ""I ask that this House and Senate protect our troops and fund them adequately!"" said Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala. ""We cannot put fiscal battles ahead of those who are engaged in America's real battles,"" said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind. ""We can give them certainty,"" said Rep. Ann-Marie Buerkle, R-N.Y., ""and give them what they need to keep us safe."" Democrats responded to this bill with a motion to recommit. If it had passed, it would have funded the DOD but not funded the government for that extra week, taking the ""troop funding"" issue off the table. It failed, with the vote of only one Republican, Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina. He winced when asked whether Democrats who voted against the GOP's bill were voting ""against the troops."" ""I wouldn't say that,"" said Jones. ""It's just one of those things.... There are other aspects of the bill that might be the reason they didn't want to vote for it."" The GOP's strategy, he said, ""made sense. They picked up a lot of votes they weren't going to pick up if they didn't fund the Department of Defense."" Later in the day, the ""troop funding"" vote would start to look like a chimera. Rep. Michele Bachmann said she'd support a new, clean Defense funding bill in the House, and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas introduced one in the Senate. This left House Republicans basically where they were in the morning--reminding people that they'd passed a budget, happy to talk about compromise if the Senate would meet them honestly. ""I made a promise of $100 billion to the folks back home,"" said Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas. (The $100 billion promise amounts to $61 billion in FY2011 cuts.) ""If I come home with less than that, I've got to have something to show them. If they're not going to go the full dollar amount, it needs to be the policy riders. It's important to my constituents and me. This is a choke point where we have some leverage to get things done. The big win would be $100 billion and some policy riders. The compromise would be less than that and some policy riders."" This is theoretically possible--it might even be what's being hammered out at the bipartisan meetings. In the meantime, Democrats were expressing confidence that the GOP wouldn't let a compromise happen. The last continuing resolution passed with a plurality of Democrats joining the GOP; the bill would have failed if they hadn't. One of the Democrats who joined the GOP was Rep. Brad Miller of North Carolina. I asked whether it was possible for Boehner to get a compromise that Democrats liked and pass it with their votes adding to a rump of the GOP's votes. ""I don't think he can,"" said Miller. ""If Boehner does that, he's a crippled leader within the Republican Party. This is as much about internal Republican politics as it is about anything else."" That's not how Republicans want it to look. As the day closed, with another White House meeting coming, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, took to the floor of the Senate and blamed the impasse on Democrats. ""If the president wants to shut down the government over this bipartisan troop funding bill, that is his prerogative,"" said Hatch. ""But I would urge him to reconsider his veto threat and join us in preventing a shutdown instead."" Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., was the next to take the floor. ""Have you ever noticed that when someone points their finger and says it's all your fault, it's all your fault--have you ever noticed that there are three fingers pointing back at them?"" This, as John Boehner said, makes America different than any other country in the world."	Government shutdown: As it gets more likely, Washington politics gets more immature.
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/baby_sitter_in_chief.html	"President Obama had another ""Daddy's home!"" moment on Tuesday. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have bickered themselves into a stalemate over how to fund government for the rest of the fiscal year, so Obama took to the White House briefing room to scold them into action. ""It would be inexcusable for us not to be able to take care of last year's business,"" he said, ""simply because of politics."" This was a departure for a president who has been trying to stay out of negotiations directly. It was a sign that progress had broken down--but also that Obama really does not want to risk a shutdown. It also cast doubt about prospects for agreement on the new and improved budget debate over government operations that was starting on the very day Obama was trying to settle the old and tired one. House budget committee Chairman Paul Ryan released a bold blueprint for the next 10 years that cuts $4 trillion, setting up a grand debate between the president and congressional Republicans over the role of government, the nature of leadership, the meaning of compromise, and, not incidentally, the central themes of the 2012 election. Addressing last year's unfinished business, the president said he wanted everyone to ""act like grownups"" but argued that he and Democrats had compromised by meeting Republicans halfway on their demands. He said he'd hold meetings at the White House until both parties worked something out. We've seen this posture from the president before--chiding politicians for playing politics when the American people just want to see something get done. He played this role during the debate over the Bush tax cuts last year, letting the two sides bicker and then, after they'd exhausted themselves, walking into the basement rec room and getting the sweaty, red-faced teenagers to shake hands. This time, though, the president seemed irritated that he had to engage. ""I shouldn't have to oversee a process in which Congress deals with last year's budget when we only have six months left,"" he said. Oversee is a slightly kinder word than baby-sit, but that was the thrust of the president's view. Republicans pointed out that the president was fussing about having to break up the game-playing but that it was Democratic leaders in control of both chambers of Congress last year who turned the whole business into a game by not passing a budget. (In fairness to Democratic leaders, that wasn't mere game-playing. That was serious duty-shirking.) While the president seemed irritated he had to straighten out members of Congress, Ryan was receiving praise for his bold act of leadership. In a town obsessed with the need to be serious about the budget, Ryan won the grand prize. Not only was his plan big, but it met a key Washington seriousness test: He was willing to court political disaster to meet his goals. Trouble was quick in coming. His plans to reform Medicare and Medicaid, just two of myriad proposals, were deemed by the Congressional Budget Office to have politically toxic potential outcomes. According to a preliminary report (which credited the plan with increasing GDP and national income due to deficit reduction), the Ryan plan would cause the elderly on Medicare to pay more for their health care. Less politically volatile, the CBO also said the plan would lead to reduced benefits for Medicaid recipients. If the Ryan plan was bold on the leadership front, it was weak on the political front. As Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget outlined the problem: It's never going to pass in a Congress in which Democrats control the Senate. ""The national discussion has moved beyond just finding a plan with sufficient savings to finding one that can generate enough support to move forward,"" she wrote. This marked the difference between Ryan's conception of leadership and Obama's. Obama says he shares Ryan's goals, but he was relatively timid in the budget he released this year. He could have endorsed his deficit commission's recommendations, but he didn't. This, White House aides have argued for weeks, was a tactical decision. Had Obama put forward a bold plan or endorsed his commission, it would have become the ""Obama Plan."" That immediately would have created a polarizing dynamic. For ready examples, they point to last year's health care battle. A president, they argue, must exercise a more subtle kind of leadership when it comes to complicated issues such as entitlement reform. Republicans had control of both houses of Congress when George Bush offered his plan to reform Social Security in his 2005 State of the Union address, but the plan still couldn't get through. Obama has not been engaged in the debate about the current year's budget directly. But this larger debate over the role of government is the one he wants to have. In presenting his plan, Ryan said he was promoting a cause, not a budget. The president would agree. He has been putting forward the philosophy behind his cause since the State of the Union in January. Ryan believes that shrinking government will spur the economy. The president says cuts are necessary, but so are investments in education, infrastructure, and alternative energy. The president's political and governing posture can be summed up in a single word: ""balance."" Just as with his remarks at the podium Tuesday, that's the message of his larger budget approach. In a sense, he needs Ryan so that he can play his preferred role as balancer. The White House engaged immediately in the larger budget fight. ""While we agree with his ultimate goal, we strongly disagree with his approach,"" said a White House statement. ""Any plan to reduce our deficit must reflect the American values of fairness and shared sacrifice. Congressman Ryan's plan fails this test. It cuts taxes for millionaires and special interests while placing a greater burden on seniors who depend on Medicare or live in nursing homes, families struggling with a child who has serious disabilities, workers who have lost their health care coverage, and students and their families who rely on Pell grants."" After the president left the press room, White House spokesman Jay Carney was asked why issues always had to come to a crisis point before they were resolved. On tough issues, that's sometimes the only way politicians will focus. Crisis feelings about the deficit converted many of the Republicans who now decry Washington spending but once voted to increase it significantly when they were in power. Carney said crisis arrangements weren't the preferred method, but they're not all bad for this president. If the debates didn't go to the brink, Obama wouldn't be able to play the adult arriving to make things right.

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/sharia_usa.html	"OKLAHOMA CITY-- Sally Kern's office in the Oklahoma state house is busy, with more trinkets than a cheer coach's trophy room. Here's an award from Americans United for Life. Here's a photo of George W. Bush throwing out the first ball at the 2002 World Series. Here's Theodore Roosevelt, hand on his hip, standing in front of a globe. ""I've put that photo of Roosevelt there because of the inscription,"" says Kern. She reads it: ""We can have no 50/50 allegiance in this country. Either a man is an American, and nothing else, or he is not an American at all."" That brings Kern to the topic of sharia law. In 2010, Oklahoma voters passed a ballot measure--the first of its kind--prohibiting any judge or court from making decisions based on the teachings of the Koran. It won in a 70-30 landslide, then was immediately bogged down in court on First Amendment grounds. So it was left up to Kern, who represents the western part of Oklahoma City in the House of Representatives, to introduce new legislation which can ban sharia without tripping on the First Amendment. Last week her bill, HR 1552, made its way to the Senate. It bans ""any law, rule, legal code or system"" not rooted in the Constitution of Oklahoma or the United States. Kern, a former history teacher, says she has no problem whatsoever with Muslims moving to Oklahoma and that the bill would protect them, too. ""When I see things that are happening that I think will weaken our American way of life, I don't like that,"" she says. ""I don't have a problem with people coming over here--why wouldn't people want to come to America, the greatest nation in the world where you have the most opportunities and freedoms? Why wouldn't they want to come over here? But if they're going to come over here, let them become Americans. If they want to hold on to their own cultures, then why--and I hope I don't get in trouble here--why not live in their own countries?"" Kern could be speaking for a million Oklahoma voters, or she could be speaking for Herman Cain, the long-shot presidential candidate who recently told ThinkProgress that he was worried enough about sharia that he would not appoint Muslim judges. She wrote her legislation after consulting with legislators in other states and with the Center for Security Policy, Frank Gaffney's hawkish group that's been leading the charge against ""creeping sharia."" And some of the momentum for her bill comes from the work of Brigitte Gabriel, a Lebanese-born author who condemns ""Islamofascism,"" and whose ACT! For America brought her to this state for three 2010 campaign speeches. But Democrats in Oklahoma respond to this with utter contempt. They were battered in the 2010 elections, left with around one-third of the seats in the House and Senate. The anti-sharia ballot measure, they say, was key to that. Cory Williams is a Democrat who voted against sending the sharia measure to the ballot then survived the election by only 280 votes. He thinks Republicans have found a clever way to exploit the unpopularity of Barack Obama in this state as well as the fear that he finds secluded locations to bow toward Mecca five times a day. To make the point, Williams cues up one of the ads that was run against him last fall. ""What do we really know about Cory Williams?"" whispers a narrator. ""We know that Cory Williams voted to allow radical Muslim terrorists to be tried under sharia law, the law of Islam."" Williams laughs ruefully when the tape is over. ""I'm lucky,"" he says, ""because I grew up in the district, and I have a pretty highly educated constituency. So I was able to explain that, no, I didn't want terrorists to get away with terrorism."" That ad was pure politics, of course. But anti-sharia campaigners say the more realistic threat is the sort of thing that happened in New Jersey in 2010. A Moroccan woman, fed up with abuse from her husband, filed for a restraining order. Judge Joseph Charles denied it because, according to sharia, the husband was acting within his rights. That decision was reversed by a higher court. (""Yeah, amazingly, the courts operate exactly how they're supposed to operate,"" says Williams.) Still, the case gave anti-sharia campaigners in Oklahoma a story to tell. Muneer Awad, the president of Oklahoma's branch of the Council on American-Islamic relations, says the New Jersey case fueled the campaign that defined the election. ""That one judge!"" he says, exasperated. ""I wish I knew that guy. He was totally wrong on the merits, but he gave Brigitte Gabriel and the rest of the people who came here this case to talk about."" Awad came to Oklahoma from Georgia in 2010; he saw the sponsor of the anti-sharia ballot measure on TV, and decided that Oklahoma, with somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 Muslims, was going to be a battleground for civil rights. He works mostly solo in an office inside a yellow geodesic dome. (""Before I took the job, I saw that and said, 'Wow, you guys work out of a mosque?' "") Awad says that even though the Oklahoma law is tied up in court, it has been successful for opponents of sharia law. ""They definitely got the word out there,"" he said. ""Every time you see an anti-foreign, anti-sharia law in another state, they all come back to Oklahoma, because they know voters supported it. And the legal challenge now gives people the framework for how to draft a similar bill and avoid the problems they had in court. It was almost like a test run, and on top of that, a discourse was created--sharia has been defined for many people as this ugly thing. It's associated with marital rape, women's abuse, child abuse--these horrible, distorted things."" Awad's argument is the same as the Democrats' argument: Those horrible things are already illegal, and there's no point codifying that again. David Yerushalmi, an attorney who does some work for the Center for Security Policy, says there is a point. He's drafted model legislation called American Laws for American Courts. At four paragraphs long, it doesn't mention sharia, but it bans judges from using foreign law. Kern's legislation is copied word-for-word from that model, as she acknowledges. (She has edited out a short section about contracts, arguing that the change makes her legislation even less vulnerable to legal challenges.) ""Has  sharia come to America yet?"" asks Yerushalmi. ""Not institutionally. That's why we have a Constitution, thank god. But how many people have to suffer before we have to pass a prophylactic law? I happen to be a guy who's strongly in favor of civil rights, and this is good for civil rights.""* Again: Democrats don't buy it. They just don't see the threat. Al McAffrey, the first openly gay member of the Oklahoma legislature, is not won over at all by the argument that gays have the most to lose from sharia law because in some sharia systems, being gay in punishable by death. The whole exercise, he says, is politics. ""It's good for fundraising,"" says McAffrey. ""I say the words 'Sally Kern' and I can raise a couple of hundred bucks."" If this is so unserious, why are national politicians talking about it? Why is, say, Newt Gingrich telling audiences that Islamic law is coming? ""It's a fear deal,"" shrugs McAffrey. ""Newt Gingrich--I don't even think he knows what day it is. He's just talking."" What does McAffrey say to constituents who do worry about sharia? ""I ask them what made them worry,"" he says. He leans in. ""What made you worry about it? Why are you afraid of it? What are you listening to, that made you afraid of this?"" The Democrats are talking past the Republicans. Kern, for example, is unmoved by the idea that the people who want sharia banned are uneducated. ""That's insulting to 70 percent of the people of Oklahoma,"" she says. It's of a piece with all the criticism she gets for introducing social conservative legislation and getting accused of distracting from the real work Republicans need to do. ""A lot of our citizens understand what Scripture says,"" she says. ""'Unless the Lord build a house, they that labor, labor in vain.' The Scripture teaches that the Lord honor the nation that honors him. I think it boils down to this: If we take care of the morality, God will take care of the economy. I think that's a principle that a lot of people in the great state of Oklahoma live by."" Correction,  April 5, 2011: This article originally misquoted Yerushalmi as saying, ""But wow many people have to suffer before we have to pass a prophylactic law?""

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/deal_makers.html	"Will there be a government shutdown? No, but check back with me at the end of this sentence. Republicans and Democrats are negotiating in earnest, but figuring out whether they are making any progress is hampered by different kinds of complexity: about numbers, about policy, and not insignificantly, about politics. Not only do both sides have to agree on how much to cut and where to cut it, but each side hopes to improve its negotiating position by declaring in public that the other side is being misleading or inflexible. In this sea of uncertainty, let's haul out the scales and see what we know. On one side, we have the many reasons a shutdown is likely. Senate Democrats and House Republicans might not be able to come to an agreement on the size of spending cuts and the so-called policy ""riders"" related to hot-button issues like funding for Planned Parenthood, the EPA, and Obama's health care plan. Or maybe they will reach a deal, and House leaders of both parties will lose enough of their ideologues that there won't be enough votes for the compromise to pass. Or, time could simply run out. The deadline is April 8, but to make good on the House promise to post all bills three days ahead of time, a deal has to be worked out by April 5. On the other side, arguing against a government shutdown, is one big reason: the economy. It's getting better. On Friday the Labor Department announced that 261,000 new jobs were created last month. That's 500,000 in the last three months. Policy makers on both sides believe that shutting down the government could risk the recovery, and no one wants to get stuck with the blame for that. There are plenty of theories in both parties about how they can turn a shutdown to their advantage, but leaders in both parties really don't want to risk it. Is there a logical connection between a shutdown and the health of the economy? You can argue that interest rates are low because the market thinks that, when push comes to shove, Congress and the president will find a way to work toward a balanced budget. When a shutdown proves markets wrong, they will charge an Irretrievably Incompetent Premium (IIP), causing rates to rise. That will increase borrowing costs for business. Whether any of this makes economic sense doesn't matter. The president and House Republicans have been arguing about economic fragility for so long that, as a political matter, the relationship between the economy and a shutdown is a certainty. President Obama cited the fragility of the economy as a reason to extend the Bush tax cuts. The health of the economy will be the single most important factor in the president's re-election. He can't risk a shutdown. That's why Chief of Staff William Daley called Boehner this week to move the deal along. According to one source familiar with the details of the conversation, Daley said the president would support significant cuts but wanted to see the final compromise largely free of policy riders. The president also knows the economy worries Boehner. On the good news about employment, Obama used the opportunity to send a little shot across the bow. ""Given the encouraging news we see today on jobs, it would be the height of irresponsibility to halt our economic momentum because of the same old Washington politics,"" he said in a statement. Republicans have argued for months that the economy is hurt by uncertainty. Shutdowns create uncertainty. If the GOP is blamed for creating uncertainty, it can hardly argue with the premise. Negotiations are at the barroom-and-backroom stage. Lots of people in the barroom yell and accuse each other of bad faith and lack of seriousness. In the backroom, the real work goes on. Leaders from both parties negotiate about the size of the cuts and the riders. They're connected by a seesaw that is driven by what each side can sell to its members. If the riders are watered down or eliminated (as many Democrats want), then Republicans are going to need a bigger total number in cuts to sell to their side. Occasionally the spectators out front pound on the door, and someone from one of the two sides negotiating comes out to please the crowd with partisan talk. Then he returns to the hard business of negotiating. This week has been consumed with a public fight over whether in the backroom a deal was reached over a ""target number"" of spending cuts. Democrats say there was a deal. One reason it is important to insist on this is so that if negotiations break down, they can say Republicans were just too ideologically rigid. Boehner has insisted that no number was cast in stone, and that he and Republican leaders are fighting to wring every spending cut they can out of the negotiations. Boehner would like the cuts to be as large as possible. That's his policy preference, and it'll make his ultimate sales job easier. But since he knows the total cuts won't be as big as some House Republicans would like, he knows they might accuse him of selling out too early, so he must work extra hard to show he's shedding his last ounce of blood to get a deal with spending cuts as large his conservatives want. The fact that negotiations are even taking place helps Democrats with a previous political problem. When the debate over funding government for the rest of the year started, Democrats felt pressure because Republicans had characterized them as unwilling to cut government in the slightest. But now Democrats are now considering substantial cuts in this fiscal year, which means this is no longer an argument about whether to cut but what to cut. Republicans may still win that fight, but it's a harder one, because it devolves into a comparison between actual programs to cut. If there eventually is a deal that Boehner has to sell to his conservative members, he will rely on a variety of arguments. The first is that they're winning. Whatever the deal is, it will be far more in cuts than Democrats originally said they'd go for. Second, he'll argue that Republicans need to show they can govern by meeting their commitments to keep government open. The third is that if they have to go hunting for Democratic votes, that will require making the bill more attractive to Democrats, which will necessarily be less conservative. And Friday Boehner offered a new one: A shutdown will actually cost the government because of broken contracts. Boehner can also argue that Republicans will be able to continue the fight to shrink government next week when they begin debate on federal spending for the coming decade. House budget chairman Paul Ryan is expected to offer a budget Tuesday that should please fiscal conservatives. As Boehner negotiates, he is keeping some important numbers in his head. He can lose 23 members of his caucus before he has to start depending on Democratic votes. Democrats have been pushing the idea all week that the crazy Tea Party members will desert Boehner en masse, which means even if he can agree to a deal, it won't pass the House. As my colleague Dave Weigel reports, the caricature doesn't fit. One senior House aide said that it's possible there will be enough in the compromise so that Boehner can make the sale to his caucus without needing Democratic votes. (This would be the equivalent of an inside straight in poker.) If he does need Democrats, there are 29 fiscally conservative Blue Dogs who might be available. If he gets all of them, he can lose 52 members of his caucus. He lost 54 the last time he asked his members to temporarily fund the government. Some of those conservative members might get back onboard now that the stakes are higher. On the other hand, as one veteran Republican vote-counter pointed out, they've all been home since that vote and been heralded as heroes for sticking to their principles. In the end, Boehner will have to rely on the president and Democratic leaders to persuade their members to join in. The speaker is also keeping some other things in mind. He doesn't want to fail on his first big test as speaker. A shutdown would be a failure. He also doesn't want to be seen as a captive of the Tea Party-backed members of his caucus. This would make him look weak. Also, the Tea Party is unpopular, as a CNN poll out this week pointed out. Late Friday afternoon, Senate Democrats were continuing the barroom portion of the theater, accusing Republicans of being fixed on ""these ridiculous riders,"" as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid put it. Still, he said, progress was being made but more slowly than he'd like. There is a possibility that if the deal isn't reached until later next week, the House three-day deadline might require the government to shut down for the weekend. Or, a temporary funding resolution might come up that funds the government for a couple of days. If a government shutdown is averted, it will be the third time the fears about a crisis will have been unfounded. The reason will have been the same all along. Despite all of the talk and threats of a government closure, both sides have always known that a shutdown would be disastrous for everyone.Become a fan of  John Dickerson on Facebook."	Government shutdown: An improving economy makes it less likely than ever.
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/shutdown_syndrome.html	"At 10:51 a.m. on Thursday, the speaker of the House took questions from reporters about the tick-tick-tick toward a possible government shutdown. ""Democrats are rooting for a government shutdown,"" said John Boehner. ""Our goal is to cut government spending, not shut down the government. ... We're going to continue to fight for the largest spending cuts we can get to keep the government open and fund it for the rest of this fiscal year."" Boehner reminded the press that Republicans had passed their own package that cut $61 billion over the fiscal year. An hour or so later, a couple of blocks away, about 200 Tea Party activists trod over damp grass to hear their leaders respond to Boehner. There was at least one reporter for every three or four activists. They were there to hear conservatives rip into Republicans for statements like the one Boehner had just made. ""I think there are more press than Tea Party Patriots here,"" joked freshman Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., in an aside to one of the organizers. Jenny Beth Martin, the national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, kicked off the rally as Republican members of Congress lined up to give their speeches. She didn't contradict Boehner at all. ""They're blatantly saying that if we go to a government shutdown, it's the Tea Party's fault,"" said Martin. ""Guys, if there's a government shutdown, it's the Congress's fault! They haven't passed a budget since 2009!"" This is not what Democrats want to hear from the Tea Party. Their strategy has exactly two parts. Part one: Accuse Republicans of forcing the shutdown by conceding everything to the radical, extreme, Nina Totenberg-hating Tea Party movement. Part two: Cave in and offer the Republicans more budget cuts if they promise not to shut down the government. So far, the second part of the strategy has gone gangbusters. On March 1, the House passed a short-term continuing resolution that funded the government for two weeks and reduced spending by $4 billion. A week later, Vice President Joe Biden came to the Senate and a deal emerged: Democrats proposed their own long-term CR, with only $6 billion of cuts. That failed. On March 15, another CR passed, funding the government for three weeks and cutting $6 billion more. Since then, Republicans have warned that they won't back anything less than their $61 billion package. So over the weekend, with Biden taking a PR lead role, Democrats announced that they could cut $33 billion and be happy. ""I think it means they're losing, at least, the rhetorical battle,"" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., after addressing the Tea Party rally and starting the walk back to the Senate. ""I think they've lost public opinion on it. If you polled Democrats, and you asked them if we need to cut spending, I think a majority of Democrats now believe that. So they're reading the tea leaves, so to speak, and I think they're coming around."" The Tea Party's role in this has been wily. While Jenny Beth Martin was echoing the GOP's message, her co-leader, Mark Meckler, was telling the Associated Press that Boehner would ""face a primary"" if he compromised. Most of the speakers at the Thursday rally avoided that talk. When Rep. Mike Pence went there--carefully preceding the shutdown talk by blaming it on Democrats--it did get applause. ""If liberals in the Senate would rather play political games, and shut down the government instead of making a small down payment on fiscal discipline and reform,"" said Pence, ""I say shut it down."" ""Cut it or shut it!"" yelled some protesters near the front of the stage. ""Cut it or shut it!"" But  Martin was one of several Thursday rally speakers who reminded the crowd that Howard Dean had said he'd be ""rooting for"" a shutdown if he was still DNC chairman, and that Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had been encouraging Democrats to call every GOP cut ""extreme.""* The idea that the Democrats were playing the Tea Party activists was so offensive to them--the Schumer quote was already legend, repeated without prompting by several protesters I spoke to--that it kept them on the reservation. ""I keep hearing that the Tea Party is going to rebel against the Republicans,"" said Ron Kirby, a retired electrical engineer from Alexandria, Va., who held an American flag in one hand and a Gadsden flag in the other. ""Whatever it is they get, I'll support them."" That was a common sentiment, even if it hasn't been tested yet. John Lonsiak, a Fredericksburg, Va. activist, put the potential blame for a shutdown on the Democrats but basically agreed with Kirby about the risks. ""The government is so big, and has so much inertia,"" he said. ""Nobody's going to die in the street. Nobody's going to starve to death. Nobody's going to miss a mortgage payment that isn't missing it already. The stock market's not going to crash. We must just be a little bit hungrier."" These are the opinions of people who don't think the government should do so much. They're not the intended audience for Democrats. But they hint at the strangeness of the Democrats' focus on the Tea Party over the specifics of the CRs and the risks of a shutdown. If the plan is to trap Republicans and slowly to build momentum against a shutdown as the government stays stalled, that's a pretty big roll of the dice, and it depends on the GOP and its allies playing looser than they have so far. In 1995, one of the turning points that helped Bill Clinton ""win"" the shutdown was a Christian Science Monitor breakfast at which Newt Gingrich suggested that the president should have come back and talked things over when the two of them were on Air Force One. That story was the source of the New York Daily News' ""Cry Baby"" cover cartoon of Gingrich. That's the sort of mistake that Democrats need to count on. So far, neither Republicans nor members of the Tea Party are making it. Correction,  April 4, 2011: This article originally misidentified Chuck Schumer as a Republican. ( Return to the correction.)"

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/left_right_and_soros.html	"The Cato Institute opened its doors to George Soros on Thursday, and he came in peace. The 35th wealthiest man in the world arrived at the libertarian think tank, evaded a question about Donald Trump from a video-camera-wielding reporter, and relaxed in a back room as a crowd gathered for his speech. It wouldn't just be his speech. Soros was one of three panelists speaking about a new edition of  The Constitution of Liberty, the most enduring book by the libertarian economist Freidrich von Hayek. The editor of the new edition, Ronald Hamowy, was tasked with introducing the experts, moderating questions, and keeping the whole thing from becoming a circus. He eyed the audience warily, hopefully. The worry was that someone would show up at the panel and decide to confront George Soros, philosophical dabbler, with George Soros, the nightmare figure who shows up on Fox News prime time the way Emmanuel Goldstein showed up at the Two Minutes Hate. Soros, who made his billions in international finance, has funded many of the new institutions of the professional left since George W. Bush started seeking re-election.  He seeded ACT, a get-out-the-vote project that didn't quite work in 2004, and then he helped fund the Center for American Progress ($3 million) and Media Matters for America ($1 million, only last year). Entering politics, he became a political target. He's the sort of billionaire whose website has to include a FAQ about where he was when the Nazis invaded Eastern Europe, because someone who Googles his name and ""collaborator"" gets a lot of false results. That problem might have reached its natural conclusion. As Soros walked into the Hayek Auditorium, his spokesman Michael Vachon told a couple of reporters that the man really wasn't paying attention to American electoral politics. ""The truth is, he's not really thinking about that right now,"" said Vachon. ""He's doing a lot of work in New Guinea, and on transparency. The election's a long ways away."" Soros' speech and comments reinforced that view. He stuck to his topic--the debate in the 1940s between Hayek and Karl Popper, the philosopher Soros cites the most (his Open Society Institute is named for Popper's work). Popper argued that ""the incontrovertible truth is beyond the reach of the human intellect."" ""While I was admiring the elegance of Popper's theory, I was also studying elementary economics,"" said Soros. ""I was struck by a contradiction between the theory of perfect competition, which postulated perfect knowledge, with Popper's theory, which asserted that perfect knowledge was unattainable. The contradiction could be resolved by recognizing that economic theory cannot meet the standards of Newtonian physics. That is why I sided with Hayek, who warned against the slavish imitation of natural science and took issue with Popper, who asserted the doctrine of unity of method."" Soros was wistful. The debate between Hayek and Popper had been enlightening. The current debate, the one in the media, was anything but. ""The political controversy on the role of the state in the economy is raging in full force today,"" said Soros, ""but the standards of political discourse have greatly deteriorated since then."" The two opposing sides in politics ""have each got hold of one half of the truth."" ""Although I am often painted as the representative of the far left and I am certainly not free of political bias,"" said Soros, ""I readily recognize that the other side is half right in claiming that the government is wasteful and inefficient and ought to function better. But I also continue to cling to the other half of the truth, namely that financial markets are inherently unstable and need to be regulated. Moreover, I am profoundly worried that those who proclaim half truths as the whole truth, whether they are from the left or the right, are endangering our open society."" Soros said all of this to an audience whose chairs were marked with plaques, thanking some donor or another who'd helped build the auditorium. Among the names on the plaques were ""Charles Koch."" The left that Soros didn't quite want to be lumped in with has become obsessed with the Kochs, and with conservative and libertarian donors in general, and as Soros was speaking, some liberal donors were putting the finishing touches on Priorities USA and Priorities USA Action, which aim to raise $100 million to play in the 2012 election. There is an outright panic among some liberals about conservative money, and a sense that Their billionaires are more loyal than Our billionaires. At Cato, as the questions started coming, it got harder to imagine Soros getting involved again at that level. Richard Epstein, a University of Chicago professor who shared the stage, ended his remarks by criticizing the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, and challenging Soros to live up to his talk about government waste and abuse. ""I want you, George, to come out on the record now to say that you're in favor of the repeal of the National Labor Relations Act,"" said Epstein. ""Then we'll have something we can talk about!"" Soros didn't answer that, but he did criticize Dodd-Frank. ""I look at the way the Dodd-Frank bill, and its failure to address the issues, how it was lobbied into incomprehension and inconsistency by special interests of various kinds,"" he said. Hamowy mostly prevented the audience from taking the conversation from Hayek to politics. A question about the Affordable Care Act slipped in anyway. Soros didn't love the new law. ""The pharmaceutical companies made a fabulous deal,"" he said, ""when they voted off any reduction in further costs for medicines, and then the insurance companies destroyed the core of the reform, which would have provided a public option."" The speeches ended, and Soros eluded more questions about politics. One reporter tried to ask him about the Koch brothers; Vachon quickly assured Soros that he didn't really know them, and that the question needn't be answered. He did take a question about Hayek. Was his dream of a high-minded political/economic discussion possible? ""Stop proving your point by proving the other side wrong,"" he said. ""Once you recognize that principle, you have a reasonable base for discussion. Get to some new basis for discussion instead of effectively tearing the country apart, which is what right now the political parties are doing."" But how did that happen? One reason for the renewed interest in Hayek, after all, is the newfound interest in  The Road to Serfdom, his best-selling but least serious work. Glenn Beck's viewers haven't read much about Hayek's rejection of conservatism or even his economic theories. They've read about how any and all social welfare leads inexorably toward fascism.

Hours after the president released his long-form birth certificate--years after releasing the short-form one that proved he was a citizen--the issue had already evolved. Republicans who'd been on the hook demanding proof of his citizenship wondered why it took so long. People with too much time on their hands--in other words, the majority of people surfing the Internet for this kind of stuff--were combing the document for proof of forgery. So Obama did not end birtherism. He did end one era of conspiracy theories about him--the fifth era, by my count. And maybe all he did was make sure the sixth era got started with as loud and embarrassing a bang as possible. If you understand how this started, and who played the biggest roles in elevating it, maybe you can also understand why it's not going to end. Paleobirtherism: 2003-07 In the beginning, there was no controversy whatsoever about Obama's family ties to Kenya. Reporters mentioned them when he became president of the Harvard Law Review. Book reviewers mentioned them when he released  Dreams From My Father in 1996. In late 2003, when Obama jumped into the open race for Illinois' U.S. Senate seat, conspiracy theorists were more focused on his middle and last names than his birthplace. An aide to one Republican candidate launched, then scrapped, a website comparing Obama to Osama Bin Laden. But it wasn't really until Obama's Republican opponent Jack Ryan dropped out of the race and Obama gave the Democrats' 2004 convention keynote that rumors about his past became marketable. On Aug. 10, 2004, perennial political candidate Andy Martin put out a statement claiming that Obama had lied about aspects of his past. (His convention speech made a lot out of his African heritage, something that reads very differently in 2011.) Martin challenged the idea that Obama's father was a ""goat herder,"" called Obama Sr. a ""devoted Muslim,"" and wrote that Obama's ""secret shame at his family history of rape, murder and arson is what actualizes him."" That, for a long time, was the Obama conspiracy theory. The candidate with the Muslim-sounding name and the Muslim father must be a secret Muslim! Chris Hayes traced the rumor's growth over chain emails in 2007, when Obama was struggling against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary. Some of them were based on facts, like a document, turned up in a CNN investigation, from Obama's school in Indonesia. His stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, had registered him as ""Barry Soetoro"" and listed his religion as Muslim. But none of them were about Obama's citizenship. Proto-birtherism: April 2008 to June 11, 2008 In March and April 2008, Clinton regained ground and looked to have some chance of beating Obama for the Democratic nomination. This was the time when some Clinton supporters started glomming on to any rumor that looked dangerous. A chain letter from American missionaries in Kenya did the trick: It claimed that Obama's real middle name was ""Mohammed."" Politifact quickly debunked the rumor, with one caveat. ""We tried to obtain a copy of Obama's birth certificate,"" the reporters wrote, ""but his campaign would not release it and the state of Hawaii does not make such records public."" The first mainstream reporter to pick up on that sentence was National Review's Jim Geraghty. ""Obama could debunk some rumors by releasing his birth certificate,"" he wrote, on June 9, 2008. One of the debunkable rumors was that Obama was born in Kenya--something that would disqualify him for the presidency. ""Rather unlikely,"" wrote Geragthy, ""as it would require everyone in his family to lie about this in every interview and discussion with those outside the family since young Obama appeared on the scene."" On June 12, 2008, the Obama campaign released a certificate of live birth on its website, and to select media outlets. Within minutes, it was accessible to anyone who had become curious about the rumors. Short-form birtherism: June 12, 2008 to March 2009 The release of Obama's COLB did not end birtherism. More accurately, it created it. The one-page document, which had the basics about Obama's birth and the weight of Hawaii's government behind it, inspired a mad rush of would-be forgery analysts and detectives. Two anonymous experts, who used the nom de birthers Techdude and Ron Polarik, published extensive image autopsies that proved, to the gullible, that the Obama campaign was passing on a forgery. ""Techdude delivers a final report that exceeds my wildest expectations,"" blogged Pamela Geller in July 2008. ""It is irrefutable, empirical evidence--Obama's birth certificate is a forgery."" The early birthers were conservatives and Clinton supporters, people with intense interest in denying the presidency to Obama by any means necessary. The Hillary supporters did some of the hardest digging. It was one of them, going by the name TexDarlin, who took up a challenge to find a contemporary birth announcement for Obama in 1961 Honolulu newspapers. In late July 2008, she found two of them. (Her original post announcing this has been deleted.) That wasn't enough to put the fire out. In August, before the Democratic convention, a Philadelphia attorney named Phil Berg, whose most recent high-profile lawsuits had been filed to bring attention to 9/11 conspiracy theorists, filed a lawsuit against Obama. The lawsuit was a bouillabaisse of discredited claims. Berg resurrected that 2007 CNN story about Obama's Indonesian school to argue--without basis--that Obama must have given up his citizenship in the 1960s. Berg got nowhere, but he kept pushing. In October, an Anabaptist bishop named Ron McRae released what he claimed was a recording of a call to Sarah Obama, a Kenya-based relative of the candidate who'd become somewhat famous (the image of a woman in an African village with an ""Obama"" sign was irresistible), in which she admitted she was in the room when Obama was born in Kenya. But that wasn't what was actually on the tape. No matter--it made it into another Berg filing. The lawsuits continued after the 2008 election. They stayed on the fringe. Alan Keyes had run a vanity presidential campaign, and lost, but he'd grown interested in the conspiracy theory. Orly Taitz, a Moldova-born dentist with a law degree from a correspondence course, and Gary Kreep, helped Team Keyes file a lawsuit arguing that his rights as a candidate had been violated by Obama's lack of proof of citizenship. Some of the lawsuits made it to the review process at the Supreme Court, but no further. Radio hosts were starting to talk about this, but no one with real political clout took the birthers seriously. This would change. Birtherism, the Democratic tactic: March 2009 to January 2011 In March 2009, with very little fanfare, Rep. Bill Posey, R-Fla., introduced one of his first pieces of legislation. ""To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require the principal campaign committee of a candidate for election to the office of President to include with the committee's statement of organization a copy of the candidate's birth certificate, together with such other documentation as may be necessary to establish that the candidate meets the qualifications for eligibility to the Office of President under the Constitution."" For the first time, an elected office-holder had indulged the birther theory. Before this point, there was no reason to ask a Republican if he bought into that stuff. Now there was. A dozen Republicans co-sponsored the Posey bill. Fringe-curious reporters (and here I'll raise my hand) and liberal blogs covered it all with amazement. A liberal videographer named Mike Stark tailed Republican members of Congress to get their takes on the story. At the time, Democrats saw an advantage in making Republicans look crazy. On May 26, 2009, for the first time, a birther question made it into the White House press briefing. Les Kinsolving of WorldNetDaily, the conservative site that promoted or investigated birther theories on an hourly basis, was called on by then-press secretary Robert Gibbs. ""In consideration of this very good promise of transparency,"" asked Kinsolving, ""why can't the president respond to the petition to requests of 400,000 American citizens by releasing a certified copy of his long-form birth certificate listing hospital?"" Kinsolving was drowned out by laughter. ""Are you looking for the president's birth certificate?"" asked Gibbs. ""Yes,"" said Kinsolving. ""It's on the Internet, Lester."" Throughout 2009, Kinsolving could be counted on as a sort of escape hatch--call on him, and he'd ask another oddball question. In the summer, Taitz, with her neon hairdo, incomprehensible accent, and ability to convince members of the military to sign up with her, became a sort of celebrity. She even appeared on the Colbert Report to talk up her cases. Absolutely zero new information was introduced--discredited reports about Obama just kept on circulating. But Democrats saw it all as a way to discredit the right. In January 2010, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee encouraged the party's candidates to get their Republican opponents on the record on some fringe issues. Among them: ""Do you believe that Barack Obama is a U.S. citizen?"" ""We have a finite window when [Republican] candidates will feel susceptible to the extremists in their party,"" wrote DSCC chairman Bob Menendez. There was plenty of video of Republican candidates going birther-curious all through 2010. Occasionally, stumbling over the birther question would cost a Republican a newspaper endorsement. It was always good for a segment on cable news. But 2010 was a bad year for Democrats. Very few of the Republicans nailed by this actually lost. Birtherism, the Republican tactic: January 2011 to April 27, 2011 Republicans  won big in 2010, and they won especially large landslides in some red and blue states. * In 2010, ""birther bills"" were distractions, doomed from the outset. In 2011, there were legislatures with big Republican majorities ready to pass them. Birtherism stopped being a joke. All of a sudden, the Republicans who believed in it were on cable TV, talking about the need to find out where Obama was born. But there were also Republicans who wanted this to go away, and they won out. Arizona passed a birther bill and sent it to Gov. Jan Brewer's desk. She vetoed it and said the obsession over the issue was leading America down a ""path of destruction."" At the same time, Donald Trump had hitched his presidential campaign to the birther ""issue."" It was not hurting him; he had gone from nowhere to the front of the tentative Republican field. This was the first Era of Birtherism in which Obama's staff had to field regular questions about an issue they knew was baseless. And this was why it came to an end today. The next era of Obama conspiracies starts with the president in a much more exposed position. Now, conspiracy theorists know that all kinds of people will listen to them if they toss an idea out there--even if the idea is proved to be baseless. Now, Democrats are on the lookout for the next big fantasy, and Republicans think they've found an Obama weakness. Why, after all, would he climb down to the gutter and duel with Donald Trump if the issue wasn't hurting him? What else is bubbling up on the Internet? What else can get under his skin?

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/four_dollarsa_gallon_and_rising.html	"Speaker of the House John Boehner made a prediction Monday about Barack Obama's re-election bid. ""If gas prices are $5 or $6, he certainly isn't going to win,""said Boehner in an interview on ABC News. It might be the least disputable thing a politician has ever said. Well, yes: If people have to keep paying more and more to fill their cars up, the president could lose re-election--even to one of the current batch of Republicans. There's evidence, circumstantial but graphically compelling, that the president's current poll numbers are a function of the price of gas. So: What can the president do about it? The standard answer is, ""Not much."" The political answer is, ""Glom on to a policy that my party and/or industry wants him to support."" The actual answer is somewhere between these two. There is no shortage of ideas. The issue will be which party or politician is skillful enough at using the politics of the moment--and oil companies will report their new, sure-to-be-massive profits over the coming days--to put any of these ideas into practice. Here's the bad news. In times of great panic over gas prices, Republicans and Democrats--and, more subtly, paid-for experts--resurrect some of their favorite energy plans. Democrats want to end tax subsidies for oil companies, and they've gotten a lift from Boehner's ad hoc agreement with them in that ABC News interview. Republicans--again, led by Boehner--say that Obama isn't taking ""all of the above"" energy plans seriously. (""All of the above"" is a way to mention unpopular energy policies without actually mentioning them.) ""I think the fact that he won't allow exploration in the Gulf, doesn't allow exploration in the inter-mountain west, won't allow us to drill in Alaska, this is not helping the situation,"" said Boehner. ""And then when you look at what the EPA is doing in terms of the number of rules and regulations comin' down the pike, those were his responsibility."" It would be awfully convenient if new drilling licenses in the Gulf and relaxed EPA regulations could drive the price of oil down. They wouldn't. ""If someone tries to dupe you into thinking we don't have enough refining capacity, that's bullshit,"" says Tom Kloza, the co-founder and chief oil analyst of the Oil Price Information Service. ""It's a good soundbite, but if anything, companies have probably added too much capacity, and if they add more they have to focus on managing margins."" It's a good enough soundbite that a lot of Republicans use it to argue that the White House's dithering on Gulf Coast drilling, in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, is responsible for rising prices. Oil companies, in this telling, are stuck in a sort of ""permitorium."" But the Deepwater disaster didn't have much of an effect on prices. When the rig blew on April 20, 2010, crude was trading around $84 per barrel. When the well was capped on July 15 the price had fallen to $76. A barrel of brent crude oil costs roughly $50 more today than it did back then. We have some idea why. The critical factor has been the unrest in the Middle East. According to industry analysts, prices have gone up because of worries both about what's already happening and what could happen. The civil war in Libya, a country that usually produces 1.6 million barrels of light, sweet crude every day, has added something like $20 to the price of a barrel of oil--a combination of decreased availability and speculative panic. Worries about what could happen in other OPEC nations are driving the price even higher. ""At any moment, people wonder if you'll see firebombs in the streets of Riyadh,"" says Kloza. ""The Saudis have to cut more checks so people don't demonstrate against them. That's not something they're used to budgeting for."" This is where we get to the roles the president and Congress could play in controlling gas prices. The ""Arab Spring"" is blooming (and burning) mostly out of our control. The major role the United States is playing is as the military linchpin of the Libya intervention. It's an unpredictable, unhappy situation, but no one factor has more bearing on the price of oil. (We can count this as one of the few things Donald Trump is right about.) So what else can we control? We got a hint of it last week, when Standard & Poor's announced that it had changed its outlook for the United States to ""negative"" because our politicians didn't look likely to reach a conclusion on the debt. The price of oil dropped, albeit only briefly. Why? Because the prospect of an economic contraction meant less demand. ""If there were some kind of a grand budget deal that were to cut spending substantially, that could be viewed as somewhat contractionary in terms of fiscal policy,"" says Bruce Bullock, who directs the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University's business school. ""That could slow growth down."" According to Bullock, American policymakers could drive prices down if they were willing to settle for less growth. It was less growth, after all, that was largely responsible for the falling gas prices of 2009. No one's calling for an increase in interest rates, but that could also drive down the international price of oil. None of this would be particularly easy for American politicians. Is there anything they could do? Why, yes. The president--or members of Congress!--could skip the coming, predictable assault on oil company subsidies, and take on speculators instead. Wars and economic distress are not new to the oil market. But the market for oil futures has never been as big as it is now. It's basically quadrupled since the start of the financial crisis, as investors and funds have sought out safe, reliable commodities to invest in. That's the political opening. The only question is whether anyone's actually able to go through it. Theoretically, the president of the United States could talk about this aspect of the gas price problem and elevate it. Unfortunately, the president is Barack Obama, whose every economic move is labeled ""socialism"" by the opposition, and who has already alienated some of the hedge fund managers in the center of this. A move against the commodities trade from Obama would be less Nixon goes to China than Johnson goes to Vietnam. But this is the plan Kloza is recommending to Obama, free of charge. ""He will piss off Wall Street, no question,"" says the oil price analyst. ""He will piss off Morgan Stanley. He will piss off Goldman Sachs. He will alienate people, but people will know he's ready to spank the speculators."""	Rising gas prices: Can Obama do anything about them?
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/no_joke.html	"""Now with all this wind, at least you know it's my real hair,"" said Donald Trump, standing before the sun-washed masses of Boca Raton, Fla., at his first truly public appearance last weekend as a (possible!) 2012 presidential candidate. The crowd laughed heartily. Everyone was in on the joke. So is it a joke, then? The media certainly seem to think so. At some dark and cluttered desk, an underpaid J-school grad is already trying to come up with the perfect morning-after pun if Trump runs. Somebody is gonna get ""Trumped"" and/or ""Fired,"" in a 56-point font and with an exclamation point. The joke could be on the media, though. Far from being a ""joke"" candidate, Trump has a kind of purity. His presidential campaign would reduce U.S. politics to its barest essence. Like the maybe-candidate, polls ""tell it straight,"" as many rally-goers said of Trump last Saturday in Florida. The polls like Trump. He makes things happen. He's a slasher--real estate mogul/author/ diviner/TV star/winemaker/ health guru/clothing designer/ WrestleMania aficionado. He's ""the living, walking personification of the Gospel of Success."" He's also ""brazen"" and ""shows no regard for political niceties."" Basically, he's serious about kicking ass and taking names. The first piece of evidence in the Case Against the Seriousness of Trump is his obsession with the birther issue. Chris Matthews filled three bathtubs up with spittle Thursday on Trump, his supporters, and the birther issue. On CNN, Ali Velshi gave Trump a stern lecture on birthers. But in using the birther issue as a talking point to warm up the crowd, Trump is just following standard operating procedure for a politician. Trump is taking the fancy ride of any ""serious candidate,"" stripping it down to the frame, painting some flames on the side, and revving up the crowd. Consider that, nine years ago, another candidate's cold open to his base was a very serious, measured speech in which he came out against the Iraq war. It worked in firing up the rabid, anti-war, Republican haters. The serious candidate used it throughout his presidential campaign. Now Obama is president, but we're still in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we've started a ""kinetic military action"" (don't call it a war!) in Libya. The other broad accusation against Trump is that he could be using his maybe-candidacy for personal gain. That's a funny joke, because it's exactly what other candidates do, especially when they've finally decided to run. A campaign is a solo gig, and it's always about the candidate: ""Nixon's the One,"" ""[I'm] Putting People First,"" ""It's Morning Again in America [Because as Leader of the Most Powerful Country in the World, I Instructed God to Turn on the Lights]."" Obama's 2008 slogan, ""Change We Can Believe In [Because I'm Bringing It],"" ain't got nothin' on Trump, who offers something shorter, more honest, and more universal: ""Me."" That's what the birther issue has been about. Does it say something about how many stupid racists there are out there? Yes. And it doesn't necessarily speak well of Trump that he confuses appealing to them directly with speaking to them honestly. But it also speaks to a consummate businessman's ability to sell his case to the first group that matters by putting his customer at ease with a joke and a smile. Trump doesn't just say his opponent ""will almost certainly go down as the worst president in history."" He says: Not only is Obama not good enough to compete against me, but maybe he shouldn't even be allowed to compete against me. I'm that awesome. He's sold to the base, then rather abruptly has said it's time to put the issue aside. He's moving on to pitch more-serious people, people whose sense of humor is a bit stale. Trump is a real estate mogul, so this isn't flip-flopping. It's more like house flipping. It won't be easy, though. His new marks include some valuable  parcels of conservative real estate: Ralph Reed, Chris Chocola, Charles Krauthammer, etc. And even if he didn't get too far with those one-liners, a good salesman knows always to leave his advertisement pen. It's a tough sell, even for Trump, but he has Krauthammer's unreserved blessing. (J/ k!) Trump has to sell the conservative movement on two things: that he has the kind of pugnacious pizzazz that can beat Obama, and that he shares some of its core values. Still, when one of your top potential rivals needs a video produced by a graduate of the Michael Bay film school, another is writing love letters to Obama, and yet another is named Jack Daniels or something, that first question is already in the bag. As for Trump's stance on actual, you know, policies? While he might have fawned over Canadian hospitals, at least he never sought Joseph Smith's advice before pushing TrumpCare. What about taxes, though? National defense? Abortion? Bailouts? Don't worry, this is about Trump--and like the Republicans, he is serious about winning. And right now, he's got the biggest bargaining chip: his standing in the polls. Trump ""reflects the id of a certain segment of populist opinion,"" according to the National Review's Rich Lowry. Yeah, it's a segment otherwise known as Republicans. The small-government party is supposed to be all about ""me."" It's pro-business, so let's make a deal. Bush may have abandoned the party's philosophy, but Trump won't. He knows it's all about ""me."" He'll attract independents for that reason, too. Candidate Obama was more serious about ""change"" than President Obama. Trump will always be serious about ""me."" His loyalty may be to the highest bidder, but at least he won't sell out. Next week Trump is scheduled to speak to several women's groups in Nevada. The speech is open to the public, so if his previous engagement is any indication, expect a packed house. People love him because he'll say ""anything that fed-up people are thinking."" His appearance last weekend in Florida proved that. ""Our current president ...,"" said Trump in Boca Raton, pausing as the crowd booed-cheered. ""You all want me to say, 'You're Fired,' "" continued Trump. ""We got a long way to go before I start using that. It's too early, and, to be honest, it's too trivial."" Like the expert salesman he is, he paused a beat. ""But I have it in the back of my mind.""The crowd went wild."	Donald Trump for president? The case for taking his campaign more seriously.
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/americas_next_top_libertarian.html	"Seventeen years and six months ago, Gary Johnson announced that he was running for governor of New Mexico. His leadership experience? He'd only ever run his Albuquerque construction business; he'd never run for office before. He looked, in other words, like the sort of candidate who runs for office on a lark, gets pulverized, and goes back to building ranch houses. ""I sized him up as a total neophyte and somebody who had no chance,"" remembers John Dendahl, who got into the Republican primary later and had much more government experience than Johnson. ""I think it would be fair to say he didn't exhibit a great deal of knowledge of how politics worked. But he spent a lot of money. He bought a lot of ads on the sides of buses in Albuquerque, and he acquitted himself very well in the debates."" Dendahl remembers one particular example of Johnson's approach to political blood sport. ""At one of the debates,"" says Dendahl, ""the candidates got asked how we'd deal with the Democrats in the legislature. New Mexico is basically two-to-one Democratic, you see. Johnson got that question and said he'd veto them. Now, most of us laughed at that. We didn't have enough Republicans to sustain the vetoes!""The joke was on them--twice. Johnson won, and Republicans won enough seats to sustain his vetoes. And he vetoed everything. In eight years in office, he vetoed 750 bills. In his second term, he came out for legalizing and regulating marijuana. He was the most libertarian governor in America, no contest. He was the Tea Party more than a decade before the idea occurred to Rick Santelli.On Thursday, on the steps of New Hampshire's state capitol, Gary Johnson will announce that he's running for president. It's a pretty safe bet that you're not aware of this. Only 14 percent of Republicans have the faintest idea of who he is. Half of them don't like him. The original Tea Party candidate starts his presidential campaign pretty close to zero. Why would a former governor with an impeccable small-government record get next to no attention? Two words: Ron Paul.When Johnson first emerged as a potential candidate in December, he was billed as the ""next Ron Paul."" In the first article about Johnson's 501(c)(4), Our America, Politico's Jonathan Martin speculated that ""Johnson may better positioned to ride the populist wave than the longtime Texas GOP congressman,"" because anger against the political establishment had metastasized since 2008, and Johnson is ""telegenic, is media savvy and, equally important, has twice been easily elected to statewide office."" All true. Before Ron Paul ran for president in 2007, Johnson was the Great Libertarian Hope. His come-to-Jesus moment on marijuana made him a national figure. Libertarians in the GOP hoped he'd run for their nomination; the Libertarian Party hoped he'd bolt and join their team. But Johnson was dismissive, ruling out a future in politics. ""I have effectively pulled the pin on my political career with my stance on drugs,"" he said in a 2001 interview with Reason magazine. After he left the governor's mansion, he used the substantial earnings from the sale of his company to travel the world, climb Mount Everest, and ski. When I interviewed Johnson in 2007 (as a reporter for Reason), he asked to be described as a ""businessman-slash-adventurer."" So the Great Libertarian Hope job went to the only applicant: Ron Paul. He was imperfect. The more cosmopolitan members of the movement frowned on Paul's abortion stance (life begins at conception), his immigration stance (he ran spine-tingling commercials about Mexicans climbing over the border), and his views on international trade. But Paul tapped into an anti-war, anti-state, pro-gold sentiment that few people knew existed. He raised $35 million. He came fourth in the delegate hunt. Johnson studied the Ron Paul campaign. He hired Paul's finance director, Jonathan Bydlak. He ran third in CPAC's straw poll because some Paul supporters made him their first choice, to prop him up. In an interview earlier this year, conducted outside a restaurant in Arlington, Va.--Johnson thought we could save money if we didn't grab a table--he explained that he wanted to expand the GOP's base and do what Paul couldn't quite do last time. ""I just would point out also that he ended up getting 9 percent of the vote, and I'm trying to be astute as to why that was the case,"" said Johnson. ""I mean, why wasn't that a higher number? Because the idea would be--speaking hypothetically--the idea would be to win. And he didn't win. So I try to understand that as well as I possibly can."" The problem is that Paul still wants to run for president. At last check, his advisers said he was 60/40 on a new presidential run. He's RSVP'd to the first Republican primary debate, scheduled for May 5 in South Carolina. He has already raised millions of dollars. The last report for Johnson's PAC, Our America, reported only $205,000 raised, and most of it spent, in the last quarter of 2010. Maybe the problem is best explained with an analogy. In Braveheart, Mel Gibson's subtly fictionalized account of the 14th-century fight for Scottish independence, William Wallace leads a rebellion. Robert the Bruce, the King of the Scots, hangs back and watches. Wallace dies. Robert gets the courage to take his place. In the 2011 Republican version of the story, the original rebel leader never fell, and decides he wants one more go at it. Johnson, understandably, does not like talking about what effect Paul will have on his campaign. ""It's not a zero-sum game,"" he said to me in Arlington. ""It can't be a zero-sum game. Nine percent of voters don't just turn to Johnson and Paul--we have to get more than that."" But how? Johnson will need some hook, some crucial showdown, ideally on a debate stage. That's what happened to Paul. At the second Republican debate of 2007, Paul calmly explained the ""blowback"" theory of foreign policy, and then-frontrunner Rudy Giuliani--who would win far fewer votes than Paul--demanded that he ""apologize"" for blaming America for 9/11. ""Did Ron Paul get any coverage before Rudy attacked him?"" asks David Boaz, the vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Before that, Ron was a member of Congress running to get on national television and talk about his issues. It was Rudy attacking him that made him an Internet and cable star."" Theoretically, there is nothing preventing Johnson from having a Rudy Moment. I've interviewed Johnson three times about his campaign. He doesn't seem to know how to evade questions, or that this is typically what you're supposed to do with questions. Gay marriage? ""I support gay unions,"" he says. ""I don't think the government should be involved in marriage."" Should states and cities be allowed to declare bankruptcy? ""I've been talking about that now for a couple months. I think that's a great idea that Congress ought to let them do."" Should marijuana be legalized? That's an easy question--Johnson came out for marijuana legalization during his second term in the governor's office. ""Control it. Legalize it. Tax it. When it comes to all the other drugs, treat drug use as a health issue, not a crime issue."" Again, theoretically, there is a path to Republican success in there. Johnson, unlike every other potential Republican candidate, believes that abortion should be legal ""until the viability of the fetus."" How many Republicans believe that? According to the exit poll of the 2008 New Hampshire primary, 52 percent of Republican voters (independents and Republicans) said abortion should be ""always"" or ""mostly"" legal. Johnson isn't much of a churchgoer--22 percent of New Hampshire GOP voters said they ""never"" went to church. Thirty-eight percent of them favored civil unions. Twenty-eight percent favored a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. And so on. There is a constituency here for someone.Johnson's struggle will be informing that constituency that he is someone--he exists, he's viable, and would better serve them than Ron Paul. When I saw Johnson in Arlington, he spoke to a fairly crowded room full of young Republicans. He was introduced, glowingly, by Amit Singh, who'd run a Ron Paul-inspired campaign for Congress in 2008 and had switched candidates. Johnson took questions for a half hour. The Second Amendment?

The year was 1999. Pets.com stock was trading at $11 per share. Nobody was all that interested in Bill Clinton's birth certificate. More important, the Republican Party's nomination looked ungettable, sure to be captured by George W. Bush. So Trump left the party. ""I really believe the Republicans are just too crazy, right?"" he told Tim Russert on Meet the Press. ""I mean, just what's going on is just nuts."" For a few months, Trump hashed out a policy agenda.  It wasn't much, but it was enough to fill a quickie book: The America We Deserve, published in January 2000.  The Trump of 11 years ago sounds a lot like the Trump who has taken over cable TV and the Drudge Report top banner these past few weeks: He's against immigration amnesty. He's worried about terrorism. He's rending his hair over America's economic decline. Oh, and there were a few other things. * ""We must have universal healthcare,"" wrote Trump. ""I'm a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one. We should not hear so many stories of families ruined by healthcare expenses."" The goal of health care reform, wrote Trump, should be a system that looks a lot like Canada. ""Doctors might be paid less than they are now, as is the case in Canada, but they would be able to treat more patients because of the reduction in their paperwork,"" he writes."

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/dancing_on_the_ceiling.html	"Washington's latest guns-a-blazin' battle is over whether Congress will raise the debt limit. Five months ago, there was no disagreement: Congress would raise the debt ceiling. The journey from there to here is a case study of how conservatives decide what Washington debates--and, maybe, how Democrats have learned to play along. In December, Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. It would have been possible for them to raise the debt limit then, months before the Treasury Department says the federal government will hit its $14.3 trillion debt limit (the latest estimate is that the limit will be reached in May). But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took a pass on the vote. ""I want the Republicans to have some buy-in on the debt,"" he said. ""They're going to have a majority in the House. I think they should have some kind of a buy-in on the debt."" Debt limit votes are, in political terms, somewhere between arsenic and strychnine. Democrats raised the limit in December 2009 by razor-thin margins in the House and Senate, and some of the people who'd voted to raise the limit lost their re-election bids. And in December, only the most wild, untamed Republicans were saying they'd oppose a debt ceiling increase. Republicans were saying, on the record, that they would bring a ""clean"" limit-raising bill to the floor. This changed. Conservatives looked at the debt limit vote as one of three leverage opportunities--Democrats call them ""hostage"" opportunities-- to force votes on the cuts they want. The first opportunity was the continuing resolution for the current year's spending, and GOP priorities like the defunding of the Affordable Care Act were left out of that. The second opportunity would come with Republican Rep. Paul Ryan's budget. And yesterday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor called the debt limit one of ""three bites at the apple."" This is why the Republican game of the moment is ""Make Me a Deal for My Career-Threatening Debt Limit Vote."" Most Republicans are playing; only a few have said there's nothing that could tempt them. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has written that he wants the debt limit vote ""accompanied by a plan for fundamental tax reform, an overhaul of our regulatory structure, a cut to discretionary spending, a balanced-budget amendment, and reforms to save Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."" Other Republicans replace the and with an or. They'll take one of these things. ""I will ask the leadership to use the leverage to get real spending caps across the board,"" Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., told me today. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who's also voting against the continuing resolution, said he wouldn't vote for the increase unless it came with that much-desired cut to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. ""I draw that line on the debt ceiling,"" he said. ""Let's do something important."" Republicans are comfortable making this ask because nobody wants to cast this vote. Last week, Dick Armey's Tea Party group FreedomWorks released a poll on the debt ceiling, conducted across 14 swing states by Republican uber-pollster Frank Luntz. Nothing in there makes the vote look easy. Sixty-nine percent of all voters opposed raising the debt ceiling--conversation over. When asked whether they'd be OK with raising the limit if it was part of a deal that ""includes very significant reductions in spending, reforms the main causes of growing debt, and implements tough restrictions on future spending,"" 54 percent of voters were still against it. The poll went even further than that. Voters were asked whether they supported the Full Faith and Credit Act, a proposal from Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would sidestep the debt limit debate by forcing the government to pay its debts before it paid anything else. Democrats have derided this as the ""pay China first"" bill. When he was asked about it in February, Cantor blew it off: ""I just don't understand how that mechanism is consistent with the notion we are a nation of laws."" In Luntz's poll, voters support the Toomey bill 55 percent to 17 percent. ""When you ask them if they prefer this option, or that option, they say 'Nah, screw that,' "" said FreedomWorks spokesman Adam Brandon. ""The big thing people are looking for is balancing the budget in a 10-year window. But the debt ceiling vote and the budget vote are morphing into one giant beast. If you ran on a Tea Party mantra, it's going to be very tough for you to vote for this without explaining how you balance the budget in 10 years."" There are three likely outcomes. One: America defaults on its debt, and all of the nightmarish things Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is predicting actually happen, with Republicans taking blame. Two: The debt ceiling is raised, with Republicans getting mostly toothless concessions. Three: The debt ceiling is raised without concessions, but with Democrats providing the margin of victory, a critical hit to House Speaker John Boehner's machismo. Nobody wants that first scenario to come true. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., is a freshman who's criticized the White House's budget for not balancing the budget in 10 years. He thinks any attempt to tie the debt vote to structural spending reform is basically nuts. ""If what they [House Republicans] want is for the average American to think that they are literally willing to risk the entire country, our entire reputation, for some narrow function, then they'll do it,"" he said. ""There are other vehicles, other moments in the appropriations process, in the legislative process, to do that. A few disciplined individuals can completely bollix up the Senate. But I should probably stop there."" It's not that Democrats like being in this position, or like that Republicans are in this position. But they talk about the debt vote the way Reid did when he kicked it down the road. Republicans will get a poison pill of their very own. ""This is no longer screwing around,"" said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore. ""This is not talking to Tea Party people in some high school cafeteria. This is international finance."" Blumenauer is one of a few dozen Democrats--so far--who has signed a letter pledging to support a ""clean"" debt limit increase, i.e., upping the limit without making extra promises. He and several other Democrats did not say what things the GOP could attach to the vote that would cause them to oppose it. Republicans still have that leverage--Democrats are more existentially afraid of the consequences of saying no. But the purpose of the Democratic promise, according to Blumenauer, is to ""empower"" Boehner to win without pandering to the base.Republicans could do that by demanding concessions that sound good but don't immediately balance the budget. This is a numbers game. To break cloture, Reid needs to get 60 votes for the debt limit increase--exactly as many votes as it got in the slim 2009 victory. Boehner can afford to lose dozens of Republicans if Democrats--starting with the Democrats who've signed that letter--vote for an increase. So some small number of Republicans may get to take home something that looks like a promise to never, ever let spending get out of control.That can be anything. Some Hill aides have suggested that a spending cap proposed by Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., could be packaged with the vote, giving Republicans the fig leaf they need. That's not perfect.  One GOP aide jokingly referred to it as the ""Re-Elect McCaskill Act,"" and one pointed out that it wouldn't go into effect for 10 years (the cap would actually go into effect in 2013), * making it the latest in a storied line of toothless spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules. But that might be a better deal than a commitment to a Balanced Budget Amendment. Not only can't that pass the Senate; it would make Paul Ryan's budget unconstitutional. Democrats figure that Republicans, at some point, will declare victory and go home. ""If it gets down to it,"" suggested Blumenauer, ""I think there's a majority in the House and Senate that would [vote to] avoid the train wreck."" Video: Obama Aims To Lower Deficit by $4 Trillion .

The Tea Party was going to shut down the government. Republicans, bossed around by their Tea Party members, were never going to cut a deal and keep the government running. To hear the president's party talk, the Tea Party was out of control, hell-bent on destruction, a Gary Oldman villain in a mid-1990s action flick. So how come the shutdown didn't happen? Because the Tea Party got strategic. In the deal hammered out late last week, Republicans got an estimated $38.5 billion in spending cuts for the rest of the 2011 fiscal year. That wasn't what they had wanted--it was at least $22 billion short. In that way, it was a minor cave-in, and a minor defeat. But in another, more important way, it was a win. The speaker of the House deftly used Tea Party pressure to extract concessions from the White House that Democrats had promised not to give. What does the Tea Party get from a budget deal that's smaller than it wanted? After all, only 28 Republicans voted against the short-term deal that would fund the government until there could be a long-term bill, and only 15 of them were freshmen. They must know something. What they know: There will be two more chances to battle Democrats on the size of government and the bill for funding it. Getting this far means that they start halfway down the field in one month, when there will be a vote to raise the debt ceiling. Liberals like Paul Krugman have figured this out.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/the_follower.html	"Leadership in politics is more often discussed than demonstrated. In the current budget debate, which has and will touch on every hot-button issue from entitlements to taxes, an underlying debate between the parties has centered around which lawmakers are ""showing leadership"" and which are simply trying to take credit for it. Republicans claim President Obama has not been a leader. But what they see as a deficiency in leadership may simply be a disagreement over strategy in which the president actually displays many of the same qualities Republican leaders once praised. ""Bold, dynamic followership,"" reads the subject line of an email Monday from House Speaker John Boehner's office criticizing the president. Obama had a chance to define a plan for deficit reduction and entitlement reform in his State of the Union address, but he ducked that opportunity. Now that House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan has offered a sweeping plan that addresses those issues, the president has announced that he will give a speech Wednesday on those topics. The congressman from Wisconsin took the lead in addressing the politically difficult issues, and the president trails in his wake. The body of the email from Boehner's office helpfully defines the words leader and follower. The president's speech will challenge the House Republican budget and call for a more balanced approach-- that's a word we'll hear a lot from the White House in the coming weeks. It comes on the heels of the averted shutdown saga in which Obama played a backseat role. He did not push for significant cuts, and though his staff was deeply involved, he only inserted himself in the debate at the last stage. So Republicans had to stifle their guffaws when they saw Obama appear late Friday night and appear to take credit for the agreement that kept government operating. It wasn't so much the president's words that suggested he was taking credit, but the images made it look that way. He appeared from the White House with the Washington Monument in the background, declaring that America's monuments had been kept open. On Monday, Obama continued the theme by visiting with a school class from Longmont, Colo.; a mother of one of the students wrote to the president expressing worry the visit would be ruined by the shutdown, which the president highlighted in his remarks. When you have a presidential escort, it doesn't take long to zoom to the front of the parade. Republicans are irritated because they want credit for the deal that cuts spending. They want credit not only because they think it will help them get re-elected, but also because it will help them win support with the spending cuts they want to win in the budget fights to come. They accuse the president of trying to get the glory without taking the political risk. Given that a president usually gets the political penalty whether he deserves it or not, perhaps this is one of the few times the dynamic works to his advantage. The White House expected these lumps. The president and his aides made a tactical decision to be followers on the budget deficit. They chose not to put forward a plan to reform entitlements to bring down costs and decided not to embrace the findings of Obama's own fiscal commission. If the president had led in this way, say White House advisers, his proposals would have become a target, and nothing major would have gotten done. This obviously was also a political strategy. Bravery points don't help when the other party clobbers you for your bold proposals. (See also: health care reform). The Obama approach was ratified at the time by a leader of the party now criticizing the president for his lack of leadership. On the day of the president's State of the Union address, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told Mike Allen of Politico that if he were president, he wouldn't speak in public about the details of an entitlement overhaul. Something that politically complicated and volatile could only be worked out in secret. Boehner also knows the beauty of tactical restraint. In 2010, when formulating his party's campaign pitch for the promises it would keep when it came to power, he and GOP leaders consciously steered clear of the big budget questions. Paul Ryan had already drawn up an ambitious plan, but Boehner knew better than to embrace it before an election. Instead he simply promised that he would have an ""adult conversation"" with the American people about the choices that needed to be made once Republicans were in power. (He's made good on that promise.) Boehner shares another quality with the president. Republicans are saying that Obama on Wednesday will increase his original commitment to deficit reduction only because he has been prompted by House Republicans. That was also true of Boehner, whose original deficit reduction offering was rejected by Republican freshmen. Under pressure, he agreed to a larger set of reductions. Obama knows he could never be the leader of the deficit-reduction derby. Instead he chose to lead a different debate over priorities by focusing his State of the Union address on a series of investments he believes are necessary for America's economic growth. Republicans thought it was crazy to design a speech around spending immediately after an election in which voters had elected Republicans on an anti-spending and deficit-reduction platform. But another way of looking at it is to say that Obama was showing the kind of leadership that usually receives praise from GOP circles: sticking to his beliefs despite the politics of the moment. Despite the public appetite for extravagant promises for spending reductions, Obama made a case for spending. For the last several months, while allies and critics have been calling for increased public involvement on issues from Libya to the fight over the budget, he has been sticking to his ""win the future"" agenda and giving speeches about improving education, innovation, infrastructure, and energy alternatives. Settling on a plan and working it even when distractions conspire to pull you away from your path is also a quality associated with leadership. (This worked pretty well during the 2008 Democratic primary, when the Obama team's long-view, delegate-based strategy paid off against Hillary Clinton.) This design anticipated greater engagement with Republicans once they put forward a proposal and the debate could be about big issues. However, the form--a Big Speech of the kind Obama plans for Wednesday--may not have always been in the cards. And clearly the White House would have preferred that the press treat the ""Win the Future"" slogan seriously and not like a memo from Human Resources, which is usually where slogans like that come from. In the end, Obama may have picked the wrong strategy, misread the political moment, and designed bad policies.  But none of that means he lacks the qualities of leadership. Public displays of leadership are the most exciting and easiest for the press to cover, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are the most politically effective. The Obama administration is betting on another way. If this approach gets results, then surely that's a quality we want in a leader. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	"When Republicans question Obama's ""leadership,"" do they have a point?"
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/shouting_down_women.html	"What does it say about the state of American political discourse that the government may shut down entirely and the two sides can't even agree on the sticking point? If the shutdown happens on Friday at midnight, Republicans will go to bed tonight believing that this impasse is over spending cuts: As House Speaker John Boehner said, ""There's only one reason that we do not have an agreement as yet, and that issue is spending."" Democrats, for their part, will go to sleep believing that the shutdown occurred because of abortion. As Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid put it: ""It's not realistic to shut down the government on a debate dealing with abortion. It's not fair to the American people. We haven't solved the issue in 40 years. We're not going to solve it in the next 38 hours."" As this fight goes down to the wire, even Republicans appear confused about whether they are holding out over a rider that would defund Planned Parenthood or over some magical dollar amount that needs to be cut from the budget (it amounts to about 0.3 percent of the budget, or as Amanda Marcotte says, ""the stuff in the couch cushions."") Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., who spearheaded the move to zero out Planned Parenthood, said on Morning Joe this week that he would certainly shut down the federal government if it meant de-funding ""the largest abortion provider in the country."" He seems not to be retreating from that stance as the day ticks on, although some of his colleagues are jumping ship. As  the midnight hour nears, the fabrications continue to trip off the tongues of GOP leadership: Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., repeated on Friday the GOP fiction that abortions are ""well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.""* (He later issued one of the all-time great clarifications, saying his remark was ""not intended to be a factual statement."") Here is Ezra Klein on the actual breakout of Planned Parenthood numbers: ""Abortion services account for about 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's activities. That's less than cancer screening and prevention (16 percent), STD testing for both men and women (35 percent), and contraception (also 35 percent). About 80 percent of Planned Parenthood's users are over age 20, and 75 percent have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Planned Parenthood itself estimates it prevents more than 620,000 unintended pregnancies each year, and 220,000 abortions."" For many American women, these are not health services that are readily available elsewhere. This is basic preventive care for the poorest and most vulnerable women in America. It's barely worth repeating the other forgotten fact here: Not one penny of taxpayer money goes to funding abortions at Planned Parenthood. That's illegal already. The GOP argument appears to be that if taxpayers fund cancer screening and preventive medicine, then that just leaves the evildoers at Planned Parenthood with more money of their own to spend on abortions. Taxpayer money spent on any kind of health care for women, it seems, is always a little bit suspect. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., was so enraged by the false connection between federal funding for family planning, known as Title X, and abortion, that she announced today: ""Where we will not go is eliminating the health care for women. Make no mistake, this entire debate has involved throwing women and children under the bus."" The Republicans' end game here may be to ban abortion in America. (If it is, Joan Walsh explains why the opposite outcome is more likely.) Or it may not be. Maybe it's to find a way to either punish and demonize low-income women, or to blame them later for the government shutdown. Either way, the whole budget fight has become part of the larger GOP war on women, and either way, itis women who will end up holding the bag when it's all over. Katha Pollitt is right: Shutting down the federal government over Title X funding has absolutely nothing to do with abortion and everything to do with women. This is about scapegoating yet another group of Americans--along with immigrants, the poor, union members, who else?--for the nation's financial problems.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/the_fleshy_part_of_the_budget.html	"In ""The Fleshy Part of the Thigh,"" one of the last episodes of The Sopranos, Bobby Bacala approaches a rapper with an idea: For a fee, he'll shoot him in the aforementioned body part. The hitman gets a payday; the rapper gets cred. It's win-win. This is a useful way of understanding the budget debate in Congress this week, which will end either with a government shutdown or with another cost-cutting, face-saving compromise. There's no point in compromising before the very last second. President Obama has to promise not to sign a one-week funding measure, because he can't look like he's caving--liberals had their fill of that when he signed the tax cut deal last December. House Speaker John Boehner has to repeat, again and again, and again, that he's trying to get the ""biggest cuts"" he can, and will accept no deal that lacks the support of 218 Republicans. As the White House says no deal, it sets up meetings--there's another one with Boehner Wednesday night. As Republicans say no deal, they take meetings and revisit one-week stopgaps. In the prisoner's dilemma playing out right now, it's important that everyone act as obstinate and offended and inflexible as he or she possibly can. There are fights coming on the debt ceiling and the new Republican budget, so for now, the players get to pick which battles they get scarred in. (In The Sopranos, Bobby doesn't get his whole fee and he shoots the rapper in a different body part, so the analogy is admittedly imperfect.) And this is why the fight over the shutdown has become so predictable. Become might not even be the right word--it's been predictable for months, ever since Republicans and Democrats mused about the apocalyptic gridlock that would come if Boehner became speaker. Nothing has changed the basic fact that voters are more likely to blame Republicans if the government closes down for a while. The weeks of pre-buttal and pre-spin haven't changed anything. There have been four basic arguments, two for each party. Republican Argument I: Shut it down. Before Republicans got their message right, at some point in March, this was the standard GOP line. It was gold on the campaign trail. In September, Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., told a conference organized by Ralph Reed that a shutdown was on the way, and basked in the applause. ""They're going to come and say, 'Daddy can't go to the V.A., the national parks are closed,' "" Westmoreland warned. ""We need to make sure you're going to be with us."" The shut-it-down argument comes in two flavors. Westmoreland focused on the first one, assuming that the shutdown would be painful. In February, Mike Huckabee summed up the second one: A shutdown would not be that bad, not that ""draconian."" Not everyone who pulls out this argument goes into detail. But since Republicans and Tea Party activists occasionally use it, they've set themselves up as the black hats of a standoff.  An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday found that 37 percent of voters would blame Republicans if the government shut down, 20 percent would blame Obama, and 20 percent would blame congressional Democrats. * Compare that with the poll that was conducted in October 1995, the last time the government shut down. Sixteen years ago, 43 percent of voters said a shutdown would be Republicans' fault, and 32 percent said it would be Bill Clinton's fault. And that was the high watermark for Republicans. They lost ground once the shutdown started. Republican Argument II: It's not our fault. Republicans and Tea Party activists have been remarkably on message since the shutdown became a real possibility. Last week, at a rally that was watched for signs of Tea Party fervor, organizers and Republicans assured the crowd that any shutdown would be the Democrats' fault. This week, Republicans have underlined, highlighted, and memorized the script. ""I believe very firmly that Harry Reid and Barack Obama have planned to shut down this government, for political purposes,"" Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., said yesterday. ""It's a diabolical plan of trying to re-elect Barack Obama, put Nancy Pelosi back in the speaker's chair, and give Harry Reid a bigger majority so they can continue their socialist takeover."" This was boiled down by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: ""They are rooting, rooting for a shutdown!"" There are some helpful facts behind this. Democrats did not pass a budget in 2010, and this impasse would have been avoided if they had. It's also true that Democrats have blinked on enough spending measures that, as one GOP aide told me, there's a real path to an agreement. All that Republicans need to do is abandon some policy riders, like the bans on funding for Planned Parenthood and NPR, and voila--Democrats will cave. And that's where things look like they're headed, so it's important for Republicans to go into a deal sounding like the victims. Democratic Argument I: Let them shut it down. This is similar to GOP Argument I, but meant more as a taunt than a demand. This isn't the best argument Democrats have, which is why none of the ones who have votes in Congress are making it. Howard Dean handed the GOP a delicate gift last week when he said, if he ran the DNC, he'd be ""rooting for a shutdown."" But since he said it, remarks like Broun's are tethered to reality.Democrats are increasingly convinced--depending on how much something can ""increase"" in a day--that the launch of Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan's budget is adding more helpful noise to the shutdown debate. Voters who are not closely following the difference between 2011 fiscal year outlays and 2012 budget projections are hearing about a document that does all sorts of unpopular things, like means-testing and privatizing Medicare and broadening the tax code while cutting the top tax rates. They won't say this. But when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid talks like he did this morning and says that ""the Tea Party is screaming so loudly"" at the Republican Party ""that it can't hear what the country demands,"" he's taking advantage of an electorate that doesn't completely understand what's happening. Democratic Argument II: We'll do whatever it takes. If there's a compromise to avoid a shutdown, Republicans will tell the base that they did whatever they could and got the best possible deal without falling into the Democrats' dastardly trap. Democrats have a similar plan, but it's even easier: They like government. They want it to keep working. If they can come off as the sensible adults who keep the place running, they ""win,"" no matter how deep the cuts Republicans get away with. That's what Reid seemed to be setting up in his final floor speech of the day on Wednesday. ""We meet them halfway, they say no,"" said Reid. ""We meet them more than halfway, they say no. We meet them all the way, they still say no.""Translation: The other guys are impossible; Democrats just want a deal. The other guys are convinced that a shutdown is good for Democrats and that Democrats are rooting for it. All the Democrats have to do is avert a shutdown, and they've got a surefire win.Correction,  April 7, 2011: This article originally misstated the percentage of poll respondents who would blame Republicans as 40 percent. It was 37 percent. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Government shutdown: How Democrats and Republicans are already spinning it.
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/04/honest_paul.html	"Two products made their debuts in Congress on Tuesday. The first was ""The Path to Prosperity,"" House Republicans' budget resolution for the next fiscal year. The second was the budget's author: Honest Paul. Honest Paul is the heroic persona of Rep. Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House budget committee. He's like the regular Paul Ryan, except he must pause regularly to accept plaudits for his candor, heroism, and courage. This persona had been in beta-testing for several years, at least since the Weekly Standard profiled him as one of the GOP's rising stars in October 2007 (headline: ""The Thinker""). Honest Paul got a good, long trial run in 2010, when Ryan introduced--after plenty of Democratic goading--the budget-cutting ""Roadmap for America's Future."" The trial run was a success, because for all of the bashing Democrats and liberal-leaning think-tankers did, it didn't stop the Republicans from taking the House. And so Tuesday belonged to Honest Paul. David Brooks wrote a column praising Ryan for ""the most comprehensive and most courageous budget reform proposal any of us have seen in our lifetimes."" When Ryan appeared on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" he was interrupted several times to accept more praise. ""Let us stop right now and commend him,"" said host Joe Scarborough, who served with Ryan in the House from 1999 to 2001. ""He's in a leadership position,"" said New York Times financial reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin. ""He's come out with a plan, which is more than the Democrats can say."" The plaudits followed Ryan wherever he went. After the MSNBC appearance, at a press conference on Capitol Hill, Paul was flanked by 16 members of his committee and his Republican peer in the Senate, Jeff Sessions. ""In the face of all kinds of threats,"" said Sessions, ""you have looked the American people in the eye and released a fact-based budget that will stand up to scrutiny."" After the presser, Ryan jumped on the phone to talk to Glenn Beck and assure Beck's listeners that they could count on him to win the budget wars. ""What will shut these union revolutionaries down?"" asked Beck. ""Ultimately, we've got to win elections,"" said Ryan, diplomatically. ""With this budget we're giving the country the debate we deserve to have."" Ryan jumped off the phone and into the American Enterprise Institute to give another speech on the Path. He was introduced by AEI's president, Arthur Brooks, who reminded the crowd that ""a budget is a moral document"" and that Ryan, making his second AEI appearance since the midterm election, was doing ""courageous work."" There are two reasons Ryan is attracting so much praise and so much of the focus today was on Ryan. One: He's courted it. He walked into punches with the 2010 roadmap. Last month he invited TV cameras to watch one of his 15-odd briefings with Republicans, where he sold them on his budget proposal. His pitch to them was hardly different than his pitch to reporters today. He even used the same ""tidal wave of debt"" illustration, in which entitlement spending becomes a murderous red flood as the baby boomers slip into retirement. Two: Everybody thinks it's in his or her best interest if Ryan's budget proposal, and Ryan in particular, captivate Washington. It's good for Republicans because they get to shift the Overton Window yet again--they've been doing quite a lot of this--and start a discussion about privatizing Medicare and turning Medicaid payments over to states in the form of block grants. In the space of a couple days, these have gone from the desks of AEI and Heritage researchers and onto, well, ""Morning Joe."" It's good for Democrats (they think) because they have an unbroken record of ripping Republicans apart whenever there's a chance that Medicare or Medicaid could be cut. That was the basis of the 1995-96 shutdown, when the GOP's budget included a more modest reform than Ryan's. That was the basis of the 2005 counterstrike on the newly re-elected George W. Bush, who spent six months campaigning for private Social Security accounts and got exactly no Democratic support. And that, on Tuesday, was how this played out. Ryan warned reporters that he'd be criticized for being so bold. ""Is this a political weapon?"" he asked at AEI. ""Of course it is."" Ryan was at his most animated when shadowboxing with Democrats who'd respond to his courage with ""politics."" A reporter in AEI's audience read out a statement from Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., in which Israel warned of a future where senior citizens clipped coupons to pay for health care. Ryan tore into the straw man with vigor. ""You have to say things like that, which are distortions and demagoguery, in order to score political points,"" said Ryan. ""You know, shame on them."" The audience--a mixture of reporters and extremely happy activists--burst into applause at Ryan's speedy rhetorical dragon-slay. But that was easy. Ryan's budget proposal does go after entitlements in a way that no Democratic budget, and none of George W. Bush's budgets, ever has. It's not nearly as bold about attacking Republican shibboleths. Actually, it's timid when it comes to all of that. At the morning presser, Ryan was asked why he incorporated so many of the take-your-medicine suggestions of the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission but didn't take their advice on tax increases. Ryan responded with a koan that was half zen and half Art Laffer. ""When you tax something more, you get less of it,"" he said. ""When you tax something less, you get more of it."" That's not true. Tax receipts nearly doubled during Bill Clinton's presidency, when income and corporate taxes were raised to levels that no Republican wants to return to. They increased in the Bush years, but not as much as analysts--such as the ones at the Heritage Foundation Center for Data Analysis, which crunched Ryan's numbers--had predicted. And Ryan proposes cuts in the top marginal income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. What does that do for the deficit? The Congressional Budget Office compared the projections for the status quo and the Ryan budget over 10-year, 18-year, 28-year, and 38-year windows. The ""extended baseline scenario""--the status quo, with the Bush tax cuts expiring--produces a deficit of 2.75 percent of GDP in 2022. The Ryan scenario produces a deficit of 2 percent of GDP. Yet overall debt, according to the CBO, would be higher than if Ryan's budget weren't adopted. It's only when we get to 2040 and on that the deficit vanishes. That's largely because of the entitlement privatization in the budget, and because of the split-the-baby plan used to make it palatable, where only people born after 1957 or 1958 will participate in the new system. Figures like this are going to get pulled out and teased out in the coming days. But we know what the first lasting development from the budget's launch will be. It's the arrival of Honest Paul, as the accountant and the spokesman who is very, very ready to be the pivotal figure here. ""It is not a budget,"" Ryan said on Tuesday. ""It is a cause."""

Technically it's called a re-election, but the themes and images of the Obama 2012 campaign so thoroughly echo the last one, people might be excused for calling him Senator. There are no images of the sitting president in the video. He appears briefly in two shots--both from the 2008 campaign. The video gives you a clear window into the Obama strategy. It is dominated by voters largely from swing states (Nevada, Colorado, and North Carolina) and largely female. They talk about the president and the next campaign in the loosest of terms. Their faces map to the Obama coalition--black, Latino, young. This is the difference between being an incumbent and a challenger. Tim Pawlenty, for example, who wants people to be able to envision him as president, makes himself the star of a video. The images match the Hollywood version of what a president might look like. (Showing that he's the quick draw in the campaign, Pawlenty responded to Obama's video with another ad that felt like it should end with ""In Theaters Soon."") President Obama, in his email to supporters, uses the difference in images to create a distinction with his potential opponents. ""The politics we believe in does not start with expensive TV ads or extravaganzas,"" he says. Since the other campaigns are likely to start that way--his did in 2008--the president suggests that if you see any of that stuff, you shouldn't believe in it. The release of the video marks the official kickoff of the fundraising season. The president will file papers with the Federal Election Commission and can now start raising money. If you click on the link that comes with the video, you are directed to a list of fundraisers taking place across the country. The Obama video gets the values questions out of the way immediately. First image: a farm. Second: a church. Third: an American flag. It is so heavy on regular people because it is an organizing tool. In order to build a grassroots campaign, the president and his team have to re-create the sense of movement that was so effective last time. The message is not change, as it was in 2008, but continuity--help the president finish the change they sent him to Washington to make. In a direct message to supporters, the president writes, ""we've got more work to do."" The problem this time is that the candidate isn't a screen onto which people can imprint their hopes. He's got an actual record. (Update, April 4, 1:44 p.m.: As if to herald this fact, on the day the president announced his re-election bid, his administration announced it would try Khalid Sheikh Mohammad at Guantanamo Bay, which Obama the candidate had promised to close.) Some former and future voters may not agree with Obama on every issue. To help those voters get to yes, we are presented with Ed from North Carolina. ""I don't like everything he's done,"" says the fiftysomething fellow in a sensible blue oxford shirt, ""but I respect him, and I trust him."" If similar voters who took a chance on Obama last time are out there, Ed wants you to know that the stakes are too high to let your mild disappointments keep you from working to re-elect the president. If you're not going to work for Obama, at least vote for him. Another message: You're going to have to build it without him. The president doesn't have the time to campaign the way a challenger does. He also doesn't want to. In the Obama team's perfect world, the president would stay above the campaign fray, look reasonable and nonpartisan to independent voters, and yet somehow all of this detachment and negative energy would send his core supporters into wild fits of organization.  ""Unfortunately, President Obama is one person,"" says Alice in Michigan. ""He's got a job. ... We're paying him to do a job, so we can't just say, 'Hey, could you just take some time and come and get us all energized?' So we better figure it out."" Alice, like Gladys in Nevada, is determined not to leave the re-election up to chance or the power of incumbency. (In a really perfect world, the opposition would be simultaneously fighting off charges of extremism.) There is no talk in the video of health care or stimulus or any of these icky wars. The weather is good, and the fruit bowl on the kitchen table is full and its contents are ripe. In 2008, Sen. Obama told his supporters, ""We are the ones we've been waiting for."" They still are. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	Obama's re-election kickoff: What it says about the campaign he'll run.

The award recognizes ""remarkable achievements accomplished through honesty, hard work, self-reliance and perseverance over adversity."" Perhaps at the ceremony, time can be found to unspool an ""oral history snippet"" included in the Nixon Library and Museum's just-opened Watergate gallery. In the video, Fred Malek, a Republican power broker and cable-chat eminence, gives what I believe is his fullest public account to date of his participation in the last known act of official anti-Semitism conducted by the United States government. (The snippet is also available online.) Malek's video testimony certainly demonstrates hard work, self-reliance, and perseverance, but honesty is not the first word that comes to mind when I consider either the tale itself or the way Malek chooses to tell it. The Nixon Library's new Watergate gallery is winning rave reviews for telling it straight about the Watergate crisis. (Its previous Watergate exhibit, ""Watergate: The Final Campaign,"" was a whitewash.) I congratulate the library director (and sometime Slate contributor) Tim Naftali for including Nixon's repulsive attempt to render the upper ranks of the Bureu of Labor Statistics Judenfrei. It was one of Watergate's most-Gothic but least-remembered subpolots. But Malek omits from his telling the detail most damning to himself--a detail he denied when last confronted with it way back in 1988. ""That kind of action--or even the suggestion that I engaged peripherally in that kind of effort--[is] morally wrong and totally out of bounds,"" Malek told Bob Woodward and Walter Pincus of the Washington Post. Malek was right that the deed Woodward and Pincus were asking him about was reprehensible but wrong to question Woodward and Pincus' ethics in raising it with him, because we now know that Malek committed it. For some inexplicable reason, Naftali, who conducted the oral-history interview, failed to ask Malek about the deed. What was this ghastly deed? Before we get to that, let's review the basic plot line. When Malek was White House personnel chief, President Richard Nixon told him (via chief of staff H.R. Haldeman) to compile a list of all the Jews who worked at the BLS. (Yes, the 37th president of the United States was certifiable. He was also--despite his strong support for the state of Israel--an anti-Semite in an era when anti-Semitism was fast disappearing. For audio evidence, see ""Tape snippet: July 3, 1971, on Jews in the Federal Government."") Malek obliged; he counted up all the Jews in the BLS and sent Nixon the number. That's the part of the story Malek cops to. Here is how Malek tells it in the Nixon Library's oral history:"	Fred Malek: Nixon's Jew-counter goes on the record but omits the worst part.
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/03/contract_killer.html	"In the fall of 2010, the Academy for Educational Development, then headed by president and CEO Stephen Moseley, sent a check for nearly $1 million to the United States Agency for International Development. Money usually flows the other way--AED was one of USAID's largest contractors--but AED had concluded it had overcharged the federal government by that amount for a project it was overseeing in Pakistan. Hence the check. If the payment was intended to settle the matter, it didn't work. In November 2010, Moseley stepped down. Four other top executives followed him out the door. On Dec. 8, USAID announced its decision to suspend AED because of ""evidence of serious corporate misconduct, mismanagement, and a lack of internal controls,"" as well as ""serious concerns of corporate integrity."" That meant AED couldn't receive new funds from the federal government. Less than three months later, on March 3--after 50 years of spearheading thousands of development projects around the world--AED announced that it would sell its assets and dissolve itself. The sudden collapse of AED startled the development community. One moment, USAID's inspector general had been investigating reported mismanagement in AED projects in Pakistan and Afghanistan, two projects out of scores that AED managed for USAID. The next, AED was suspended based on ""initial findings"" by the inspector general that weren't being made public. Soon after that, AED was folding--and the inspector general hadn't even released its report yet. According to USAID, the suspension of AED was evidence of the government's careful stewardship of taxpayer dollars. But to five current AED employees and three others in the development community--none of whom would speak on the record for fear of retribution by USAID--it's the result of a recent crackdown on government contractors at a time when ""accountability"" has become a byword of both political parties and the Obama administration, particularly when it comes to Iraq and Afghanistan. ""The American people's money must be spent to advance their priorities, not to line the pockets of contractors or to maintain projects that don't work,"" Obama said in March 2009. For some, the death of AED was evidence that it's possible to take ""accountability"" too far. The fall of AED made waves in part because of its size and history. AED managed about $500 million in grants and contracts every year. Until the suspension, it employed more than 700 people in Washington and about 2,000 people worldwide. Since then, 180 employees have left or been laid off, according to Michelle Galley, a spokesperson for AED. As president and CEO for more than 20 years, Moseley turned AED into one of the biggest nonprofits in the country. He was compensated for it, too: In 2007, he was paid nearly $900,000 in total. AED's woes first began in the summer of 2009, when someone blew the whistle on an AED project in Pakistan. After the country was hit by a massive earthquake in October 2008, AED had scrambled to provide emergency relief and apparently overpaid for emergency supply kits, according to an AED employee close to the activity. AED hired the accounting firm Ernst & Young to investigate the problem, and looped in some USAID officials. But it didn't immediately involve the USAID's inspector general. That turned out to be a mistake. ""You need to engage with them fully as soon as possible, instead of pushing them off and making it look like you're obstructing justice,"" says the AED employee. In the fall of 2009, USAID's inspector general launched its own investigation into AED's Pakistan project. From the start, AED and the inspector general disagreed on how much AED was required to cooperate, according to people familiar with the events. AED argued that because its project was technically a ""cooperative agreement"" with USAID--a deal that's looser than a formal contract--it wasn't strictly required to report any problems to the I.G. When a new round of allegations emerged in July 2010 involving an AED higher education project in Afghanistan, the inspector general expanded its investigation. AED dug in its heels. Instead of dealing with the inspector general directly, AED engaged its attorneys. ""We lawyered up,"" says an AED source. In late 2010, AED gave back almost $1 million to USAID--the amount that AED's own audit had determined that it owed as a result of its mismanagement of the Pakistan project. It was Moseley's way of saying, ""I can handle this. We've dealt with this issue,"" says a longtime development official who has worked with Moseley. The final straw was the inspector general's discovery of emails that suggested AED wasn't fully cooperating with the investigation, according to sources within AED who admit they haven't seen the emails. On Nov. 16, 2010, Moseley stepped down, and three weeks later--the same week that the inspector general released an audit critical of USAID's work in Pakistan--AED was suspended. It's impossible to say definitively what happened until the inspector general's report is released. (If you have information, Slate  wants to hear from you.) But members of the development community are voicing their disappointment with what they call USAID's lack of transparency during the investigation. In a letter that circulated widely within AED, former USAID officer Marcia Bernbaum wrote to agency director Rajiv Shah to express her ""serious concerns regarding the way that USAID has handled the suspension."" The main complaint has been that USAID suspended AED without sufficient explanation. Its announcement of the suspension uses strong language--""serious corporate misconduct, mismanagement, and a lack of internal control""--but doesn't provide examples. Another objection is that USAID opted to suspend the entire organization rather than targeting the problematic programs in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Others argue that USAID should have known that suspending AED, a low-margin nonprofit that relies overwhelmingly on government funds, would be a death sentence. AED receives 90 percent of its funding from USAID and other federal agencies, according to Galley, and many of those contracts require annual renewal. The suspension effectively dried up AED's revenues. ""It's a tragic case of somebody who just wanted to smack somebody and hit them, and they fell over backwards and died,"" said a senior executive at another development organization. Then again, the financial health of a company is not a consideration when USAID is weighing suspension or debarment of the contractor. ""We did not force AED to dissolve,"" says Lars Anderson, a spokesman for USAID. Indeed, it was the decision of AED's board to find an acquirer to buy the company's assets, according to Galley. At that time, says Anderson, USAID and AED were negotiating an administrative agreement that would have allowed parts of the organization to continue operating. Accident or not, AED's collapse is just the latest chapter in the ongoing effort for better oversight of federal contractors. Every president since Ronald Reagan has emphasized government based on measurable results. In Obama's case, that's meant cracking down on spendthrift contractors who don't deliver. Congressional Republicans have joined the crusade, too, in the name of efficiency and reducing spending overseas. In a 2009 report, USAID's inspector general urged USAID to make more use of its powers to suspend (cut off funds to an organization temporarily) and debar (cut them off permanently). USAID took the task to heart. By February 2011, the agency had ""made great strides forward,"" said USAID chief acquisitions officer Maureen Shauket in testimony before the Wartime Contracting Commission. (Shauket, who did not return a phone call to her office, was the person who made the decision to suspend AED.) Between 2003 and 2007, USAID issued 17 suspensions or debarments, according to USAID. Between 2008 and February, 2011, that number rose to 37. Their greatest ""success story,"" deputy inspector general Michael Carroll told the Wartime Commission at the same hearing, was ""the recent suspension of the Academy for Educational Development, AED."" Yet USAID has uncovered instances of fraud that have not resulted in suspensions. In November 2010, the Louis Berger Group agreed to a $69 million settlement after allegedly overcharging USAID by $15 million to $20 million over 10 years for development projects in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Sudan. Two former executives went to prison for fraud. Yet the settlement allowed the company to continue to working on government contracts. USAID did suspend Deloitte Consulting LLP in March after the contractor failed to crack down on corruption at Kabul Bank in Afghanistan. But unlike the suspension of AED, the suspension of Deloitte applied only to its Kabul Bank contract. Its other contracts with USAID remain. It's impossible to gauge USAID's decision to suspend AED without seeing the full inspector general's report. But AED employees say it is possible to get a rough sense of proportionality. The AED executives responsible for any high-level mismanagement have left the company or been pushed out. The money has been paid back. What was the point of suspending--and, inadvertently, destroying--the entire organization? ""The terms of the suspension appear to be disproportionate to the possible infractions and mismanagement,"" Bernbaum wrote in her letter to Shah. In interviews, several AED employees brought up a recent article by Andrew Natsios, the head of USAID in the Bush administration, about the rise of a government ""counter-bureaucracy"" that prioritizes compliance over effectiveness. When contractors operate in corrupt and high-risk countries, it's impossible to avoid being tainted to some extent by that corruption. Accountability is important, but not at the expense of doing good work. ""A point can be reached when compliance becomes counterproductive,"" he writes. ""I believe we are well past that point."""
