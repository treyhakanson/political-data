The talk about her running for president in 2016 has swelled ever since. The combination of Clinton's stature, the stretch of time between now and the first caucus, and the media's undifferentiated love for presidential campaigns is going to create a vast bloom of speculation. We should call in the meteorologists, because by 2014 you're going to be able to spot it on Doppler radar. This is mostly terrible. There's nothing wrong with the idea of a Clinton candidacy, but the coverage of that idea is going to encourage us to be stupid at times. (She'll eat corn and people will say she's pandering to Iowa.) Clinton is very popular, and people want to know if she's going to run. Fair enough. But she's probably not going to let us know for quite some time. In a reasonable world, we'd task someone to wake us when Clinton is ready to tell us she's running. (In this world we'd do the same thing with vice presidential picks. No more veepstakes!) But we don't live in that world. For some time, no one will really know what Clinton is going to do, but that will not stop us from guessing. In the absence of information, the stories will come--and they will keep coming. They probably won't be nourishing either. If only we could produce some kind of energy--something useful or productive--with all of this feverish activity. This is a shame, because there are some good things about starting the 2016 presidential race early. While taking a poll that pits Hillary Clinton against Marco Rubio right now is silly, the fact that Rubio may be thinking about running is not. Presidential races excite ambition, which causes politicians to take risks, which can start conversations about important ideas. Our day-to-day political life is small, but in the presidential conversation it's still possible to imagine bigger things. It is a place to discuss first principles. (This is distinct from the nature of the conversation during a presidential campaign, which gets very small fast.) The 2016 conversation really helps the Republican Party. Whether you agree with the scathing criticism of the Republican National Committee report or not, it's clear the party needs some new leaders and a new direction. The big questions are up for debate: What should a government do? What's the right mix between principle and politics in a politician? Which Republican ideas are core beliefs and which ideas are expendable? Old forms are being challenged. The GOP has favored governors, but the boys in the buzz right now are Sens. Rubio and Rand Paul. Governors like Chris Christie of New Jersey and Bob McDonnell of Virginia are out of favor with some conservatives but popular with independents in blue states, which a lot of party strategists think is the key to winning. The presidential stew keeps these questions swirling. The party transformation must happen, but the self-preservation instincts of mildly ambitious men and women who don't want to be president are never going to move the conversation into high gear. The glory of a spot in the presidential sweepstakes draws people out of the wings, though. To get noticed, these men say exciting things. Rand Paul's filibuster, is one example. Presidential speculation about surgeon Ben Carson put him in position to amplify the exciting things he said--sometimes too exciting. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called the GOP the ""stupid party"" and it stuck, in part, because he was more than just a governor; he's a man who wants to be in a position to determine the future of the party. In New Jersey, Gov. Christie's presidential strategy is his governing strategy. The best way he can make the case for what his presidency will look like is by getting results at home. So he's motivated to be more than just a caretaker. That is also true of Gov. Jindal, who will take risks to get noticed in Louisiana. Ambitious politicians are often cautious, but in the early days of the presidential sweepstakes they inch a little out of their comfort zone in hopes of getting noticed. The presidential race doesn't just excite, it draws out ideas. A great deal of the movement on immigration reform among Republicans has been the result of a push to reform the party ahead of the 2016 election. Unlike the risk-taking atmosphere in the Republican field, the 2016 contest puts the Democratic side in a bit of a freeze. Hillary Clinton is in a class well above the rest--including Vice President Joe Biden. When Clinton left office, the Wall Street Journal poll showed she had a 69 percent approval rating. The only other national politician who is nearly as popular is her husband. (Quiz: In 2012, did Barack Obama need Bill Clinton more than Hillary Clinton will in 2016? I told you I couldn't resist.) Clinton doesn't need to take risks to get noticed. (She spoke out in favor of same-sex marriage last month, but in the Democratic party it would have been riskier not to.) It's hard for any of Clinton's potential challengers to take her on before she announces a run, which stalls the kind of fertile debate that's possible on the Republican side. This pause may inspire Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Martin O'Malley of Maryland to innovate or take some kind of risk at the statehouse; they have to do something if they expect to get noticed. Will Hillary Clinton run? She may not even know yet. She is in the best position in American politics. She can keep the door open a long time. She has loyal staff who are willing to wait for her. She has time to tap a vast fundraising network. She can promote the causes she cares about--human rights and women's rights--and stay in the news. (She has two high-profile events this week on those topics.) She'd be working on those issues even if she weren't running, so she doesn't have to contort herself much to keep her options open. Tuesday night she will be greeted like a rock star by the audience at Vital Voices, an organization she helped found in 1997. Outside, members of the Ready for Hillary super PAC will hold a rally in support of her 2016 candidacy. The presidential speculation brings attention to her causes. There's nothing silly about that."	Why It Isn't Silly to Speculate About 2016
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/hillary_clinton_running_for_president_her_diehard_fans_and_loyalists_have.html	"It was the thrilling-est busywork of Adam Parkhomenko's young life. Hillary Clinton, still in the Senate, would meet some well-wisher. She'd grab his business card and deliver it to her Friends of Hillary PAC, specifically to Parkhomenko, with ""three sentences of notes"" about the possible ally/voter/donor. ""She wanted us to save all that information,"" says Parkhomenko, breaking between meetings for coffee in downtown D.C. ""She wanted to follow up with them. I'd get that all the time. President Clinton did the same thing. They'd hear from people who wanted to be in our world, and they'd take the names. They'd call, they'd ask 'How's the database doing?' Eventually that got shortened. 'How's the DBS?' "" Talking about data entry makes Parkhomenko wistful. This summer will mark the 10th year of his campaign to elect President Hillary Clinton, a campaign that began when he was in high school. For four of those years, Clinton was secretary of state, barred from the grubby world of politics, Jefferson-Jackson dinners, and databases. The expert prepper lost precious time to prep. Enter the Ready for Hillary PAC, founded in January, ramping up its activities ""in the next two weeks."" It's a shadow campaign set up at least two years before Clinton will actually decide whether or not to run for president. It'll raise money, sell merchandise, and build lists until the actual Clinton campaign bursts to life. And then it will change its name to ""Ready PAC,"" raise money, sell merchandise, and build lists, etc. ""I've always looked at Hillary as a brand,"" says Parkhomenko, who at age 27 will be the executive director of Ready for Hillary PAC. ""That's been especially true in the last couple of years. It's a brand I believe in. It's a brand I want to protect. It's a brand I want to build."" There have been presidential draft campaigns long before they were caucuses or primaries or, obviously, PACs. But Clinton's advantage is so deep and broad that the super PAC looks downright gaudy. By miles, she's the most popular Democrat in America. In Iowa, whose anti-Iraq War caucus-goers hobbled her 2008 campaign, Clinton leads the field by at least 39 points. In New Hampshire she's up by 50. In trial heats, in their own home states, she slaughters the strongest Republican candidates. So Democratic donors are holding out for Hillary. Mother Jones reporter Andrew Kroll has coined a term--the Hillary Clinton Cash Freeze--for the glacier of big money that Andrew Cuomo or Martin O'Malley can't crack. There is no new Obama, a star who can hack away at the Democratic coalition and take black voters and college kids and people who marched against the Iraq War. The 2016 Democratic nomination process might be the most boring since 1932, when Franklin Roosevelt waltzed into the convention. But Clinton die-hards are superstitious. ""She hasn't been able to build lists since 2008,"" says Allida Black, the 61-year-old Eleanor Roosevelt scholar who co-founded the group. On election night 2012, as President Obama was declaring victory, Black was trading emails with Parkomenko about the possible PAC. (The two of them had worked for the 2008 campaign, then collaborated on VoteBoth, an online effort to put Clinton on Obama's ticket.) ""Just when I was sending my email, swoosh, I got his email!"" says Black. ""Of course the polls look good, but you need to be ready. Somebody who's got more money than God could come in and self-finance. Who knows what could happen?"" Ready for Hillary is built to minimize the risk. In 2005, anyone who wanted to defend the Clinton brand (or anyone who wanted to be President Clinton's ambassador to Barbados) could donate to her PAC. By 2007, they could donate to her campaign. Black and Parkhomenko promise something else--a group that's both ""grassroots"" and able to raise endless money, protecting the brand from the inevitable scammers. Last week they brought on the 2008 campaign's national finance director, Matt Felan. They'd previously locked in a donation from Ann Lewis, a Friends of Hillary veteran. ""We're going to show people that super PACs can operate in a different way,"" says Black. ""Every donation over $250, we're going to make public. You're going to know exactly who our donors are. Adam and I would never, never do anything that would taint Hillary."" If it works, it's a friendly hack of the super PAC model. Born of the Roberts court's campaign finance decisions, the super PAC was both perfected and self-parodied by the Republican campaigns of 2012. The model presidential super PAC was Restore Our Future, the nonsensically-named ""Death Star"" run by friends of Mitt Romney. The wealthiest donors cut seven-figure or eight-figure checks to the PAC, expecting them to dive-bomb Romney's opponents with no tact or sympathy. It was easy to keep the PAC and the campaign separate, because it was so hard to find Republicans passionate about Mitt Romney. That is harder for the Hillary die-hards. They really do adore her, and their love is tempered by eight or 12 or 16 years of disappointment. ""It's painful,"" says Black. ""That's not because I miss campaigning. In 2008 they sent me to 14 states in 18 months. I'd leave on Thursday, work all weekend, come back on the red eye, go back to work. But being with the PAC will mean that I don't see her."" Black leans over the table--she wants to emphasize this. She gave the Clintons a $25.32 donation when she was in school and that was the sum of her spending money. She was at the Democratic National Committee meeting, protesting, when the Michigan and Florida delegates were assigned in a way that helped Obama. Some of her fellow travelers were so angry that they jumped to the McCain campaign, or fed the rumors that the ""inadequate black man"" was born in Kenya. Black kept faith. And she can't even tell Clinton about it. ""There is a kryptonite firewall between the PAC and the candidate,"" she says. ""I want her to win so badly, I'm willing to say I'm not going see her for four years. I'm not even seeing her now when I could, legally. I just wrote a book about Eleanor Roosevelt, okay? I so badly wanted to sign a copy and give it to her in person. We're talking a bucket list experience, you know? But I wouldn't do it."" It used to be so much easier. Grueling, sure, but with so much positive affirmation. Parkhomenko's own Clinton crusade started when he coded VoteHillary.org. In the innocent Internet days of 2003, a one-page website draft campaign was enough to get steady attention from the Associated Press and the Washington Post. Parkhomenko marched to Iowa to schlep Hillary buttons outside the Jefferson-Jackson dinner. That was the work that got Parkhomenko into Friends of Hillary, then into the failed 2008 campaign, the failed VoteBoth campaign, his own failed campaign for Virginia delegate in 2009 (he became a police reservist instead), and now this. He's changed his mind about one minor point. In 2003, he told the Post that Hillary could only win if she ran that year. Parkhomenko had an obvious personal stake in the theory, but he really gamed it out. ""If a Democrat wins in 2004, Parkhomenko says, Hillary won't run against him in 2008,"" reported Mark Liebovich. ""By 2012, she will be 65 years old. So 2004, he says, is Hillary's time."" I sent that quote to Parkhomenko and asked whether he had been young and naive, or whether he'd be right. He quickly emailed me back. ""Everyone today knows that 2016 is Hillary's time."" If she's inaugurated in 2017, Clinton will be 69 years old. After the shouts of ""Benghazi!,"" it's the only dagger Republicans have thrown at her. At the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (age 71) boasted that the GOP's farm team was young and vigorous, while the Democrats' next primary would be a ""rerun of the Golden Girls."" Black loves that joke. ""The Golden Girls are loyal,"" she says. ""They are wicked funny. They're smart, they're successful, they get knocked down, and pick themselves up off the floor. And don't you see those young men knocking at their door? And look at Betty White! She's an icon for 20-year-olds. I'd welcome the label of a Golden Girl."""	Inside the Super PAC That's Already Working Overtime for Hillary
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/ashley_judd_not_running_against_mitch_mcconnell_republicans_thought_the.html	"It was only fair that the news broke on Twitter. At 2:07 p.m., Kentucky time, actress and activist Ashley Judd tweeted that she'd ""decided"" on her next move. Over seven more tweets, she explained that she was ""currently unable to consider a campaign for the Senate,"" ending months of speculation and false starts. Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, saw the news via a retweet. He'd written 61 short messages about Judd, around 10 times as many as he'd written about a competitive Senate race in Michigan. When Scotland decided on a date for an independence referendum, Dayspring reminded readers of how Judd ""wintered"" there. When Judd spoke at the George Washington University, Dayspring shared the collective snark of unimpressed reporters and warned that ""Dems in Kentucky worry about her bizarre & controversial views."" But the dream was over. Dayspring moved on. ""We're plumbers, not philosophers,"" he says. ""Our job is to point out the weaknesses of candidates. There was intense media focus on the possibility that Judd might run."" And why was that? It wasn't just that Judd was sort of famous, or could potentially raise $20 million, or that readers of popular websites like to click on photos of attractive women. (In the modern media economy, no one can dismiss that factor.) Kentucky wasn't on any Democrat's Senate map for 2014, and no handicapper thought Sen. Mitch McConnell could lose to Judd. In 2012, Barack Obama only won 38 percent of the vote in Kentucky; even Walter Mondale cracked 40 percent. The polls that showed McConnell's approval ratings diving through the Earth's crust still gave him the edge over Judd. That's why Republicans liked her. A Judd candidacy promised a sort of year-long cosmic revenge on Democrats. The official GOP history of 2012 is that the party blew elections thanks to ""bizarre comments"" (Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's term) about rape. Judd was famous, and Republicans wanted to make her more so. She'd called mountaintop mining the ""state-sanctioned, federal government-supported coal industry-operated rape of Appalachia."" She'd called procreation ""selfish."" Chris Cillizza, the Washington Post's Moses of political CW, has pronounced Democrats ""better off without Ashley Judd"" for all these reasons. The plan was to turn Judd into a Bizarro Todd Akin. Republican candidates kept getting asked about ""rape gaffes"" from other states? Fine: Let Democrats in West Virginia, South Dakota, and Alaska deal with someone who says ""I have been raped twice, so I think I can handle Mitch McConnell."" Let 'em have their own gaffe prone distraction. According to Jess McIntosh, the communications director for the pro-choice/pro-female PAC Emily's List, none of that was going to work. ""It was so emblematic of the problem Republicans have in talking about this,"" says McIntosh. ""They thought mentioning rape was the issue. No. It was the insensitivity toward women and toward rape survivors, which repeated by drawing that ridiculous correlation. It showed that Republicans did not learn any lessons from 2012. They still don't know what they did wrong! They're holding rape sensitivity trainings and they don't know."" McIntosh was a founding member of an informal pro-Judd brain trust. The Judd-for-Senate buzz began last summer, when the actress worked the Democratic National Convention. (She was a delegate from Tennessee.) She gave short speeches at state delegation breakfasts, and gave another at an Emily's List event, where she first heard cheers of ""Run Ashley Run."" (This happens sometimes when a celebrity gives a decent political talk. See also: Ben Carson.) Anita Dunn, a veteran of the White House communications team, became a Judd Whisperer. So did Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. But other Democrats fretted about Akin-nization, and they won out. Obama strategist David Plouffe was among those who feared how ""Republicans would use [Judd's] candidacy and Hollywood background to attack Democratic Senate candidates running in other red states."" The Judd Whisperers disagreed. People were underrating the amazing power of umbrage. Judd's critics couldn't help themselves, making fun of the actress whenever she mentioned rape. Stephen Crowder, an emcee at the Conservative Political Action Conference, asked the crowd, ""What is this obsession with Ashley Judd and rape?"" and got (unfairly) pilloried online. It was clockwork: A conservative news site would report on Judd, and the ""what's with her and rape comments"" jokes would flow. ""The reason why Akin was a problem for the entire GOP was that he was not an outlier,"" says McIntosh. ""He said what they had been trying to legislate all along. [Paul] Ryan co-sponsored a bill [HR3] that did the Todd Akin gaffe. (It created a definition of ""forcible"" rape. Akin's ""legitimate rape"" comment was meant to describe ""forcible rape."") It's not a replicable strategy unless there's something like that undergirding it."" It was even simpler that that. In April 2012, Judd wrote a piece shaming media outlets (liberal ones!) that published click-bait photos of her face looking puffy. ""The assault on our body image,"" wrote Judd, ""the hypersexualization of girls and women and subsequent degradation of our sexuality as we walk through the decades, and the general incessant objectification is what this conversation allegedly about my face is really about."" The article rocketed around social media, shared or liked on Facebook a half a million times. A year later, conservative blogs asked whether America was ready for the ""First Puffy-Face Senator."" A Judd campaign was bound to test the power of this compelling nonsense. McConnell was already on the beat. He's gotten a month of good press by condemning ProgressKY, a ""super PAC"" that couldn't raise money or file FEC reports, because it attacked his Taiwan-born wife Elaine Chao in clumsy racial tones. The modern Senate race doesn't need to be high-minded, careening from policy debate to policy debate. No: It careens from meme to meme, umbrage to umbrage. And the Juddless Democrats will have to prove that somewhere else."	Why Republicans Thought Ashley Judd Would Be the New Todd Akin
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/rand_paul_and_marco_rubio_s_presidential_ambitions_will_the_republican_party.html	"The fascination with Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio is understandable. Both are young and ambitious Republicans in a party looking for its next leader. They are charismatic risk-takers who can talk to the media beyond just Fox News. Also alliteration may be destiny. Headline writers cannot resist writing Rand and Rubio combination. (See examples, here, here, here, here, and above.) Both men are also considering running for president. We should leave them to their hobbies. It's three years until the next primary and it's silly to assign too much presidential weight to anything they do now. (Though it's not crazy to imagine people returning to the Rand Paul filibuster of 2013 the way they did Barack Obama's convention speech in 2004). But even now, the presidential jockeying of these two men is interesting in another context. It tells us something about the Republican Party they would hope to lead. The GOP is going through a molting period. The route each man charts and how successful he is in capturing arguments of the moment--on immigration, drones, and whatever else comes up--will tell us something about what the emerging Republican Party values and what it might look like as it tries to get in shape for the next national contest. If the Republican Party of 2016 embraces either of these two senators it will be a radically different party. If either is elevated into a serious national candidate, it would reverse two old truths about presidential politics: that opposition parties promote candidates who are distinct from the sitting president and that governors have the advantage over senators. Parties often nominate candidates that represent a clean break from whomever is in the White House. The youthful John F. Kennedy was a contrast to the aging Dwight Eisenhower. Ronald Reagan, the man of certainty, came after the always vacillating Jimmy Carter. The feel-your-pain governor Bill Clinton was a counter to the aloof patrician George H.W. Bush. Bob Dole, the war hero of the Greatest Generation, was supposed to be an antidote to Clinton the Baby Boomer and in 2000, after four more years of Bubba and his personal transgressions, Republicans nominated the born-again George W. Bush who promised at the end of every speech to restore honor and dignity to the Oval Office. Simply having a different ideology than the sitting president is generally not enough. Opposition parties always offer a different policy view, but in picking their standard bearer, they have historically decided he should also be made of different stuff. This extra differentiating attribute is one of the reasons moderate candidates have often beaten more liberal or conservative candidates: Romney over Santorum, Obama over Edwards, McCain over everyone else, John Kerry over Howard Dean, George W. Bush over Steve Forbes, Bill Clinton over Tom Harkin, Bob Dole over Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan. The search for differentiating attributes makes sense when the president has been in office for some time. That's because the other party has been consistently tying his policy failures to his character flaws. That allows the opposition to wrap its partisan criticisms within deeper truths. So, Barack Obama has been a bad president because he has no executive experience. He doesn't know how to make decisions because he has never run anything. Another flaw is that his political success was built on a series of good speeches. That should have warned us all along that he was only good at ""playing"" a politician, not at actual governing. Finally, Obama is a radical. He came to prominence with the support of the far left that opposed the Iraq war. That connection with the party's extreme wing has always defined his essential character. These are three of Barack Obama's flaws. They are also three attributes of Marco Rubio and Rand Paul. Neither has really run a big enterprise. Both will rise to national prominence on the strength of their speeches--that is all that senators can do--and both are seen by activists as the true representatives of their core beliefs--though obviously Paul and Rubio are favored by different kinds of activists. If a candidate holds the very attributes his party has been arguing are so damaging, you might think that would undermine his pitch. Fortunately for these candidates, politics is not rational, so partisans will just stop believing these are catastrophic shortcomings when their favorite fellow happens to have them. Still, these similarities to Obama leave fewer ways for these two men to distinguish themselves from the Obama years (and each other) in a national contest. It will be interesting to see if both men will make sharper ideological pitches, since that is the attribute they can point to that shows the greatest differentiation. If either of these two senators makes a serious go of it, he will also challenge the historical preference for governors. Both parties have liked men that hail from the statehouse: Carter, Reagan, Dukakis, Clinton, Bush. Four of our last five presidents have been governors. That's logical: Governors do a lot of things that presidents do. They have to pick a staff and delegate enormous responsibility to them, negotiate with interest groups, battle with a legislature, and make hundreds of decisions when avoiding them is not an option. There are very few senators who prefer their life in the Senate to the sense of accomplishment and agency they had as governors. Governors also shoot straighter, if for no other reason than they are habituated to explaining actions where they cannot duck accountability. The buck stops at their desk. Legislators are expert at diffusion. They take more credit than they deserve for the collective legislative process, and elude blame on controversial matters by citing the process. ""I was for it before I was against it,"" as former Sen. John Kerry once said. There is also a political reason to pick a governor. They work outside of Washington. Voters are often looking for figures unstained by the system. The authors of the recent GOP ""autopsy"" report are also enamored of governors for another political reason. They represent a synthesis between GOP principles and a reality that has led to electoral success. There are 30 Republican governors, and Congress is less popular than head lice. Which is the better farm team? It seems only natural that GOP voters would pick from their stable of Republican governors or former governors--someone like Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush, or Scott Walker. If Republicans do not rally around their governors, they will be making a conscious choice to ignore all of these arguments in favor of some other attribute they value more highly. And we see that happening as Gov. Christie of New Jersey and Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia are heckled for not being conservative enough. At the moment, ideology trumps experience in the Republican Party, which is extraordinary since a lack of executive experience has long been presented as one of Barack Obama's signature flaws. Marco Rubio and Rand Paul have three possible roads they can take. They can reach the usual historical place occupied by the likes of Sen. Howard Baker, Sen. John Glenn, and Sen. Bob Kerrey, men who looked like presidential material until a governor came along. Or, they can wind up like Sen. John McCain and win their party's nomination but flame out in the general election. The best possible outcome is to follow Barack Obama's route. But it is not entirely up to Rubio and Rand. Which road they have available to them will depend on how much the Republican Party is willing to change."	Will the Republican Party Let Marco Rubio or Rand Paul Lead?

That isn't an ancient maxim, but the idea behind it is so self-evident, I don't need to find Sun Tzu's version to know it's true. When you are trying to build trust with someone who does not trust you, don't give them new reasons not to trust you. President Obama needs to be reminded of this basic truth. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked him if he was planning to relax after he landed in Israel on Wednesday, Obama replied, ""It's good to get away from Congress."" House Speaker John Boehner told Jake Tapper in an interview, ""So much for the charm offensive."" Oh come on, you're saying. (And if you're not, you should be.) How sensitive a spring flower is John Boehner if he bruises this easily? Is this how inconsequential our politics have become that this overheard line requires comment? Yes, this is exactly what we've been reduced to and we can all meet for a symposium on how small things have become later this summer. (I'll bring the microscope!) But if the president wants to get that big deal he's been talking about, he's going to have to hold his tongue. The premise of the president's recent outreach to Republicans is that he might be able to build connections that would lead to a grand budget bargain. This relationship relies on trust. Republicans must trust that if they take a political risk to support changes in the tax code that would bring in revenue for deficit reduction--which will hurt them with their supporters--the president won't undermine them further with their voters by making them look like chumps. This relationship needs to do more than just win their agreement. It needs to be flexible and durable enough to help Republicans build support on their own side. The president's Republican partners have to make the case for this bargain (still a near-fantasy long shot) to their voters and colleagues who don't trust the president and who only form their opinions about him by watching television. The president understands this at some level. During the Bush years, then-Sen. Obama advised the White House that it was hard to work with the administration when Republicans were constantly making Democrats out to be terrorist appeasers. He also knows this because at least two Republican senators he's trying to work with have told him as much. Remember late last year when a fiscal cliff deal was in sight, and President Obama held a press conference with multiple jabs at Congress? ""So ... I'm confused,"" said a spokesperson for Eric Cantor, ""Does POTUS want a deal or not? Because all those jabs at Congress certainly sounded like a smack in the face to me."" That news conference created ill-will that didn't kill the deal, but it has made working on another one much harder. It's why lots of Republicans are anticipating he'll do it again on a big deal now. The president dined with Republican senators, met with Republicans on the Hill, and placed lots of behind-the-scenes phone calls that we don't know about. I've talked to some of the senators the president has talked to, and they attest to his sincerity. They believe he wants a big deal and this outreach is not some kind of political trick. At the dinner at the Jefferson Hotel, President Obama said he would create room for a big deal by reducing his attacks on Republicans, which convinced some that he really was on a new course this time around. But two days later, the president undermined his promise. In an interview with George Stephanopoulos, he characterized the Republican position as wanting to ""gut Medicare or gut Social Security or gut Medicaid."" Republicans involved in the deal-making said, There he goes again. The goodwill was diminished. Medic! This is hardly a reason to go diving for the iodine and gauze bandages. Politicians regularly say terrible things about each other and then make deals. Speaker Tip O'Neill and President Ronald Reagan were often pretty mean in public. Reagan once called O'Neill ""a round thing that gobbles up money,"" and the house speaker said Reagan was a ""cheerleader for selfishness."" But the two men could work together because they had a certain level of trust. In today's world, this is how a Republican senator can say glowing things about New York Sen. Chuck Schumer. Schumer may regularly demagogue Republicans, but in a deal his word is solid. He can be trusted. The president has no trust reservoir. But he will need to create one if he's going to get a deal. So holding his tongue is how he builds that trust. It's not the only thing he must do, and it may not be enough, but it would make getting a deal easier. The president's allies worry that in negotiations with Republicans, Obama will concede to their excessive and ever-shifting demands. If he were to agree to raising the Medicare eligibility age just to get a deal, they argue, that would be bad. Those near retirement would be hurt, and there would be no deficit reduction. The benefits of getting a big deal don't outweigh those costs. That's a reasonable argument, but in this case, there is no such cost to the president knocking off the wisecracks about Republicans. He'll have plenty of time to savage them later if a deal falls through. It is no doubt hard for the president to lay off a few knocks since he's taking so many himself. When Rep. Kevin McCarthy, a member of the House Republican leadership, says that the president is spending more time on his NCAA basketball bracket than a budget, that's a cheap shot. It's natural for the president to want to swing back. But the route to a deal is not through Kevin McCarthy. He voted against the fiscal cliff deal. The White House theory about how this grand bargain gets done assumes Kevin McCarthy and those like him will probably vote against it. Staying focused on the smaller ""common sense caucus"" should be possible for Obama and his team. They were the ones who defined the no-drama approach to politics during the 2008 election, showing an ability to ignore the foolishness on cable television and go about their business. Resisting the urge to strike back is the hard part of schmoozing with the opposition, and that is where LBJ's talents--which are so often misapplied to the current context--might be instructive. Johnson was a brute and a bully, and he fought like hell for what he wanted. He was also incredibly arrogant. (Why check the Bible, his press secretary Bill Moyers once joked on the LBJ campaign plane, ""when we have Himself here with us."") But when LBJ wanted something as much as Obama wants us to believe he wants a deal, Johnson flattered, sublimated, and diminished himself before whomever he hoped to woo. Sometimes he even gave those senators pointers on how they should boast in public about how they'd bested him. Perhaps President Obama has done all of this in those private phone calls. He's definitely endured a lot of lectures from men he would like to tell to get stuffed. But what he does in private only creates some of the room he needs for a deal. Perhaps his opponents will never be satisfied, or they'll move the goal posts. What? No flowers? But this is the strategy the president has picked. His public remarks are making it harder for the very people he's trying to convince to work on a big deal, which means he's not only dropping an ox in their soup but in his own."

""Is that? Do you like that?"" Mark Sanford is hemmed in by a media scrum at his victory party at an Irish pub in downtown Charleston. He's just won 37 percent of the vote in a 16-person Republican primary for an open South Carolina congressional seat, the same seat he held in the 1990s before becoming governor, before the Appalachian Trail, before a post-Clinton world where Americans don't seem to care much about what you do behind closed doors if you apologize, move on, and play to your base. Sanford captured more ballots in this special election--19, 812 votes--than were cast in the entire Democratic primary. (Elizabeth Colbert Busch, the sister of Comedy Central satirist Stephen Colbert, won that contest handily.) Sanford will now compete in the GOP primary runoff, which will be held April 2. In the glare of the TV cameras, Sanford blanches at the term comeback kid. ""You guys can come up with all your own definitions on these things,"" Sanford says. ""What I learned a long time ago is the media's gonna do what the media's gonna do."" ""This must feel like redemption,"" the TV reporter says. ""It's been incredibly humbling ... it's been a remarkable journey,"" says Sanford. Indeed. It was four years ago when this quirky South Carolina governor's political career crashed and splattered all over a million TV screens in what's remembered as one of the most awkward press conferences ever. The tears. The meandering apologies and mentions of days crying in Argentina with a soul mate who was not his wife. The tug on his elbow from an aide when it finally became too much. Sanford, many believed, had aspirations for the White House. In the immediate aftermath he did not resign, nor was he impeached. But his wife left him, and he left the governor's office in obloquy. He was finished. Then a strange twist of events. In December, Republican Sen. Jim DeMint announced he was quitting the Senate to run the Heritage Foundation, Gov. Nikki Haley appointed GOP Rep. Tim Scott to replace him, and 16 candidates--Mark Sanford among them--filed to run for the open seat. In the race was newcomer Teddy Turner, the conservative son of liberal media mogul Ted Turner, a smattering of local lawyers and officeholders, and a roster of no-names looking for a score. Along the campaign trail these last few months, Sanford spoke of a ""God of second chances"" and a ""reservoir of human grace"" that he says he believes is a reflection of God's grace. His boilerplate response to affair allegations was if you live long enough you're bound to fail somewhere, and while he failed in his personal life he never failed the taxpayer. All around the district staff and volunteers placed plywood signs splashed with black spray paint reading ""Sanford Saves Tax $,"" a hokey reminder to his frugal folk hero status. Of course, Sanford had the highest name recognition in the field and he had early money to spend left over from an old campaign account. In the end, that was enough. In the Irish pub, Sanford's oldest son tells me he always thought it was inevitable that his father would run for public office again. In her memoir, his ex-wife Jenny Sanford had written that upon hearing of their dad's affair, one of the children remarked: ""Oh my gosh. This is going to be worse than Eliot Spitzer!"" That was before Spitzer became a co-host of a show on CNN. Before an incredibly popular Bill Clinton gave the best received address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. These days if you stand strong through your scandal and play to your base, apparently you're golden. Ask Sen. David Vitter. Back in the Irish pub, Sanford's dentist and former college cheerleading partner Eddie White is watching the returns coming in on a TV above the bar before the candidate arrives. He tells me stories about a young Mark Sanford, an introvert who really cared about politics and how it might have been the only thing he was ever really good at it. And sure, he embarrassed the state of South Carolina. ""Get over it,"" White says, and shrugs. He takes a sip of his beer. ""Everyone shits their pants."" He tells me Mark Sanford is a true man of integrity. Down the bar a little further is a middle-aged woman who has similar things to say. Sanford was always honest about what happened, she says, not like that Bill Clinton. ""When men reach a certain age, something happens,"" she told me. ""They fall apart."" They buy a boat, she says, or they trade in their wives for a younger woman. When Sanford arrives at the pub he has his kids in tow. They stand behind him as he takes the microphone. The numbers have come in and it's clear he's the front-runner heading into the runoff. He doesn't talk about forgiveness or a ""God of second chances."" ""Are you guys ready to change things in Washington, D.C.?"" Sanford asks, his voice rising. The crowd whoops. ""Are you in fact ready to do something about the spending train in Washington, D.C?"" The crowd goes crazy. Seven decades ago, Thomas Wolfe published a posthumous novel about a man from the Carolinas who embarrasses the people of his hometown in a book he wrote about it and then tries to return home to menacing threats. It was called You Can't Go Home Again. Thomas Wolfe is dead, and Mark Sanford is in a runoff."	Why Mark Sanford Is the Next Comeback Kid

The top political story was tomorrow's congressional primary in South Carolina: ""[Mark] Sanford Seems Headed for a Runoff."" The main photo, occupying a third of the page, recapped last weekend's Conservative Political Action Conference: Sarah Palin, who sort-of governed Alaska for 31 months, sucking soda from a 40-ounce Super Big Gulp. This was a comprehensive guide to the Republican Party at its lamest, a sum total of all of the things that make its national leaders turn red and curse off-mic. That was what the Growth and Opportunity Project (GOP--see what they did there?) was supposed to fix. The five-member committee, a project of the Republican National Committee, was launched in December--after the Romney debacle but before party chairman Reince Priebus had won a second two-year term. The Republican Party had just won the white vote while losing everybody else. To find out why, the RNC tapped a white woman, a Hispanic woman, a black man, a Jewish guy, and one white male from the South--a veritable Captain Planet cast. Their 100-page report was an impressive work of hair-shirting. ""The Republican party needs to stop talking to itself,"" they wrote. ""The perception that the GOP does not care about people is doing great harm to the Party."" They made no mention of abortion and no mention of marriage. ""Among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond,"" they wrote, ""must be to embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform."" At the press conference where they rolled this out, Puerto Rican team member Zori Fonalledas gave the reform pitch en Espanol before repeating it in English. We hadn't actually strayed far from CPAC. Al Cardenas, the bilingual president of the American Conservative Union, had promised to use the conference to ""stimulate the conservative electorate to support [the Senate's bipartisan] immigration measure."" He did so, with CPAC speaker after speaker telling conservatives to suck it up and get behind reform. Skeptics couldn't really shout down the speakers at CPAC. Lucky for me, an avatar of the conservative base had found the RNC's roll-out. I was seated next to Neil Munro, the Irish-born reporter for the Daily Caller who'd interrupted President Obama's announcement that young illegal immigrants wouldn't be targeted for deportation. Munro didn't interrupt anyone today. He waited for report co-author Ari Fleischer to evade two questions on state party politics and debates, then asked whether coming out for ""amnesty"" would be ""posing any damage to your other supporters"" for the false hope of winning some Hispanics. ""What's the evidence it actually works?"" asked Munro. ""That's one of many steps that need to be taken,"" said Fleischer. ""Every American knows that we have to find a solution,"" said Fonalledas. ""OK, I asked for evidence,"" said Munro. ""Do you have any polling evidence that your base will support amnesty, guest workers, and future flow?"" ""They will support it, I think,"" said Fonalledas, ""because it's really an issue we need to resolve if we want to gain Hispanics and minority votes."" ""What's the evidence?"" asked Munro. Fonalledas mused some more about the need to win Hispanic voters and the conversation moved elsewhere. ""Is it rude to ask it a fourth time?"" whispered Munro. I told him to try asking in Spanish. Somebody's got to ask. As Ramesh Ponnuru points out, the report ""ignores all of the political arguments made by critics of comprehensive reform, let alone the policy arguments,"" and doesn't mention ""that Hispanics tend to be more supportive of Obamacare than white voters."" The GOP report was committing the party to more technical and strategic reforms, with the implication that it would lay off the social issues that anger--nay, motivate--the base. In his speech to the full Press Club, Priebus pledged to open a hacker-friendly field office in San Francisco. In the report, the RNC promised more ""Digital Campaign Colleges"" in ""Austin, New York, Denver, and so on."" Alienate gays and nonwhites and you can't even start to play in those cities. How to get there? Make the national party, and its nominee, less vulnerable to eruptions from the base. The report calls for the primary debate schedule to be cut back to pre-2008 levels, with maybe a dozen televised forums, and more control over who moderates them. Subtly, it mentions that ""self-deportation"" hurt Republicans in 2012. It doesn't mention that the term originated with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped Alabama and Arizona write immigration laws that made it prohibitively hard to live as ""an illegal."" It doesn't mention that Rick Perry's meltdown began when he suggested, in a debate, that immigration hard-liners didn't ""have a heart."" The states were always going to produce tricky, hard-right issues. That couldn't be helped. But the party could control how often its candidates were forced to respond, and it could build more credibility--as Texas Republicans have--with nonwhites. ""Obama called his mother a typical white person and there was no outcry from the equality community,"" said Fleischer after Priebus' speech. ""If people believe in us, the gaffes get diminished. If people don't know us, the gaffes gain resonance."" Those gaffes usually come from pretty sincere places. Missouri's failed Senate candidate Todd Akin, patron saint of gaffes, mused about the female body's power to nullify rape because he came out of hard-right religious politics and really believed that stuff. The RNC debuted a way to shut that whole thing down. In the report, they call for ""inviting as many voters as possible into the Republican Party by discouraging conventions and caucuses for the purpose of allocating delegates to the national convention."" Take away the caucus system and there's no Ron Paul movement; there's no stubborn Rick Santorum candidacy for social conservatives to rally behind. Do that, and maybe the party can be as conservative as it likes in the states without the national candidate having to sweat it. In the Q&A after his speech, Priebus got a question about the party's outreach to gays. He cited Sen. Rob Portman's recent announcement that he supported gay marriage--that was good for ""outreach."" I noticed that Rep. Bill Johnson, who represents southeastern Ohio, was in the room to hear Priebus, and I asked him about Portman's catharsis. ""I personally believe that we create many of the problems that we have because the federal government inserts itself into social issues that probably should be resolved by the states,"" he said. ""I think our Founding Fathers were pretty smart in not addressing those things."" It was a dodge, but not so long ago, it would have been an answer about the primacy of marriage. Johnson and Portman were thinking harder about swing voters than about their party's base. Priebus wants as many Republicans as possible to make that same lifestyle choice."	The GOP's Stealth Plan for Appearing a Little Less Crazy
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/justice_department_s_inspector_general_report_is_the_voting_rights_section.html	"A long-awaited report from the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General issued last week sheds considerable light on the battles within the department's voting section during the Bush and Obama administrations. The picture is not pretty. It is a tale of dysfunction and party polarization that could unfairly derail the nomination of the next secretary of labor and could even provide ammunition to Justice Antonin Scalia's incendiary charge, made during the Supreme Court's hearing on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act last month, that the civil rights law is a kind of ""racial entitlement."" The sordid business raises serious questions about whether the whole model for the federal enforcement of voting rights should be reworked. The record of political bias in the Justice Department's voting section during President George W. Bush's administration is well-known. (The department's voting section is charged with enforcing the Voting Rights Act and other federal voting laws.) We know from earlier reports that election officials, including Monica Goodling, went on a hiring binge to hire conservative attorneys to work in the section and, in the words of Bush appointee Bradley Schlozman, to ""gerrymander all those crazy libs right out of the section."" We know that senior Justice Department officials in the Bush era, including Hans von Spakovsky, overruled the recommendations of career civil-service attorneys in the section to approve Georgia's controversial voter identification law. And we know that the Justice Department during the Bush era made decisions widely perceived to help Republicans, such as approving Texas's mid-decade re-redistricting of its congressional seats to create more safe Republican seats, an effort partially overturned by the Supreme Court after finding it violated the Voting Rights Act. But less well-known are the charges by conservatives that the voting rights section under the Obama administration has been just as biased in its hiring and decision-making--including charges that the Justice Department wrongfully dropped a case of voter intimidation against members of the New Black Panthers Party during the 2008 election because the perpetrators were African-American; that the department handled Freedom of Information Act requests from liberals more quickly and efficiently than those from conservatives; and that conservatives were disfavored in hiring and promotion by the new bosses, including the head of the civil rights division, Thomas Perez, who President Obama nominated Monday to serve as the next secretary of labor. The inspector general's report rejected most of these conservative charges. It found that the decision on the New Black Panthers, as well as decisions on whether to pursue claims of voting rights violations against white voters and others, were within the policy discretion of Justice Department officials. Likewise, the inspector general concluded that many Bush-era decisions, such as those over the Georgia voter ID law, were also within the policy discretion of Justice Department officials. The inspector general rejected the claim involving the handling of FOIA requests and found that partisan hiring practices had improved since the Bush era. But other aspects of the department's investigation were deeply troubling. As conservatives have long charged, many of the career civil-service employees in the Justice Department's voting section are strong liberals. Conservatives who worked at the department, especially on cases involving the protection of white voters, were ostracized, called ""Klansman,"" ""Nazi,"" or subject to ridicule in department emails or in anonymous items posted on political blogs. One voting-section employee admitted to lying under oath to investigators about posting such comments. She said she did it in response to a series of harassing comments made by three male conservative colleagues in February 2007, including ""highly offensive and inappropriate sexual comments about the employee, including her sexual orientation, and remarks about how she was 'pro-black' in her work."" The lack of professionalism and level of personal nastiness in the report in some cases is appalling. As Andrew Cohen remarked, "" 'At least we are better than Bradley Schlozman' is no standard for a Justice Department."" And while hiring practices have improved in the Obama administration, the inspector general found that department's use of civil rights and voting rights experience as criteria for hiring tend to skew the section's hiring toward Democrats and liberals--experience that the inspector general said was not always necessary to do the job. Further, one of the members of the voting-section hiring committee often sent emails within the Justice Department ""that were highly critical of Republicans or conservatives."" This ""would lead a reasonable person to question [his] ability to evaluate job applications free from political or ideological bias."" The voting section's troubles went beyond personnel issues into the question of whether the Voting Rights Act was fairly enforced. Some department employees, including a current manager ""admitted to [IG investigators] that, while they believed that the text of the Voting Rights Act is race-neutral and applied to all races, they did not believe the Voting Section should pursue cases on behalf of White victims."" Even if the department had ""infinite resources, [two career attorneys] still would not have supported the filing of [a case against black officials discriminating against white voters] because it was contrary to the purpose of the Voting Rights Act, which was to ensure that minorities who had historically been the victims of discrimination could exercise the right to vote."" While the investigators did not find that these views affected how the department enforced the Voting Rights Act, these statements will play right into the hands of conservatives like Justice Scalia who attack the civil rights law as a ""racial entitlement.""  Don't be surprised to see the report cited in an opinion by Justice Scalia in the Shelby County case considering whether the Voting Rights Act remains constitutional. More broadly, the report has gotten conservatives in a tizzy and will be featured prominently in the Perez nomination battle. Hostile Republicans are going after Perez, even though many of the problems predate his tenure as head of the civil rights division and he comes across pretty well in the report. (The worst the report says about him is that he gave inadvertently incorrect testimony regarding whether political appointees were involved in decisions on prosecutions in the New Black Panthers case and that he should have investigated further before testifying about the case.) The sharp divide between liberals and conservatives working for the voting section, and the widely divergent policy choices they pursued in the Bush and Obama administrations, raises serious questions about whether this wing of the Justice Department, as currently constituted, can do its job. The inspector general's report rejected the idea that it was inevitable for the voting wars to spill into the voting section: ""Other Department components--including components that specialize in subject areas that are also politically controversial, such as environmental protection--do not appear to suffer from the same degree of polarization and internecine conflict. We believe the difference is largely a function of leadership and culture, and that steps must be taken to address the professional culture of the Voting Section and the perception that political or ideological considerations have affected important administrative and enforcement decisions there."" Maybe. If not, then we should consider more radical solutions. Because, if the people charged with maintaining a level playing field can't keep the peace, what hope is there for anyone else?"	Is the Justice Department Too Liberal to Enforce the Voting Rights Act?
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/woodrow_wilson_held_the_first_presidential_press_conference_100_years_ago.html	"The first presidential press conference was a mistake. President Woodrow Wilson's private secretary, Joseph Tumulty, advised newspapermen in Washington that at 12:45 p.m. on March 15, 1913, the governor--he still called Wilson by his former title--would ""look them in the face and chat with them for a few minutes."" The new president expected to greet each man one-by-one to begin a personal relationship of the kind he had with reporters as governor of New Jersey. Up to that point, presidents had either ignored the press or fed them news in small, private, off-the-record meetings. Teddy Roosevelt spoke to reporters while his barber gave him his morning shave. But at the appointed hour, 125 newsmen appeared in Wilson's office. He didn't know what to do. They stood in their sack coats and vests in a semi-circle, four deep waiting for the new man to start pushing around some words. ""I did not realize there were so many of you,"" said Wilson after an awkward pause. It wasn't just that he was new to the job. At the time, the White House press room was barely bigger than the lavatory across the hall. ""Your numbers force me to make a speech to you en masse instead of chatting with each of you, as I had hoped to do, and thus getting greater pleasure and personal acquaintance out of this meeting."" The speech en masse became a regular feature of the Wilson administration and, 100 years later, the White House press conference has retained the shape of that first meeting--awkward, impersonal, and with little pleasure for the president. The moment legitimized the press corps and put the president and the press in an extended clutch--entwined and angling for advantage. The rocky launch of this new institution highlights a truth about the limits of the presidency. Wilson knew when he took office what his successors only learned through hard experience, and that President Obama is learning afresh this week as his poll numbers dip in the wake of the sequestration fight: A president shapes public opinion, but he is not a master of it. Wilson had a lot in common with the current president. He was accused of being too professorial and aloof, and he loathed the news culture for its focus on the trivial and commercial. Experience would only harden this view, but on that first meeting, he was anxious to show that he liked newspapermen and they were even more anxious to be liked. The New York Times headline of the encounter reads ""Wilson Wins Newspapermen,"" and gushes from start to finish about how much the newspapermen loved Wilson and how Wilson seemed very much indeed to like them, too! ""As he went on talking, the big hit he was making with the crowd became evident,"" wrote the Times reporter. ""There was something so unaffected and honest about his way of talking under this unexpected call on him that it won everybody."" The Washington Post headline read, ""Wilson, in friendly chat, says he likes reporters."" The Post correspondent went wobbly, concluding the first paragraph of his dispatch by describing Wilson this way: ""Standing there, where he could take in all with a sweep of his kindly eyes and with a genial smile."" Though there were so many in the room, some clearly got a few turns on Wilson's lap. At that first meeting, Wilson didn't do much more than blink those kindly eyes and tell the assembled men that he was fond of them and was sorry he hadn't visited sooner but that he was trying to ""get onto his job."" The White House usher didn't even note the event in his official book. A week later, on March 22, Wilson held his second press conference. This time it made the usher's book and it was held in the East Room. The president came prepared. Apologizing for the raggedness of their first encounter, he said he wanted to build a working partnership with the 128 men who attended. ""Please do not tell the country what Washington's thinking, for that does not make any difference. Tell Washington what the country's thinking."" He asked reporters to ""lend me your assistance as nobody else can,"" to bring ""the freight of opinion into Washington ... to try and make true gold here that will go out from Washington."" The reporters were baffled. ""Our function, at least as we saw it, leaving aside our duty, was to inform the country what Washington was doing,"" wrote New York Times Washington bureau chief Richard Oulahan later. The president, he said, ""had come to Washington with a distinct prejudice against the place and what he conceived to be its mental atmosphere."" Wilson, the former political science professor, had a specific notion of how the president operated in a democratic system. He didn't want the press to broadcast his views. As historian David Michael Ryfe explains, Wilson thought the president should be a conduit for public opinion. He would not follow the mob, but he also couldn't lead the country where it didn't want to go. ""A nation is an organic thing,"" wrote Wilson, ""its will dwells with those who do the practical thinking and organize the best concert of action: those who hit upon opinions fit to be made prevalent, and have the capacity to make them so."" As president, Wilson would curate public opinion and then work with Congress to enact its will. But in order to have a sense of public opinion and tweeze out those views ""fit to be made prevalent,"" he needed reporters to send out the fishing nets to collect as much information as possible. This view is at odds with the modern conception of the action-hero president whose rhetoric--amplified through the media--can overcome the obstacles flung in his way. President Obama's fans wish he could give a speech like the ones he gave during the campaign so that he could enact a true liberal agenda. Republicans, like Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, argue that the president should ""lead"" by speaking to the country about the dire state of the country's finances so that the people will fall in line behind cutting the entitlement programs they love so much. Wilson wasn't the only president who thought public opinion could at best be molded but never controlled. Abraham Lincoln took walks that he called ""public opinion baths,"" to learn the public mood so that he could shape it into policy. He was relentlessly ridiculed for his ponderousness and reluctance to act, which was the result of his belief that the public could not be forced in a radical new direction.  FDR agreed. He famously said, ""I cannot go any faster than the people will let me."" Political scientists largely agree, too. ""Presidential power is not the power to persuade,"" writes professor George Edwards. ""Presidents cannot reshape the contours of the political landscape to pave the way for change by establishing an agenda and persuading the public, Congress, and others to support their policies. Instead, successful presidents facilitate change by recognizing opportunities in their environments and fashioning strategies and tactics to exploit them."" If this is a basic truth about the presidency, it's a hard one to put into practice. President Obama came into his second term saying he was ""mindful"" of previous presidents who had overreached after winning a second term, but then he overreached in the fight over sequestration. Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were great communicators but left office complaining that they wished they had been able to find the right message to move the public faster. The problem all presidents learn is that it's hard to know what public opinion is. The public doesn't really know what it believes much of the time. Or, the public is misinformed. For an academic like Wilson though, more data was better than less, which is why he was so anxious to enlist reporters as fact-finders, not as his personal megaphone. In setting up the White House press conferences, Wilson was asking for a trade. He would let reporters in, giving them access and standing, if they would play the role he wanted. The press didn't oblige, but Wilson still tried to carry out the experiment. As W. Dale Nelson reports in his book on the history of the White House press secretary, Wilson relied on his private secretary Tumulty to report on the public mood. ""I'm happy to have [Tumulty] a good deal away--to pick up opinion--which he does wonderfully well. Washington is no place to learn what the country is thinking about."" The next few years would be bumpy for the official presidential press conference. In July 1913, Wilson threatened to stop them when the New York Sun published comments on Mexico that were supposed to be off the record. Afterward, all comments were considered off the record unless the White House said otherwise, which essentially recreated the arrangement that had existed before the first formal press conference. As war loomed in 1915, Wilson halted the press conferences for a year and his view of the press grew colder. At one point, in arguing for legal limits on press coverage, he said, ""I do not think that the newspapers of the country have the right to embarrass their own country in the settlement of matters which have to be handled with delicacy and candor."" Future presidents would continue the battle, but Wilson had ceded the enemy a crucial beachhead. ""Every president after that felt compelled to hold press conferences,"" says Senate historian Donald Ritchie who wrote a great history of the Washington press corps. ""He treated them as professionals and gave them legitimacy."" Working reporters hadn't even had their own room at the White House until Teddy Roosevelt. Now they had a right to ask the president questions as a part of the regular functioning of the office. This access would ultimately doom Wilson's view of reporters. If a reporter could ask questions on a regular basis, they could set the agenda and fit Wilson's views into whatever they decided was important. Those decisions were informed by the very cynical and commercial interests Wilson had loathed. Wilson hated this idea and very soon invented a crucial new presidential tool: the public stonewall. Ryfe, the presidential historian, studied 630 of Wilson's press conference answers and found that 67 percent of them were unresponsive, uninformative, or cursory. A reporter at the time said the object of Wilson's press conferences was ""to make responses which seemed to answer the questions, but which imparted little or nothing in the way of information."" Almost 20 years to the day after Wilson's first press conference, FDR would give his first fireside chat, an attempt to regain the agenda by speaking directly to the American people without the press filter. President Obama has tried all of the same tricks, from a Google Hangout to a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" to regular appearances on ESPN and late night talk shows. The only thing he hasn't tried is inviting us all into his office for a chat. That's probably wise. We'd probably break something, either news or an heirloom."	It's the 100th Anniversary of the First Presidential Press Conference--and They Are Still No Fun for the President
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/paul_ryan_s_budget_the_republican_economic_leader_s_promise_of_a_balanced.html	"Shortly after 10:30 a.m., Tuesday Rep. Paul Ryan and the Republican members of his House Budget Committee entered the TV studio and took their places. They positioned themselves behind the economic guru of the party, holding white and green copies of The Path to Prosperity as tight as hymnals. ""What we have here,"" said Ryan, ""is a budget that balances the budget. A path to prosperity with a responsible balanced budget. We believe that we owe the American people a balanced budget. And for the third straight year, we've delivered it. In fact, we've balanced this budget in just 10 years. This is a document, a plan that balances the budget in just 10 years."" In 25 seconds, Ryan had uttered some tense of the word ""balance"" five times. This was master-class message discipline, telegraphed weeks in advance. In the middle of January, Ryan had sold House Republicans on a three-part punt of the coming fiscal crises, climaxing with a budget that would balance in 10 years. His previous budgets took 25 years to come into balance. Some Republicans did their own math and panicked: Would Ryan be forced to expand his Medicare ""premium support"" plan to hit more seniors? He wouldn't. For all of its mystic, wonkish charms, a budget resolution doesn't have to be very specific. Ryan eliminated the deficit in 2023 by counting new revenue from the ""fiscal cliff"" tax hikes, repealing Obamacare, restoring money that had been ""raided"" from Medicare, and cutting social programs by as much as 50 percent. According to the Congressional Budget Office's math, he would balance the budget and Democrats wouldn't. As Ryan talked, the National Republican Congressional Committee issued cloned press releases to brag about this difference. ""Will [New Hampshire Rep. Anne] Kuster Stand Up for a Balanced Budget?"" they asked in one email. In another: ""It's time for [New York Rep.] Tim Bishop to step up to the plate and demand that SOMEONE in his party produce a balanced budget."" It's good, clean hit. Senate Democrats haven't passed a budget resolution since 2009. (They have, obviously, funded the government. Remember, budgets are more about statements of principle than making numbers add up in real time.) On Wednesday, Washington Sen. Patty Murray will release a budget, which will include a rumored 1-1 ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts, but won't balance. The White House has never produced a balanced budget. It's hinting at a plan in which ""the ratio of debt to GDP is below 3 percent""--stable, but not balanced. Why do Democrats keep tumbling backward into this trap? Because they don't think it's a trap. Voters don't punish them for failing to balance the budget. In 2012, Mitt Romney won voters who called ""the deficit"" the ""most important issue"" by a 2-1 landslide. And yet Romney's eating birthday cupcakes in California somewhere, and Paul Ryan is stuck in the House, reintroducing his old budgets. Investors don't punish the Democrats, either. In 2011, when Standard & Poors downgraded America's debt rating, the agency fretted for a plan that fixed ""the government's medium-term debt dynamics."" It didn't cry out for a balanced budget. And then everybody stopped paying attention to S&P. Think back to the origins of this Ryan budget. Why does it balance in 10 years, not 25? Because back in January, at the House Republican retreat, it seemed like the sort of thing that could get the feral members in line. ""This looks like a concession to the internal dynamics of the [Republican] conference,"" says National Review columnist Ramesh Ponnuru. ""It doesn't make as much sense in the broader context of public opinion."" Ponnuru should know; he was one of the speakers at that retreat. He's happy with much of the new Ryan budget--""it's great that they're still standing for Medicare premium support""--but wonders whether they focused on the wrong numbers. Why be so specific about when the budget will balance, but not about how? The Ryan plan collapses the tax code into two ""pro-growth"" rates, 10 percent and 25 percent, with no change to expected revenue. At today's press conference, Ryan was asked whether he'd get those numbers by closing loopholes that middle-income people crave--the mortgage tax deduction, for example. Ryan said that the Ways and Means Committee would hold hearings to figure this out, but it might be painless. ""You can actually plug loopholes and subject more of a higher-earner's income to taxes with a lower tax rate,"" he said. Why leave it so vague? ""I don't think there's good argument for being specific about the rates and unspecific about the tax base,"" says Ponnuru. ""They've left themselves open to the argument that they are delivering a specific valuable promise to rich people. If you're making $2 million, and your top rate falls from 39.6 percent to 25 percent, you're going to be saving a lot of money."" And this is how Democrats have always defeated the ""balanced budget"" cause. In 1995, when a balanced budget amendment was close to victory in the Senate, Democrats warned that mandatory balance would mean biting hard into Social Security. In 2013, a new Senate Republican version of the BBA has been introduced, and forgotten. Republican strategists admit that ""balanced budgets"" are a ""70 percent issue""--supermajority support when voters hear about them--but that the details of possible cuts remain horrifically unpopular. Republicans who aren't yoked to the party's daily messaging don't see the benefit of making sure every idea has a nice CBO score. ""What I would have advised to Romney, if Romney won, was something that immediately helped the economy,"" says Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. ""I'd pass one bill that cuts the corporate income tax rate in half. I would have started there. I wouldn't have worried about whether it was revenue neutral, or what anyone says."" And Democrats don't sound worried about their ""unbalanced"" budget. I asked Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, who's up for re-election next year, whether he was comfortable with a budget that didn't balance buy a certain date. ""I don't worry about those things,"" he said. ""We're working towards a balanced budget."" Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent elected last year, made the same distinction. ""The important thing is we're on a sustainable path toward a balanced budget,"" he said, ""while at the same time not crippling the economy."" King has slain the ""unbalanced"" dragon before. When he ran for Senate, Republican-aligned groups attacked him for his record as governor from 1995 to 2003. ""When King left office,"" warned the narrator in one Chamber of Commerce ad, ""he left Maine with a $1 billion budget shortfall."" None of this stopped King from winning a three-way race, by 22 points. The Balanced Budget God, so compelling to Republican voters, isn't so compelling for anyone else. ""Republicans are missing the vast majority of the American electorate,"" says Kellyanne Conway, a pollster who spoke at the GOP retreat. ""They're not job seekers. They're not job creators. They're job holders. Focus on them."""	Why Paul Ryan's Balanced Budget Message Falls Flat
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/barack_obama_s_outreach_to_paul_ryan_the_president_is_reaching_out_to_the.html	"When he releases his budget Tuesday, Rep. Paul Ryan will not win membership to President Obama's Common Sense Caucus. That's the name the president uses to describe his yet-to-be-defined group of lawmakers who are open to supporting a grand budget bargain. Membership in the CSC is built around a basic agreement about how to shrink the deficit: Republicans will accept some revenue from the tax code in exchange for Democrats agreeing to cuts in entitlement spending. That formula is what puts Ryan out of the running: His budget reportedly will balance in 10 years, without tax increases. His plan is also premised on the repeal of Obamacare. To achieve balance, Ryan's budget will also use magic beans and cut funding for unicorn husbandry. That's the tone of administration officials responding to Ryan's budget. Despite the mockery, the president invited Ryan to lunch last week, and White House press secretary Jay Carney said the president thinks Ryan is a ""thought leader in the Republican party."" So what's going on here? The president's outreach to Paul Ryan shows just how flexible he is trying to appear in his overtures to Republicans. He's not just going after the low hanging fruit--senators with a history of bipartisanship--he's going for the top budget banana. The approach also marks at least the third stage in the Obama/Ryan relationship, which has gone from warm to chilly to late-night Siberian ice fishing in January. The icicles are melting a bit, and while they may never disappear, finding the right temperature may be a key to determining whether a grand budget bargain can be struck. In the early days of the administration, the Obama and Ryan relationship started out warmly. In January 2010, when Obama attended the House Republican retreat in Baltimore, he tried to show how much respect he had for those with an opposing ideology by talking about Ryan. He called him a ""sincere guy"" whose roadmap for balancing the budget was a ""serious proposal."" In the meeting, the president several times said he didn't want to oversimplify Ryan's plan for fear of mischaracterizing it. He then used Ryan's plan to make a general appeal for removing politics from either side's proposals for reforming Medicare. ""We're not going to be able to do anything about any of these entitlements if what we do is characterized, whatever proposals are put out there, as, well, you know, that's--the other party is being irresponsible; the other party is trying to hurt our senior citizens."" A year and a half later, Obama was using Ryan as a political foil. At a speech at George Washington University in April 2011, with the budget chairman in the audience, the president said Ryan was trying to change the basic social compact in America by destroying entitlements that had protected Americans. Ryan became a regular target for White House attacks, which continued as he signed up as Mitt Romney's running mate. Obama's second term kicked off with an attack on the budget chairman in the president's inaugural address. ""They do not make us a nation of takers,"" said the president referring to the entitlement programs of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. ""They free us to take the risks that make this country great."" It was a shot at Ryan, whose talk about ""takers who feed off the government and don't pay taxes"" became a white-hot issue during the presidential campaign. Now President Obama is back to visiting with the House Republicans. He'll make a trip Wednesday to meet with the House GOP conference on Capitol Hill. And he's back to reaching out to Ryan. According to conversations with White House officials, the president and his aides know it is a long and contentious process to find common ground with Ryan--the budget Obama will release won't make any attempt to balance the ledger--but showing respect for Romney's former running mate helps ease the partisan tensions a bit. That's a necessary step to putting a deal of any kind together with Republicans. Ryan has also shown that he can be a conduit between GOP political realists and the more conservative members of the House Republican conference. He agreed to revenue increases as part of the deal to avert the ""fiscal cliff,"" and he argued for not staging a fight over the last debt ceiling increase. Democrats in the White House and on the Hill are still suspicious, but these two acts give those who fantasize about a grand bargain a way to explain how the Paul Ryan of the past could join in a grand bargain compromise. Working with Ryan is also a requirement if Obama is to reach a budget deal through the normal channels. The theory of the moment is that the president's best route is to take advantage of the pause between crises and work through the slower, slightly more reasonable congressional process. If the regular way of doing things does prove possible, then Ryan and his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Patty Murray, will meet in a conference committee to hash out the partisan disputes over tax increases, cuts in popular domestic programs, and changes to entitlements. If there's going to be a deal through the normal procedures, that's where it will get done and where Ryan will prove whether he can be an honorary member of the Common Sense Caucus."	Why Paul Ryan Matters So Much to Barack Obama
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/barack_obama_s_invites_republicans_to_the_white_house_the_president_s_effort.html	"President Obama is reaching out to Republicans. He had dinner with GOP senators Wednesday night and he had lunch with his former rival House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan Thursday afternoon. For the moment, Friday breakfast is open, but perhaps Dick Cheney is free. Next week he will visit Republicans in the House and Senate. How a president works with Congress and persuades lawmakers to do his will is key to the office. With President Obama it is a particularly fascinating topic because he came to office promising a special magic in forging new arrangements with his opponents and he set high expectations about his power to motivate the public if those inside-Washington arrangements didn't flower. Many of the evaluations of Obama's leadership seem flawed though, because they focus on whether Obama has or has not reached out sufficiently to Republicans. Embedded in the question is the idea that if you reach out, you will be successful. Nothing could be less true. It isn't that Obama is reaching out to Republicans for the first time. It's just that his past attempts at doing so haven't panned out. That's because whether a president succeeds in working with his political opponents depends on the timing, the target, and topic, not whether he is trying at all. The aloof president is reaching out. That was the media's first gloss on the president's new robust effort at networking. He had finally embraced a Truth of Washington: You must engage your opponents and work with them. Finally he's showing leadership. Hooray! This view is too reductionist. It's clear that President Obama is pivoting, but the question is whether he's doing so to take advantage of a new landscape or if he is finally embracing a simple truth of presidential leadership he long ignored. The answer is somewhere in between and it's still evolving, but to get a clear understanding requires a sharper definition of what it means to lead when it comes to working with the opposition in Congress. The first step in stripping away some of the fetishism about cooperation is that reaching out to your opponents is not necessarily synonymous with leadership. If it were, Republicans who are praising Obama now would not have attacked him for making promises to engage the leadership of Iran. And if you talk to your opponents when they refuse to listen or when other strategies would bear more fruit, you're being ineffective, which is not showing good leadership at all. So it doesn't just matter who a president meets with but also whether the environment is ripe. Effective outreach also depends on the target. During the failed effort to negotiate a grand bargain in 2011, Obama reached out about as much as possible to House Speaker John Boehner--and Boehner reached right back. They spent many hours on the phone and together, with only their mutual longing for a cigarette to bind them. Whatever lesson Obama is learning right now about the need to speak to his opponents, it isn't simply that he needs to have a conversation. He's known that for a long time and he's shown it by putting in the hours. But the president may be learning a lesson about what kinds of Republicans he should work with. The gambit this week is to work around Republican leaders. But this isn't the first time the president has tried that either. Early in his first term, during negotiations over the stimulus package, he reached out to Sens. Grassley, Snowe, Collins, and Specter. He even got into the horse-trading business. Specter won biomedical research and voted for the stimulus. Obama agreed to adjust the alternative minimum tax as a part of the stimulus to court Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, but it didn't work. During the negotiations over health care reform, Obama tried a back-room deal to secure the support of Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson, but it failed after the public got wind of the so-called ""Cornhusker Kickback."" Obama may not be very good at trying to work Congress; he may only have done it in fits and starts, but you can't say he hasn't tried. In these evaluations of presidential leadership, LBJ is usually brought into the conversation. Everyone's advice: Obama should be more like him. Johnson was a master but had large Democratic majorities in Congress, and he had special talents from his long service on Capitol Hill. Still, Lyndon Johnson would never have been caught off guard, as this White House has been recently, that senators necessary to make a deal were unaware of the president's positions. Johnson knew what every senator needed and he worked to get it to them. Johnson also knew how to make himself look small, so that other politicians could appear to have bested him. That seems hard to imagine from President Obama. The other historical analogy you hear in conversations about Obama's relationship with Congress is the deal making between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill. Sen. Lindsey Graham referred to the deals those two were able to work out, recently.* ""We'll be Tip O'Neill, you be Reagan,"" he said on Face the Nation. Great line, but Tip O'Neill had a group of Democrats in districts Reagan won who were under political pressure to work with the president. The Congress Obama faces is in the opposite position. The passion in the caucus is against the president, not for him. The key to presidential leadership in working with Congress is not simply engaging in outreach but knowing how to calibrate it. When it comes to the issue of immigration reform, Obama has not reached out on purpose and he's toned down his public remarks. He doesn't want to upset the fragile bipartisan consensus that exists. On the issue of gun control legislation, Obama has kept the issue on the agenda by talking about it in public but has stayed out of the Congressional process. In these cases, restraining outreach is the best way to show leadership. By turning his efforts to the inside game, the president is momentarily turning away from the ""campaign style"" tours around the country, which he had hoped would help put pressure on Washington lawmakers. Some might suggest the switch renders a final verdict on the folly of pursuing that kind of outside game. It doesn't. Campaigning for policies is not antithetical to leadership, it is leadership. All great presidents have done this. Republicans who decry Obama's tactics might remember that George Bush took 66 trips around the country to sell his Social Security plan. The failure of that effort highlights again that the key question should be about effectiveness. The problem is not the method itself but whether the president is using it at the right moment. In the end, Bush's own party scuttled his Social Security dreams. They thought they'd get killed for trying to reform the popular program. (Democrats were even more opposed.) President Obama successfully used enough outside pressure to prevail over Republicans in the most recent fight over raising the debt limit. He may, however, have proved the limitations of this tactic by using the same technique in the sequestration fight. The president's average approval rating is now below 50 percent and he no longer towers over Republicans in polls about blame for letting sequestration happen. By opting for cooperation over the public cudgel, Obama isn't learning a lesson about leadership, he's learning about what tools to apply when and how. Now we'll get to see if he's any good at using them. Correction, March 8, 2013: This article originally misspelled Sen. Lindsey Graham's first name. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Why Obama's Overtures to the GOP Don't Equal Leadership
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/rand_paul_filibuster_the_kentucky_senator_s_move_to_stop_john_brennan_s.html	"It started with a tweet. Nearly three hours into Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's filibuster--a protest of John Brennan's nomination to run the CIA, at least until the Obama administration answered more questions about drone warfare--Utah Sen. Mike Lee's press office tweeted that he was coming to the floor. When Lee arrived, he asked a question, and Paul gave him the floor. Photographers and reporters watching C-SPAN cameras lost the picture of Paul and sprinted down marble stairs to the doors of the Senate to catch him leaving. He wasn't leaving. When a senator exercises his right to filibuster, he has to stand at his desk. He can't sit. He can't relieve his bladder. That's what makes a real, talking filibuster so difficult and so rare that a reporter who joined the Capitol Hill beat in January 2011 had never seen one. The last extended speech, by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, briefly held up the 2010 lame duck tax-cut compromise. That speech became an insta-book, thanks to The Nation. As media bait that speech had nothing on the #Randpage. Paul had warned for weeks that he would ""use every procedural option at my disposal to delay"" Brennan's confirmation. He arrived in the Senate on Wednesday with a black binder packed with drone-skeptic articles and quoted from the Atlantic, Esquire, National Review, and the Guardian. Within hours, reporters who rarely covered drone policy were live-tweeting Paul quotes. The National Republican Senatorial Committee launched a #StandWithRand fundraiser for senators who ""remained committed to upholding the values and the mandates of the Constitution."" Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley watched this unfold with deep sympathy and deeper irony. Not two months had passed since the Senate bucked him--and 50 of his peers--and punted on filibuster reform. Most modern filibusters consist of 41 (or more) senators voting ""no"" on cloture, preventing debate on a nomination or bill. Merkley and a posse of young senators wanted to alter that so that every filibuster meant standing up and ""talking through the weekend,"" really debating each other. ""If a person's going to make a stand on a nomination, this is the way to do it--the way Sen. Paul is doing it,"" Merkley said. ""The American people can watch this and weigh in on whether he's a hero or a bum. That's reasonable. That honors the traditions of the Senate."" Merkley contrasted that with the filibuster that happened right before Paul's speech, one that got perfunctory media attention. For the third time, Democrats tried to advance the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. For the third time she got a majority of ""aye"" votes but couldn't break the 60-vote cloture threshold. ""That took no time or energy from any member,"" Merkley said. ""It had no impact on the American people. It had no accountability. From the time that leadership struck its deal on the filibuster, they talked about the need for comity. And what we've seen since then is a 100 percent, all-out effort to paralyze this body. We've seen that in 43 Republican senators saying they would support a filibuster of anyone nominated to run the (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau). We saw it in the first-ever filibuster of a defense secretary."" Paul had joined both of those efforts. His vote against cloture on Chuck Hagel made some libertarians furious, but Paul explained that he was trying to use the delay to coax more drone answers from the White House. The experience left him burned. After winning a 12-day delay, most Republicans went back to their states and frittered time away. They got a few answers from Hagel about whether he'd said cruel things about Israel, shrugged, and moved on. That led right into Paul's filibuster of the Brennan nomination. He understood the value of high dudgeon and infinite time to talk. ""I will speak until I can no longer speak,"" said Paul at the top of his speech. ""I will speak as long as it takes, until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our Constitution is important, that your rights to trial by jury are precious, that no American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found to be guilty by a court."" What followed, for more than six hours, was a plain-talking series of arguments, precedents, and hypotheticals about an opaque issue: Can the executive branch assassinate American citizens without due process? ""The 1947 National Security Act says the CIA doesn't operate in our country,"" Paul said. ""Nobody questions if planes are flying towards the Twin Towers whether they can be repulsed by the military. Nobody questions whether a terrorist with a rocket launcher or a grenade launcher is attacking us, whether they can be repelled. They don't get their day in court. But if you are sitting in a cafeteria in Dearborn, Mich., if you happen to be an Arab-American who has a relative in the Middle East and you communicate with them by email and somebody says, 'Oh, your relative is someone we suspect of being associated with terrorism,' is that enough to kill you?"" After three hours, as the media perked up, Paul was joined by Lee, then by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who said that Paul was ""standing here today like a modern Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" After four hours he was joined by Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee who'd been able to see some classified drone legal arguments from the administration. Wyden had always planned on speaking; now, he was doing it with an inordinate number of people watching and tweeting. Senators who rarely agreed with Paul got up to help him tease out his arguments. ""We ought to take out bad guys or guys who are about to do us harm,"" said retiring Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss. ""I think that's been your position all along, that with due process, we ought to let that happen."" It looked like a debate that altered the day's media coverage. It didn't look like another drive-by filibuster of a judicial nominee. In an interview with Roll Call--conducted before the Paul speech--Democratic whip Sen. Dick Durbin tried to explain how badly that second sort of filibuster had been broken. ""If this is an indication of where we're headed,"" he said, ""we need to revisit the rules again."""	How Sen. Rand Paul's Filibuster Won the Day
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/jeb_bush_s_immigration_wars_the_former_florida_governor_should_not_have.html	"Whether Jeb Bush's new book can influence the debate over immigration policy remains to be seen, but the publication of Immigration Wars has quickened the death of the campaign book. A grateful nation thanks him. Books written by people thinking about becoming president are nearly as weightless as the press release, but because they take the shape of a respected medium, they claim more attention. Using a venerable form to peddle mush fools voters, ties down critics, and enlists candidates in a protracted exercise to become even less forthcoming than they might otherwise be. In Immigration Wars, the former Florida governor tried to take a bold stance on a seemingly insoluble issue. Good for him, and Bush is a good candidate to inject new ideas. He has a healthy supply of at least two laudable instincts: He is willing to break with his party, which suggests an independence of mind, and he prioritizes hard-won compromise, another useful quality at a time when lawmakers in Washington seem incapable of progress. But the book has had a rocky launch. In it, Bush wrote that he does not support a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented workers in the United States. That was a reversal of his previous support for that position. Commentators immediately interpreted this switch as a move to court conservatives in advance of a 2016 presidential run. But upon publication of the book, Bush vacillated again, returning to his previous position, saying that he would support a pathway to citizenship under certain circumstances. That second head fake brings him in line with an increasingly popular position in the Republican Party, which is trying to find new ways to court Hispanic voters. Commentators immediately interpreted Bush's flip-flopping as a rerun of the types of the mistakes Mitt Romney made in the 2012 campaign. Conservative columnist John Podhoretz wrote, ""Jeb Bush's clear discomfort with his own book reminds me of Charles Barkley complaining about what was in his memoir."" This is not the first time a member of the Bush family has been lost in translation. Whether Jeb Bush was trying to prepare the way for a presidential run or simply influence the debate, he has not improved his chances to do either. It's the book's fault. Potential candidates who write books are trying to hit an impossible target. They have picked a medium that expects bold declarations and truth. A book is supposed to be something above the normal prattle. But presidential campaigns do not reward bold declarations of truth. A campaign requires a book of comfortable truths, nothing too abrasive you'll have to answer for later. We saw proof of this in the 2012 election. At the Harvard campaign manager's conference after the election, Rick Perry's campaign manager Rob Johnson told the truth about the Texas governor's 2010 book Fed Up! When asked for proof that Perry wasn't thinking of running for president until just before he announced in the summer of 2011, Johnson pointed to Perry's book published six months earlier. No one who was running for office would ever write a book like that, said Johnson, because the book actually delineated what Perry believed. Romney's chief strategist ""fell in love,"" with the book, according to the Romney campaign manager, because it was such a trove of opposition material. Most damaging was Perry's claim that Social Security was a ""Ponzi scheme."" Romney clobbered him repeatedly with the charge. Unlike Perry, Mitt Romney had been running for president for six years. He knew how careful he needed to be when he wrote No Apology. There's a rule of thumb with these books: The more declarative the title, the less declarative you'll find the statements inside. True to form, the book was not a high-calorie meal, but even the first edition of No Apology wasn't insubstantial enough. When the political landscape shifted between publication of the hardback and the paperback, Romney watered it down further. In the original edition, Romney seemed to suggest that his Massachusetts health care plan was a model for the nation. In subsequent editions, printed after that view became toxic in Republican circles, he asserted an opposite view. Romney was trying to keep up with the changing political landscape, which doesn't track with the book publishing schedule. Many people think that was his campaign's signature flaw. He didn't know what he truly believed. That is the problem Bush faces with his book. If his immigration book is to be considered a bold declaration of principle, then either his principles in the book are out of step with the emerging GOP consensus, or by changing his view now to keep up with that consensus, he demonstrates that he lacks principles. Neither of these is good for a politician. This isn't really Bush's fault. How could he know that influential voices in the Republican Party would shift their principles on illegal immigrants so much in the short time between when Bush submitted his manuscript and when it went to press? Bush's book assumes the conservative principles involved in immigration are more solid. It attempts to build a bridge between principle and the political moment. This is what the Republican Party needs right now: a man who advocates for time-honored truths in a new context and adapts them to changing times. But if that's your pitch--I can find the new ground--then you have to actually hit the new ground. The confusion about where Bush actually stands muddles this pitch. Normally the writing process forces the writer to grapple with ideas. If done honestly, it makes the author feel naked and exposed until he builds himself back up again to a coherent worldview. If this were what candidates actually did, a book could be weaponry. They could brandish its ideas, hard-won from the process. That is not what campaign books are. Instead, they engage the author in a trimming exercise, an extended cogitation on how to package their ideas for public consumption. That's what campaigns are for! Books should not be campaign propaganda, or they risk become another casualty of ""progress."" The closer to a campaign a book gets, the worse it gets. That was true of Barack Obama's books. His first one, Dreams From My Father, was carefully crafted to present a specific image, but it was far more candid and authentic than the gently-gently-all-things-to-most-people Audacity of Hope produced ahead of the 2008 race. If you find yourself in the boiler basement where any respectable second-hand bookshop stores its collection of candidate campaign books, there are a few that will help you pass the time less desperately. Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative and John McCain's Faith of My Fathers contain ideas that don't slip out of your hand the minute you try to take hold of them. You could argue that they were written long enough before their campaigns to keep the campaign taint at bay. This loose definition of campaign book would allow you to include John Kennedy's 1957 Profiles in Courage. Yes, says the conservative, but Kennedy didn't write that. Fine, says the liberal, Goldwater didn't write Conscience of a Conservative either. Which book is more authentic? Does it matter? If Bush simply wanted to influence the debate over immigration, he didn't really need a book. The press hangs on his every word. Lots of conservatives like him. He's got a huge platform. As a former governor who accomplished things in office, he has standing. He's had to do more than just kibbitz. But candidates need to create physical books (no e-books, please) because they allow for book signings and book parties where potential voters can gather in primary states or potentially crucial swing states. Republican clubs can hold events. We all have something to give Dad for Father's Day. They are a useful tool, but that's not the same thing as a good book."	Why Jeb Bush's New Book Was a Mistake From the Beginning
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/menendez_s_dominican_prostitute_scandal_have_the_allegations_collapsed.html	"Do we really have to root for Bob Menendez? The pride of the Union City, N.J., Democratic machine? The senator who allegedly blocked an attorney's promotion because she worked on a (flimsy) corruption case against him? The guy who clings so bitterly to the American embargo on Cuba that he once blocked two of Barack Obama's science advisers--science advisers!--until he was reassured that history's least effective blockade was safe? Possibly. Menendez has earned a one-day respite from the life of an ""embattled senator."" ABC News and the Washington Post have sprayed iced water on a four-month-old allegation that the senator hired underaged prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. Nexis de los Santos Santana, a woman who had told ABC News just before the 2012 election that she'd slept with Menendez, has recanted in an affidavit. ABC News is also reporting that it had been led to the story by ""Republican operatives who insisted on anonymity."" After scrutinizing the allegations in 2012, ABC News decided not to report them. But the GOP operatives walked the story over to the Daily Caller, the website founded in 2010 by Tucker Carlson to outscoop the mainstream media. And on Nov. 1, 2012, Carlson's site  reported that ""two women from the Dominican Republic told The Daily Caller that Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez paid them for sex."" The mainstream media largely ignored it before Election Day, and Menendez won re-election. But the story stayed alive, becoming part of the ""undernews,"" as former Slate blogger/current Daily Caller blogger Mickey Kaus has dubbed ""stories bubbling up from the blogs and the tabs that don't meet MSM standards."" Those standards are all over the ABC News story, which refers to the DC as a mere ""conservative web site."" Yet mere ""website"" status didn't stop the DC from Incepting this story into the minds of New Jersey Democrats, or stop reporters from asking Democrats to respond to the ""reports."" Because Menendez is accused of many things, and because he's had to pay $58,500 for flights on a donor's airplane and because that donor, Salomon Melgen, has received favors from Menendez totally unconnected to the unsubstantiated sex parties, ""reports"" could mean anything. To save time, everyone assumed Menendez was running from the allegation with all the sex. Menendez, the sort of pol who corrects for a grimy public image by wearing red, white, and blue shirts and ties, didn't have to worry about the prostitution rumor until Melgen's office was raided in January 2013, and the press started covering his very real financial scandals. Since then, he's stuck to one talking point and repeated it like a chorus of ""Hey Jude."" His accusers are ""anonymous, nameless, faceless individuals on a Web site,"" purveyors of ""smears."" Menendez responded to the ""smears"" with a crisis team. They earned their keep. By mid-February, the New York Times' news pages were calling Menendez ""capable of bare-knuckle politics"" and a ""brawler who once wore a bulletproof vest to testify in a federal corruption case against a powerful political mentor."" And the sexual allegations against Menendez began to fall apart. In early February, Univision interviewed a woman with the same name as one of the supposed Dominican prostitutes who insisted she had never met the senator. The Miami Herald ""combed the Dominican Republic to find evidence that Menendez consorted with prostitutes"" but found nothing. The conservative media, in turn, became contemptuous of the MSM's desire to protect embattled Democrats. Ever since Matt Drudge and not Newsweek broke the Monica Lewinsky scandal, this has been conservative narrative--one confirmed by the 2011 Anthony Weiner scandal, when Reliable Sources host Howard Kurtz tweeted that the key evidence was probably fake. The result of this well-earned paranoia is a deductive, prove-this-wrong-why-don't-you theory of the scoop. The Daily Caller noted that ""one of the clues that Weiner wasn't telling the truth was that he was following a lot of young girls on Twitter,"" and--hey! --Menendez was following ""a very young-looking Dominican girl on Twitter."" It turned out that the girl lived in New Jersey and had appeared in a Menendez campaign ad. Another site attempted to advance the story by pointing out that Menendez's adult daughter was a political strategist and HuffPost Live host: ""His daughter's past views and writings on sexuality and gender issues are in conflict with the senator's actions in the Dominican Republic."" The MSM is just as contemptuous of the conservative narrative, and skeptical. After all, what reporter doesn't want to ruin a politician, any politician, by digging out a scandal? The reporters who wrote this week's Washington Post and ABC News stories on Menendez previously broke news on Solyndra and Rev. Jeremiah Wright, respectively. Conservatives are confounded by today's stories, but not convinced. The killer docs are ""affidavits obtained by The Washington Post."" Did the paper get them at a press conference conducted by a cousin of Salomon Melgen? No--I'm told that the paper got them independently, but I had to ask. Matthew Boyle, the reporter who wrote the first Daily Caller stories on Menendez writes that the Washington Post ""got the wrong girl."" A Breitbart.com item catches the Post tweaking the story to remove a reference to the Daily Caller and add the reference to the cousin--all ""arguably relevant to the question of whether the new story is credible."" Yet right over there is ABC News, explaining that the recanting prostitute was offered to them, and to yjr DC, by Republican sources. Who's gotten the best of this story? The Daily Caller walks away with something. Even if its original story disintegrates, we're left with the insane tale of a midlevel Bond villain attempting to frame a U.S. senator in foreign courts. An amateur media critic might wag his finger at David Martosko, who picked up the DC's story after Boyle switched jobs. But at the end of February, Martosko announced a move to the Daily Mail, the tabloid that's become ""the biggest newspaper in the world."" The undernews always wins."	Why Did It Take So Long for the Menendez Prostitute Story To Fall Apart?
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/congressional_salaries_senators_representatives_and_their_staff_all_deserve.html	"Americans loathe Congress. Cockroaches, traffic jams, and colonoscopies have higher favorability ratings. Important decisions are endlessly delayed because of petty bickering and political posturing. Congress's biggest accomplishments these days are government shutdowns and a costly budget sequestration--precisely when the U.S. economy is struggling to rebound. That's why Congress needs a big fat pay raise. You read that last line correctly. Members of Congress are overworked and underpaid, and we are all suffering as a result. While plenty of people are willing to run for Congress, being in office isn't what it used to be. Senators and representatives earn less than they have in decades. They don't have the same level of staff support, even while the workload has exploded. They work in a poisonous political environment. Representatives have every reason to keep an eye on the exit--they all could earn more as lobbyists. We get what we pay for, and there's no question we are not paying enough to keep the best people on the job. The average member of Congress earns $174,000 a year, a lot more than the median American household of $50,000. But it's not as much as the median starting pay of $234,000 for a dermatologist, and doesn't come close to the $9.6 million that the CEO of a typical public company earned in 2011. For an apples-to-apples comparison, we have to look at what members of Congress earned in the past, and how much they could earn at other jobs. If representatives were paid today what they brought home in 1992, adjusted for inflation, they could expect a $43,000 pay bump, bringing their earnings to $214,000. Nowadays, a member of Congress who ""retires"" and becomes a lobbyist--a fairly common career move--can expect his or her pay to jump to at least $700,000 (for a representative) or $1 million (for a senator). As former Sen. Jim DeMint recently said, ""Leaving the Senate to become president of the Heritage Foundation is a big promotion."" His salary sextupled to more than $1 million. That's a heck of a promotion. For the superwealthy--and some members of Congress are superwealthy--salary doesn't matter. According to my analysis of Center for Responsive Politics data, 18 percent of representatives and senators in 2011 had an estimated net worth of $5 million or more. They probably wouldn't even notice if they got a raise. For the 30 percent with a net worth between $1 and $5 million--the ""wealthy""--a better paying job isn't something they're likely to sneer at. As for the remaining 52 percent, landing a K Street gig as a lobbyist is pay dirt. It's probably their best chance to join the top 2 percent of U.S. income earners, pay off campaign debt andthe kids' college tuition, and put money aside for retirement. During campaign season, you often hear candidates say we should be ""running government like a business."" Not at these wages. A recent study by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that the CEOs of America's 350 biggest companies were paid 231 times the salary of a typical worker. By comparison, members of Congress earn 6 times the average pay of the lowest paid employee in their offices. Looking across the globe in Singapore, where running government like a business is actual policy, the prime minister earned a whopping $1.7 million--or four times President Obama's $400,000 salary. Meanwhile, government ministers take in $1.1 million, or 5.5 times the $199,700 earned by the secretary of defense. (These are Singapore government salaries after some big across-the-board cuts.) Singapore, long considered one of the world's most efficient governments, adopted seven-figure salaries for top public service posts to attract talent and prevent corruption. It worked. When we look at the incentives for congressional staff, the situation is even worse. Few voters realize that for decades we've been downsizing the staffers that support senators and representatives. The people who do realize it are the lobbyists and think tanks that have been cherry-picking seasoned staff in a successful bid to extend their reach into congressional offices. Comparing the late 1970s with the mid-2000s, the total number of committee staff in the House has shrunk to 62 percent of its previous levels, while the staff in the Senate is at 67 percent of its former size. The number of personal office staff in policymaking roles in the House is at 69 percent of previous levels, and in the Senate at 86 percent. Legislative support agencies like the Congressional Research Service and the General Accountability Office took huge hits. Sen. Tom Coburn, a fierce opponent of government spending, recently decried cuts to GAO's funding in a report titled Shooting the Messenger. Adjusting for inflation, pay for congressional staff has been flat for the last 25 years. Only the chief of staff and the legislative director--the top two policy slots in a congressional office--earn more than their 1980s counterparts. As surveys by the Congressional Management Foundation have revealed, many congressional staff are inexperienced newcomers. All too frequently, they don't have the expertise or experience to understand the nuances of the agencies they're overseeing, especially when compared with better-paid executive branch bureaucrats who've been around for decades. These young staffers are also up against the older, wiser versions of themselves who now work for special interests. There are just about as many registered lobbyists as congressional political staff on the Hill--about 13,000. With the huge reduction in congressional staff, lobbyists and think tanks often set the congressional agenda and are a major source of expertise about how government works. Congressional staff depart through the revolving door with alarming speed, as a recent Washington Times story shows. Like senators and representatives, staffers are paid well to leave, and as a London School of Economics study found, they receive an additional pay bump so long as their former boss remains in office. This is dangerous for our democracy. And not surprisingly, many very competent people no longer want the job. The last two elections brought the largest class of freshman representatives in 60 years. During the same time, the House's budget has been cut by more than 10 percent, and funding for committees in 2013 will be slashed by an additional 11 percent. If we want our representatives to work for us, we must pay them well enough to stay focused on the people's business. We should make sure they have enough competent, experienced assistants to do their own research and draw their own conclusions. Right now we aren't paying for quality work, and it shows."	Why Congress Deserves a Big Fat Raise
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/michael_bloomberg_s_gun_control_campaign_the_new_york_city_mayor_s_fight.html	"Is Michael Bloomberg helping or hurting his cause? When the New York mayor's organization, Mayor's Against Illegal Guns, launched its $12 million advertising campaign to pressure lawmakers into supporting gun control legislation, the negative reaction from the NRA was predictable, but a week after the launch, the reaction from potential allies has also been cool. Senators and staffers working on bipartisan legislation say that Bloomberg's effort to mobilize voters is less effective because it is also energizing gun control opponents. It's pressuring lawmakers in the wrong way, too. Any legislator targeted by Bloomberg's campaign who ultimately supports gun control legislation will look like he or she is being bowled over by a nanny-state mayor who wants to tell their constituents how to live their lives. In conversations with senators working on bipartisan gun safety legislation, the discussion quickly moves to questions of culture. Democrats need Republican allies from states with a vibrant gun culture. Those Republicans can credibly carry the message that the final bill is not part of some secret plan to seize all the guns. The key point of dispute is what kind of records would be kept as a part of an expanded background check system. Records would help catch criminals, say its proponents. They would give federal gun grabbers a breadcrumb trail to the gun closet for the eventual confiscation, say gun rights advocates. No Democrat can assure skeptics that the legislation is not the thin edge of the wedge, not even Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who the NRA rates as a friend of gun rights. Manchin has been desperately searching for a Republican partner in this effort. (Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, who supports some gun control measures, doesn't count because he's not seen as an envoy from gun culture). Just as Manchin, Arkansas' Sen. Mark Pryor, and other Democrats from conservative states are arguing this legislation won't become a clandestine attempt to take people's guns, Michael Bloomberg comes along--the mayor who tried to force portion control on sugary drinks and who banned cigarette smoking from public indoor spaces. A greater boogeyman for the gun culture would be hard to find. Senators and activists working on legislation argue that when gun control becomes a cultural issue they lose leverage. Voters who would be inclined to part ways with the no-compromise views of the NRA are spooked by what they perceive as a threat to personal liberty. The assault weapons ban offered a good illustration of this phenomenon. Gun control advocates recognized, even in the early days after the Newtown, Conn., massacre, that too many voters had a cultural aversion to banning weapons to make an assault weapons ban realistic. Bloomberg's effort risks turning a discussion about guns into a war of competing cultures. People in North Carolina and Virginia don't want people from out-of-state telling them what to do. They especially don't want a New York City mayor telling them what to do. That is what Sen. Pryor was getting at when he said, ""I don't take gun advice from the mayor of New York City. I listen to Arkansans."" The ads financed by the Bloomberg group neatly encapsulate the problem of whether the message can survive the messenger. In one ad, a man holding a shotgun is wearing plaid flannel and a camouflage cap. He sits on the tailgate of a pickup truck while children play behind him. He says, ""I support comprehensive background checks so criminals and the dangerously mentally ill can't buy guns."" The message reflects coordination: frame background checks as a way to protect the public from criminals and the mentally ill, not an attempt to infringe on the rights of innocent law-abiding citizens. But the ""hunter"" in the ad is a little too stylized, and the spot has rightly been lampooned by conservative commentators for breaking a few basic gun safety rules. (The man points his gun while children play nearby and he has his finger on the actual trigger). ""It's like what a person from Manhattan thinks a hunter looks like,"" said one Democratic strategist. When political operatives talk about how vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election in 2014 can survive voting for effective gun control, they say that those senators will be able to rely on their local connections to voters to explain their votes. They claim they'll have the ""messaging tools."" Explaining why their vote wasn't a capitulation to the New York money of the soda-pinching mayor will require a few more tools. These complaints are just the kind of noise lawmakers make when they are being pressured. Lawmakers who want to have it both ways--shake their heads about gun violence but do nothing about it--often try to sidestep the issue by saying they support the goal but not the methods. So these complaints could simply be a dodge. Or, those lawmakers fixated on a bipartisan solution may be deluding themselves about the chances for a deal. In that case, Bloomberg's campaign and President Obama's remarks Thursday with victims of gun violence are a necessary push to get squishy lawmakers to fall into line. But can they create enough pressure? It's a tough task. Bloomberg inadvertently identified the problem in his interview on Meet the Press last Sunday. As the mayor was explaining the thinking behind his campaign, he said, ""when 90 percent of the public want something, and their representatives vote against that, common sense says, they are going to have a price to pay for that. The public is going to eventually wake up and say, 'I want to put in office somebody that will do the things that I think are necessary for this country.' "" Bloomberg is overstating his case. Because even when 90 percent of the public says they agree about something, such as background checks--which is what Bloomberg was talking about in this instance--it isn't the same as believing that something is ""necessary for this country."" That's a higher level of commitment to the issue than can be divined from a public opinion poll. Just because you are in favor of something doesn't mean that you'll become a single-issue voter on that issue--especially if it doesn't touch your life directly. That is the same problem President Obama encounters when he cites the same 90 percent poll number and says, as he did Thursday, that ""nothing is more powerful than millions of voices calling for change."" The voices have to do more than call; they have to march and become active. The number willing to make that kind of commitment is not 90 percent. The hurdle has always been that the people who want to fight gun control legislation are more likely to make it a voting issue than those who support gun control legislation. That's the reality Republicans and Democrats in conservative states feel. Having a New York City mayor threaten that you will be turned out of office if you don't agree with him doesn't change that reality one bit. In fact, it just gives you another thing to be against."	Why Michael Bloomberg May Not Be Good for Gun Control
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/supreme_court_hears_prop_8_while_the_justices_heard_arguments_inside_the.html	"""The dominoes are falling,"" said Dr. Bob Borger. ""They're falling faster than I ever thought they could."" Borger, an Annapolis, Md. pastor, was walking back from the first-ever March for Marriage with two fellow Marylanders. They'd rallied outside the Supreme Court as justices heard arguments for the repeal of California's Proposition 8. All of the Marylanders had worked on the 2012 campaign to ban gay marriage in their state, too. They were carrying huge signs from that campaign, with the slogan Tell the Governor, Tell the President: Protect Marriage. But they'd lost. Maryland was one of three states that voted to legalize last year, and that fed into the liberals' case that gay marriage was mainstream. ""The margin was around 100,000 votes,"" said Borger. ""It was close, and up until the day of the election I thought we would win."" Tuesday's march to the court was put together in six busy weeks by the National Organization for Marriage. More than 5,000 conservatives showed up--better than NOM had expected, not shabby for photos. Less than half of them were white. Spanish-speaking chaplains and families called for every child to have una mama y un papa. Chinese prayer groups gathered in circles to sing English hymns translated into Mandarin. Isolde Cambourne, a French student at D.C.'s Catholic University, waved a Tricolor and spread the news about the mega-rallies for marriage in her country. And yet the mood varied between nervous, defensive, and panicked. Nobody, not even the red-sash-wearing youngsters of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, would predict an outright court win for their side. They had seen too many dominoes fall. ""I don't trust this court,"" said Ofelia Verdejo, one of 700 conservatives--mostly Catholic, mostly Hispanic--who rode buses down from New York and New Jersey. ""They change. They change their minds."" In doing so, they were risking ""God's judgment,"" which is consistent. What worried NOM and the other assembled groups was public pressure, and a majority of the court deciding that legalizing gay marriage would put them in lockstep with cultural trends. In an interview last week, NOM president Brian Brown dismissed news of Republican conversions to the gay marriage cause, like that of Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, as hype meant to show ""momentum"" that didn't exist. In a short speech to marchers, after telling them to ignore the ""hateful"" Westboro Baptist Church, Brown put it succinctly. ""No more Roe vs. Wades!"" he said. Meaning: If the court struck down Prop. 8 or DOMA, it would impose alien marriage laws onto states that didn't want them. That would spark an endless culture war. ""I hope it won't be another Roe v. Wade situation,"" said Ray Bullock, a retiree from Rhode Island, carrying a banner with the slogan Destroy Marriage--Destroys Family--Destroys America. ""They decide, and the country fights over it for the next 50 years. Because what we have now is a government that's legislating immorality. Legislating it!"" Bullock had opposed the Supreme Court's 2003 ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, when a majority struck down laws against sodomy. As he described the reasons why, he grew apoplectic. ""OK, the police shouldn't bust through a door and see if that's going on,"" he said. ""But if they were discovered to be in that position--these people do it in the frickin' playgrounds! The Occupy people, they were having sex in parks! Nobody wanted to put it on TV! I mean, come on!"" Bullock wasn't the only marcher still agitated by Lawrence. ""That's the case that got me interested in politics,"" said Robert Broadus, a Maryland conservative and sometime congressional candidate. More than one marcher could quote from Antonin Scalia's dissent in that case. The majority, according to Scalia, had left ""on pretty shaky grounds state laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples."" He was right. And so, they kept marching to the court. They arrived, and were held off for a few minutes by an impressive array of police officers. Pro-gay-marriage activists, who'd gotten to the court steps early, filled every inch of space apart from the street. The March for Marriage would have to continue down 1st Street, flanked by gay men holding pictures of their husbands and millennials whose signs punned on unfamiliar pop songs or Internet memes--""Wedding Bands'a Make Us Dance,"" ""Scalia YOLO."" The marchers trudged past the court, led by Brown and a black-brown coalition of pastors. They were stopped before they were even parallel to the court's steps by Carmen Guzman, holding a sign bedecked in rainbow banners. You Called Me Names
 Bullied Me
 Now Give Me Justice Guzman drew photographers away from the marchers as she talked about her marriage and put scripture to music. ""Whatsoever you do to the least of my people,"" she sang, ""that you do to me."" The marchers at the front of their column kneeled down and prayed. Police started to nudge Guzman out of the way, she left, and she was replaced immediately by a group of pastors and activists wearing the logo of Get Equal. Again and again, they stepped in front of the NOM column. It took 50 minutes to move two blocks. Apart from the human barricade, the anti-NOM forces were almost polite. There was no real heckling, just a little counter-chanting. One man on the sidelines wore a family portrait around his neck, with the caption Our Massachusetts Marriage Should Count in Virginia. He affected disappointment, not anger. ""You're hating your Hispanic brothers and sisters!"" he said, shaking his head. ""Think of your Hispanic brothers and sisters!"" From time to time, one of the marchers would engage the disappointed man and explain why he was wrong. ""We don't hate you,"" said a youngish Hispanic marcher. ""We hate the sin."" ""It's not a sin,"" said the disappointed man. ""It's who we are."" ""It's a sin, it's in the Bible,"" shrugged the marcher, and he moved on. This was edifying; it was exhausting. The marchers returned to their rally point, and Brown asked them, from the stage, to share any photos they had of the multiple blockades along the route. Gia Coluccio, a 2012 college graduate who'd gone to work for the American Principles Project, described the traditional marriage movement as the ""counter-culture."" It had been, what, two or three years since they were the culture? That defensiveness cropped up again and again in the after-action speeches. Salvatore Cordileone, the archbishop of San Francisco, was introduced as a leader of the Prop 8 campaign. In that capacity, he'd compared legal gay marriage to ""male breastfeeding."" But he had a different audience now, and different stakes. ""Please understand that we don't hate you,"" he said, addressing anyone who might watch on TV. ""We are not animated by animus or bigotry. It's not our intention to offend anyone. If we do, we apologize."""	Did the Anti-Gay Marriage Movement Die Today?
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/the_republican_party_and_gay_marriage_will_more_republicans_follow_rob_portman.html	"Last Friday, after 24-odd hours of media chatter about Ohio Sen. Rob Portman's conversion to the cause of gay marriage, I ran into the one person who wasn't surprised. Brian Brown, the president of the National Organization for Marriage, stopped by a happy hour that Rick Santorum's PAC was hosting for activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He was probably tired of talking about it, I figured, but why not ask? What did he think of Portman? ""Portman's going to have a primary in 2016,"" said Brown. Advocates of traditional marriage had never really trusted Portman anyway. ""He was never out in front on marriage."" And he wasn't representative of any Republican shift, as much as the media wanted to portray it as such. The traditional marriage cause has received no good news since then. No other notable Republicans have flipped, but the Republican National Committee issued a report on party renewal, and it didn't mention marriage. A Washington Post/ABC poll found the highest-ever overall support for gay marriage, 58 percent. For the first time ever, young Republicans (under 49) were solidly in favor of gay marriage. Overall, though, 59 percent of Republicans still opposed it. Republicans over 65, the party's most reliable voters, opposed gay marriage by a 68-25 margin. It's relatively easy for Rob Portman, three-odd years away from a primary, to flip on gay marriage. It's harder to calculate the costs for Republicans if they ""evolve"" on gay marriage now, or if activists think they see them evolving. ""I don't think the Republican Party will move away from traditional marriage,"" said Brown over the phone on Friday. (He's doing plenty of media before NOM marches on the Supreme Court next week, the day of the Prop. 8 hearing.) ""There's no way a political party can abandon 80 percent of its electorate and survive. It just doesn't work that way. The idea that young people are the group we have to make this change for, while we abandon the black community's support for marriage, and the Hispanic community's support--all of this is just fantasy so that Rockefeller Republicans, country club Republicans can dictate the future."" Brown has a point. Republicans and conservative supporters of same-sex marriage have media savvy and a dynamite hook: They're changing a stodgy party that can't win national elections. What they don't have is institutional support inside the GOP. Ken Mehlman, the former RNC chairman who denied he was gay for years, can get more than 100 signatures on a brief supporting same-sex marriage rights. He can't get sitting Republicans, or active Republicans in the party's stronghold states, to sign it. ""Committed Christians make up a huge voting bloc within the GOP,"" said A.J. Spiker, the 32-year-old chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. The ""Ken Mehlman sliver of the party,"" he said, didn't play in Iowa. ""We can't win elections without committed Christians staying engaged. I suppose the argument is that young people won't vote Republican unless the party changes on marriage, but I don't hear young people advocating for gay marriage. I was the co-chair of Ron Paul's Iowa campaign, a liberty-minded group, and I don't hear it."" For the ""Ken Mehlman sliver,"" Iowa's caucuses are part of the problem. Every four years, the media descends on a nonbinding activist contest and uses it to assign momentum to candidates. Every four years, candidates are asked to commit themselves to all manner of social conservative tests if they want to compete in Iowa. In 2011, NOM got the leading Republicans to sign a four-part pledge committing them, among other things, to the passage of a Federal Marriage Amendment. The Urbandale, Iowa-based FAMiLY Leader crafted its own pledge. Rick Santorum, who won the caucuses and briefly became the social conservatives' paladin, signed both pledges. ""Core values aren't talking points to be negotiated away,"" said Bob Vander Plaats, president of the FAMiLY Leader. ""Core values are what motivate us. In the last two cycles, 2008 and 2012, we've nominated the most moderate candidates in McCain and Romney. We got crushed."" But in 2012, voters also kept a Democratic majority in the state Senate and they retained a judge who'd voted to legalize gay marriage in the state. Was that a defeat for the marriage cause? No. According to Vander Plaats, that was an early warning sign of what happens when the party declares a ""truce"" on social issues. ""You had a top of the ticket candidate in Mitt Romney who was on both sides of every issue including marriage,"" said Vander Plaats. ""He had a disastrous ripple effect."" You can't even find a national Republican who'd defend the Romney campaign. But their job is tricky: They want social conservatives to stay quiet but motivated. At his weekly briefing on Thursday, Speaker of the House John Boehner interrupted a reporter who started to ask whether the party's ongoing legal action for the Defense of Marriage Act contradicted their tone shift. It was merely necessary. ""In our system of government, the administration doesn't decide what's constitutional,"" said Boehner. ""The Supreme Court does."" The party would be tolerant without moving sharply left on marriage. ""I am a social conservative,"" said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus in a Friday talk with reporters at National Review's D.C. offices. ""Yes, we are still a pro-life party. Yes, we still defend our platform on marriage."" But backing off marriage, as an issue, didn't amount to an endorsement of the Democrats' position. ""Listen to Gov. Mike Huckabee. Listen to the way Mike Huckabee talks about these issues, because I don't know anyone who talks about them any better while staying true to principle and exhibiting the decency and tone in the way he talks about it. It would be a model for a lot of people in the party. That would be my suggestion."" Huckabee's actually weighed in on this stuff. In a message on his website this week, he snarked at Hillary Clinton and Rob Portman for declaring their bold new marriage views and getting praised by the media. ""Before you make up your mind, ask yourself: Is it a decision you can reconcile with an objective standard of morality, like the Bible? Or are you just bending with the prevailing winds?"" That's what Iowa Rep. Steve King wants to know. Social conservatives point to his 2012 re-election win as proof that they can win where squishes can't. (Romney won King's district, but the congressman did run ahead of the ticket.) He's strongly considering a 2014 run for Senate. He's convinced that the ""evolvers"" are wrong. ""Immigration, marriage--what's next, life? The abortion issue?"" he asked. ""If the Republican Party decides that we can't take positions that are clear on principle--immigration, rule of law, marriage is between a man and a woman--if we decide that we can't maintain those positions because some people disagree, this party will fracture.* It sets up the scene by which history eventually produces a party that does reflect the values of its society. I'm thinking about the formation of the Republican Party in the first place, as an abolitionist party. It was a glorious time, to watch Republicans stand up and say: We reject slavery. And if I were advocating for the things these 'leaders' are, I'd go back and read up on the Whigs, and I'd reflect."" *Correction, March 26, 2013: This article originally misquoted Rep. Steve King. He referred to Republican positions saying, ""marriage is between a man and a woman,"" not ""marriage is between the rule of law."" Read more from Slate's coverage of gay marriage."

Barbara Mikulski co-wrote a mystery novel. In Capitol Offense, a senator from Pennsylvania is fatally stricken during a polka contest. He's replaced by Norrie Gorzack, a Polish-American nurse who tells it like it is and cracks the case of 16 missing MIAs.* After one long day, Gorzack returns home to cook a ""passable eggplant"" with ""a dash of olive oil."" She gets a mysterious message, a rough voice telling her she's ""treading on dangerous ground,"" but ""the guys from Nam, guys from Delta Force, know you're up to the job."" Gorzack/Mikulski doesn't break a sweat. ""I played the recording through two more times,"" she writes, ""and then went back to my eggplant."" This was fiction, but it was Mikulski as she wanted to be seen. (She's 4 feet 11 inches tall, but made her heroine taller so she could ""vicariously"" be 5 feet 4 inches.) Every other Mikulski story grows out of a cliche. She was the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate ""in her own right,"" not as a replacement for a dead spouse.* She's also on every list of ""meanest senators,"" ranked by staff turnover and anecdote. In 2005, Nevada Sen. Harry Reid told reporters about the time he was getting flack for a pro-life vote and Mikulski told Democrats to leave him alone. ""Everybody walked away,"" Reid said. ""Because everybody's afraid of her."" That is one of the anecdotes people are allowed to print, and they do, all the time. It does a pretty good job of framing Mikulski's current job: The Last Defender of Liberalism. In December 2012, after Hawaii Sen. Daniel Inouye died, Mikulski won the top job on Appropriations.* For all the attention given to House and Senate budgets, those documents set spending targets but don't fund the government. Appropriations bills do that. It would be up to Mikulski to save spending from the House Republicans. She wasn't first in line for this. Two senior senators, Vermont's Patrick Leahy and Iowa's Tom Harkin, passed on the job. To reporters this meant that the committee had ""lost its luster,"" and reporters were basically right. For decades, Approps was the place where senators from small states--West Virginia, Alaska, Mississippi--rerouted money to where they wanted it. But ever since December 2010, Congress has sworn off the ""earmarks"" that specifically direct spending to members' pet programs--like, say, $2.5 million for a company working on unmanned drones in Lexington Park, Md. And not since 2009 had the Senate passed a budget with spending targets. Congress was moving from kludge to kludge, between continuing resolutions that funded the government. The thankless work of making this happen now fell to Mikulski. ""She's an appropriator,"" says Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin. ""She believes in this--she goes back and forth with the subcommittees. It's a natural fit."" This year's continuing resolution was the first test. Democrats hated it from the outset. In order to keep the government running past March 27, House Republicans put together a spending package that held federal expenses to $982 billion, in line with the sequestration cuts. But Republicans hadn't wanted sequestration to hit defense spending. So they added back some of the money--$127.5 billion total for military pay, $2 billion for embassy security, and so on. They left the cuts to social programs, with the implicit warning that restoring those cuts meant losing the House Republicans' votes. People who've worked on the Hill before and during the Tea Party era have numerous theories of why the system's broken. If they reduce it to personality, it's simple: Sen. Inouye was universally loved, but didn't push people. Mikulski pushes. Her job was to defend spending, which is easy to deride, against cries of ""waste,"" which are media catnip. Mikulski avoided the catnip. After the House passed its continuing resolution, a reporter started to ask Mikulski about John Boehner's demands, and she cut off the question. ""Congressman Boehner's going to talk about what he needs to talk about,"" she said. ""We are definitely not in a posture of being provocative or pugilistic ... if we want to be pugilistic we would have taken some of these bills and just jammed it through."" She referred to the Senate's bill as ""Mikulski-Shelby,"" giving credit to Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the ranking member. They would work it out between members. ""I don't know if we'll have a full blown, everybody see it, kumbaya, read everything,"" she said; there was a difference ""between a conversation and a conclave."" A few days later, Mikulski released the bipartisan--always bipartisan!--amendment to the bill. Funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children was increased, along with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families along with funding for civil legal services. (One of Mikulski's stock self-descriptions is that she's a ""social worker with power."") On March 12, when this came to the floor, it met the expected resistance from media-savvy spending-cutters. Arizona Sen. John McCain and Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, who regularly publish (or tweet) lists of ludicrous-sounding government programs, demanded more time with the bill. ""It wouldn't be a real bill if you two didn't offer amendments,"" said Mikulski. ""In the days when we were skeptical and even suspicious of one another, you wanted to look at it to make sure there were no cheap gimmicks, no little fast hand motions, no earmarks parachuted in. But I can say this: After the Democrats finished the bill, we gave it to Sen. Shelby and his staff. This bill has been very much scrutinized so that any of those tricks of the old days are not here ... if anyone spots something they think is a cute gimmick, I would sure like to know about it."" Mikulski parked on the floor and managed the debate. This took days, and attracted some minuscule percentage of the coverage that went to Sen. Rand Paul's drone filibuster. It ended in a win late Wednesday afternoon--63 votes for cloture, nine of them from Republicans. A reliable group of moderates and appropriators had come through, dreaming of a day when they could actually hash out yearly budgets instead of flat-footing between crises. ""It's not exactly the way things should be done, but it's better than the rut we've fallen into,"" said Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who voted for cloture. ""We're going to see a lot more actual appropriations activity on the Senate floor, in this Congress, than we've seen over the last four years."" Democrats, by nature more worried about stasis than the Republicans, were optimistic for the same reasons. Hacking out a bill today means, maybe, getting back to the normal budget process tomorrow. Doing that, said Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, means that the next round of budget negotiations return to ""a balanced way, instead of just trying to cut our way to deficit reduction."" ""Once you get a bill to the floor, and you get two managers who both want it to pass, things happen!"" said Levin. ""Positive things happen around here!""  It had just been so long since a budget meant anything but ""messaging."" Mikulski doesn't really do messaging. When Bob Shrum was working for her 1986 campaign, and Republicans tried to stoke the rumor that she was gay, Mikulski denied it. ""There was no Ted Kennedy who ever asked me out,"" she joked to Shrum. When new hires join her staff, they get a green card describing ""BAM's Principles."" Among them: We cannot always guarantee an outcome, but we can guarantee an effort.
 Always be clear about: ""What is the objective we seek?""
 Goals should be specific, immediate and realizable.

The Republican National Committee is testing this theory. The RNC ""autopsy"" on the 2012 election is a bracing critique. Formally known as the ""Growth and Opportunity Project,"" its authors say that at the national level, Republicans turn off all but the most faithful. It sharpens its critique by quoting focus groups of former Republicans who described the party as ""scary,"" ""narrow minded,"" ""out of touch,"" and as the party of ""stuffy, old men."" If they admit it all now, and fast, they'll be on the road to recovery in time for 2016 Unless Republicans broaden the base of the party by reaching out to minorities, women, and young voters in new ways, says the report, ""it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future."" Do you disagree? If you do, it might be because you're cocooned in a party that has become expert in ""how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people"" but has long lost the ability to persuade anyone who isn't already an elephant-pin-wearing member. The 100-page document, compiled by veteran Republican operatives, including Henry Barbour and George Bush's press secretary Ari Fleischer, lands (thump!) in the middle of a raucous debate.* What does the Republican Party stand for? How much must it change? Who knows the way out of the wilderness? Is it the noble but undisciplined grassroots, or the professional class of strategists, pollsters, and operatives? For three days last week, at the Conservative Political Action Conference, movement conservatives lashed out at the consultants and establishment toadies who have sold out their cause by watering down conservatism. And as if on cue--affirming their every fear--the RNC produced this report. On almost every issue the report addresses--minority outreach, the primary schedule, and the importance of quantitative analysis over conservative gut checks--the RNC autopsy reads like the party establishment's manual for reasserting its control over the party. What makes this moment in Republican politics so fascinating is that the central issues of political life are up for grabs. What do people want from their government? What should the government try to be--something that helps them with their problems or something that gets out of the way and lets them lead their lives? The answer of course is both, but the Republican Party is having difficulty finding the balance. Forces that once bound them together are disintegrating. President Obama is no longer a unifying enemy and the GOP has no clear and obvious future frontrunner to show them the way. The issues are familiar and date back to the origin story of the modern GOP. ""I am impatient with those Republicans who after the last election rushed into print saying, 'We must broaden the base of our party,' "" said Ronald Reagan in 1975. ""What they meant was to fuzz up and blur even more the differences between ourselves and our opponents."" That same sentiment is alive today among conservatives who are apt to read the report's call for a ""more welcoming conservatism,"" as an attempt to water down ideology that should be celebrated. Rand Paul wants to modernize the Republican Party, too. He called it ""stale and moss-covered"" last week at CPAC. His political pitch is very similar to Reagan's from long ago. The voters to reach for are the ones who have become disgusted by politics and don't even bother to vote. So, offer them a clear choice. ""If we are going to have a Republican Party that can win, liberty needs to be the backbone of the GOP,"" he said. ""There are millions of Americans, young and old, native and immigrant, black, white, and brown, who simply seek to live free, free to practice their religion, free to choose where they send their kids to school, free to choose their own health care, free to keep the fruit of their own labor, free to live without government constantly being on their back."" The new RNC strategy document is moving in the other direction. It argues against the constant talk of cutting spending and argues that GOP candidates should support a more activist vision of government. ""To people who are flat on their back, unemployed or disabled and in need of help,"" say the authors, ""they do not care if the help comes from the private sector or the government--they just want help."" (The dreaded pollsters have support for this notion). When talking about trying to attract more women voters, the report cites the liberal Center for American Progress as an authority. CAP's poll said the second most important issue for women voters in 2012 was choosing ""a candidate who will fight for them."" The report continues: ""Our candidates, spokespeople and staff need to use language that addresses concerns that are on women's minds in order to let them know we are fighting for them."" Paul is making a case for how his principle can be good politics. The RNC report starts by reading the political landscape and then fitting the politics on that slope. But that doesn't mean surrendering one's principles, argue the report's authors. They have a model for the kind of politically savvy conservatives who have found a synthesis between principle and electoral success: the GOP's 30 elected governors. When Scott Walker talks about fighting for the middle class, it doesn't sound conspiratorial. ""People in the middle need to feel that someone is fighting for them. They want someone who will fundamentally look out for them as a voter."" The authors of the report say they are not a policy committee, so while the report is very specific about the need to hire more female spokespeople, demographic sensitivity courses for candidates, and a program to train ethnic conservatives, it is silent on what kinds of policies might actually appeal to the groups the GOP needs to target. That makes the suggestions often feel unreal. It's much like my plan for being a successful novelist. It includes millions of readers and sold-out book events in big cities across the land. That's all fine, but I'm just not sure how to write the book. The authors say the GOP is woefully out of touch with younger voters and that those voters care about civil rights. What they're talking about is greater support for same-sex marriage, but they dare not speak its name. One policy idea is too electorally important to ignore, however. ""We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,"" write the authors. ""If we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only."" They argue that Hispanic voters will not open their ears to hear other GOP policies if this impediment is not removed. This fact is considered such an accepted truth it is presented with no evidence. The mix between principle and political expediency is a strange alchemy, and it takes place inside the hearts and minds of the politician (those who have both). What movement conservatives are worrying about is that the Republican Party establishment is institutionalizing the GOP's capitulation on core beliefs by setting up rules that discourage the grassroots and empower the consultants. That's what was behind the repeated attacks on strategists at this year's CPAC. ""Now is the time to furlough the consultants and tune out the pollsters!"" said Sarah Palin. ""Send the focus groups home and toss the political scripts because if we truly know what we believe, we don't need professionals to tell us!"" Conservatives are right to be suspicious of an overreliance on numerology. It is a favorite tool of the professionals, not the grassroots. If the party orientation turns toward hitting certain targets among voter groups like Hispanics, Asians, and women, the strategists and number crunchers will just try to hit those targets and make the numbers go up. It institutionalizes the political targets over principle. The report's section labeled ""campaign mechanics"" calls for an entire rewrite of the Republican playbook based on ""a new culture driven by data, technology, analytics, and personal contact."" If this happens, it will only further empower the college of political Beltway elites and encourage groupthink. Of course, grassroots heroes won't like the sound of providing data-based arguments over folk wisdom and wit. Then again, echoing the momentary passions of the crowd might sound good on talk radio but turn off the kinds of voters you need to actually win elections. The report also calls for a shorter primary season and fewer debates. The idea is to keep the party nominee from getting too bloodied during the process, thus weakening him or her for the general election. But debates and multiple contests--particularly in caucuses where long-shot candidates got to know the voters--helped insurgent candidates. The problem, say GOP donors and strategists, is that caucus contests made up of only the most ardent conservatives distort the race when a pet-rock candidate begins to seem viable. Though the results of the 2012 GOP autopsy were financed by the party, that doesn't mean they'll be adopted. Some of the structural changes will depend on votes within the Republican National Committee and the thematic changes will rely on a person who can lead the party. Right now Republicans don't have a national leader, and they probably won't until the next presidential campaign. So we won't really know whether the findings of this autopsy will survive or not, at least not until the GOP first finds itself a body. Correction, March 19, 2013: This article mistakenly named Haley Barbour as an author of the GOP report. It was Henry Barbour. (Return.)"	Why the GOP Likes Political Consultants More Than Grassroots Heroes
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/george_will_on_gay_marriage_the_conservative_columnist_s_rejection_of_the.html	"In a conservative movement seized by extremists, George Will is one of the sane ones. But his recent rejection of social science as having any role to play in the gay marriage debate is wildly off the mark. It's intellectually dishonest, scientifically ignorant, and--I'll say it--anti-gay. Will claims that reasonable people disagree about gay marriage ""because so little is known about its consequences."" He quotes a legal brief by conservative scholars affiliated with a famously anti-gay think tank that calls research about gay marriage and parenting ""radically inconclusive."" He then warns the Supreme Court--which will hear oral arguments on two gay marriage cases next week--to be wary ""about social science that purports to prove propositions ... for which there cannot yet be decisive evidence."" In other words, he suggests the value of research on gay marriage is currently zero. Suppose a group of people claim that redheads can't enter the town square because they'll drive away commerce, badly harming the economy--and then this group gets a law passed barring redheads from public spaces. To reverse the discriminatory law, they then argue, redheads must spend however long it takes to amass definitive proof that entering the town square won't cause harm (which is impossible since you can't conduct research on scenarios you won't permit). When redheads nevertheless begin to produce a growing body of research that points conclusively to the fact that their presence does not harm commerce, the law's defenders consistently reply, ""It still might; more research is needed."" That is the position Will is defending in the gay marriage debate. The very idea that gay equality would cause serious harm is the kind of belief you hold if you're already inclined to think, usually for moral reasons, that homosexuality is harmful, that is, if you're anti-gay. Otherwise, there'd be no better reason to assume gay marriage is harmful than there is from letting redheads go to market. Although the real basis of most opposition to same-sex marriage is moral, conservatives have found that arguments alleging harm to society are more powerful than ones that simply declare what they don't like to be morally wrong. So they have spent a generation making the case that gay equality would cause all kinds of social disruptions. It's exactly the same tactic that was recently proven profoundly wrong when the Pentagon lifted its ban on openly gay service despite continuous claims that doing so could destroy the military. Advocates of equality have responded by conducting research on gay families that has consistently shown such fears to be ungrounded. George Will calls this body of work ""spurious social science by supporters of same-sex marriage"" and complains that it ""purports to prove"" something that can't yet be proven. But serious scholars don't claim that social science proves gay marriage is OK. It's the other way around: Anti-gay activists dream up harms that gay equality would cause and claim social science proves it--even though they've never supplied such proof. What the most responsible advocates of gay equality claim is that social science helps dismantle conservative claims of harm and strongly suggests the kids are OK. We use the research defensively, out of necessity, because anti-gay advocates make baseless empirical predictions that we're obligated to refute. Will also gets the scientific method wrong, offering an impossibly high--and wholly incorrect--bar for what constitutes scientific proof, leaving no way for the pro-gay side to ever convince him that the bogus harms conservatives have dreamed up are unlikely to happen. He suggests that the ""scientific standard"" requires ""large random samples with appropriate control samples"" and concludes, quoting the conservative legal brief, that ""there neither are nor could possibly be any scientifically valid studies from which to predict the effects of a family structure that is so new and so rare."" But research doesn't have to use random samples to be scientific. The scientific method demands systematic analysis based on empirical observation. While large random samples are the gold standard, that doesn't mean that all other research is unscientific. It just lessens--somewhat--its predictive value. And bear in mind that even the largest research studies on public policy issues only offer predictions, not guarantees, about future outcomes. The difference here is one of degree. What does the social science actually tell us? Statistics on marriage rates show consistently that they have not dropped in states and countries that allow gay marriage, as examined in Slate. But since gay marriage is so new, so are these results, and no one ever promised civilization would end in a day. The bulk of the controversy surrounds research on gay parenting. At least 45 scholarly studies have compared children of gay and straight parents and found no disadvantages to the former. It's true that many have small, nonrandom sample sizes--often about 30-50 families. But when you aggregate 45 consecutive studies--even small ones--that all reach the same conclusion, what you end up with is an almost unheard-of scholarly consensus. ""Rarely is there as much consensus in any area of social science as in the case of gay parenting,"" said Judith Stacey, the New York University sociologist who is one of the deans of gay parenting scholarship. In any event, not all the studies are small or nonrandom. A 2010 Stanford study used census data, instead of a convenience sampling or self-reporting, to examine 3,500 children of same-sex couples. It compared their school progress to more than 600,000 kids of straight parents and found no differences. Other studies are ""longitudinal,"" increasing statistical reliability by tracking developments over many years. The longest-running and largest such study, the U.S. National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study, followed 78 lesbian-headed households for more than 25 years. Led by Nanette Gartrell, a UCLA-based psychiatrist and researcher, the study found no disadvantages (and a few advantages) to children with lesbian moms. Is there any research showing disadvantages for kids with gay parents? Try as they might, conservative scholars, often funded by anti-gay think tanks, have failed to produce a single study. In the most embarrassing recent effort, University of Texas professor Mark Regnerus was formally reprimanded for publishing a study (which he wrote about for Slate) that he claimed had a massive sampling pool; in reality the number of children of same-sex couples he surveyed was a whopping two. (Last week it was reported that conservative funders bankrolled the study and urged Regnerus to rush it to maximize its influence on the Supreme Court.) Whatever you may say about the limits of the gay parenting studies--and all research has limits--the pro-gay research is currently winning, 45-0. Absent actual evidence, the religious right has routinely used studies of single-parent and divorced households to allege that any family lacking a father--that is, even if it has two loving moms--is bad for kids. They cite research showing that two parents are better than one, and since all that research has focused on opposite-sex parents, they conflate number with gender and rally around the talking point that kids need ""a mother and a father."" Appallingly, George Will has now stooped to this level, citing the allegation of conservative scholars that ""research concluded that growing up without fathers had significant negative effects on boys,"" even though that research never included households with two gay parents--and this after complaining about ""inappropriate invocations of spurious social science"" by liberals. None of this should matter. Even if gay parenting did disadvantage kids, it wouldn't follow that gay marriage should be banned since gay people--like single and divorced people--will have kids no matter what. How could banning gay marriage help those--or any--kids? And if we based straight marriage rights on predicting durability, half the country wouldn't be allowed to wed. But the research does matter, because conservatives have made it matter, and it may very well influence the Supreme Court. It's true we don't know everything about gay marriage and parenting, but what we do know is important to get right."	Is George Will Homophobic?
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/derek_khanna_the_young_republican_lost_his_job_in_the_house_for_having_the.html	"The Republican Party's future is sitting in the dark. It's early Thursday morning, the start of the Conservative Political Action Conference, and Derek Khanna is somewhere in the shadowed media corner to the far left of the main stage. As Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey talks about the 2012 election, and how Republicans ""never had an alternative, compelling narrative,"" I find the 25-year-old Khanna in front of a laptop, tweaking some remarks about the balanced-budget amendment, fitfully paying attention to the noise from the podium. ""It's typical flag-waving stuff,"" he says. ""Apart from Cuccinelli--Cuccinelli was surprisingly interesting."" Ken Cuccinelli, the Virginia attorney general and candidate for governor, had given a pretty basic campaign speech to a crowd built to adore him. What impressed Khanna was Cuccinelli's moderate twist. ""Conservatives should lead the campaign to changing the culture of corrections in America,"" Cuccinelli had said. Too many of his peers were ""excited to lock people up and throw away the key."" That was what Khanna wanted: Republicans talking about something new, tricky, important, even somewhat boring. Four months ago, while working for the House Republican Study Committee, Khanna put out a memo on the deeply un-sexy topic of copyright law. Intellectual property rights, wrote Khanna, were viewed as pure capitalism, when they should be treated as a government monopoly at its worst. The memo was retracted; Khanna was out of the RSC. David Brooks was merely the most famous pundit heralding Khanna as a brave new wonk, punished for an idea that ""differed from the usual lobbyist-driven position."" We know what the people in funny hats and Palin masks do at CPAC. We know all about the holdouts--ready for study or museum display at this point--who still laugh at Ann Coulter's jokes. We know that William Temple, the ""Tea Party patriot"" who dresses in revolutionary-era garb and carries a Gadsden flag signed by Michele Bachmann, will make his Zelig way into every photo. So what does the wise young wonk do at CPAC? Khanna is going to find out, because he's been coming here for years, as a typical young Republican. ""The [U-Mass] Amherst College Republicans would make the drive down here, every year, overnight,"" he says as we walk out of the ballroom. ""We were supposed to switch off drivers. We didn't. So when I became president of the CRs, that was my first executive play: Making somebody else drive the car."" Leaving the ballroom means entering a gauntlet of people who want your precious time--radio hosts, Tea Party News Network pundits, organizations both legendary (the NRA) and obscure, trying to bait passersby with candy or free pens. Khanna introduces me to his roommate, Chris Thomas, who's repping a consumer rights group called Fan Freedom, devoted to unwinding the regulations that cover ticket sales. ""We just had a good hearing in Minnesota,"" he says, and he hands me a brochure with the Fan Freedom logo of a righteous fist grabbing a ticket and some equally righteous slogans: We believe we have the right to buy, give away or sell tickets however we choose, anytime we choose, in any way we choose, at any price we choose. Khanna leads me toward the escalators that lead to the rest of the exhibits. We run into a friend, a current College Republican, and Khanna ribs her for picking the wrong candidate in 2012. ""I worked for Santorum,"" she admits, ""because I didn't like anyone else."" ""You worked for him because he's awful!"" says Khanna. She has to take a phone call about her upcoming internship with Sen. Marco Rubio; Khanna takes the opportunity to wonder whether his unlocked phone will get him arrested at a congressional hearing on unlocking. It's a rare note of pessimism, because this has been a pretty solid week for his issues. Sen. Rand Paul's filibuster on drone policy, for example, that revealed GOP enthusiasm for something the media didn't know how to cover. ""When I was at the RSC, we put out a report on drones and included a section in there about the assassination of American citizens,"" he says. ""I have an academic article coming out--I presented it at the Atlantic Council--about how drone warfare really empowers the executive branch. I've been very concerned about that, very concerned about the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki."" We cruise through the exhibit hall quickly, stopping only for Khanna to catch up with libertarian columnist David Harsanyi (""Let's talk"") and with National Tax Foundation staffers who are excited for Khanna's upcoming panel. ""I'm talking about a balanced-budget amendment that originates in the states,"" he says. ""Phyllis Schlafly's talking tomorrow, right?"" asks the tax staffer, next to a mini putting green decorated with suggestions for possible spending cuts. ""For some reason, she's opposed to that."" ""Oh, it would be great if she took us on in her speech!"" says Khanna. We hear a short spiel for RedStateDate.com, ""the only online dating site that perfectly blends love and politics,"" and then we head toward the ballroom. Khanna spots Judson Phillips, who was, for a little while, the most powerful Tea Party activist in the country. It was Phillips who convened the Tea Party National Convention in Nashville three years ago, the one that featured Sarah Palin's first ""major speech"" since she quit her Juneau day job. ""We've got to keep talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" says Phillips. The 25-year-old and the Tea Partier talk about the need to educate Congress, and about Phillips' Jerry Garcia tie, and then Khanna has to go to his speech. ""Derek's going to do big things,"" says Phillips. ""The people who threw him under the bus will rue that day."" They could have predicted it. Khanna wasn't a particularly starry-eyed young conservative. ""I was in the room at CPAC 2008, when Mitt Romney dropped out of the race,"" he says. ""I was devastated. Everyone I was with was devastated. John McCain was the next speaker on the schedule. So I went back in the room and my friends [who supported Romney] were like--Are you serious? Already?"" The showiest moment in his old College Republican days was a ""filibuster"" to save the conservative newspaper on campus. He thought the paper was idiotic; he just didn't want to see it shut down because it offended people. Khanna gets collared for a Tea Party News Network interview, then heads in for his speech--""It'll be boring."" He's the youngest panelist on a subject with no dissenters present: Does America need a balanced-budget amendment? The debate, such as it is, pits the people who want states to pass the amendment first with the people who want it to come out of Congress. The Congress-first side is represented by Lew Uhler, a Robert Loggia lookalike who's led the National Tax Limitation Committee ever since Ronald Reagan asked him to 41 years ago. ""You're too young to have been fighting this fight in the mid-1980s,"" says Uhler, reminding Khanna of how an old campaign failed. ""This was down and dirty."" ""With all due respect,"" says Khanna, ""if there was enough support in the 1980s to get it to 33 states, when the debt was at $2.5 trillion, I believe we can get it to 34 states today."" That's the end of his official duties. Khanna meets up with friends, en route to lunch. While he waits, college Republicans zero in on the well-spoken young guy who just got his face on C-Span. I'm the assistant vice chair of the Catholic University CRs ... Any time you can come to Grand Rapids, we'd love to have you ... Khanna shakes hands with a kid wearing a three-piece suit, Constitution in the vest pocket, and joins the crew as they trek to the convention village's restaurants. The ""truth truck,"" a vehicle bedecked in horrific pictures of abortions, is parked in front of the piano bar. ""That's disgusting!"" says one of the young Republicans. ""Ugh! I thought it was a food truck,"" admits another. The crew settles on Nando's, a chicken place renowned for its spicy sauces. Everybody orders sauce-less chicken wraps; Khanna talks about the need to kill Sen. Patrick Leahy's version of cellphone unlocking rules. The rest, students and recent grads, get caught up on the controversy of the conference, the way that the gay Republican group GOProud was barred from opening a booth. They ended up scoring a sneaky invitation from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a panel about gay rights in a too-small room, at an undesirable time. ""I've been telling everyone to go,"" says Khanna. Then it's back to the main conference rooms, with plenty of time to catch a panel ostensibly about whether Republicans need to ""shoot all the consultants."" On the way, Khanna is stopped again, by a PR consultant who saw CNN reporters in need of interviews. ""You'd be perfect,"" she says. ""Under 30, smart, handsome, and""--she whispers--""not white."" Khanna laughs politely, because she's not wrong. His family emigrated from India decades ago. Half of the official chatter at this conference is about how the party has alienated voters who aren't white and straight and male. When I ask about the need for that GOProud panel, he says ""I'll give you a quote,"" and composes himself to give an answer that could survive vetting by a focus group. ""My family, they came to the United States in the '60s,"" he says. ""I worry about other immigrants, in similar positions, when they see a party that excludes a group like GOProud. The perceived lack of inclusion of gay people might become a perceived lack of inclusion of Hispanics, of Asians."" Khanna finds the panel, entering just as Pat Caddell--who's only referred to as a Democrat when he's pitching columns--finishes a rant about how the conservative base was scammed. ""Mitch McConnell is the Admiral Burnside of politics!"" he says. ""The grassroots needs to hold them accountable, and you didn't!"" Jeff Roe, a Missouri strategist, rises to give a modest defense of consultants. Hating the consultant for the failure of the candidate is like hating your wife because you're too lazy to diet. Conservative voters don't go online. Liberals live online. ""They date online."" ""That was before RedStateDate,"" whispers Khanna. When the consultant panel ends, a busier panel about the youth vote takes its place. Khanna deals with it the same way: Polite listening, frequent use of his smartphone, sarcasm when it's called for. The umpteenth youth representative insists that the GOP merely needs a new ""narrative""--then the Obama kids will come running. ""How about better tech policies?"" whispers Khanna. That's almost enough sitting and listening for a day. Khanna hits the GOProud panel, packed far beyond fire department standards, and sticks around to catch up with the panelists. They all know him. The guy whose wonkery outsmarted the House GOP is a good ally, now or when, as GOProud's Jimmy LaSalvia says, ""he takes over."" I stay out of Khanna's way for a few hours, as he and a new crew of Republicans venture back into the restaurant quarter. Shortly after 10 p.m. I find him again, at the ""Millennial Party"" that's taken over a bar called the Public House. It's one of those crowds that proves the laziness of Stephen Glass--why did he have to fabricate a group of young Republicans in Sunday clothes, downing shots and pumping fists? The last time I see Khanna, he's singing along to ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" as a man staggers past him, drinking beer out of a glass large enough to host a Bonsai tree. The next morning, Khanna emails me about a panel titled ""Internet freedom vs. Intellectual Property: What is the conservative view?"" A friend had told him it would ""highlight the myths you raised in your RSC paper."" ""I'm stopping by this,"" he says. ""I don't know if it would be of interest."""

When my son offers to do the dishes, I know I'll find something broken somewhere in the house soon enough. When an email from a distant acquaintance starts on a chatty note, I prepare for the Big Ask. In only the most well-adjusted marriages would a spouse's surprise gift of flowers not stir the least bit of suspicion in their mate. So it is only fitting that Republicans are suspicious of President Obama's warming trend. One minute he's dismissing us and the next he's picking up the tab for dinner? In short, goes the theory, Obama's charm offensive is a trap. The president is putting on a good face for the public in order to set up his opponents for the 2014 elections. When no budget deal is reached, the president will be able to say that he tried but the Republicans rebuffed him and should be thrown out of office. This suspicion would be natural in a normal relationship, let alone one as poisoned as the relationship between the president and the GOP. But to stay intact this theory must survive at least two challenges. It misunderstands President Obama's ambition (he cares more about his legacy than he does Congressional Democrats) and it suggests Obama learned nothing from his first several years in office when he attempted the strategy Republicans are accusing him of, and failed. We know this much about Barack Obama: He is ambitious. When advisers wanted to go for a more modest health care bill in his first term, he pushed for Obamacare, citing his desire to do big things. We also know presidents think about their legacies in the second term. Republicans have long argued that the president's ego is as large as the national debt. If you map out his DNA, it reads: me, me, me. So, what is likely to win the president greater glory in the history books: a grand bargain that leads to a healthy economy or the return of a Democratic House majority? The president and his advisers believe that a grand budget deal would help an economy that is poised to take off. Recent economic data, including February's strong jobs numbers, confirm their view that economic conditions are on the upswing. If the president can contribute to fixing the budget mess, consumers and companies will spend more and the economy will blossom. The president would be able to claim he revived the economy after the worst downturn since the Great Depression. A grand bargain would also allow him to say that even though everyone thought Washington was broken, he was able to forge a deal that tackled a problem people tell pollsters they care the most about. Now, let's consider the glory associated with the outreach-as-trap theory. If the endgame were to win the 17 Democratic seats necessary for Democrats to take  control the House--a few seats won't do--that would be an accomplishment, but not really one to light up the history books. More important, it wouldn't reflect direct glory on Obama. Also, this electoral strategy doesn't do anything to address the economy. The president and his advisers think these budget clashes keep a lid on growth; if the president were to go this route, Obama would be resigning himself to a legacy in which the Obama economy is remembered as constantly struggling. Also, I've had a lot of conversations over the years with Democratic operatives who have regularly complained that Obama cares more about himself than fellow Democrats. If he's now adopting a Congress-first strategy, it would represent a significant change in character, especially for a second-term president. But wait, what about the theory of two months ago that Obama wanted to destroy the Republican Party? The truth at the center of that theory is still the same: Obama is ambitious. What has changed is the tactic. During the post-election budget fights, the president had more leverage than he does now. He'd just thrashed Mitt Romney and polls showed that voters preferred his ideas to Republican ones. He decided to work that advantage by pressuring Republicans right out of the gate. He pressured them in the fiscal cliff negotiations and debt ceiling fights, and he succeeded. He tried again in the battle over sequestration and it didn't work. The across-the-board cuts took place and the president's approval numbers and advantage over Republicans dropped with it. The tactic failed, but the ambition remains. So he's changing tactics on the budget from pressure to outreach. That's just what the president wants you to think, say the skeptics. They know the truth, and they have a White House leak to prove it. In a recent National Journal article, an anonymous White House adviser told Ron Fournier that the president's slap and tickle with Republicans is a sham. ""This is a joke. We're wasting the president's time and ours. I hope you all (in the media) are happy because we're doing it for you."" The minute this quote hit the Internet, I got two emails from House Speaker John Boehner's office and the Republican National Committee put out a press release. On Twitter, a variety of Republicans cited it as proof for a variety of claims. ""Is the president serious about a grand bargain?"" asked Karl Rove. ""WH adviser gives us our answer."" What are we to make of this? First, when a former White House adviser who once decried anonymous quotes cites an anonymous quote as holding a singular truth, you should be suspicious. Second, when someone tries to tell you one anonymous quote is the truth while ignoring what appears just one skinny line space away, that person is treating you like an idiot. In the next sentence, Fournier quotes another White House source who claims the president is sincerely reaching out to Republicans. The most plausible interpretation of the blind quote based on my conversations with administration aides is that there are those in the administration who think trying to negotiate with Republicans is a joke because the GOP will never cooperate in the end, not because the president is engaged in a deliberate sham. The more on the record version of this is ""we're not naive about the chances for a grand bargain."" Still, White House press secretary Jay Carney was trying to clobber the anonymous notion in his Tuesday press conference: ""I have no idea who said that, but I can tell you that opinion has never been voiced in my presence, in the president's presence, in the West Wing. It does not represent the president's view, it does not represent the White House's view, and it does not represent the administration's view."" Fortunately, as a thinking member of the electorate, you don't have to adjudicate whether the anonymous source represents metaphysical truth. Whether the president thinks his efforts to reach out to Republicans are a joke or not is not that relevant. His sincerity about a specific tactic used to reach the grand bargain doesn't speak to whether he's sincere about the grand bargain itself. The president can think that the outreach strategy is a joke but that some other strategy might work. We don't know. Furthermore, being skeptical that a strategy will work doesn't undermine the enterprise. Many Republican lawmakers, for example, are highly skeptical that Obama is serious. They don't trust him. They think working with him is a joke. But it doesn't follow that they are less committed to a grand budget bargain. Politicians engage in activity all the time that either they or their staff thinks isn't likely to amount to much. That is a key requirement of politics--to engage in activity you find meaningless, suspicious, and silly--because it helps you to reach a larger goal. (I am certain that even Karl Rove did this at least once when he worked in the White House.) One high-profile example of this truth about the disconnect between your public acts and private motivation was Mitch McConnell's statement in 2010 that his single most important job was to make Obama a one-term president. For Democrats, what McConnell said was a revealing truth, the way this anonymous White House aide is speaking the truth for Republicans. Republicans defended McConnell, saying his remark wasn't a sign the Republican Senate leader had totally thrown over his duty to the people for political gain. Of course Mitch McConnell wanted Barack Obama to be a one-term president. It's not the kind of thing you are supposed to say out loud if you are adhering to the traditions of the Senate, maybe, but that's a matter of etiquette. When McConnell uttered those words it didn't tell us anything new about McConnell's underlying posture. He was going to try to thwart the president until either his view of the public interest or his personal ambition told him to do otherwise. That's the natural state of things. We'd like it to be different, but it isn't. Despite McConnell's view, he still participated in a number of agreements with the president on the debt ceiling, funding the government, and extending the payroll tax cut. Republican lawmakers who will be up for re-election in 2014 will have to decide soon whether President Obama is being honest about wanting to work on a big deal or laying a trap. One fact that they might include in their thinking is that the tactic of outreach-as-trap is not very effective. The fact that they are still in office reflects this truth. Obama tried throughout 2009 and 2010 to paint Republicans as unreasonable. In 2010, Republicans retook the House. In 2012, Republicans held on to the House despite the president running the exact playbook they accuse him of running now with a general election electorate filled with more sympathetic swing voters. In 2014, the president will face the ""six-year itch,"" which Charlie Cook reminds us today is never good for presidents. The president's party has lost five of the last six such elections, forfeiting an average of 29 House seats and six Senate seats. It's possible the president is recycling this strategy in a bad historical environment, but it's more likely that he isn't going to risk his legacy on a failed gambit without trying something else first. If the long-shot attempts at a grand bargain break down, Obama will no doubt attack Republicans in 2014 with fervor, but it will be part of a political and legacy salvage operation. If his ambition is still intact, it's possible that he might first want to pursue a strategy that adds to his greatness, rather than a long-shot strategy that at best gets him a few rays of reflected glory."	Why Obama's Outreach to Republicans Is All About Obama
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/barack_obama_promised_transparency_the_white_house_is_as_opaque_secretive.html	"President Obama has failed to deliver on few promises as miserably as his vow to create a more transparent and open government. Shortly after being sworn into office, he sent a memo to federal agencies promising, ""We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration."" At the time, I was a staffer on the Senate Finance Committee for Republican Charles Grassley and couldn't help but laugh. Before I worked on Capitol Hill, I was a reporter and broke a story about how Bush administration officials had silenced federal scientists who had tried to speak up about climate change after Hurricane Katrina. I based the article on documents and email messages I had uncovered through the Freedom of Information Act. Even though the Department of Commerce handed over the emails, I was disappointed to discover that portions of them had been illegally redacted to hide the involvement of specific political appointees. After seeing years of heavy-handed secrecy and incessant White House claims of national security to hide the ball from Congress, I supported President Obama's efforts to clean things up and restore some balance. But like most reporters, I am suspicious of these types of promises, especially from politicians. Regardless of who occupies the White House, I understand that power wants power. Scrutiny just gets in the way. President Obama is no different. Whether it's responding to Congress, media questions, or FOIA requests, this administration is no better than its predecessor. The big difference: Obama is a Democrat. And because he is a Democrat, he's gotten a pass from many of the civil liberty and good-government groups who spent years watching President Bush's every move like a hawk. No one knows this better than John Kiriakou, the CIA agent who reported to federal prison two weeks ago for blowing the whistle on the agency's use of torture. During an interview at an Arlington, Va., coffee shop, Kiriakou said the time has come for Washington watchdog groups--organizations like Public Citizen, Project on Government Oversight, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and others--to admit that President Obama hasn't come close to making good on his promise to make government more transparent and accountable. ""Dan Ellsberg. He called me again last night,"" said Kiriakou, referring to the man who in 1971 leaked the Pentagon Papers and opened the world's eyes to the United States' long involvement in Vietnam. ""We talk about this all the time. He keeps asking me, 'Where is the outrage? If this were a Republican administration, people would be in the streets, right? We would be marching in the streets. But people cut Obama a break to the point of irrationality.' "" Indeed. Soon after he was sworn into office, Obama appointed an ""ethics czar"" named Norm Eisen, a successful attorney, who had been one of the president's classmates at Harvard Law School and later became a major fundraiser to his campaign. Eisen was likely handed the ethics portfolio for a specific reason: He was steeped in the world of Washington watchdogs. (Eisen is one of the co-founders of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW.) With Eisen on board, the administration was able to make cosmetic changes and neutralize harsh disapproval with a classic Washington maneuver--inviting potential critics to the White House for meetings. The administration understood that many of these groups would be satisfied by getting meetings with the ethics czar, and would calculate that if they became too critical of the president that their newfound ""access"" would be in peril. So the watchdogs have scampered up to the White House time and again, hopeful that maybe with the next election, the next initiative, maybe even the next meeting, something would change. The most absurd example came a couple years ago when a group of Washington watchdogs went to the White House to give the president a ""transparency"" award, and the president refused to accept the award in public. The meeting wasn't even listed on the president's public schedule. The watchdogs shouldn't be fooled so easily. In March 2010, the Associated Press found that, under Obama, 17 major agencies were 50 percent more likely to deny FOIA requests than under Bush. The following year, the presidents of two journalism societies-- Association of Health Care Journalists and Society of Professional Journalists--called out President Obama for muzzling scientists in much the same way President Bush had. Last September, Bloomberg News tested Obama's pledge by filing FOIA requests for the 2011 travel records of top officials at 57 agencies. Only about half responded. In fact, this president has prosecuted more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than all prior administrations combined. And an analysis released Monday by the Associated Press found that the administration censored more FOIA requests on national security grounds last year than in any other year since President Obama took office. Even when members of his own party ask questions, the Obama White House throws down an iron curtain. After demanding answers about the government response to the BP oil spill, Democratic Arizona Rep. Raul M. Grijalva sent a long letter to Obama expressing disappointment with the ""unjustifiable"" redactions he received, ""including entire pages blacked out in the middle of pertinent e-mail conversations."" One of the most glaring examples of Obama's failure on transparency is his response to the ""Fast and Furious"" fiasco--the botched attempt by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to find Mexican drug lords by tracking guns smuggled from the United States into Mexico. The debacle came to light when ATF whistleblowers met with investigators working for Sen. Grassley. Grassley sent a letter to the Department of Justice demanding answers; not realizing Grassley already had documents that laid out the operation, officials at Justice responded with false and misleading information that violated federal law. When Grassley pressed the issue, the Justice Department retracted its initial response but refused to say anything more, which has resulted in multiple hearings and subpoenas. The storyline is classic Washington: Whistleblowers run to Congress about bad behavior; Congress demands answers; the White House throws up a wall. But where is the outrage, especially from the very groups who are supposed to be holding the government accountable? It doesn't exist. Writing about Fast and Furious for the Huffington Post, Danielle Brian of the Project on Government Oversight mused whether the entire inquiry being led by Republicans was merely ""partisanship"" run amok. Wouldn't it have been more logical for her to ask why Democrats hadn't joined Republicans in demanding that the White House respond? Such a poor grasp of the facts could be caused by the involvement of Rep. Darrell Issa, who was ordered years ago by the Republican leadership to turn the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform into a war machine against the White House. However, in this case, Issa was in the right. As the administration continued to insist they had no involvement or knowledge of the ATF program, Issa released several Fast and Furious wiretap applications with signatures of top Justice Department officials. Rather than attacking the administration's stonewalling, Melanie Sloan, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, attacked Rep. Issa for releasing the sealed documents. Never mind that every investigative committee releases sealed documents. (I cannot tell you how many times my Senate Finance Committee colleagues and I released documents that were under seal.) It's how Congress functions and does its job. However, CREW's close ties to ethics czar Eisen might explain why Sloan was so quick to go on the partisan attack. Tired of stonewalling, House Republicans threatened Attorney General Eric Holder with contempt, forcing Obama's hand. In 2007, presidential candidate Obama told the Boston Globe, ""My view is that executive privilege generally depends on the involvement of the president and the White House."" He must take a different view of it now, as Obama declared executive privilege to protect the Department of Justice as well, compelling the House to vote for contempt. Most Americans don't care about arcane legal battles over separation of powers between the White House and Congress. On election night, it was obvious that the issue had not resonated outside right-wing media circles. When it became clear that Obama was going to win, an employee with one of Washington's watchdogs tweeted, ""Now am I allowed to criticize Obama on drones & assassination & military commissions & secret memos expanding secret surveillance powers??"" Maybe it's a bad joke, but the implication is that she and her cohort had been withholding criticism of the president until it became clear that he had beaten Mitt Romney. The ATF whistleblowers who brought the issue to Congress faced years of harassment from their agency but were ignored by Washington's collection of good-government groups, who typically rally around whistleblowers. Only the Washington Times reported that Agent Peter Forcelli later resolved his disputes with the agency. After the election, Agent John Dodson was also cleared of any wrongdoings and was even praised by the ATF for taking the ""courageous step of going to Congress to ensure that the public learned of the flawed tactics used in Operation Fast and Furious."" Only Fox News covered the matter. Kiriakou says that it's time for people to acknowledge the facts about the Obama administration's attitude toward whistleblowers and transparency in general: ""I think these groups are stuck in a 2008 mentality where, 'Oh my gosh, we have President Obama. He is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, and he's promised greater transparency, and he really wants to do that but he just can't yet. It will come. It will come. We should trust him.' "" The occasion is not yet ripe for many in Washington to admit that the Obama administration is no different from those who have come before it. But time will come when the cognitive dissonance between what Obama says and what he does will be too much. ""We should judge him by his actions,"" Kiriakou says. Hopefully, it won't take another four years."	Is the Obama Administration the Most Secretive and Opaque Yet?   
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/daily_currant_satire_the_fake_news_website_keeps_fooling_journalists.html	"It had been weeks, weeks, since a news organization was suckered by an obvious piece of satire. We were due for another face plant, and we got it: a hot piece of Breitbart.com clickbait titled ""Krugman Files for Bankruptcy."" ""Paul Krugman, the economic darling of the left, has filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection,"" wrote Larry O'Connor. ""Apparently this Keynsian thing doesn't really work on the micro level."" It's actually ""Keynesian,"" and it doesn't, but that's not the point. The point was that O'Connor, like so many before him, had accidentally run with fake news from the Daily Currant. In nine short months, the Web publication has fooled people into thinking Rick Santorum was on Grindr, that Michele Bachmann was going to ban falafel in public schools, and that Sarah Palin had joined Al-Jazeera. The dupe on that last story was Suzi Parker, a contributor to the Washington Post's She the People blog. ""If Parker had a shred of self-awareness, integrity, and dignity,"" wrote media watcher John Nolte, ""she would have changed the headline to 'Too Good To Check,' and under it posted an essay about how shallow, smug, bitterly angry partisanship can blind you to common sense."" Nolte is an editor at Breitbart.com. I asked O'Connor and Parker to comment on the most embarrassing mistakes they made all year and help me conduct some media autopsies. To my surprise, they both declined comment. Luckily, the Washington Post's Erik Wemple tracked down the origin of the Krugman story--a sponsored item on the Boston Globe's website published without any editor's knowledge or consent. ""Prudent Investor,"" branching out from his normal work as a Pilgrim's Progress character, cited ""Austria's Format online mag."" The bogus story, credited to the Daily Currant, was titled ""Paul Krugman Is Broke."" English-speakers shrugged and hit ""share."" Why is the Internet so easily fooled by this Satire-Magazin? Daniel Barkeley, the 28-year old who founded the site last summer, has his theories. ""We write articles that seem more real than articles you might see in the the Onion,"" he says. ""If you look at Ricky Gervais' shows, like The Office, or Armando Iannucci's shows, like The Thick of It, those are fly-on-the-wall documentaries. That's the kind of comedy I like--it's made to look real. It's funnier that way, and we think it's more intelligent that way. So I guess a byproduct of that is that you end up with parodies that people think are true."" When Barkeley says ""we,"" he means himself and one colleague. It's just two people who keep accidentally hoaxing the media. Barkeley went to the University of Oregon, then moved to Los Angeles, dreaming of a career as a comedy writer. ""It was very spur of the moment,"" he says. ""I didn't know anybody."" He switched to investment banking, went to school in France, and for his final assignment he designed a business--a satire website. One month later, the site was live. Less than a year later, Barkeley has built a ""tight but livable"" existence from online ads--a business that gets new attention, every month or so, when someone thinks a piece of satire is real. New attention, but not necessarily new traffic. ""I'm looking at the analytics,"" says Barkeley, ""and traffic isn't much higher than it was a few days ago."" The Daily Currant's faux scoops get shared at basically the same rate whether they spill into the mainstream or not. They're written in the driest possible prose. A fake source in the Onion eventually starts cursing or otherwise giving up the game. A fake source in the Daily Currant sounds completely earnest. This was about as wacky as the Krugman story got: ""The majority of his debts are related to mortgage financing on a $8.7 million apartment in lower Manhattan, but the list also includes $621,537 in credit card debt and $33,642 in store financing at famed jeweler Tiffanys and Co. ""The filing says that Krugman got into credit card trouble in 2004 after racking up $84,000 in a single month on his American Express black card in pursuit of rare Portuguese wines and 19th century English cloth."" It's funny if you realize that Krugman would never buy anything like this. But if you're inclined to hate the guy, you'll read the numbers and nod your head. In the harsh words of Gawker's Max Read, the Daily Currant's parodies are 'semi-believable political wish-fulfillment articles distinguished by a commitment to a complete absence of what most people would recognize as 'jokes.' "" And that's why people share them. Sometimes an article surges on social media because it's got a scoop that changes minds. The rest of the time, the article rockets around Facebook because it confirms what the reader already thinks and what his friends believe. For one 2011 study, two academics at the University of Pennsylvania analyzed 7,000 New York Times articles that had made it to the site's ""most shared"" list. ""Participants were less likely to share the story if they were in the high sadness as opposed to the low sadness condition,"" they wrote. ""Second, the results were similar for arousal; the high sadness condition evoked less arousal than the low sadness condition. Third, as hypothesized, this decrease in arousal mediated the effect of condition on sharing."" That's one theory, but it could explain most of the social Web. You share the picture of Abraham Lincoln next to the inspiring quote because it makes you happy. You share a paean to free speech by a Russian composer--""The Russian state is acting like a dominant male in a group of monkeys!""--because you felt inspired. You share the story about Sarah Palin being stupid because you think Sarah Palin is really stupid and refuse to let the 2008 election end already. ""After the whole Todd Akin thing happened,"" says Barkeley, ""I put up a story about how he thought breast milk could cure gay people. The Guardian contacted me and wanted to know where the video was. I said 'No, no, it was a fake.' But at least they checked, right?"""	Why Does the Daily Currant Keep Duping Journalists?
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/rand_paul_s_filibuster_on_drones_demonstrates_the_perfect_way_to_kill_a.html	"His mind restored by sleep, his bladder finally emptied, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave his first interview after a 12-hour drone-policy filibuster to an awed Glenn Beck. ""This man is going to be the logical choice for president of the United States,"" Beck told his listeners, just after 10:30 a.m. ""He is reasonable, polite, and I believe in a teaching mode right now."" Paul was telling Americans that they ""have the right to live, and to have a trial, and to have a warrant. Not just to be killed, gunned down in the streets, or in this case, killed by a drone, because this president or any president says, yeah, take him out."" The last time most people saw Glenn Beck, he was hosting a Fox News show renowned for its use of a mobile blackboard. In white chalk on black slate, viewers learned that Barack Obama was building a private army, that the government would seize private land to peg a new post-dollar currency, and that the Arab Spring was an ""Archduke Ferdinand moment"" for Marxists. That was the old Glenn Beck. The new Glenn Beck calls himself a ""libertarian"" akin to Penn Jillette. His news site and online video channel brim with stories about heroic applications of the Second Amendment (""Wanted fugitive fatally shot by gun-toting Kansas farmer""), left-wing censorship (""Do you count as an extremist 'patriot'?""), and politicians alternately heroic (Rand Paul) and vile (John McCain). Paul's filibuster became such a sensation, so fast, that it's easy to forget where anti-drone activism started. It started on the left. Last year, when Charles Krauthammer got spooked about domestic surveillance drones, he warned that he was taking the ""hard left, ACLU"" stance. If you showed up at any sizable anti-war rally since 2012, you probably saw the grey, phallic head of a papier-mache drone hoisted over the crowd. The first city councils to debate drone bans were in liberal Charlottesville, Va. and even-more-liberal Seattle. ""The request for our resolution came from the Rutherford Institute,"" says Charlottesville Mayor Satyendra Huja. That organization, based in that college town, has called Barack Obama the ""executioner-in-chief."" If you want the government to regulate or ban drones--for domestic surveillance, for warfare, for targeted killings of Americans--this is exactly how you want the politics to work. There's no scrutiny of government surveillance or warfare programs unless those programs stir up left-right paranoia. When that paranoia crests, a bill can be stopped, or a ban can squeak through. Ask the poor lobbyists for REAL ID, or ask one of the tech lobbyists who thought the Stop Online Piracy Act was going to sail through. You can't win one of these battles unless the lumpen talk radio fan thinks the government will use its powers to steal his freedom. Until this week, that was the problem facing anti-drone campaigners. One month ago, the Washington Post/ABC News poll asked voters whether they favored ""the use of unmanned, 'drone' aircraft against terrorist suspects overseas."" Eighty-three percent said they did, and 65 percent said they favored even targeted killings of American citizens. That was more than a year after a drone attack killed al-Qaida's ""YouTube preacher"" Anwar al-Awlaki and his 16-year-old son, American citizens both. Most Americans didn't worry about that. So Paul gave them something to worry about. Unless the administration said otherwise, Paul argued that it was claiming indefinite authority to execute Americans. Any American. Maybe even you. ""I don't think the president would purposely take innocent people and kill them,"" said Paul in his filibuster. ""I really don't think he would drop a Hellfire missile on a cafe or a restaurant like I'm talking about. But it bothers me that he won't say that he won't."" He invoked the shootings at Kent State in 1970, and asked whether the government could have used drones to kill Jane Fonda. A conservative who slapped a ""Not Fonda' Kerry"" sticker on his Dodge Ram nine years ago didn't hear a defense of anti-Vietnam War activists. He heard Paul, and thought about the government maybe targeting right-thinking Americans who rallied at Tea Parties. Every wave of anti-state resistance has its science fiction novel, some dystopian vision of what might happen at the bottom of the slippery slope. The ur-text of the Tea Party's anti-tax, anti-regulation campaigns was Atlas Shrugged. But the bumbling central government in that novel can't even locate a gulch full of rebel geniuses. In his filibuster, Paul invoked a different novel--1984. When he read it originally, ""we didn't have the ability to look at people and the government couldn't look at me in my house 24 hours a day."" But now, ""we have drones [that weigh] less than an ounce, presumably with cameras ... It is not impossible to conceive that you could have a drone fly outside your window and see what you're reading, to see what your reading material is. It's not impossible to say that they couldn't send drones up to your mailbox and read ... what kind of mail you're getting and where it's from."" If that's fanciful, it's no more so than the questions liberals asked about Bush-era programs like warrantless wiretapping. Americans, bless us, are quick to consider the ways our leaders put on epaulets and dark sunglasses and turn into tyrants. ""The president's got the kill list,"" said Rush Limbaugh in his own Thursday interview with Paul. ""He's bragging about it, senator! They're trying to build up his tough national security credentials."" The Limbaugh-Paul dialogue lasted longer than the dialogue with Beck. It was even more important in establishing Paul's argument in the broader conservative movement, outside of the libertarian wing. Limbaugh, without agreeing 100 percent with Paul, thanked him for representing ""the majority in this country,"" people who mistrusted government power. ""Nobody in the Republican Party has taken this guy on."" If that becomes the story, that's how drone skeptics--whether they fear for their privacy or oppose targeted killings abroad--move the needle on a debate they were losing. Paul's Thursday media tour went like a dream, but nothing he said helped him as much as the action in the Senate. Shortly before noon, Sen. John McCain and Sen. Lindsay Graham walked onto the floor for a short colloquy. The subject: Rand Paul's wrongness. McCain read from a Wall Street Journal editorial condemning ""Rand Paul's drone rant."" Graham displayed one of those low-information, maximum-impact charts that make C-Span great, contrasting the number of American territorial deaths caused by al-Qaida to those caused by drones--2,751 to zero. Had Rand Paul forgotten 9/11? Paul couldn't have asked for better enemies. Limbaugh dismissed these ""Republican establishment"" losers with a wave of his hand. ""There are a lot of people today who can't believe, literally can't believe, that the highest law enforcement officials in the country cannot, with ease, assure the American people that they will not be randomly targeted by a drone!"""	Why Drone Paranoia Might Be a Winning Issue

Tonight he's entertaining Republican senators at the swanky Jefferson Hotel. Next week, he's driving down the avenue to visit Republicans in the House and Senate separately. You may remember that shortly after the election the president declared that schmoozing the opposition was useless. At a news conference, he said that even when he invites Republicans to the White House and takes pictures with their families, ""it doesn't prevent them from going onto the floor of the House and ... blasting me for being a big-spending socialist."" Last week he talked about Republicans who wanted to paint horns on him. Behind the scenes, the Obama view of the GOP's obstructionism was even rougher. Obama's top political adviser, Dan Pfeiffer, told the Washington Post a few weeks ago: ""There's a moment of opportunity now that's important,"" Pfeiffer said. ""What's frustrating is that we don't have a political system or an opposition party worthy of the opportunity."" As recently as a week and a half ago, the president's aides were pointing to a slew of polls that showed the White House was winning budget fights handily over Republicans. The sequestration, they predicted, would put the GOP in such a pinch that Republicans would ultimately give in to the president's call for a mix of tax increases and spending cuts to avert the across-the-board sequestration cuts. It didn't turn out that way, so now the president is adapting. Since re-election, President Obama has been working on two tracks with Republicans. He has used a softer approach on issues such as immigration, education, and gun safety, but taken a tougher line on budget issues. The GOP cried uncle twice, on the fiscal cliff and over debt-limit negotiations. They didn't budge on sequestration, and the polls got fuzzier. A new CBS poll shows that 35 percent of Americans blame the president for the sequester, almost as much as the 38 percent who blame congressional Republicans. That's not a big enough margin to mobilize voters and force the GOP into a deal. So out with the roadshows and in with the chafing dishes. Obama's dinner is the second step in a process that started with phone calls to House and Senate Republicans over the last few weeks but intensified this weekend. He's trying to find a ""common sense caucus,"" as he called it. So far, the dinner list includes Sens. Kelly Ayotte, N.H.; Saxby Chambliss, Ga.; Tom Coburn, Okla.; Bob Corker, Tenn.; John Hoeven, N.D.; Mike Johanns, Neb.; John McCain, Ariz.; Dan Coats, Ind.; Pat Toomey, Penn.; Richard Burr, N.C.; and Ron Johnson, Wisc. The list was put together by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who will also attend. The GOP's actual congressional leaders are not invited to this new round of negotiations, at least not now. The president has had enough battles with House Speaker John Boehner and isn't going back to direct negotiations with him. (That's just fine with Boehner.) On the Senate side, Obama has sent Joe Biden to cut deals with Mitch McConnell in the past, but McConnell is up for re-election in 2014. The president's aides think that makes him a complicated and more unwilling partner than usual. There's also the view in the White House that perhaps the GOP leaders are not telling their Republican caucus members exactly what Obama has offered. Throughout the last few budget negotiations, a handful of Republican senators have seemed unaware of the president's actual positions. The president is now going to take his ideas to them directly. The principle topic is his desire to reach a grand budget bargain based on a deal in which Republicans agree to $600 billion or so in revenue from tax reform and Obama agrees to changes to entitlement programs. Of three possible entitlement changes cited most often--changing the formula used to calculate Social Security payments, raising premiums for wealthy Medicare recipients, and increasing the program's eligibility age--Obama has agreed to the first two. White House aides know this outreach is a long shot, but it's the best approach of all the long shots left to solve the budget impasse. Senate Republicans are more independent and compromise-minded than their Republican House counterparts. For example, 89 percent of Senate Republicans voted yes on fiscal cliff bill at the end of last year, for example, compared with 36 percent of House Republicans. If the president can win a deal in the Senate, he assumes John Boehner will be pressured into at least allowing a House vote on it. Such a measure would probably have to pass with a majority of House Republicans voting against it. If the president is going to make a deal with Republican senators, he's going to have to create a pathway for them. That will mean he has to tone down the rhetoric, particularly on blaming Republicans for every ill that might happen as a result of the sequester. Republican senators might be open to a deal, but not if the president is painting their party as a haven for the cruel and unfeeling. At least one administration aide suggests that now that the run-up to sequestration is over, the president will back off, or at least reduce, the attacks. In the end, the measure of the president's willingness to work with the other side may not be whether has them over for dinner, but whether he stops filleting them."	Obama's Schmoozing Republicans Again--Even Though He Said He Wouldn't
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/hugo_chavez_s_legacy_the_former_venezuelan_president_was_not_the_typical.html	"Even before Hugo Chavez died, he had become a ghost. A strange, unfamiliar quiet had fallen on Venezuela for weeks as people waited to hear the voice of the president who had been part of their daily lives for nearly 14 years. That's because Chavez spoke to Venezuelans constantly. In his first 11 years in office, he addressed the nation, on average, every two days. His remarks, usually improvised, typically ran more than four hours. If you add up these talks, which all radio and television stations were required to broadcast, they would amount to 54 full days. And then there was silence. Venezuelans last heard their president on Dec. 8 when he announced that he was returning to Havana for his fourth operation to treat a recurring bout of cancer. He wouldn't return to Venezuela until Feb. 18, slipping into a military hospital in Caracas in the middle of the night. (His advisers later admitted that his ability to speak had been impaired by a tracheal tube that had been inserted to assist his breathing.) Chavez had made the trip home, but he never truly returned. He was present but could not be seen. The eerie quiet was only broken with the announcement, delivered by Vice President Nicolas Maduro late Tuesday, that the 58-year-old president was dead. What has Chavez bequeathed his fellow Venezuelans? The hard facts are unmistakable: The oil-rich South American country is in shambles. It has one of the world's highest rates of inflation, largest fiscal deficits, and fastest growing debts. Despite a boom in oil prices, the country's infrastructure is in disrepair--power outages and rolling blackouts are common--and it is more dependent on crude exports than when Chavez arrived. Venezuela is the only member of OPEC that suffers from shortages of staples such as flour, milk, and sugar. Crime and violence skyrocketed during Chavez's years. On an average weekend, more people are killed in Caracas than in Baghdad and Kabul combined. (In 2009, there were 19,133 murders in Venezuela, more than four times the number of a decade earlier.) When the grisly statistics failed to improve, the Venezuelan government simply stopped publishing the figures. The political ideology Chavez left behind, Chavismo, was a demonstrable failure for the Venezuelan people, but it is not as if it ever failed Chavez himself. Despite his government's poor showing, the Comandante's platform secured him another six years in office, with a decisive 11-point victory, only five months ago. Will Maduro, Chavez's handpicked successor, and his other cronies be able to pick up where the former president left off? His successors would be in better shape if Chavez had been a typical South American strongman. But he wasn't just another caudillo who stuffed ballot boxes and rounded up his enemies. As I describe in my book The Dictator's Learning Curve, Chavez's rule was far more sophisticated than such heavy-handed regimes. Like many authoritarian leaders, Chavez centralized power for his own use. Not long after taking office in 1999, he controlled every branch of government, the armed forces, the central bank, the state-owned oil company, most of the media, and any private sector business he chose to expropriate. But Venezuela never experienced massive human rights abuses. Dissidents didn't disappear in the night, and for all Chavez's professed love for Fidel Castro, his regime was never as repressive as Castro's tropical dictatorship. And unlike Castro and many other autocrats, Chavez didn't fear elections; He embraced them. Most opposition leaders will tell you that Venezuelan elections are relatively clean. The problem isn't Election Day--It's the other 364 days. Rather than stuffing ballot boxes, Chavez understood that he could tilt the playing field enough to make it nearly impossible to defeat him. Thus, the regime's electoral wizards engineered gerrymandering schemes that made anything attempted in the American South look like child's play. Chavez's campaign coffers were fed by opaque slush funds holding billions in oil revenue. The government's media dominance drowned out the opposition. Politicians who appeared formidable were simply banned from running for office. And the ruling party became expert in using fear and selective intimidation to tamp down the vote. Chavez took a populist message and married it to an autocratic scheme that allowed him to consolidate power. The net effect over Chavez's years was a paradoxical one: With each election Venezuela lost more of its democracy. As with Che Guevara, Chavez's face may appear on T-shirts for decades to come, but Chavismo as a political project is not possible without Chavez.* As a guiding force, there was no real substance to it beyond the man at the center. What does it stand for? Populism, socialism, militarism, xenophobia, nationalism, Marxism, anti-Americanism, class warfare, Bolivarian revolution, lawlessness, corruption, financial collapse--it depends on where you stand. It was always an amalgam, never something pure, clear, or fixed. If it had any staying power, it wasn't because it helped Venezuelans build something sustainable. Again, the country is in near ruins. Rather, Chavismo served only to showcase the man who propounded it. A man whose humble origins and charismatic personality helped forge a connection with the country's poor, a population who had long been excluded from politics. A man whose style, voice, and methods were so unpredictable that it took his opponents more than a decade to even understand whom they were opposing. The question now is what will follow. According to the constitution, the government should hold new presidential elections within 30 days. If that does happen, Vice President Maduro will most likely square off against Henrique Capriles, the opposition leader who lost to Chavez last October. Despite his defeat in the last presidential polls, Capriles is a formidable campaigner who has twice defeated senior officials with close ties to Chavez in state elections. Still, if the election is held on schedule, a mixture of grief and nostalgia for the country's fallen leader will likely give Maduro the upper hand. How would a President Maduro respond to the crisis conditions he would inherit? When Chavez faced criticism for one government failing or another, his charisma and connection to voters let him lay blame at the feet of his ministers. (Chavez cycled through nearly 200 Cabinet ministers in his first 10 years.) Maduro lacks the Comandante's wit and flare. His chief quality appears to have been his willingness to do Chavez's bidding, without question. And unlike his predecessor, Maduro may not even be primarily concerned with holding the opposition in check. He will know that there are plenty of politicians from his own camp waiting to take advantage of his first misstep. All of which may spell a more insecure, paranoid, and perhaps aggressive presidential palace. Indeed, Maduro's statement informing Venezuelans of Chavez's death wasted no time in engaging in bizarre, politically charged scapegoating. ""We have no doubt, the time will come in history when we can create a scientific commission to show that Comandante Chavez was attacked with this disease,"" said Maduro on Tuesday. ""We already have plenty of clues about this, it's a very serious matter that will have to be investigated by a special committee of scientists."" Maduro also announced the expulsion of two American military attaches and accused the United States of trying to destabilize the regime. Combative words, a warning of U.S. military intervention, and oddball conspiracy theories meant to encourage suspicion and distrust were always basic ingredients in Chavez's rhetoric. The fear now is that Chavismo's blend of bravado and insecurity could swing unpredictably in the hands of whichever cronies succeed Chavez. In a country as polarized as Venezuela, having political figures tell their supporters that the people who disagree with them may be responsible for their beloved leader's demise comes dangerously close to throwing a match on a tinderbox. Caracas remained quiet on Tuesday night, but the calm may be fleeting. In the days and weeks to come, we should expect Chavez's political heirs to continue to pull pages from his songbook. But we already know that none of them can sing a tune like Chavez. Read more of Slate's Hugo Chavez coverage. Correction, March 6, 2013: This article originally misspelled Che Guevara's last name.

Lawmakers in Washington couldn't even design a sword of Damocles correctly. This is depressing, and suggests even the most basic tasks are beyond the reach of our lawmakers. As a result, a lot of people appear particularly glum, as if they gave up optimism for Lent. But what if you decided to embrace hope during the Easter season? Is there any evidence that there could be a rebirth of common sense and progress? Such a pursuit would require a degree of faith, a reliance on things unseen and a belief in hope over experience. But there have also been some more concrete developments that might at least distract you from greater despair and doubt. The first is purely procedural. This month, the president, House, and Senate will all present budgets as a part of the standard budget process. Washington getting back to its regular rhythm is no small thing. It represents a return to the central issues of the budget--taxes, spending, and investment--and distance from the blame game of sequestration politics. For Senate Democrats, who have shirked the formality of producing a budget for some time, this alone might seem miraculous. A return to normal business means there will be hearings and public debates about entitlements and closing loopholes. That might remove some suspicion from the process. The series of last-minute crisis bargaining--the holy trinity of the debt ceiling, fiscal cliff, and sequestration--make people feel like they're being taken. Yes, any grand bargain will be worked out in a small room too, but if the issues have been aired in a formal way that might raise trust in an ultimate deal. (Warning: business-as-usual also means lobbyists and 100 interest groups will pick apart 100 different elements of any deal. Still this is progress: In a time of total dysfunction, regular dysfunction is preferable.) Once the larger debate starts, the threshold questions for progress will be familiar: Will Republicans move off their no-taxes posture and will President Obama agree to changes in entitlement programs? Both are possible: Obama has endorsed entitlement changes in public and private--from raising the Medicare retirement age, to means testing it, to changing the formula for Social Security increases. Republicans agreed to $600 billion in revenue. The trick is really binding those two positions in the same deal. Republicans were absolute in their opposition to replacing the sequestration cuts with tax revenue. That could be a sign of their unwavering resistance to the idea. But it might also have been the macho Republicans were required to show to build trust for a future accommodation. GOP leaders probably needed to be a little extra macho on sequestration. Many influential Republicans believe that GOP lawmakers conceded to the president in the fiscal cliff and debt limit negotiations. In conversations with GOP aides, it was clear that their bosses believed the base wouldn't tolerate another perceived surrender. Now at least the party's leaders can refute the claim that they back down whenever Obama tries to pressure them. If there is ever going to be a grand bargain, GOP leaders will need to sell it to their rank-and-file. If nothing else, Republican leaders can make the pitch now without being shouted down. We interrupt this story with a bulletin from reality. ""We're done on revenue,"" says one GOP aide about any future deal that would include tax revenue. So whatever imagined new trust there may be among the Republican rank-and-file and their leadership is irrelevant because leaders aren't going to try to sell a deal that includes tax revenue. Pessimists have a strong case, to be sure. Republicans held out for 22 years before they voted for a tax increase two months ago, and it's a good bet they don't want to do that again anytime soon. But the same GOP aides now saying that Republicans are ""done on revenue"" once said the GOP-controlled House would never vote for a tax increase. In the end, that prediction was wrong. House Speaker John Boehner also said he wouldn't agree to any debt limit increase that didn't include an equal amount of spending reductions. That didn't come to be either. Furthermore, the GOP's position isn't really ""we're done on revenue""--it's more like ""we're done, unless the president convinces us not to be."" If the president shows willingness to give in on entitlements, enough Republicans might accept some tax increases. There is at least rhetorical openness among some Republicans to that kind of a deal. On Face the Nation, Sen. Lindsey Graham endorsed a deal where revenue gained through tax reform would go toward deficit reduction in exchange for trimming entitlements. Former Gov. Jeb Bush has said an ultimate deal could include tax revenue. The benefit of a grand bargain has always been clear to both sides. While a bigger deal means more complexity and lobbyists, it also means more ways to buy off various opponents. Some Republicans can be convinced that voting for revenue that comes from changes in the tax code is OK because those changes will make tax regulations simpler, which will in turn promote growth. Some Democrats can be persuaded that you can only save entitlements by reforming them. For many Democrats, talk of a grand bargain is another head-fake. Some Republicans may say they are open to a deal, but when the details are put forward, they'll only ask for more. That is what torpedoed negotiations in the summer of 2011 and every attempt since. One reason the rhetoric never matches up is that politicians can have it both ways. They can proclaim the desire for a compromise approach, but then raise the bar on specific measures well beyond any reasonable standard. A cynic might also point out that Sen. Graham, who faces a possible primary challenge, is going to have a lot of incentives to set a standard for entitlement reform that Obama can never meet. If you insist on being an optimist, you must believe that elections and polls mean something, but that the sequestration fight wasn't a fair test of that proposition. Polls show there is overwhelming public support for a budget agreement that includes revenue from tax increases and spending cuts. In a recent Pew poll, 76 percent of people said that the president and Congress should focus on a combination of spending cuts and tax increases to reduce the budget deficit. Just 19 percent agree with the Republican position that tax increases should be kept out of a deal. Despite a core group of Republicans who will never vote for revenue from tax increases and a smaller group of Democrats who won't vote for entitlement reform, there are enough politicians who will feel enough pressure to back a deal. The fiscal cliff, debt limit, and sequester negotiations took place in an environment cluttered by claims and counter-claims about the disasters that would result. In a more extended, slightly longer debate, the ultimate choices may be clearer and less likely to be sabotaged by histrionics. Lawmakers and the press will have less cause to get distracted. Math may finally kick in, too. If lawmakers want to tackle the deficit, after sequestration cuts, there's just not that much more you can cut out of the discretionary part of the budget to solve the problem and stay in office. You can only get deficit reduction of a significant size from the tax code or entitlements, and in a divided government that means deal making. A final grand bargain only happens if the president can build what he calls the ""common sense caucus"" in the Senate. He was on the phone with Republicans over the weekend trying to start the negotiations. The White House thinks there are enough Republican senators open to reason. The president's pitch is that while the sequester does nothing to reform entitlements, nothing to reform the tax code, and ultimately does little to reduce the deficit, the big deal the president wants cuts spending, finally takes on entitlements (though not fully), and all for the price of revenues that Boehner has put forward before. On the Democratic side, there are several senators up for re-election in conservative states who need to show that they are cutting spending and reducing the deficit. A bipartisan, group of senators might give Boehner cover to allow the House to take a vote and not require that it pass with a majority of Republicans. He's already taken that route three times since the election--on the fiscal cliff deal, Hurricane Sandy relief, and the Violence Against Women Act. Maybe this case proves the difficulty of being an optimist in Washington today better than the underlying reasons for optimism. Retaining faith requires some breath holding, self-delusion and, in the end, prayer."	Why Obama and the GOP Are Ready to Work Together
