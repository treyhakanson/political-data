Well, not really. It was somewhere near the 10th or 12th sentence, when Nominee Trump introduced his temporary state of emergency. What I made up top there, you see, was an exaggeration, done to honor the writing style of Miller: terse, efficient bursts of hyperbolic horror against coastal elites, immigrants, big business, foreign countries, multiculturalism, and other nefarious interests arrayed to exterminate working-class white men from existence. In Miller's voice, those interests are attempting to kill you, friend, and everything you love, and you should hate them. This is how Miller, technically a senior policy adviser, speaks. It is intense. It is ugly. It is frequently effective. Just as Donald Trump's speech was Thursday night. I first saw Miller on the trail in April, where he opened a series of rallies for Trump. ""His bromides are a pure distillation of white working-class resentment against the elites,"" I wrote at the time, ""and his function at Trump rallies is to get all the important information out there before Trump takes the stage and rants haphazardly about whatever's on his mind."" He understands the right-wing populist seam that Trump inadvertently struck at the beginning of his campaign better than Trump does. Though Trump would always prefer to speak extemporaneously, Papa Manafort wouldn't allow that for an occasion like tonight. So in the biggest political speech of the year--one of the generation-defining speeches in Republican politics, really--the voice we heard belonged to snarling, 30-year-old Stephen Miller, until earlier this year an aide to Sen. Jeff Sessions. For example (and I'm quoting here from the leaked text): ""But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders."" This is a Stephen Miller line. It does not merely criticize a policy of Barack Obama's. It suggests--not suggests; it says, explicitly!--that Obama sacrificed a child to pursue some pantywaist internationalist objective hazily defined as ""open borders."" It is a nonsense line soaked in blood for effect. ""Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!"" is a Stephen Miller line, and probably the most charmingly old-timey fascist construction of the speech. Miller draws deeply from nationalist rhetoric, and in nationalist rhetoric, globalism is the bad guy. This was not rhetoric you heard in mainstream party politics prior to this cycle. ""Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place"" is a Stephen Miller line. No one in mainstream Republican speechwriting would ever mention ""big business"" as among the arrayed enemies. At his best--once he's finished stacking the dismembered bodies of those murdered by the undocumented immigrant, hiding around the corner on a dark night--Miller draws an unbreakable emotional bond between Trump and his core supporters: If not Trump, we are told, there will be no one to save the average American from the globalist plan, or--and this is really what it's about--a culture that's leaving them behind. ""My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge,"" Miller wrote in the speech's best-written passage. ""It reads: 'I'm With Her.' I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: 'I'M WITH YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.' "" And then: ""I am your voice."" Trump, as we saw over the course of his interminable delivery, is a poor orator who often misses his mark, and in his speech he flubbed the line, delivering it as an afterthought, a thing that got in the way on the teleprompter. It's a clever line, though, in its way: It critiques Clinton's slogan for its narcissism by saying he is the voice of America. But it raises a terrifying possibility. If Trump's is the voice of America, that means Stephen Miller's is, too. Can you be frightened by your own voice? Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Dark, Resentful Voice Behind Trump's Speech
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/donald_trump_s_speech_was_just_another_scam.html	"CLEVELAND--Here is a line from Donald Trump's speech to the nation, delivered Thursday at the Republican National Convention. It comes early in the speech, part of his broad case that the United States is soaked in blood and rife with chaos. ""Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's 50 largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years."" At best, this is a half-truth. The federal government isn't responsible for local crime prevention, but even if it were, the national homicide rate is at a 40-year low, according to the FBI. Homicides have increased in the nation's largest cities but from low baselines unseen since the 1960s. There are still areas of high violent crime, but overall, Americans are safer now than they've been in a generation. It's not clear Donald Trump knows that. But it's obvious he doesn't care. The point is not to give the public an accurate sense of its safety. The point is to paint a picture of disorder and violence, to scare Americans into flocking under Trump's banner. And to that end, he has crafted a demagogic speech of lies, misrepresentations, and plain, unadulterated bullshit. Consider this, another ""fact"" from Trump's address: ""Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens."" This is the first of Trump's dubious assertions of immigrant crime. And it's nonsense, a ""fact"" without provenance beyond the nativist and white supremacist websites that form the fetid swamps of the internet. The truth is that unauthorized immigrants are far less crime-prone than their native-born counterparts. According to one analysis of 2010 Census data, just 1.6 percent of immigrant males ages 18 to 39 were incarcerated, compared with 3.3 percent of native-born males. According to a report from the Center for Investigative Reporting, 4 out of 5 arrests for drug smuggling on the U.S.-Mexico border involved American citizens. There is no credible analysis that shows a meaningful connection between unauthorized immigrants and violent crime or otherwise. And that's before we get to the most important fact of the immigration debate: Barack Obama has deported more immigrants than any other president before him. Or how about this assertion? ""The irresponsible rhetoric of our president, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment than, frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen."" It's ludicrous. As I've written, there's no reading of President Obama's rhetoric on race and racism--from shootings by police, like those in Ferguson and elsewhere, to shootings of police, in Dallas and Baton Rouge--to support the claim that he's ""dividing"" by race and color. And it's not borne out by the numbers. Obama's approval rating stands over 50 percent. He has overwhelming support from black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. A substantial minority of whites also back him. If there's a figure in American life who is dividing the country by race and color, it is Donald Trump, who crashed onto the national scene with a campaign of breathtaking bigotry against immigrants and Muslims, who has broadcast racist messages and deployed anti-Semitic propaganda. The whole speech was a trash heap of falsehoods. At one point, Trump claimed that Obama had almost doubled the national debt. It actually increased from $11.1 trillion to $19.2 trillion. He described an America of record unemployment and disadvantage. Even granting the decline in labor force participation, there are more Americans working now than at any point in the past 10 years, with two years of the strongest private sector job growth since the 1990s. He attacked the administration's Iran deal for giving the nation ""$150 billion"" (false). He accused Obama and Hillary Clinton of opening the United States to ""massive refugee flows"" (false) and suggested there's no screening of refugees (also false). The most egregious part of Trump's speech deals with trade. It's where he sells a simplistic story and makes outlandish, unrealistic promises to renege on and renegotiate America's trade deals. As the Economic Policy Institute explained to Greg Sargent of the Washington Post--after Trump cited EPI's work on manufacturing--Trump on trade is ""is a scam that seems to be offering a path for workers but actually just offers mostly empty boxes on trade and steers the discussion back toward the traditional corporate agenda."" Scam. This gets to the essential truth of Trump's speech. The world as described by Trump doesn't exist. The Trump as described by Trump doesn't exist. As a businessman, Donald Trump's career is defined by failure, fraud, and mismanagement. He has little knowledge of domestic and foreign affairs and shows little interest in the basic work of running a campaign, much less serving as president. Remove family members and employees from the mix, and there's no one in Trump's orbit--not ghostwriters, not business associates, not former contractors--who will attest to any of the qualities he claimed onstage tonight. The prototypical Trump story isn't the success of some municipal project; it is theft: from small businesses, from ordinary investors, from desperate students. Over the past year, Trump has harnessed and deployed bigotry and hate for political gain. He has shown himself to be erratic, intemperate, and dangerously ignorant of the world around him. Despite this, the Republican Party has elevated him with its highest honor and placed him and his authoritarian impulses within reach of the White House. Speaker after speaker at the RNC has praised Donald Trump as ""not a politician."" They are right. He is not a politician. He is a threat. And we'll all pay the price if he succeeds.

And if serious Republicans read the same paper, they must be sickened with fear--if they weren't nauseated already--that their party's presidential nominee is a threat to national security. For on the front page of the Times, in an interview on foreign policy, Trump says that, despite our treaty obligations, he would not defend NATO allies from an invasion if they haven't been reimbursing us for the cost of protecting them; that he would abandon our military bases in Asia; and that he wouldn't pressure Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to relax his crackdown because ""the world looks at how bad the United States is"" on civil liberties, too. Thursday morning, Trump spokesmen disputed the Times story, claiming that he wasn't quoted accurately. Since then, the Times has released a transcript of the full interview, and the story, it turns out, is not only accurate but even more distressing than the boiled-down story suggested. Look at the following exchange between Trump and Times reporters David Sanger and Maggie Haberman: Trump: I would prefer that we be able to continue [with NATO allies], but if we are not going to be reasonably reimbursed for the tremendous cost of these massive nations with tremendous wealth--you have the tape going on? Sanger: We do. Haberman: We both do. Trump: Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, ""Congratulations, you will be defending yourself."" Sanger reminds Trump that Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty obliges member nations to treat an attack on one as an attack on all. Trump replies, ""How is it helping us? We have massive trade deficits."" He also says, ""In a deal, you always have to be prepared to walk""--as if the 28 nations of NATO were opposing sides in a contract dispute, not members of a mutually beneficial, trusting alliance. Then comes the shocker. Sanger: Can the members of NATO, including the new members of the Baltics, count on the United States to come to their military aid if they were attacked by Russia? And count on us fulfilling our obligations-- Trump: Have they fulfilled their [financial] obligations to us? If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes. And if they haven't paid the amount that Trump considers their proper share, the answer is no. Then, to make matters specific, there's this: Sanger: I was just in the Baltic States. They are very concerned obviously about this new Russian activism, they are seeing submarines off their coasts, they are seeing airplanes they haven't seen since the Cold War coming, bombers doing test runs. If Russia came over the border into Estonia or Latvia, Lithuania ... would you come to their immediate military aid? Trump: I don't want to tell you what I'd do because I don't want Putin to know what I'd do. No! The whole point of NATO is to tell potential enemies, in no uncertain terms, that the United States and every other member-nation will respond to an attack with force. In talking about U.S. commitments in Asia, Trump reveals himself as completely ignorant about military matters. If we shut down our bases in Japan and South Korea, and some crisis compels us to move back, Trump says, ""We can always deploy"" troops and weapons from bases in the United States, adding, ""It would be a lot less expensive."" In fact, it would be a lot more expensive. It costs more to base troops at home than abroad, and it costs a lot more to deploy from home--we would need more cargo-transport planes and ships as well as the pilots, crews, and fuel to operate and maintain them. And it would take weeks, in some cases months, to mount a large deployment--possibly too long to make a difference. If Trump is elected president, and if he actually does what he says he'll do, every ally in Europe and Asia will scramble to form partnerships that do not include the United States. Some of the weaker allies will feel compelled, seeing no other choice, to cut a deal with Russia or China. Allies in every realm of international relations will view America as an untrustworthy guarantor. Trump's view of the world isn't entirely out to lunch. If he and the Republican Party were trying to prompt a debate on America's role in the world, if they were running on an avowed platform of isolationism, that would at least be taking a position. Such a debate is long overdue, and isolationism has its place as one school of thought in the American political tradition. But it's untenable for nearly every speaker at the GOP convention to lambast President Obama and Hillary Clinton for weakening our defenses, abandoning our allies, and ""leading from behind"" when the Republican candidate talks about our allies as expendable customers and prefers not to lead at all. Trump reveals himself in the Times interview as an odd combination of isolationist and mercantilist. To him, every relationship is transactional, and the transaction's currency is money--and only money. He sees alliances as a financial drain, carrying no geopolitical benefits. Geopolitics don't enter into his calculus. If a commitment costs too much, cut it loose, cut the losses, balance the books, period. Everything is a deal, and all deals are like the real estate deals that have made him a fortune. When the Times reporters ask him how he would deal with ISIS, he says that he would get the Turks to do more. When he's reminded that the Turks care more about bashing the Kurds than defeating ISIS, he says, ""It would be wonderful if we could put them somehow both together."" What's his diplomatic plan for doing that? ""Meetings,"" Trump replies. ""If I win, we will have meetings ... very early on."" One wonders: Does Trump think that President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry haven't already had ""meetings"" with Erdogan and the region's other leaders about doing more to beat ISIS? Does he think his idea is novel? This may explain why he thinks the Obama administration--the entire U.S. government--is filled with idiots. Don't they see, he might be thinking, that they have to hold meetings? He may see meetings with Erdogan and other national leaders as no different from meetings with the New York City Department of Buildings, a tenant who's behind on his rent, an indebted hotelier that he wants to buy out, or a supplier that he's trying to fleece. The fact that the world is a mess, that America isn't winning better deals, is proof to Trump that our people in power don't know how to run a slick meeting. He thinks his opponents and critics know nothing. He doesn't know how much he doesn't know. Read more of Slate's election coverage."	Trump Would Abandon Our NATO Allies. That's Crazy.

The deftness of this reversal of policy is so anomalous that we need to consider its causes, as well as its consequences. To recap: The Trump campaign showed little interest in the writing of the Republican Party platform, even as the document evolved to undermine the nominee's political strategy and took stances at odds with his own. But his aides did intervene aggressively in one committee meeting. They pushed hard to soften the platform's stance on providing military assistance to Ukraine. When pressed about this change, Trump aides literally ran in the other direction. Then, on Wednesday, Trump told the New York Times that he would abandon our nearly seven decades-old commitment to collective security in Europe. If Putin rolled tanks into Eastern Europe, Trump would have to check whether those countries paid their fair share to NATO before fulfilling our obligations to protect them. If these were sincere positions, they might be defensible. The Obama administration has been reluctant to arm the Ukrainians. There's a coherent case to be made for American retrenchment in the world. The problem is that Donald Trump and his campaign aren't staking out ideological positions. As I have argued, Trump has a long history of sucking up to Russian political leaders to advance his business interests in that country. His praise of Putin has correlated with large infusions of Russian cash into his real estate projects. Furthermore, his campaign is staffed by aides with financial ties to the Russian state. For his part, Putin has recognized the opportunity that the Trump campaign presents. He has thrown Russian propaganda behind it; his intelligence services have purloined documents from Democratic Party servers, and they have begun publishing them on the internet. And why not? Trump is Putin's geo-strategic dream. NATO has been effective at curbing Putin's military adventurism. Russia may mess around in eastern Ukraine, but it won't set foot in Estonia or Poland. That's because it has little interest in fighting a war with an alliance obligated to protect those countries. Rather than facing a resolute, unified West, he prefers conducting a negotiation with a fragmented one and has sought to destabilize Europe through support of Trump-like figures in France, Italy, and elsewhere. Nobody believes in the art of the deal more than Vladimir Putin--and in Trump, he sees a naive, egomaniac whom he can roll. Now that the subject of Putin's relationship to the Trump campaign has become part of the conversation, there are several questions that require answering. And many of these pertain to Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort. As I have reported, Manafort didn't just represent oligarchs tight with the Kremlin. He became business partners with them. He ran a private equity fund in which the aluminum magnate (and Putin pal) Oleg Deripaska invested millions. As the Washington Post has shown, this fund didn't exactly do much investing. In fact, Manafort struggled to account for the cash he received. And rather than pay back Deripaska, he apparently went underground. In 2014, Deripaska's lawyers noted, ""It appears that Paul Manafort and [his business partner] Rick Gates have simply disappeared"": Manafort's vanishing became a joke in certain Republican circles. So why has Manafort suddenly felt comfortable re-emerging into public view? How did he square his debts with Putin's ally? Another question for the campaign chairman: What are his dealings with the Kremlin? It's clear that he has advanced its interests in Ukraine, where he managed the political rehabilitation of its favored candidate, Viktor Yanukovych. He also went into business with one of the Kremlin's primary natural gas middlemen, Dmitry Firtash. To what extent did these relationships bring him into the inner sanctum of Russian power? It's a murky realm and the questions have more than the whiff of conspiracy. But the circumstantial evidence is mounting. Given that the Trump campaign seems determined to reverse decades of core American policy, policy that Putin has worked assiduously to erode, it seems foolish not to consider the dark possibilities.

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/07/vladimir_putin_has_a_plan_for_destroying_the_west_and_it_looks_a_lot_like.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. Vladimir Putin has a plan for destroying the West--and that plan looks a lot like Donald Trump. Over the past decade, Russia has boosted right-wing populists across Europe. It loaned money to Marine Le Pen in France, well-documented transfusions of cash to keep her presidential campaign alive. Such largesse also wended its way to the former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, who profited ""personally and handsomely"" from Russian energy deals, as an American ambassador to Rome once put it. (Berlusconi also shared a 240-year-old bottle of Crimean wine with Putin and apparently makes ample use of a bed gifted to him by the Russian president.) There's a clear pattern: Putin runs stealth efforts on behalf of politicians who rail against the European Union and want to push away from NATO. He's been a patron of Golden Dawn in Greece, Ataka in Bulgaria, and Jobbik in Hungary. Joe Biden warned about this effort last year in a speech at the Brookings Institution: ""President Putin sees such political forces as useful tools to be manipulated, to create cracks in the European body politic which he can then exploit."" Ruptures that will likely multiply after Brexit--a campaign Russia's many propaganda organs bombastically promoted. The destruction of Europe is a grandiose objective; so is the weakening of the United States. Until recently, Putin has only focused glancing attention on American elections. Then along came the presumptive Republican nominee. Donald Trump is like the Kremlin's favored candidates, only more so. He celebrated the United Kingdom's exit from the EU. He denounces NATO with feeling. He is also a great admirer of Vladimir Putin. Trump's devotion to the Russian president has been portrayed as buffoonish enthusiasm for a fellow macho strongman. But Trump's statements of praise amount to something closer to slavish devotion. In 2007, he praised Putin for ""rebuilding Russia."" A year later he added, ""He does his work well. Much better than our Bush."" When Putin ripped American exceptionalism in a New York Times op-ed in 2013, Trump called it ""a masterpiece."" Despite ample evidence, Trump denies that Putin has assassinated his opponents: ""In all fairness to Putin, you're saying he killed people. I haven't seen that."" In the event that such killings have transpired, they can be forgiven: ""At least he's a leader."" And not just any old head of state: ""I will tell you that, in terms of leadership, he's getting an A."" That's a highly abridged sampling of Trump's odes to Putin. Why wouldn't the Russians offer him the same furtive assistance they've lavished on Le Pen, Berlusconi, and the rest? Indeed, according to Politico's Michael Crowley, Russian propaganda has gone full throttle for Trump, using its Russia Today apparatus to thrash Hillary Clinton and hail the courage of Trump's foreign policy. (Sample headline: ""Trump Sparks NATO Debate: 'Obsolete' or 'Tripwire That Could Lead to World War III.' "") Russian intelligence services hacked the Democratic National Committee's servers, purloining its opposition research files on Trump and just about everything else it could find. They also wormed their way into the computers of the Clinton Foundation, a breach reported by Bloomberg. And though it may be a mere coincidence, Trump's inner circle is populated with advisers and operatives who have long careers advancing the interests of the Kremlin. We shouldn't overstate Putin's efforts, which will hardly determine the outcome of the election. Still, we should think of the Trump campaign as the moral equivalent of Henry Wallace's communist-infiltrated campaign for president in 1948, albeit less sincere and idealistic than that. A foreign power that wishes ill upon the United States has attached itself to a major presidential campaign. * * * Donald Trump's interest in Russia dates back to Soviet times. In fact, there's extraordinary footage of him shaking hands with Mikhail Gorbachev. It comes from 1988, the peak of perestroika and Gorbachev's efforts to charm the American public. On his legendary trip to Washington and New York, the Soviet in chief left the confines of his limousine and security cordon to glad-hand with the American people. Donald Trump suggested to reporters that the Soviet leader would be making his way to Trump Tower, a crucial station on his journey to capitalism. This was, in fact, a self-aggrandizing fabrication that Trump himself planted in the tabloids, but it was a convincing lie. A year earlier, Trump had traveled to Russia at the invitation of the Soviets. They wanted Trump to develop luxury hotels in Moscow and Leningrad to feed the regime's new appetite for Western business. ""The idea of building two monuments in the U.S.S.R. has captured his imagination,"" Newsweek reported. Trump likely reveled in the newspaper stories that reported Gorbachev's forthcoming visit to his HQ as fact. But surely even he never expected his fake story to become reality. He must have been gobsmacked when he received word that Gorbachev wanted to pay a spontaneous visit to Trump Tower. The skyscraper's namesake rushed down from his penthouse office to pay obeisance. From the video, we can see the blotched head of Gorbachev emerge from his car. Trump and his retinue push through the crowd. ""Great, great honor,"" the mogul says as he pumps the hand of the Soviet supremo. One of Trump's vulnerabilities is that he doesn't always vet his people, whether it's business partners, the dubious characters he retweets, or the foreign leaders who show up at his door. As it turns out, this Gorbachev wasn't really the Soviet leader but an impersonator called Ronald Knapp. Trump was lavishing praise on the winner of a look-alike contest. It was merely the first instance of Trump carelessly sucking up to Russian power in the hopes of securing business. Those Soviet hotel projects never went anywhere. But over the years, Trump has returned to the idea of building in Russia again and again. Effective real estate developers are genuine seers; they can conjure mental images of glorious structures and vibrant neighborhoods where other mortals see mere blight. Trump had the brashness to imagine developing hotels in Moscow when that was a fatal enterprise. In 1996, a Kalashnikov sprayed the American hotelier Paul Tatum, who had the temerity to complain about the Chechen mafia and the less-than-scrupulous business culture he endured. Yet it wasn't hard to see the appeal of Russia, to both the bottom line and the ego. An article in the Moscow Times described Trump as the city's first grand builder since Stalin. Indeed, he later planned a development on the site where Stalin once hoped to construct the Palace of Soviet Congresses. Five separate times Trump attempted Russian projects, hotels, apartments, and retail on the grandest scale. In one iteration, he promised an ice rink, a ""members club,"" and a spa, for ""the finest residences in Moscow."" Another project he described as ""the largest hotel in the world."" His gaudy style appealed to Russian nouveau riche, and he knew it. ""The Russian market is attracted to me,"" he once boasted. He registered his name as a trademark in Moscow and even licensed it to a liquor company, which sold Trump Super Premium Vodka. Government officials claimed that they wanted to do business with Trump because they also considered him super premium. In the mid-'90s, the general-turned-politician Alexander Lebed told him, ""If Trump goes to Moscow, I think America will follow."" Trump never could quite simultaneously align all the elements--investment, approval--to actually break ground. Yet his foray into Russia should be considered a smashing success; Trump set himself up for triumph even as he failed. With each doomed real estate project, he lavished praise on the key constituency that blesses deals, namely Russian politicians. (In front of a pack of reporters he told Lebed, ""We've been reading a lot of great things about this gentleman and his country."") The praise encouraged Russian officials to keep inviting Trump back for big potential deals. Each time he traveled to Moscow for a high profile visit, he attracted press attention and his stature increased. (After one trip, he bragged about a meeting where ""almost all of the oligarchs were in the room."") This elevated profile ultimately attracted investors. Russians helped finance his projects in Toronto and SoHo; they snapped up units in his buildings around the world--so much so that he came to target them, hosting cocktail parties in Moscow to recruit buyers. (His tenants included a Russian mobster, who ran an illegal poker ring in the Trump Tower and accompanied Trump to the staging of the Miss Universe contest in Moscow.) Even when he built a tower in Panama, he narrowcast his sales efforts to draw Russians, as the Washington Post has reported. ""Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,"" Trump's son, Donald Jr., bragged. ""We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."" The nature of the Donald Trump campaign is its fundamental blurring of his political and business interests--on display just recently in Scotland, when he praised the Brexit vote as a boon for his golf courses. As one campaign finance expert told the New York Times, ""Historically, candidates would separate themselves from their business interests when running for office. Trump has done the opposite by promoting his businesses while running for office."" Such mercantilist motives likely undergird Trump's ornate praise of Putin, too. Having a friend in the Kremlin would help Trump fulfill his longtime dream of planting his name in the Moscow skyline--a dream that he pursued even as he organized his presidential campaign. ""Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment,"" he once said. ""We will be in Moscow at some point."" * * * One of the important facts about Trump is his lack of creditworthiness. After his 2004 bankruptcy and his long streak of lawsuits, the big banks decided he wasn't worth the effort. They'd rather not touch the self-proclaimed ""king of debt."" This sent him chasing less conventional sources of cash. BuzzFeed has shown, for instance, his efforts to woo Muammar Qaddafi as an investor. Libyan money never did materialize. It was Russian capital that fueled many of his signature projects--that helped him preserve his image as a great builder as he recovered from bankruptcy. The money didn't come directly. Hunting for partners with cash, he turned to a small upstart called the Bayrock Group, which would pull together massive real estate deals using the Trump name. Its chairman was a former Soviet official named Tevfik Arif, who made a small fortune running luxe hotels in Turkey. To run Bayrock's operation, Arif hired Felix Satter, a Soviet-born, Brighton Beach-bred college dropout. Satter changed his name to Sater, likely to distance himself from the criminal activity that a name-check would easily turn up. As a young man, Sater served time for slashing a man's face with a broken margarita glass in a barroom brawl. The Feds also busted him for a working in a stock brokerage tied to four different Mafia families, which made $40 million off fraudulent trades. One lawsuit would later describe ""Satter's proven history of using mob-like tactics to achieve his goals."" Another would note that he threatened a Trump investor with the prospect of the electrocution of his testicles, the amputation of his leg, and his corpse residing in the trunk of Sater's car. What was Trump thinking entering into business with partners like these? It's a question he has tried to banish by downplaying his ties to Bayrock and minimizing Sater's sins. (""He got into trouble because he got into a barroom fight which a lot of people do,"" Trump once said in a deposition.) But he didn't just partner with Bayrock; the company embedded with him. Sater worked in Trump Tower; his business card described him as a ""Senior Advisor to Donald Trump."" Bayrock put together deals for mammoth Trump-named, Trump-managed projects--two in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a resort in Phoenix, the Trump SoHo in New York. Several of those projects broke ground, but they were a mere prelude. ""Mr. Trump was particularly taken with Mr. Arif's overseas connections,"" the Times reported (after buyers of units in the Trump SoHo sued him for fraud). ""In a deposition, Mr. Trump said that the two had discussed 'numerous deals all over the world' and that Mr. Arif had brought potential Russian investors to Mr. Trump's office to meet him."" Trump described the scope of their ambitions: ""[T]his was going to be Trump International Hotel and Tower Moscow, Kiev, Istanbul, etc., Poland, Warsaw."" Based on its cast of characters, Bayrock itself was an enterprise bound to end in a torrent of litigation. The company's finance chief Jody Kriss has sued it for fraud. In the course of the litigation, which is ongoing, Kriss alleged a primary source of funding for Trump's big projects: ""Month after month for two years, in fact whenever Bayrock ran out of cash, Bayrock Holdings would magically show up with a wire from 'somewhere' just large enough to keep the company going."" According to Kriss, these large payments would come from sources in Russia and Kazakhstan that hoped to hide their cash. Another source of Bayrock funding was a now-defunct Icelandic investment fund called the FL Group, a magnet for Russian investors ""in favor with"" Putin, as a lawsuit puts it. (The Daily Telegraph has reported that Bayrock mislabeled FL's investment as a loan, in order to avoid at least $20 million in taxes.) These projects are simply too ambitious, too central to his prospects, for Trump to have ignored the underlying source of financing. And it was at just the moment he came to depend heavily on shadowy investment from Russia that his praise for Putin kicked into high gear. In 2007, he told Larry King, ""Look at Putin--what he's doing with Russia--I mean, you know, what's going on over there. I mean this guy has done--whether you like him or don't like him--he's doing a great job."" * * * While Putin hasn't dirtied his hands in American elections, the Russians have cultivated Washington--hiring fancy firms to craft strategy, donating money to think tanks, building a small coterie of wonks sympathetic to their leader's view of the world. The Trump campaign is the unlikely culmination of this effort. It has been a magnet for like-minded fans of Putin. Fans might not be quite the right term, since so many of these advisers have profited from proxies of the Russian state. Let's begin at the top. Trump's campaign manager is a wizened operative named Paul Manafort. It's true that Manafort is a mercenary by trade. His old Washington consulting firm pioneered the practice of representing the dictators of the world, no matter their grim record. (I profiled his authoritarian ambit earlier this year.) Late in his career, however, Manafort dedicated himself to working on behalf of clients close to the Kremlin. His grand achievement was reviving the doomed career of the anti-charismatic politician Viktor Yanukovych. Manafort's image-crafting and shrewd strategy culminated in Yanukovych's election to Ukraine's presidency in 2010. Thanks to Manafort's handiwork, Ukraine pulled into Putin's sphere of influence. Unlike other American consultants who flitted in and out of Kiev, Manafort set up camp there. He became an essential adviser to the president--his tennis partner even. If Manafort were the only Kremlin connection in the Trump campaign, his presence might signify nothing. But he's hardly isolated. Many pundits have scoffed at the idea that Trump has a circle of foreign policy advisers given that his initial list of gurus emerged abruptly in March and included names unknown to most experts. Yet the list suggests certain tendencies. One of the supposed Trump whisperers was an investment banker named Carter Page. During a stint in Moscow in the 2000s, he advised the state-controlled natural gas giant, Gazprom and helped it attract Western investors.  (In March, Page told Bloomberg that he continues to own shares in the company.) Page has defended Russia with relish. He wrote a column explicitly comparing the Obama administration's Russia policy to chattel slavery in the American South. His reasoning: ""Numerous quotes from the February 2015 National Security Strategy closely parallel an 1850 publication that offered guidance to slaveholders on how to produce the 'ideal slave.' "" Also on the list of advisers is Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Eighteen months after he departed government, he journeyed to Moscow and sat two chairs away from Putin at the 10th anniversary gala celebrating Russia Today. In Politico, an anonymous Obama official harshly criticized Flynn: ""It's not usually to America's benefit when our intelligence officers--current or former--seek refuge in Moscow."" More recently, Richard Burt, a Reagan administration official, has begun advising Trump on foreign policy. His criticisms of NATO and pleas for greater cooperation with Putin grow from a deeply felt realism. Yet his ideological positions jibe with his financial interests. Burt is on the boards of Alfa-Bank, the largest commercial bank in Russia, and an investment fund with a large position  in Gazprom. Trump's advisers have stakes in businesses where the health of the Russian state is the health of the firm--where, in fact, the state and the firm are deeply entangled. The campaign isn't just one man with an aesthetic affinity for Putin and commercial interests in Russia; his sentiments are reinforced and amplified by an organization rife with financial ties to the Kremlin. * * * Is Putin already meddling in this campaign? In his chilly way, he has signaled his rooting interest. He praised Trump as ""very talented."" His mouthpieces are more effusive. Vladimir Yakunin, the former chairman of Russian Railways, has said of Trump, ""He is addressing some internal failings of the American people."" The Kremlin doesn't seem much bothered to disguise its help. Soon after the discovery of Russian intelligence hacking into Clinton servers, documents suddenly materialized on the web: a PDF of the DNC's opposition research file and a trove of spreadsheets, including a list of donors to the Clinton Foundation. Foreign intelligence agencies often go fishing for information on American political campaigns. Chinese hackers tapped Mitt Romney's servers in search of useful nuggets. But the Russians have made an art of publicizing the material they have filched to injure their adversaries. The locus classicus of this method was a recording of a blunt call between State Department official Toria Nuland and the American ambassador to Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt. The Russians allegedly planted the recording on YouTube and then tweeted a link to it--and from there it became international news. Though they never claimed credit for the leak, few doubted the White House's contention that Russia was the source. We can only speculate about the documents the Russians have in their possession and how they might use them. The material they have released thus far is relatively innocuous, but it may just be a hint of leaks to come--as they experiment with unfurling their material and gauging the reactions to leaks. The Clinton Foundation is, after all, a pretty juicy target to have hit--a place with an ethically borderline approach to fundraising and already a primary object of Trump campaign fusillades. One of the sites that has posted purloined material is called Guccifer 2.0, which strenuously protests that it is the work of a lone hacker. The site features a warning that it has released only a small smattering of documents from the ""many thousands I extracted."" He is not the only one sitting on a pile of damaging material. Julian Assange, who hosted a show on Russia Today, warned, ""We have emails relating to Hillary Clinton which are pending publication."" * * * Donald Trump's ego compounds his naivete. He's vulnerable to flattery; his confidence in himself exceeds his intellectual capacities. All of this makes him particularly susceptible to exploitation, an easy mark. For this reason, dubious figures have always gravitated to him. (Please read David Cay Johnston's persuasive account of Trump's long ties to organized crime.) It seems the Russian president has noticed this, too. To quote Trump on Putin, ""A guy calls me a genius and they want me to renounce him? I'm not going to renounce him."" In the end, we only have circumstantial evidence about the Russian efforts to shape this election--a series of disparate data points and a history of past interference in similar contests. But the pattern is troubling, and so is the premise. If Putin wanted to concoct the ideal candidate to serve his purposes, his laboratory creation would look like Donald Trump. The Republican nominee wants to shatter our military alliances in Europe; he cheers the destruction of the European Union; he favors ratcheting down tensions with Russia over Ukraine and Syria, both as a matter of foreign policy and in service of his own pecuniary interests. A Trump presidency would weaken Putin's greatest geo-strategic competitor. By stoking racial hatred, Trump will shred the fabric of American society. He advertises his willingness to dismantle constitutional limits on executive power. In his desire to renegotiate debt payments, he would ruin the full faith and credit of the United States. One pro-Kremlin blogger summed up his government's interest in this election with clarifying bluntness: ""Trump will smash America as we know it, we've got nothing to lose."""

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/ted_cruz_s_speech_gave_anti_trumpers_what_they_wanted.html	"CLEVELAND--Ted Cruz does not choose a single word or phrase by accident. His every utterance is intentional, and so is its effect. And the key phrase from Cruz's speech Wednesday night was: ""Vote your conscience."" There was no mistaking what he meant, particularly if you were an anti-Trump delegate who'd spent the week getting roughed up by the party and its nominee. As soon as Cruz said that--right after teasing, cruelly, with the line ""please, don't stay home in November""--the impatient Trump delegates who'd been waiting months for an endorsement from Cruz just lost it. They began to boo, reportedly egged on by Trump operatives, and soon enough Trump himself arrived on the scene, glowering from the stairs, stepping all over Cruz's moment. ""Vote your conscience"" has become a loaded term for Republican delegates over the past week. Cruz loyalists, with whom anti-Trump die-hards heavily if not completely overlap, first tried to insert a ""conscience clause"" into the party rules that would unbind the delegates, allowing them to vote for the candidate of their choice. It was stomped out in committee last week, and then a protest against the rules package was killed in controversial fashion on the convention's opening day. Saying ""vote your conscience"" wasn't just a non-endorsement of Trump. It was a big kiss blown to the anti-Trumpers, thanking them for their service in Cleveland and giving them license not to vote for Trump. The gesture was a welcome one. For Cruz and his delegates, the hazing from Trump World never seemed to stop. Even Trump's plane was mocking them, interrupting a Cruz rally earlier in the day. Cruz's delegates have been brow-beaten and derided by Trump's campaign and the RNC throughout the week, and by late afternoon Wednesday, the question of whether Cruz would endorse his former rival was building into the marquee story of the RNC's Day 3. ""I think it's up to Ted Cruz to do what is best for his interests,"" said Selma Sierra, a Utah delegate and director of the state's Bureau of Land Management office. This was before the convention had been gaveled into session. Did she, personally, support Trump? ""Wait 'til tonight,"" she said. ""I'm going to see what our great leader has to say."" ""It's time. Tonight,"" said Utah state Sen. Scott Jenkins, who supported Cruz in the primary but now stands firmly behind Trump. He doesn't see what's so complicated for the resisters. He'd heard some of his fellow Cruz delegates talking about how it's a ""moral issue."" But he doesn't see the moral issue of stopping Hillary Clinton as all that difficult. Jenkins also raised that other, more bureaucratic ethical question that cuts the other way: Cruz's obligation to fulfill the pledge he signed last year promising to support the nominee. Laura Ingraham, the conservative radio host, unsubtly called on Cruz to honor his word in her convention speech Wednesday night. ""I want to say this very plainly: We should all--even all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos, we love you--but you must honor your pledge to support Donald Trump now."" she said. ""Tonight!"" There were Cruz delegates here who'd come hoping that the program might help them turn the corner on Trump. They found themselves more anti-Trump than ever after the goonish treatment they'd received from Trump's campaign and the RNC during the rules matter. The whole affair involved a lot of parliamentary knife-fighting over a petition, signed by a majority of delegates from nine states, demanding a roll-call vote on the convention rules. Trump and the RNC's whip operation, recognizable by their neon-green baseball caps on the floor, ""were threatening people as far as like, 'If you don't take your name [off the petition demanding a roll-call vote on the rules], we will end your career in politics,' "" said Jennifer Fetters, a Washington delegate who served as coordinator for Cruz's state campaign. ""They were trying to be manipulative, saying, 'You guys are sore losers,' "" she added. Somebody, she said, was even ""following around"" another member of the Washington delegation. ""She was going to call the roll-call vote, and she had Trump people pushing up against her, trying to get the sergeant-at-arms to move her back."" Fetters continued: ""I was hoping by the end of this convention I would feel unity, and unfortunately Trump and his supporters, the people who were working on his behalf here, as well as the RNC, our state party chair, made me say, 'Nope.' "" She hoped Cruz would say the same. Minnesota delegate Andy Aplikowski, a Cruz supporter who lost a special election for state senate earlier this year, recounted a similar experience during the rules fiasco. At a Minnesota delegation meeting Monday ahead of the rules vote, the leaders of the state delegation and the RNC told everyone that disobeying ""would have consequences."" Like? ""Lack of money--Victory money--not getting support for our candidates."" He didn't buy much into it, being from a blue state. ""I'm in Minnesota. Every October, the RNC pulls the plug."" Though he didn't remove his name from the petition demanding a rules vote, the RNC's whips were able to remove three delegates from Minnesota's petition, and it was over. ""This is not inclusiveness,"" he said. ""Unity is not force. Unity is achieved."" On Wednesday, Cruz took a while to get to ""vote your conscience,"" overfilling his nine-minute speaking slot with a 23-minute speech. The Trump campaign had known for hours what Cruz was going to say and had emailed an embargoed copy of the speech to reporters so that they would know, too. If he wasn't going to endorse, they figured, they might as well set him up to endure the wrath of the delegates. After Cruz's non-endorsement, and the ""vote your conscience"" edict had been issued, Scott Jenkins pronounced himself disappointed in Cruz, though he was far too polite to boo the way those unruly New Yorkers did. ""It's the same thing that happened to Romney: The sore losers went home,"" he lamented. ""Oh, well. I don't know. Doggoneit!"" But Selma Sierra got the message. ""We've been suppressed"" by Trump delegates, she said, ""and he's talking about everybody having the same equal rights. I know we don't, because we were kept from voicing our opinions, and wanting to have the rule roll call to give everybody an equal chance."" She pointed to some sections on the floor that had booed Cruz's speech: ""Clearly people don't want that."" Wednesday night was the first time that anti-Trump delegates got what they wanted all convention. After days of rejection, their message, which all week had been suffocated in little back rooms and snuffed out on the floor by goons in green hats, was heard. Cruz registered their dissent into the record forever. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Donald Trump Incited a Delegate Civil War at the GOP Convention. Ted Cruz Made It Worse.
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/the_message_of_the_rnc_is_clear_and_terrifying.html	"CLEVELAND--Let's recap. On Monday, the Republican Party inaugurated its convention with a single message: fear. Fear of Hispanic immigrants, slammed as vectors for crime and disorder. Fear of ""radical Muslims,"" portrayed as a faceless, bloodthirsty horde. Fear of black activists, condemned as anarchists and lawless agitators. The argument was clear: You are in danger, threatened by a brown invaders and black saboteurs. Donald Trump will keep you safe. It was a remarkable display of demagoguery, a clear sign that the Republican Party--whatever it was before Trump--is now a party of overt white nationalism. And it was just the beginning. On Tuesday, a day nominally devoted to ""making America work again,"" Republicans took this demagoguery to the next level, broadcasting a virtual show trial in a clear effort to delegitimize the Democratic presidential candidate as a political actor. ""Since the Justice Department refuses to allow you to render a verdict, let's present the case now, on the facts, against Hillary Clinton,"" said Chris Christie, in his primetime speech, less a brief for Donald Trump and more a jeremiad against the sins--real and imagined--of the Democratic presidential nominee. With each charge against Clinton, the delegates screamed in hatred, breaking into chants of ""Guilty!"" and ""Lock her up! Lock her up!"" Indeed, if anything permeates the mood at this year's RNC, it's deep disdain and contempt for the former First Lady, verging on a kind of hysteria. Walk around the Quicken Loans Arena and you'll see vendors hawking a variety of anti-Clinton gear, from buttons and knick knacks, to shirts with slogans like ""Trump That Bitch"" and ""Clinton Sucks But Not Like Monica."" I have yet to hear an attendee use this rhetoric, but I've seen plenty purchase a T-shirt, or at least smile at the men selling the shirts. Beyond convention speakers or hard-working peddlers, there are members of the Trump campaign team, like New Hampshire state representative Al Baldasaro, who has advised Trump on veterans issues. ""This whole thing disgusts me,"" he said of the events at Benghazi, which took center stage on Monday. ""Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason."" When watching a national convention, it's tempting to dismiss this kind of rhetoric as simple showmanship, the heat and hyperbole that come naturally to any partisan political gathering. But this is different. Look back to the 2004 Democratic convention. For all of their hatred of George W. Bush, mainstream Democrats didn't demand a tribunal, or call for law enforcement to put him in prison. (As opposed to a Monday night speaker who said, plainly, that ""Hillary deserved to be in stripes."") John Edwards didn't hold a mock trial of Dick Cheney, and Barack Obama--one of the keynote speakers--didn't accuse Bush of cavorting with Satan. If Monday's program represents the triumph of nativism in the Republican Party, as the GOP succumbs to Trump's virulent strain of Know-Nothingism, then Tuesday's events show the extent to which Trump's authoritarianism has supplanted small government as the creed of the national Republican Party. And it's not just Christie's call to imprison Clinton for her alleged crimes, a move with no place in a democracy. Before he spoke to the assembled convention, Christie told a group of donors that a President Trump would purge his government of officials hired or appointed by Obama. As my colleague Elliot Hannon notes, ""[W]hat Christie is proposing resembles more of a witch hunt where federal staffers will be judged by their loyalty to the regime,"" as opposed to the usual churn that comes with a new administration. When coupled with Trump's plans for mass deportation of unauthorized immigrants and a ban on Muslim entry into the United States, you have a clear outline for repressive, authoritarian government, where disfavored minorities are hounded and political opponents condemned as criminals. And Republicans, blind with anti-Clinton animus, can't see it. Press delegates on Donald Trump's rhetoric--on his behavior and his temperament--and they deflect. Hillary Clinton can't be president. Hear it enough, and it begins to sound like a mantra, a way to rationalize the decision to put Donald Trump a stone's throw from the presidency. On Tuesday, the assembled delegations announced their delegate counts and formally nominate Trump. Most delegates were thrilled, hopeful that Trump would indeed be the next president of the United States. Outside, in the recreation area of the convention called""Freedom Plaza,"" delegates and attendees cheered as they ate, drank, and socialized. It felt like an ordinary event at an ordinary convention. That was the scariest part of all--the feeling that people here had already fit Donald Trump into the normal rhythms of American political life. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/chris_christie_s_malicious_attack_on_hillary_clinton_was_full_of_lies.html	"In his convention speech Tuesday night, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie roused the Republican delegates with a bill of indictment against Hillary Clinton's record and character as the nation's top diplomat. He was clearly staking his bid for a Cabinet post in the Trump administration, but his reading seemed more like an audition for the role of Reverend Parris in a summer-stock production of The Crucible. ""Lock her up!"" ""Burn the witch at the stake!"" roared the crowds that night, as they had the night before, and Christie fit right in. But let's examine his monologue in a way that no one else, least of all Christie, has done: as a serious, substantive list of charges. In this light, he wouldn't make it as an assistant district attorney in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, much less as attorney general of the United States. Christie began with Libya, a weak spot for the Democratic contender. The U.S. intervention in that country's civil war, with the resulting ouster of Muammar Qaddafi, did turn out disastrously, and, as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was the Obama administration's most avid advocate of supporting the rebels militarily. But it's over-the-top to pronounce her ""guilty,"" as Christie did, ""for ruining Libya and creating a nest for terrorist activity."" For one thing, Clinton was far from alone in pushing for armed intervention. Christie didn't mention this (and I doubt anyone else will this week), but Donald Trump also favored U.S. military action, saying, ""If you don't get rid of Qaddafi, it's a major, major black eye for this country."" Recall the context: The besieged Qaddafi was threatening to exterminate tens of thousands of his own citizens; the Arab League, in a near-unprecedented move, unanimously beseeched the United States for help; NATO expressed eagerness to dive in; and the U.N. Security Council drafted a resolution. Obama agreed (yes, with a push from Clinton and National Security Adviser Susan Rice) to send in U.S. air power but only if the European allies, who had more stake in the conflict, restored order and cleaned up afterward. The leaders of France and Italy agreed. The first part of the operation succeeded. The problem was that France and Italy proved unable or unwilling to do their parts in the ""post-combat phase."" As a result, the place fell apart, and terrorists moved in to fill the vacuum. But is Libya worse off than it would have been had Qaddafi remained in power? Unclear. Regardless of the answer, is Hillary Clinton to blame for the ensuing anarchy? Marginally, at most. At least a real debate could be had about Libya. (Not that Christie contributed to one.) The rest of his speech was flooded with falsehoods. ""In Nigeria,"" Christie told the crowd, ""Hillary Clinton amazingly fought for two years to keep an al-Qaida affiliate off of the terrorist watch list,"" and, ""as a result of this reckless action by the candidate who is the self-proclaimed champion of women all around the world,"" the terrorists abducted hundreds of schoolgirls. The truth is the Nigerian government, a U.S. ally, strenuously opposed efforts to put Boko Haram--the al-Qaida affiliate--on the watch list, arguing that doing so would elevate the group's stature. A letter to Secretary of State Clinton, signed by 25 Africa specialists, including the U.S. ambassador to Nigeria under President George W. Bush, urged her not to place the group on the watch list. Doing so, the letter stated, ""would internationalize Boko Haram, legitimize abuses by Nigeria's security services, limit the State Department's latitude in shaping a long-term strategy, and undermine the U.S. government's ability to receive effective independent analysis from the region."" There was an internal debate over the matter, but the State Department's counterterrorism bureau took the Nigerian government's side. Even so, in June 2012, Clinton put the three alleged leaders of Boko Haram on the terrorist watch list--which sparked a process leading to the designation of the entire group in 2013, not long after she left government service. In any case, there is no evidence that putting Boko Haram on the watch list earlier would have prevented the abductions. Christie then moved on to China, claiming that Clinton ""praised the Chinese government for buying our debt to finance Barack Obama's bloated stimulus plan."" Quite apart from the issue of whether the stimulus plan was bloated, this is how debt-financing works, and this particular feature of Chinese-American relations long precedes--and will long follow--Clinton's tenure as secretary. Then came Syria where, according to Christie, Clinton lauded President Bashar al-Assad as ""a different kind of leader"" and ""reformer."" Now, Christie added, there are ""400,000 dead at the hands of the man that Hillary defended,"" betraying herself as ""an awful judge of the character of a dictator and butcher."" Again, Christie distorted the facts. In March 2011, Assad started arresting protesters who were inspired by the Arab Spring. On CBS' Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer asked Clinton why the U.S. wasn't sending in airstrikes, as it had in Libya. After all, Assad's father had ""killed 25,000 people at a lick"" in similar circumstances 30 years earlier. Clinton replied (emphasis mine):"	Let's Count the Lies in Chris Christie's Attack on Hillary Clinton
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/paul_ryan_is_a_trump_supporting_racism_enabling_coward.html	"In his address to the Republican convention on Tuesday night, House Speaker Paul Ryan accused Democrats of inciting ethnic resentment. ""Let the other party go on and on with its constant dividing up of people, always playing one group against the other, as if group identity were everything,"" Ryan charged. ""In America, aren't we all supposed to see beyond class, see beyond ethnicity? Are all these lines drawn to set us apart and lock us into groups?"" It was a remarkable sermon, delivered on behalf of the most egregious racist nominated to the presidency by a major party in at least half a century. Ryan spoke every word with his usual earnestness, unencumbered by shame. Looking back at history, we tend to focus on villains, men like Donald Trump who use hatred to gain power. We forget the importance of cowards. Every Trump needs his Ryan. I've always liked Paul Ryan. He talks about opportunity and empowerment, not scapegoats. He focuses on fiscal responsibility and self-reliance, two of my favorite Republican themes. He strikes me as constructive and sincere. It's not his fault that the Republican Party, during his tenure as speaker, nominated Trump. But Trump's nomination confronted Ryan with a terrible dilemma. As the head of the Republican Party, Ryan had to decide whether to reject Trump and lose the election, or embrace Trump and lose the party's soul, as well as his own. Ryan made the wrong choice. He decided that the Republican Party would criticize race baiters, but it would also tolerate and support them. Trump has run the most racially incendiary campaign in decades. He has proposed to bar all Muslims from entering the United States. He has explicitly attacked the trustworthiness of Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, and Seventh-day Adventists. He has libeled Arab Americans, mocked Native Americans, retweeted anti-Semites, and argued that a sportscaster shouldn't have apologized for anti-black comments. Today, no decent, well-informed person can honestly deny Trump's penchant for prejudice. During the primaries, Ryan condemned Trump's Muslim ban and his failure to forcefully repudiate former Klansman David Duke. So did Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who, as the GOP's presidential nominee, had put Ryan on the Republican ticket in 2012. But the Republican voters of 2016 flocked to Trump, and on May 3, the chairman of the Republican National Committee declared him the party's presumptive nominee. Republican politicians had to decide: Could they support a racist demagogue for president? Romney decided he couldn't. ""Our first priority should be to stand by our principles,"" he told the Wall Street Journal. ""If those are in conflict with the nominee, the principles come first."" In an interview with CNN on June 10, Romney outlined three reasons to oppose Trump. First, racism is morally non-negotiable. It's a deal-killer. ""I simply can't put my name down as someone who voted for principles that suggest racism or xenophobia, misogyny, bigotry,"" said Romney. ""If there's someone that was an anti-Semite, for instance, and they had all of the same positions I had, and they were running for president, I simply could not vote for them."" Second, Romney saw racism as a character issue and Trump's deployment of it as a deep flaw, not the kind of thing consultants or speechwriters could fix. ""He can change his rhetoric. I believe he can hide who he is,"" Romney conceded. ""But I believe that who he is has been revealed by his lifetime and by the words in the campaign that he has spoken."" Third, Romney worried about Trump's cultural effects. ""I don't want to see trickle-down racism,"" said Romney. ""Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation. And trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny--all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America."" Essentially, Romney was challenging his party to see prejudice in a new way--to treat it as an issue of national moral health, as Republicans have traditionally done with abortion and marriage. Initially, Ryan, too, withheld his endorsement. On May 5, two days after Trump was anointed, Ryan said he wasn't ready to support the presumptive nominee. ""This is the party of Lincoln, of Reagan, of Jack Kemp,"" said Ryan. ""What a lot of Republicans want to see is that we have a standard-bearer that bears our standards."" A week later, after meeting with Trump, Ryan drew a distinction between ""policy disputes,"" on which Republicans could agree to disagree, and ""core principles,"" which were non-negotiable. Did race-baiting violate Ryan's core principles? For two weeks, Ryan kept his silence, and Trump held his tongue. Then, at a rally on May 27, Trump unleashed a 10-minute tirade against Gonzalo Curiel, the judge presiding over a fraud case against Trump University. Trump pronounced the judge's name for effect, eliciting boos, and informed the crowd that Curiel--who had been born in Indiana--""happens to be, we believe, Mexican."" Trump's spokeswoman followed up, asserting in a CNN interview on May 30 that Curiel was ""connected"" to protesters who brandished ""Mexican flags"" and were trying ""to stop an American president from running for office."" Trump's attack on Curiel sparked a national uproar. Ryan couldn't have missed it. But three days later, on June 2, he endorsed Trump. In an op-ed, Ryan said Trump had earned his blessing by affirming ""fundamental principles such as the protection of life"" and pledging to work with House Republicans on ""the issues that make up our agenda."" Racism wasn't on the list. Hours after the op-ed appeared, Trump went after Curiel again. He said the judge's ""Mexican heritage"" created ""an inherent conflict of interest"" that made him unfit to judge Trump, since Trump was ""building a wall"" on the Mexican border. Another uproar ensued. Ryan could have withdrawn his endorsement. But he didn't. Ryan, unlike Romney, didn't see racism as a character issue. He treated Trump's latest slur as a mysterious outburst. It ""was out of left field, [to] my mind,"" Ryan sputtered in a radio interview on June 3. ""It's reasoning I don't relate to."" Sometimes, Ryan conceded, Trump ""says and does things I don't agree with."" But Ryan stuck with him, arguing that Trump would sign Republican bills into law. Over the next two days, Trump repeated his attacks on Curiel's ethnicity. On June 7, reporters asked Ryan whether he regretted endorsing Trump. Ryan called Trump's remarks ""the textbook definition of a racist comment,"" but he refused to disown the presumptive nominee. ""I don't know what's in his heart,"" Ryan pleaded. In a radio interview on June 9, Ryan dismissed Trump's racial jabs as ""antics."" Trump pressed on. After the Orlando massacre on June 12, he launched a weeklong campaign against ""second-generation"" Muslim Americans, those who had been born in the United States. He claimed that there was ""no real assimilation"" of Muslims and that they were ""trying to take over our children"" by telling kids ""how wonderful Islam is."" Trump mocked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, calling her ""Pocahontas."" He said sportscaster Jimmy ""the Greek"" Snyder shouldn't have apologized for racist remarks about blacks. He tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton--originally circulated by anti-Semites--that framed her against a background of dollar bills, next to a six-pointed star with the words, ""Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!"" Ryan shrugged off these incidents as unhelpful but meaningless and unrelated. He blamed the Star of David incident on a ""flunky"" and advised Trump to ""clean up the way his new media works."" In a CNN town hall on July 12, when a questioner asked about perceptions of Republican bigotry, Ryan urged voters to focus on the party's ""ideas,"" not ""some of the harsh rhetoric you see here or there."" To Ryan, the racism of the party's presidential nominee was a sideshow. Ryan, like Romney, offered three arguments about race-baiting. But Ryan's arguments weren't for banishing it. They were for tolerating it. First, Ryan said it was unacceptable to divide the GOP. ""If I lead a schism in our party, then I'm guaranteeing that a liberal progressive becomes president,"" Ryan warned in a press conference on June 23. Three weeks later, at the CNN town hall, he shot down a questioner who asked about voting libertarian. That's ""basically voting for Hillary Clinton,"" Ryan scoffed. Second, Ryan argued that Republican leaders should yield to the will of Republican voters. In an interview that aired June 19 on Meet the Press, he declared that he had a ""responsibility"" not to ""dis-unify our party and disrespect the voters, the Republican primary voters of America."" In the CNN town hall, Ryan said Trump ""won the primary fair and square. And that is why we want to respect the will of these voters."" Third, Ryan depicted religious bigotry as a negotiable issue and a tolerable point of view. In a June 12 interview on This Week, he emphasized that he and Trump saw eye to eye ""on the big issues"": tax reform, welfare reform, and health care. When George Stephanopoulos asked about the Muslim ban, Ryan replied: ""We don't agree on that. That's fine. Good people can disagree on things."" In the CNN town hall, Ryan again gave Trump a pass on the Muslim ban. ""Look, no two people agree on everything,"" he said. These three arguments guarantee that the Republican Party, under Ryan, will accept bigots. They might be criticized or chided, but not excluded, even from the top of the national ticket. To exclude them would divide the party. It would disrespect the Trump-friendly voters who now control the Republican nominating process. It would impose absolutist judgments on a party in which the taboo against ethnic and religious slurs has been set aside as just another form of ""political correctness."" Ryan's job at the convention, and for the remainder of the election, is to pretend that none of this has happened. So he ended his speech Tuesday night with a plea for love. ""Everyone is equal,"" he said. ""Everyone has a place. No one is written off, because there is worth and goodness in every life. ... That is the Republican ideal. And if we won't defend it, who will?"" Indeed, who will? Not Paul Ryan. Not the party of Lincoln. Not anymore. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

His fight at the convention was over, the Trump-defying contingent of which he was a leader having been crushed by the machinery of his own party. The roll call was just a detail, the body count coming in from a shattered front. It was time now to talk about Pokemon Go. What does Mike Lee think of Pokemon Go? Not much. ""I downloaded it thinking it might be fun, because it's all the kids are talking about,"" he said. ""I can't for the life of me figure out what is fun about Pokemon Go. No one has been able to explain it to me. Staffers, my children, neighbors tried to explain why it's fun. It makes no sense. It is not a fun game. Maybe there's something in it that I'm missing."" He lamented that you don't even ""stumble across any Constitutions in it."" He went on: ""I even opened Pokemon Go inside the Senate chamber one time--we're not supposed to do that, it's against Senate rules--but I was curious to see whether there were points to be scored inside the Senate chamber. Nothing. So."" He went on about this for a little while longer, and even tried to open it on his phone, sometime around Oregon. He couldn't get any service. Oh, well. But what else was there to talk about? Certainly he didn't want to talk about what was unfolding in front of him. I stood by Lee for about an hour leading up to Utah's turn in the roll. Waves of reporters would arrive every 10 minutes asking the same two questions, both of which he was perfectly polite in answering for the 10-millionth time this convention. How is he feeling? ""It's the convention. It's like the Super Bowl!"" (One time he added, more glumly, ""like the Super Bowl, at the end of the day, it turns out to be no big surprise."") Will he endorse Donald Trump? ""We'll see."" He would like Trump to show that he understands federalism and the separation of powers. Lee, Sen. Ted Cruz's first (and ultimately one of the few) endorsers in the Senate, mostly kept silent on Trump for a long time. Sixty-nine percent of Republican caucus-goers in his heavily Mormon state went for Cruz, while 14 percent went for Trump. No state's Republican electorate was as distinctly disgusted by Trump as Utah's, and Lee, behind that extremely polite demeanor, seems to feel likewise. In late June, the smile finally fell off during a Newsmax TV interview when he was pressed about not endorsing Trump. ""We can get into the fact that he accused my best friend's father of conspiring to kill JFK,"" Lee told Steve Malzberg. ""We can go through the fact that he's made statements that some have identified correctly as religiously intolerant. We can get into the fact that he's wildly unpopular in my state, in part because my state consists of people who are members of a religious minority church. A people who were ordered exterminated by the governor of Missouri in 1838. And statements like that make them nervous. ""Don't sit here and tell me, Steve,"" he concluded, ""that I have no reason to be concerned about Donald Trump."" Lee was among the Trump-resisting delegate leaders who got rolled by the candidate and the RNC during Monday's fiasco over the party rules on the convention floor. I asked him if he had gotten any more information from the RNC about how it had disappeared the petitions. ""I haven't heard anything,"" he said. ""I don't necessarily expect to hear anything. Which is unfortunate, but I guess that's where we are."" The roll call proceeded, with Lee offering a running commentary. Maine now. What does Lee think his dear friend Ted Cruz will say in his convention speech Wednesday? He demurred, focusing less on the prospect of Cruz endorsing Trump than on Cruz's style. ""He thinks podiums are a form of torture, or something,"" Lee said. ""He'll have a mic, and he'll pace, and he'll come down in his boots. I think he sleeps in his boots. He's never not wearing boots."" New Hampshire now, Corey Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager serving as chair of the state's delegation, looking bug-eyed and puffy-chested as always, shouting out Trump's delegate haul from the state. Lee hollered back, ""Great job, Corey!"" He and his wife, Sharon, were agog at the severity of the look on Lewandowski's face. And wasn't it funny how some states referred to Trump as ""Donald Trump"" while others said ""Donald J. Trump. ""There might be another Trump,"" he said. ""Donald K. Trump!"" New Mexico now--the state of Breaking Bad, Lee said. ""It's real, you know. You think it's a drama, but it's actually real people."" Somewhere around Texas, as state delegation chairs went on and on about their most famous residents, he made a dry joke about what Utah could say. ""Ted Bundy!"" Utah's turn was here. Phill Wright, vice chair of the Utah Republican Party, announced that the state would cast all 40 of its delegates' votes to the overwhelming winner of their caucuses, Ted Cruz. ""Nailed it,"" Lee said to Wright, as they waited, and waited ... ""Pursuant to the announcement of the delegation and the rules of this convention,"" the presiding convention chair eventually announced, ""Utah: 40 votes, Trump."" Wright, Lee, and others went stone-faced for a moment, though of course they knew what was coming. The chair explained the peculiar provision in the Utah rules that, ""notwithstanding the outcome of the state's presidential contest, those votes will go to the lone surviving candidate in the race."" Another reporter noted that Lee's delegation didn't seem particularly happy with the ruling, even if no one there was surprised. ""He came in with 14 percent,"" Lee said. But this was all anticlimax. Trump had already hit his mark. Moments earlier, New York had put Trump over the 1,237-delegate threshold. As the Quicken Loans Arena celebrated to ""New York, New York,"" Lee and most of the rest of the delegation stared straight ahead, barely cracking an expression. I asked Lee if he would describe this as a happy moment. Was this exciting? He thought about it for a few seconds. ""Conventions,"" he said, ""are always exciting.""

That your word is your bond. And you do what you say and keep your promise. That you treat people with respect."" In 2008, Michelle Obama stood onstage at the Democratic National Convention and said, ""Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values. Like, you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond, that you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect."" Earlier this week, Slate published a story headlined ""141 Things Donald Trump Has Said and Done That Make Him Unfit to Be President."" If we added in ""his wife plagiarized Michelle Obama at the Republican convention,"" it would probably rank below ""Said he would force the military to commit war crimes,"" ""Proposed to create a database to track Muslims in the U.S.,"" ""Called Mexican immigrants rapists,"" and roughly 130 or so other entries. But that doesn't mean the Trump campaign's plagiarism is trivial. Or that we shouldn't care. Or that it's some ingenious Trumpian fake-out that we shouldn't fall for. Or that the media is falling down on the job. Or that it's making us forget the stakes of the election. Here's what those arguments basically add up to: We have serious problems to solve, and we need serious people to solve them. (I grabbed that from The American President--owe you one, Aaron Sorkin.) Yes, Donald Trump is terrifying. Yes, we should be extremely wary of normalizing his behavior, and of losing sight of the hate and rhetoric at the core of his candidacy and on display throughout Monday night's RNC program. But come on, stern-faced finger-waggers of America. The wannabe first lady of the United States told a massive prime-time audience ""that you work hard for what you want in life,"" a phrase one of her speechwriters seems to have copied wholesale from the current first lady, the wife of the man Trump calls ""the worst president in U.S. history."" It is astonishing that this happened here, on our home planet. It is amazing and unfathomable and world-historically ironic. It is a moment to be cherished forever, not waved away like some D-grade campaign gaffe. The RNC's chief strategist is defending Melania Trump by quoting from My Little Pony! If you're too high-minded to care about a little light prose theft, you're missing the story of a campaign crack-up. In a just world, the Trump-istas would've turned on one another on account of, to pick one example at random, the hypothetical rapist-repelling wall that Mexico is going to pay for. But ""heads are going to roll"" when heads are going to roll. The notion that videos and stories and follow-up stories and analysis and tweets and memes about word-is-bond-ghazi will distract from the ""real issues"" at hand in this election is infantilizing and wrong. People are capable of thinking multiple thoughts each day, and of reading multiple articles. It's ludicrous to suggest that coverage of any individual story will totally drown out other campaign news. As I write this, the most-read story on Slate is Will Saletan's piece arguing that Rudy Giuliani's speech, not Melania Trump's, was the most damning of the evening. Readers of this website were somehow not too distracted to click on it. As compared with, say, the mechanics of how the anti-Trumpers got squashed on the convention floor, the plagiarism story is simple, resonant, and easy to understand. And it seems self-defeating, if your goal is to make the case that Trump is unfit to be president, to shoo voters away from a salacious item that happens to demonstrate Trump's unfitness. James Fallows made that case in a series of eight tweets that can be distilled into these two: It's not just that the Trump campaign allowed this to happen. It's that, when it became undeniable that Melania Trump had plagiarized Michelle Obama, Trump's operatives and surrogates denied it, vociferously and repeatedly. You could make a reasonable argument that the plagiarism itself was amusing but ultimately pointless. The cover-up has been much worse than the crime. It's true that we shouldn't normalize Trump's racism. It's also true that we need to pay attention to how the Trump operation disdains the truth. If they're willing to lie about something as dumb as this, when the cost of coming clean is relatively low, then what do you think they'll tell us about the ""real issues""?

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/rudy_giuliani_s_convention_speech_was_a_disaster_too.html	"The 2016 Republican National Convention is a marvel of cognitive dissonance. It seems to have been constructed as though Republicans were nominating a normal presidential candidate. But they aren't. We keep hearing that the nominee stands for this or has said that--but he doesn't, and he hasn't. He's outside the bounds of presentable behavior. So the party, in its presentation, ignores his record. Take Monday's speech by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Like previous speakers, he complained that President Obama has failed to identify ""our enemy."" Giuliani described this enemy as ""Islamic extremist terrorism."" Then he paused to lecture reporters: ""For the purpose of the media, I did not say all of Islam. I did not say most of Islam. I said Islamic extremist terrorism."" Well, that's nice. But it's not what Trump has said. Trump has said, ""Islam hates us."" He has proposed a ""complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" If you don't like that position, don't lecture the press. Lecture your nominee. ""Donald Trump is a leader,"" Giuliani went on. ""He will reassert America's position as the nation with the best values to lead the world."" Really? Trump will show we have the best values to lead the world? Maybe a Republican speaker could have said that about George W. Bush, who at least claimed to fight for democracy. But Trump? Trump's whole foreign policy is about renouncing values. He says our scruples weaken us in the fight against ISIS. He says we should torture prisoners for sheer retribution. He says we should target the families of terrorists. He says we should seize oil from countries we invade. Take the Ten Commandments, turn them upside down, and that's pretty much what Trump stands for. You can argue that his foreign policy might scare some countries into bowing to us, as they do when threatened by Russia or China. But values? Please. Giuliani accused Obama of dividing the country over police shootings. He asked: ""What happened to 'There's no black America, no white America, there is just America'?"" Speaking for the GOP, Giuliani pledged: ""We reach out our arms with understanding and compassion to those who have lost loved ones because of police shootings."" That's sweet. But maybe, before issuing that pledge, Giuliani should have checked Trump's Twitter account. He could start with Trump's tweet that ""the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics."" Then perhaps he could move on to Trump's retweet of a fabricated claim that 81 percent of white homicide victims were killed by blacks--followed by Trump's insistence that the number came ""from sources that are very credible."" Then maybe he could peruse Trump's tweets about the anger over policing in Ferguson, Missouri (""President Obama has absolutely no control [or respect] over the African American community"") and over the death of Freddie Gray (""Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!""). And for dessert, he could read Trump's remark, just three weeks ago, that sportscaster Jimmy ""the Greek"" Snyder never should have apologized for racist comments about black athletes. There's no black America, except in everything Trump says to white America.

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/how_the_gop_rolled_the_anti_trump_movement.html	"CLEVELAND--""The petitions have been signed and turned in,"" Kendal Unruh said from her seat in the Colorado delegation of the Republican National Convention, as she made last-minute preparations. She was about to have her moment of truth Monday afternoon. ""And,"" she went on, ""you're going to watch them ignore us."" In the past week, Unruh, a teacher, has become a folk hero to anti-Trump Republicans who insist on exhausting every last parliamentary tool at their disposal to block Donald Trump's nomination. She and her cohort of fellow dead-enders find themselves directly in the crosshairs of RNC chairman Reince Priebus and Trump's presidential campaign, whose No. 1 objective is to ensure a smooth, camera-friendly show of unity this week. It took a lot of effort from the likes of Priebus and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort just to get all of these people in the building in a semi-coordinated, nonviolent fashion. Now they have to deal with Unruh and her collaborators--and they're not shy about doing so. For a day, at least, the smoke-filled room--a relic of a time before nominees were chosen by voters--returned to the American political scene. After Unruh's contingent of anti-Trumpers in the rules committee failed to insert a ""conscience"" clause into this year's rules package last week, an amendment that would have the effect of unbinding the delegates, they adopted a new tactic for the convention itself. The idea was that, when the rules report was brought up for passage by the full convention, anti-Trumpers would insist on recording the vote by roll call--rather than by voice vote, in which the power to determine whether the yeas or nays are louder resides with the presiding chair and his gavel. A roll call vote would be an arduous process, and it'd have the effect of emphasizing the internal discontent over party's nominee (and of knocking the convention way off schedule). The mechanism for forcing such a vote is party rule 39 of the temporary rules under operation, which allows for roll call votes if majorities of seven delegations request it by petition. After RNC chair Reince Priebus opened the convention around 1 p.m., the rules committee repaired to a breakout room to approve the package it negotiated last week and send it to the full convention. After their marathon session last week, the members of the committee mostly seemed to want to get it over. When committee chair Enid Mickelsen brought up the report for approval, one stray delegate, Fred Brown of Alaska, asked for the committee to consider offering something, for the sake of ""unity,"" to the members who felt they were steamrolled the previous week. Mickelsen wasn't having it. ""The chairman rules that the gentleman is out of order,"" she said with a determined coolness. ""We said we would have full and fair debate. No one who sat through our meeting could possibly believe the people did not have an opportunity to speak their mind."" A round of applause broke out. The committee approved the platform, and Unruh and her allies, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee, moved on to the next thing. Important people, including Republican lawyer turned cable news rules explainer Ben Ginsberg, loitered in the back of the room, texting and making calls. The states petitioning for a roll call vote had about one hour to turn their petitions in to convention secretary Susie Hudson. The secretary was difficult to find during that hour--some would say intentionally so. Camera crews from MSNBC showed Unruh racing through the halls of the convention trying to find her. They were able eventually to get the petitions into Hudson's hands. ""We'll have a vote on the floor later today regarding the rules,"" a cheery Lee announced from the ground floor of the Quicken Loans Arena. ""We'll see what happens."" His understanding was that majorities of delegates from 11 states had turned in petitions demanding a roll call vote. Beau Correll, the Virginia delegate who last week won a court case against a state law binding him to primary results--not against party rules binding him--believed there were 10. ""Now we won't be ignored,"" Correll said. ""Now it's not Speaker Ryan reading the teleprompter and saying, 'The yeas have it.' It's about accountability."" He added, though, that we'd have to see whether the RNC ""tries to run from their responsibility of organizing the convention by the rules""--i.e., ""ignores"" their petitions, as Unruh had said they would. The rules package came up for adoption after easy passage of the reports from the credentials and permanent organization committees. In no way did acting chair Rep. Steve Womack--not Speaker Paul Ryan, the permanent chair who was busy hiding from this hot mess all day Monday--acknowledge the rule 39 petitions and the roll call vote his party rules would seem to require him to hold. He just called for a voice vote. The yeas screamed and never quieted down, drowning out whatever nays there might have been. Womack gaveled it for the yeas, and the Republican National Convention went bonkers. The petitioners and affiliated other anti-Trumpers--as well as delegates who simply thought a roll call would have been fair--began shouting ""RECORD THE VOTE!"" only to be met with corresponding chants of ""U-S-A!"" or ""WE WANT TRUMP!"" Unruh's Colorado delegation discussed walking out of the convention and never returning, but first Womack, the acting chair, returned to the dais. He called for a redo to get a clearer vote. Though the yeas and nays sounded roughly equal in decibel level the second time, Womack again called it for the yeas, and then asked for objections. When the chair of the Utah delegation raised the issue of the roll call petitions that had been ignored, Womack explained that they had received nine petitions, but that three states' petitions had been withdrawn because petitioners had taken off their names. No roll call would be ordered, and the rules package passed--again to loud, loud objections. Which states withdrew? Unruh had no idea, and neither did Washington delegate and fellow anti-Trumper Eric Minor. Both were holding court with mobs of reporters on the floor as the rest of the convention approved the party platform. Security and police on the floor, frustrated, began screaming at the huddlers in vain to clear off. None of the anti-Trump revolt leaders--Unruh, Minor, Correll, Lee, or Colorado's Regina Thomson--seemed to be getting an explanation from the RNC about how or why the precise number of states the RNC needed to back out were able to do so. ""If the roll call failed, we were prepared to be done at that point!"" Minor exclaimed. ""I would have seen it as the final nail, and we wouldn't have gone any further. But they didn't even allow the vote."" He hadn't heard a word of explanation about what went down. ""I don't know if there was arm-twisting. I don't know if there even were three states that withdrew. This is all happening behind the scenes."" On the other side of the floor near the Colorado delegation, reporters had cornered Unruh so far back against the wall that she was leaning against the short glass barrier to the MSNBC set. Hardball's Chris Matthews, sitting in his anchor's chair, simply leaned back and had an ear directly to her face. Had anyone told her what had happened? ""No, of course not,"" Unruh said. ""And we deserve to know that, actually. We deserve to know who the states were and who the people were that they peeled off."" I talked to a source on the floor with Trump and the RNC--""We're married, there's no difference, we're all together""--who'd whipped delegates to withdraw their signatures. He showed me a Post-It note on which were scribbled the four delegations that actually withdrew: Minnesota, Iowa, the District of Columbia, and Maine. (The RNC confirmed these were the delegations.) ""We just went up to [delegates who signed the petitions] and said, 'Hey, do you know what you signed?' "" the source said. ""And a lot of them didn't know what they signed. Some of them thought they signed a petition that was pro-Trump, some of them thought they signed a petition that was anti-Trump, some of them thought they signed a petition that would change one rule or another rule."" What they did, he explained, was have them sign a form of their own that would take their name off the withdrawal petition. Who knows how they pitched that. Still speaking to reporters nearby, Kendal Unruh asked a friend to grab her purse by her seat, because she worried about someone trying to dig through it. ""The RNC doesn't want chaos in the party, but they create the chaos,"" she said. ""We had Trump people looking over our delegates' shoulders taking pictures of their texts. We had Trump delegates that were standing back to deny us access."" ""This entire system,"" she concluded, ""is rigged to force the vote for Donald Trump."" She insisted, though, that she's not out of plays yet. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Missing Secretary. The Disappearing Signatures. How the GOP Rolled the Anti-Trumpers.
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/mike_pence_s_religion_why_the_trump_vp_pick_is_quiet_about_his_beliefs.html	"Way back in 1994, when Mike Pence was a twice-defeated candidate for Congress, an unemployed dad trying to launch a syndicated radio show, and an entry on nobody's VP shortlist, he told a reporter about casting his first vote in a presidential election. It was 1980, Carter vs. Reagan, and Pence could only chuckle that he'd gone with the wrong man. He'd voted for Carter, Pence explained, because he ""was a good Christian. Beyond that, there was a sense of, 'Why would you elect a movie star?' "" These days, Pence talks about Reagan a bit differently. During his recent (and successful) audition to be the running mate of a television star, Pence paid Donald Trump the highest sort of Republican praise. ""I think he is someone who has connected with everyday Americans like no one since Ronald Reagan,"" Pence told reporters. That Gipper pivot says a lot about how Pence has shifted over the years, as he's moved from the media to Congress to the Indiana statehouse--how he's become less candid, less human, and more shamelessly fixated on stoking his career. Pence's religious beliefs still shape his politics as surely as they did when he voted for Carter. But as part of this transformation, he has alloyed his faith with political expediency, keeping his evangelicalism at the center of his worldview, even as he's become ever less willing to discuss it. Pence has a strange conversion narrative. He grew up in a big Irish Catholic family of Democrats in central Indiana, serving as an altar boy, attending parochial schools, and idolizing another liberal president: JFK. But in 1978, while a freshman at Indiana's Hanover College, he converted to evangelical Christianity through the influence of a nondenominational fellowship group. ""I simply made a personal decision for Christ,"" Pence told me in 2012, when I was working on a profile of him after he'd won the gubernatorial race. Though he was now born-again, Pence's faith didn't transform quickly or simply. (Whose ever does?) Post-college, he kept attending Mass and worked as a youth minister at a Catholic church; he even applied to Washington, D.C.'s Catholic University with plans to become a priest. As late as 1994, Pence still described himself as ""a born-again, evangelical Catholic."" You don't see many of those, even in Indiana, but Pence's beliefs had not yet defined his politics. He'd gone through a second conversion in college, this one ideological. But the two conversions didn't always inform each other. After all, Pence voted for Carter because of his faith, but he still voted Democratic. Even when Pence ran for Congress in 1988 and 1990, in the twilight of the Reagan era, he didn't link his politics and his faith. Both campaigns focused more on his opponent's lucrative reliance on PACs than on anything remotely religious. After those losses, Pence stepped away from politics. He ran a successful Indiana think tank, then created an even more successful talk-radio show, a format in which he honed his serene demeanor and his disciplined sloganeering, two skills that have made him a remarkably effective communicator (with a few memorable exceptions). During this period, Pence's faith also solidified. In the mid-'90s, he started taking his family to an evangelical megachurch in Indianapolis. He coined his most durable slogan, describing himself as ""Christian, conservative, Republican--in that order."" He began to approach politics with a more activist bent, as abortion replaced special-interest cash as a chief matter of concern. Asked in 1995 to name the one person he'd like to have dinner with, Pence replied: ""Jesus Christ."" By the time he gave Congress another try, in 2000, it was clear that Pence had changed. He won the seat and held on for the next 12 years, eventually rising to third in the GOP's congressional leadership. But his faith stayed front and center. Pence refused to campaign on Sundays. He declined to dine solo with women who weren't his wife. (""It's about building a zone around your marriage,"" he told the Hill.) After 9/11, his first reaction was to gather his staff in prayer. Aides and other politicians often saw him reading his Bible, and Pence would cite specific verses to justify policy arguments. ""These have stood the test of time,"" he told one staffer. ""They have eternal value."" He was frank about the influence of his evangelicalism. ""My support for Israel stems largely from my personal faith,"" he told Congressional Quarterly in 2002. ""In the Bible, God promises Abraham, 'Those who bless you I will bless, and those who curse you I will curse.' "" During his time in Congress, Pence emerged as one of the most privately and publicly devout figures in Washington. But something changed when he ran for governor of Indiana. You could no longer get Pence to address his faith, past or present. When I interviewed him in 2012, I asked about the peculiarities in his religious biography; each time, he evaded. Could he help me understand his strange spiritual journey? ""I cherish my Catholic upbringing,"" he replied. Could he explain why his faith shifted again in the mid-'90s? ""We just felt drawn to worship at an evangelical church."" Could he define himself as a believer? ""I'm a pretty ordinary Christian, trying to make that faith real every day."" It was all pretty stunning to see. The man who once quoted Genesis 12:3 to justify his foreign policy was now speaking in phrases so platitudinous they felt ripped from the chorus of a particularly bad Christian rock song. But this was all by design. While reporting that profile, I learned of a private meeting Pence had held in the fall of 2010. With his closest aides, he'd plotted out how to run for governor--and how to downplay a record in Congress that included trying to defund Planned Parenthood and trying to block the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" among other social-conservative stands. Instead of highlighting those stands, as at least one adviser had urged him to do, Pence decided to sell himself as a technocratic ""jobs and schools"" candidate. I asked Pence about that meeting, too. ""It was a private meeting,"" he replied. Once elected, Pence began pushing a very different agenda. While the most notorious example came when he signed the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2015, Pence's faith has driven decisions big and small. It led him to sign a new anti-abortion law so restrictive that the American Civil Liberties Union is now suing the state. It led him to award a $3.5 million contract to Real Alternatives, a nonprofit that pushes abstinence education and urges pregnant women not to abort. ""My faith,"" Pence told me in 2012, ""has continued to be what I hope is the most important thing in my life."" Pence's beliefs have shifted at least twice--from his family's Catholicism to an idiosyncratic evangelical Christianity, and from that to a more hardened and ideological version of the same. If, as he insists, faith does indeed order his life, why did he stop being so open about it? Why strip the evangelizing from his evangelicalism? Good luck getting Pence to comment on that. The easiest answer seems to be that he decided that as his political ambitions grew his public religiosity needed to shrink. There are plenty of politicians who've made this same calculation, but few have tried to solve it with Pence's baggage--or with his bumbling approach. Recall the governor's infamous appearance on ABC's This Week in which he tried to defend the RFRA. When George Stephanopoulos asked him if the law licensed discrimination, Pence offered abstract and illogical defenses instead of addressing what most people, whether for or against, saw as the RFRA's true purpose--an extra defense for Christians who felt under attack by rapidly liberalizing attitudes toward LGBT rights. But Mike Pence, a man with presidential dreams, could no longer say that. And so the polished communicator simply melted down. Even now, as he starts the biggest role of his political life, Pence still doesn't know how to receive these questions other than by ducking. He's always been a better idealist than a careerist.

An assailant drove a truck through a crowd of Bastille Day revelers in Nice, killing at least 84 people and injuring hundreds of others. We know relatively little about the attacker, but authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are treating this as a terrorist attack. As are politicians. Here in the United States, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have made statements on the attack in Nice. And as was true with the killings in Dallas or the shooting in Orlando, their responses go to the core of their political personas. Which is another way of saying the obvious: Clinton is a traditional politician in every way you can imagine. Trump is a train wreck. Let's start with Clinton. The presumptive Democratic nominee went to CNN to talk terrorism with Anderson Cooper, and she stayed very much on message. When asked whether the U.S. was at war with terrorist groups, she disavowed a ground intervention in Syria and other ISIS-held territories and focused on more conventional counter-terrorism measures. ""I would be very focused on the intelligence surge,"" she said. ""I would be very focused on working with our partners and allies and intensify our efforts against the ideologues that peddle radical jihadism online."" When asked about the term radical Islam, she followed her line from previous interviews on the topic. ""We're at war against radical jihadists who use Islam to recruit and radicalize others in order to pursue their evil agenda,"" Clinton said. ""It's not so important what we call these people as what we do about them, and I think back to our success in getting Bin Laden. It was important that we built the case, we got the information, and the president ordered the raid."" And on the question of refugees to the United States, Clinton pushed back on the notion that terrorists could infiltrate the U.S. by posing as such. ""I would not short-circuit the vetting process,"" Clinton said. ""If we are talking about women, children, orphans who are fleeing horrific violence, that's a different category than young men or people who have some record that could be ferreted out as some concern."" Again, a typical response from a mainstream politician. Then there was Trump. As soon as news broke of the attack, Trump was out with a tweet: ""Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It's only getting worse."" As Trump tweets go, it's vague. But it's a clear reference to the real estate mogul's constant warnings about the threat from ""radical Islam."" (This, despite the lack of information on the attacker and his motives.) Shortly after this tweet, Trump made an announcement. He would postpone his vice presidential announcement, in honor of the victims. He then took to Fox News to speculate on this announcement (early reports said it was Indiana Gov. Mike Pence), while offering commentary and observations on the attack in Nice. When asked about this behavior the next morning, Trump adviser Paul Manafort explained that the presidential nominee ""emotionally reacted to [the attack], it really bothered him, and he felt the pain, just felt it was not right to do something self-serving and political the day after."" Hours later, Trump announced his vice presidential choice, as if he had never said he would be doing otherwise. And hours after that, several reporters revealed something remarkable: Around midnight on Friday, Trump was asking aides if he could back out of that vice presidential choice and shift gears. It's rare for a running mate to change the shape of a presidential race, but it's still a vital decision. The process of choosing a vice presidential nominee, as much as the person himself, tells us a great deal about the presidential candidate and how he would govern. That Trump would try to go back on his choice--at the moment that it's too late--doesn't inspire confidence about his ability to govern and undermines his carefully crafted message of strength and resolve. All of this is before we get to the nuts-and-bolts of the vice presidential rollout. As rumored and reported, Trump chose Pence. But there wasn't a plan for the announcement. As Politico's Shane Goldmacher explained on Twitter, Team Trump did little to prepare for Friday's public unveiling. There was no press release, no note on the website, no new domain for the ticket, no indication--anywhere--that Pence was actually involved in the Trump campaign. Nor was there pushback to Democratic attacks on Pence, which came fast and furious. You can look at the past 24 hours as a test for Trump. How would he make one of the biggest decisions of his campaign? How would he react in the event of a crisis? The answer is simple. Poorly. Read more of Slate's election coverage."

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/donald_trump_s_un_american_acceptance_speech_at_the_republican_national.html	"I am your voice ... the mystical union of leader and nation. Really, that refrain is the essence of Trump's authoritarian threat. Thursday night's halting, stagy address may not sound entirely like the improvisational Trump, the true Trump, but it distills the man and his program. And in the end, the program doesn't really matter. That's because the inchoate threat keeps changing--Mexican rapists, Islamic terrorists, Black Lives Matter. It's all just an anarchic mess, beyond the technocratic solutions proposed by desiccated, politically correct elites. These problems can only be solved by a tough leader, a messianic figure from beyond the system. The threats keep changing, but after so many months of running for president, Trump's solutions have never evolved. They remain just as flimsy and rhetorical as they were when he started, when he didn't have a policy shop or speechwriters. The solutions still amount to the promise that Trump will win, that his leadership prowess is the palliative, all else is trivial. I alone can fix it. The sense of crisis is everything for Trump--even if it's largely invented. His depiction of darkness justifies his candidacy, the need to violently shake the system. His ability to conjure fear is what distinguished him from all those career pols he has vanquished. And it suits his ego. He turned down every entreaty to run for president, beginning in the late 1980s, waiting for the moment when the sense of despair justified his entry into the game. He is the chieftain of destiny. Everything will change for the good with his delivery of the oath of office. Americans will finally wake up ... Trump uses the phrase America First, only dimly aware that he is repeating a phrase from the interwar years and indifferent to its historic resonances. But he compulsively echoes that period--another time when leaders described the world in apocalyptic terms. He harps on the need for national regeneration; he decries the disorder that cannot be remedied by conventional politics; he touts faith in what the historian of fascism Robert O. Paxton calls ""the efficacy of the will."" All we need to do is start believing. There was a strangely foreign quality to Trump's address, despite its overt nationalism. He didn't ground his narrative in American history; he didn't invoke any leaders or episodes from the national past. Indeed, he didn't even mention the troops in uniform, a stock trope of acceptance speeches. Although he repeatedly led the crowd in chanting USA, USA, there was little sense of American exceptionalism--the pluralistic form of American nationalism that forms the bipartisan basis for our political rhetoric at the presidential level. No talk about a light unto the nations. Aside from his quite striking defense of the LGBTQ community, there was nothing that hinted at expanding freedom to new quarters of the country. Everything in his speech pointed in the other direction--away from American leadership abroad, away from minorities seeking more respectful treatment in the national conservation. But the point isn't really America. The Republican Party is now his, another Trump piece of real estate. It's easy to imagine how the government would become the same--a blurring of man and state.  To save the nation from the brink of doom, he would do what it takes, whatever it takes. That is, after all, the totality of his platform. I am your voice.

It is, after all, the network that blamed a hoodie for the death of Trayvon Martin and claimed that poor people have it pretty good if they've got a refrigerator. We'd all probably be better off if we shut off Sean Hannity and Megyn Kelly and watched sports or nature documentaries or talked to our families. This does not have to be a hypothetical.

She was quite surprised, then, to find her mother becoming an increasingly attentive Fox News viewer. Abby felt she had no choice: The child unleashed the power of parental lock on her own mother. After Abby's mother called her cable operator to ask why the channel wasn't working, Abby revealed that she had blocked it. The mother and daughter then had the opportunity to ""have a conversation about whether it was a good news source or not.""

Sessions was talking about Ted Cruz and Cruz's supposedly wounded feelings Thursday morning, and for the second time in 12 hours, Sessions found himself pissed off at his Texas colleague. We were speaking after a Texas delegation breakfast in downtown Cleveland, where in front of a roomful of angry delegates from his home state, Cruz had just finished defending his decision not to endorse Trump. Sessions, a leader in the House, had sat stone-faced throughout. ""Ted wants to justify his own actions in a way that I am sure is honorable. But in the process of being honorable, you can dishonor the greater good,"" Sessions told me. ""Ted wants his ideas to be more powerful than the team's. And I am for the team."" Sessions has served in the Texas congressional delegation with Cruz for nearly four years. ""It is very consistent behavior."" After the stunt Cruz pulled the previous night, this conference room in a downtown Marriott was perhaps the only place in Cleveland that might have let him in the door unharmed. That didn't mean he'd be unconditionally embraced, though. ""You have the right, and even the duty, to hold me accountable,"" Cruz began. ""That's why I'm here this morning. It would be the easiest thing in the world to turn tail and run. But that ain't gonna happen."" Anyone who expected Cruz to apologize for or amend his nonendorsement knows absolutely nothing about Ted Cruz. He feeds on the enmity of his political peers or those he would deem less principled than he. It's exactly what his supporters love and his detractors hate about him. Though the group of folks gathered at the Marriott may all be supporters when his targets are, say, Mitch McConnell or Barack Obama, they broke down into heated factions over Trump. ""Last night, when I addressed the convention, I addressed the convention because Donald Trump asked me to,"" he explained. ""And when Donald asked me to, he didn't ask me to endorse. And indeed three days ago I talked on the phone with him and told him, 'I'm not going to endorse you.' "" ""WHY NOT?"" a delegate shouted out. ""That's right!"" someone seconded. ""Sir, I'm happy to answer that, but I'm not going to engage in a screaming fight,"" Cruz responded. After saying his piece, in which he noted how ""dismaying"" it was to hear pro-Trump delegates boo a line that suggested voters should obey their consciences and vote for candidates who will uphold the Constitution, Cruz moved to questions. At first, he seemed to leave open the possibility of one day supporting Trump: He was merely a spectator, he suggested, and he would adjust his stance as events developed. ""I am watching, and listening, to make that decision"" about which candidate he'll eventually support. He did clarify that he will not be voting for Hillary Clinton, though, and he promised not to campaign against Trump or lob missiles his way. But his dispassionate constitutionalist shtick--as if he were waiting for Trump to clarify his position on the 10th Amendment or whatever--didn't last long under duress. Attendees soon heard what this was really about, or at least to what Cruz had shifted his excuse as questioning went on and became more heated. ""You signed a pledge that said you would support the party nominee,"" another delegate, former La Marque Mayor Geraldine Sam, said to him. ""You've said your word is your bond. And if you didn't believe it ... you shouldn't have said it. I supported you, and I expected you to keep your word and say that your word is your bond."" ""Hear, hear!"" a nearby delegate shouted. Another let out a loud whistle, and the room broke out in applause. ""Thank you for speaking, and speaking from your heart,"" Cruz said warmly before transmogrifying into his more lawyerly self. ""I'll tell you the day that pledge was abrogated,"" he said. ""The day that was abrogated was the day this became personal. ... I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. And that pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm gonna nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.' "" The crowd seemed to soften. The chivalrous Texan appeal to honor was resonating with a large chunk of the crowd. Geraldine Sam was not among them. An older black woman, she waved off Cruz's excuses about Trump dishonoring his family. ""I was called the N-word--'How'd that N-word get into office?' My life was threatened while I was mayor of La Marque. I still support my city, I still support the citizens of my city, I still walk around with a smile on my face."" She continued, irritated: ""My family was called words"" far worse than anything Trump said about Cruz or his family. ""The black community, people were hung on trees, but we're here. We were tarred and feathered for the right to read. My mother, when she grew up, could neither read nor write because it was against the law for her to read and write. Guess what: We grew up. And that's what it's all about."" She'll never support Cruz again. As arguments broke out in the hallway outside the ballroom, sometimes with tears streaming down the faces of conflicted delegates, Rep. Michael Burgess, also in attendance, tried to make sense of the mess. He has a bond with Cruz and looked at the situation with a little more empathy than Sessions. ""I was a Cruz supporter when he first ran for Senate,"" Burgess said. ""I think I was the only one in the Texas delegation who supported him--certainly the only one who was returning [to Congress] to support him, maybe Ron Paul did as well."" Burgess is a ""believer in his ability to fight and stand up and do what he believes is the right thing."" He paused. ""After the primary in Indiana, I had hoped that there could be a detente of some sort between the Trump camp and the Cruz camp. I think the wounds are too deep and too fresh, and I think that's what we heard this morning."" ""I've run political races before,"" he continued. ""I've said things that were phrased inartfully. I've said things that I would've liked to have taken back. But that's not part of it. You can't do that."" Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/mike_pence_worships_a_new_god_donald_trump.html	"Woody Allen used to tell this story in his stand-up act: He once went to work at a white, gentile ad agency. The pay was $95 a week. The job was ""to sit in their office and to look Jewish."" Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, has a similar role in Donald Trump's presidential campaign. His job as Trump's running mate is to stand next to the nominee and look Christian. Trump is on his third wife, thinks ""Two Corinthians"" is a book of the Bible, and made a fortune running casinos. He needs a character witness. The witness is Pence. In his speech to the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night, Pence talked about the economy, terrorism, and law and order. But his chief message was God. ""I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order,"" he began. ""I was raised to believe in hard work, in faith and family. ... The most important job I'll ever have is spelled D-A-D."" Pence vouched for Trump's humility, respectfulness, and ""devotion to his family."" He pledged to ""pray daily"" and keep ""faith that God can still heal our land."" The words you'll hear a lot from Pence, when he talks about Trump, are ""this good man."" Pence used that phrase in an interview with Sean Hannity on Friday, an introductory rally with Trump on Saturday, a joint 60 Minutes interview on Sunday, and his convention speech on Wednesday. In an address to the American Conservative Union on Tuesday, Pence said ""this good man"" four times. ""I have a sense of this man. I have a sense of his heart,"" Pence told the ACU audience. ""It's time for us to come together, time for us to come together around this good man."" The idea that's being projected for public consumption is that Pence's values somehow rub off on Trump. But what's actually happening is the reverse. Pence came into the Trump campaign with some firmly stated principles. In less than a week, to conform to his new boss, he has bent them. Last fall, after the Nov. 13 terror attack in Paris, Pence and other Republican governors tried to halt the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states. But in December, when Trump proposed a ""complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" Pence balked. ""Comments that suggest that Muslims should be banned from the United States are offensive and unconstitutional,"" said Pence. ""The United States cannot and should not discriminate on the basis of religion. The free exercise of religion is at the very heart of our constitutional guarantee for all persons of this country."" In May, when Pence was asked again about Trump's proposal, the governor replied: ""I've had more than a few battles with a Republican president. ... I am not immune [to] disagreeing with people who otherwise I support."" Now that Pence has joined the ticket, however, his tune has changed. In the 60 Minutes interview, he snapped into line: Lesley Stahl: Mr. Trump, you have called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. [To Pence] Do you agree with that? Pence: I do. In fact, in Indiana we suspended the Syrian refugee program in the wake of the terrorist attack. We have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of this country, and Donald Trump is right to articulate that view. Trump told Stahl he could get around the religious discrimination problem by phrasing the ban in terms of ""territories."" The conversation proceeded: Stahl: So not Muslims? Trump: You know, the Constitution--there's nothing like it. But it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide as a country, OK? ... We're not gonna allow the people to come into our country. ... And if people want to come in, there's gonna be extreme vetting. ... Pence: [to Stahl] You just asked me if I'm comfortable with that. And I am. Pence also softened his position on torture. On July 15, 2008--exactly eight years before he was named to the ticket--Pence, then serving as an Indiana congressman, spoke at a House hearing on rules for questioning detainees. Pence defended the use of pressure in interrogations, but he laid down two rules. The first was no torture: ""Torture is illegal. Torture is banned by various provisions of the law. I support that."" The second rule was no defiance of international law. Interrogations, Pence argued, must be conducted in a way ""that shows our devotion to the rule of law, our veneration for the Geneva Convention[s]."" These principles, too, have melted. On 60 Minutes, Pence repeatedly refused to draw lines against Trump's proposed use of torture: Stahl: Mr. Trump wants to bring back waterboarding, and, quote, ""a hell of a lot more."" Are you [Pence] comfortable with bringing back waterboarding? Pence: I don't think we should ever tell our enemy what our tactics are. ... Stahl: But are you OK with the idea of waterboarding? Pence: I think enhanced interrogation saved lives. Stahl: And you're OK with that? Pence: What I'm OK with is protecting the American people. What I'm OK with is, when people have the intent to come to this country and take American lives, that we are prepared to do what's necessary to gain the information to protect the people of this country-- At this point, Trump interjected, complaining that ISIS fighters ""chop off heads [and] drown people in steel cages, and we can't do waterboarding."" The exchanged continued: Stahl: Would you use their techniques? Trump: Those techniques get information. I don't care what anyone says. Stahl: [to Pence] Are you agreeing with him? Pence: What I can tell you is, enhanced interrogation gleaned information that saved American lives and--I was informed--prevented incoming terrorist attacks on this country from being successful. The American people expect the president of the United States to be prepared to support action to protect the people of this nation. And I know Donald Trump will. Stahl: Have you answered me? Pence: I have. What we're seeing in this interview is corruption. We often think of corruption as an institutional process, usually involving money. But in this case, corruption is simply the surrender of principle in the face of power. Trump and Pence sit side by side, the candidate and his Christian adviser. The religious man is supposed to be guiding the irreligious one. Instead, it's Pence who capitulates. He will no longer criticize the proposed ban on Muslims. He will no longer draw a line against torture. He supports whatever Trump thinks is ""necessary."" He dares not contradict the boss. In this room, only one god is being heard. This scene, this genuflection of one man before another, is a warning. It's what happens when you worship power. It's what happens when you use religion to glorify a man rather than change him. Across the Republican Party, one politician after another is bowing to a new god, a god who preaches religious enmity, ethnic conflict, violence, and torture.

19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/ted_cruz_s_refusal_to_endorse_donald_trump_will_make_him_a_conservative.html	"So many Republicans who've condemned Donald Trump as a demagogue, a boor, a con man, and a racist have nevertheless endorsed him that it's hardly surprising that the delegates assembled at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night expected Ted Cruz to do the same. But he didn't. Trump's devotees were so livid about Cruz's pointed refusal to endorse Trump that Ken Cuccinelli, a Cruz ally, felt moved to escort Ted's wife, Heidi Cruz, away from the convention floor. There are possibly apocryphal stories floating around of an angry Trump supporter who had to be restrained from clocking Cruz in the jaw, and of a billionaire donor who barred Cruz from entering his suite and, presumably, from raiding the minibar. We can safely say that Cruz would do well to leave Cleveland posthaste, unless he wants to be tarred and feathered by ornery Trumpublicans. The irony here is that, in the opening months of the Republican race, it was Cruz who did a great deal to legitimize Trump's candidacy in the eyes of conservatives. As Republican strategist Curt Anderson told Washington Examiner columnist Byron York, ""while others were attempting to stop Trump, Cruz was complimenting him and sucking up to him."" Anderson and other Republican insiders now say that Cruz is once again proving too clever for his own good--that all he's done is make himself look like a disloyal snake. Yes, Trump may have accused Cruz's father of having been involved in the assassination of JFK. And yes, Trump did retweet a crude insult of Cruz's wife's appearance. None of this matters, because Cruz once pledged to support the GOP nominee. Granted, Cruz made that pledge before Trump's personal attacks on his family, and Trump made it clear that he had no intention of honoring the pledge that he himself had made, but, er, MALFUNCTION MALFUNCTION. Someone please call Newt to explain away these contradictions! I mean, at the very least Cruz should have let Trump know that he wasn't planning to endorse him. Um, actually, Cruz did let Trump know that well before his speech, and Trump gave Cruz a speaking slot regardless. Eliana Johnson of National Review reported that Cruz wasn't going to endorse Trump days before the speech, and one hopes that someone on Trump's staff reads the conservative press. OK, let's leave aside the question of whether Cruz's refusal to endorse Trump onstage was kosher. Since Republicans have united behind Trump's candidacy, how can Cruz possibly recover from such a brazen act of disloyalty? Well, as recently as a few weeks ago, 48 percent of Republicans wanted the delegates at the RNC to somehow deny Trump the GOP presidential nomination. Not all of the 51 percent of Republicans who felt otherwise were enthusiastic about the prospect of a Trump candidacy either. Though many of the Republican delegates gathered in Cleveland were enraged by Cruz's non-endorsement, one suspects that a decent-size slice of the Republican primary electorate was cheering him on. If Donald Trump defeats Hillary Clinton and proves wildly popular in office, all bets are off. Ted Cruz's political career may well be over. But if Trump is elected and his presidency is seen as a failure, or if Clinton is elected despite her grave political weaknesses, Cruz has put himself in a pretty decent position to run for the GOP presidential nomination once again. Cruz's great weakness throughout the Republican primaries is that though he enjoyed the support of hard-right conservatives and churchgoing evangelical Christians, constituencies that overlap, more moderate Republicans found him repellent. Cruz has now earned himself a second look from Republicans by zagging where Marco Rubio and Scott Walker zigged. None of this is to suggest that Cruz's path to the White House will be an easy one. He's still really weird and awkward. But Cruz doesn't need to be elected president to have a big impact on the country. Jay Cost of the Weekly Standard, one of Donald Trump's most scathing detractors in conservative media, has compared Cruz's non-endorsement to Ted Kennedy's stirring speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, which offered a full-throated defense of liberalism without also offering anything more than pro forma congratulations to Jimmy Carter, the Democratic nominee. That speech helped cement Kennedy as a liberal icon. If Trump goes down in November, Cruz's Wednesday night speech could make him the GOP's conservative standard-bearer for years to come. Not a bad consolation prize for Cryin' Ted. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Ted Cruz Just Made Himself a Conservative Icon--and Perhaps the GOP's 2020 Nominee

Not that she, in the sleepy-eyed neurosurgeon's view, is morally compromised. Not that she has evil intentions for the nation. That she actually harbors sympathies for the fallen angel, Lucifer, himself. Carson's ""receipts,"" as we're calling proof these days, for this unholy alliance were rather ingenious. Clinton's senior thesis, he said, endorses the work of noted community organizer Saul Alinsky, to such an extent that he ""affected all of her philosophy subsequently."" Alinsky wrote a book called Rules for Radicals. This book is, in turn, dedicated to Lucifer, ""the original radical,"" as Carson paraphrased Alinsky, ""who gained his own kingdom."" (The book actually uses a winking line about Lucifer as one of three epigraphs, more on which in a moment.) So Clinton is dedicated to Alinsky, and Alinsky is dedicated to ... you see where this is going. Carson said:"	Come on, Ben Carson. Lucifer Is Totally a Republican.
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/the_co_designer_of_hillary_s_logo_discusses_the_trump_pence_logo.html	"Last week, the Trump campaign was reamed for a logo released after the selection of Mike Pence as vice presidential candidate. The design featured Trump's ""T"" plunging into the ready orifice of Pence's ""P."" Mocked endlessly on social media, the logo was speedily replaced with a simpler, less suggestive logo that merely shows the candidates on top of each other. Slate emailed Jesse Reed, who along with Michael Bierut co-designed Hillary Clinton's campaign logo, for his thoughts on the logo and its walk of shame. The conversation has been lightly edited. What was your immediate reaction to the initial logo? Before saying anything, I should state that the sight, thought, and sound of Donald Trump makes me physically ill. But I like talking about logos, so here we go. The [original] identity resembles a student project. The word America is in the slogan, so stripes were a go-to move. The combination of letterforms is awkward and, without stating the obvious, signals some sort of penetration. Maybe that's my favorite part. Formally, the mark is poorly drawn--the ""T"" has a different thickness than the stripes, and the bottom stripe tries but fails to identify the letterforms as the stars on a flag. It follows the tradition of cliches that we've seen in many campaign design languages, but they went the extra mile and hired a sophomore in design school who recently learned Adobe Illustrator. What do you think about the contrast between the penetration logo and Trump's pre-VP logo, which was much simpler? I used to think the first logo looked cheap, but there was almost something refreshing and unpretentious about that. But the penetration logo's symbol was more involved than anything I can remember seeing since the Obama ""O"" rising sun. I imagine there was a conversation, or demand, to introduce something ""iconic"" into the brand. Someone said the name alone wasn't enough or lacked power, and the addition of a running mate provided this opportunity. There are benefits to a symbol that a wordmark lacks, such as a reduction in size. But the complexity of this mark would complicate such uses. People said the penetration logo was reminiscent of clothing logos. Do you agree? It almost made sense for Trump, given his interest in status symbols. If I'm being honest, I thought the same thing. American clothing labels have been using a flag motif on polo shirts since I can remember, which started when my mom would drag me to T.J. Maxx in fifth grade. An American flag reference, plus the addition of two initials--reminiscent of T.H., R.L., etc.--conjures an association that's difficult to deny. Additionally, the entire configuration is very static; there's nothing else it can do. It quite literally would be perfect to embroider on a polo, but as a mode of larger visual language, it's limiting. And as many clients will often do, Trump could have very well said, ""Yeah, make it like the Tommy Hilfiger logo; that's a solid brand."" Nothing against Tommy--I love those clothes! If you were designing a logo for Trump and Pence, would you have tried to intertwine them in the way that they initially tried to do? People have been cracking jokes about the penetration, but it really is weirdly suggestive of a kind of closeness that we know isn't there substantively or personally, as well as maybe an equal partnership moving forward. We know that's not happening. Again, I'm more opposed to Trump than I am to touching subway poles during flu season, but there was a huge missed opportunity in their solution. They were given the graphic designer's gift of having the same amount of letters in both names. I would have kept the size and spacing the same and simply shifted the weight. Typographically speaking, there could have been a very sophisticated treatment of the two names that is stronger than some weird monogram having intercourse. Again, it's kind of my favorite part. What kind of considerations should be made in general when adding a VP's name to signage? I think they should be on a level of general equality, but there are other ways to establish dominance: color, weight, style--serif, slabs, italics, bold, thin, and so on. Shit, I hope Trump doesn't read this and get any ideas! What do you think about adding the tagline at the bottom? I think it's weak. It's also bullshit. How do you think they handled the switch to the new intercourse-free logo? This is classic.

On Tuesday night, the tweet ticker at the Quicken Loans Arena flashed a message from the white nationalist group VDARE: ""Rep. Chris Collins has the crowd fired up against illegal immigration and for @realDonaldTrump."" At any other convention this would be a headline-making disaster; here it was just a blip. In the midst of all this ugliness, Chris Christie's prosecutorial jeremiad against Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night, and the baying bloodlust of the audience, might seem normal. It is not normal. Christie began by criticizing the Obama administration for failing to hold Clinton accountable for her ""dismal record"" as secretary of state. ""Tonight, as a former federal prosecutor, I welcome the opportunity to hold Hillary Rodham Clinton accountable for her performance and her character,"" said Christie. The crowd erupted in chants of ""LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!"" while Christie smiled and nodded. ""Give me a few more minutes, we'll get there,"" he continued. ""Here's what we're going to do. We're gonna present the facts to you, you, tonight, sitting as a jury of her peers, both in this hall and in your living rooms around our nation."" A series of charges followed. Some, like Clinton's mishandling of Libya, were at least partly legitimate. Others were bizarre. At one point, Christie faulted Clinton's response to the mass kidnapping of schoolgirls in Nigeria, which happened after she left office. After each accusation, he asked, ""Is she guilty or not guilty?"" Each time, the crowd roared, ""Guilty!"" Certainly, there's nothing new about Republicans hating Clinton; they've been doing it for decades. Nevertheless, American presidential campaigns are not typically built around the dream of jailing the opposing candidate. Prime-time convention speakers usually pay lip service to the cliche of disagreeing without being disagreeable. Convention planners have not, in the past, staged their events like fantasy show trials. They have not sought to work their crowds into ecstasies of hatred. Those chants of ""LOCK HER UP!"" might be common among conservatives nowadays, but we haven't seen their like at a modern political convention. Christie's speech was logically incoherent. Even if you buy his damning interpretation of Clinton's foreign policy errors, it doesn't make sense to discuss them as matters of criminal malfeasance. Emotionally, though, that's  in keeping with how Clinton's bitterest foes talk about her: as a person of absolute corruption, who, through some sort of occult trick, moves through the world with intolerable impunity. As many people pointed out on Twitter, the way that Christie punctuated his inquisitorial brief with the crowd's cries of ""Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!"" made him sound less like a contemporary politician than a magistrate condemning a witch. Hating Hillary is the great theme of this gathering. T-shirts and buttons for sale around the convention revel in it: ""Hillary for Prison,"" ""Life's a Bitch--Don't Vote For One,"" ""I Don't Often Hate, but When I Do... I Prefer To Hate Hillary Clinton."" It's the one thing that binds together the GOP now that its nominee has blithely jettisoned many of the party's central principles. It is also, in its dehumanizing fervor, inescapably intertwined with misogyny. It's not that Republicans don't hate men--they obviously despise Barack Obama. But their loathing of Clinton is even more primal. They want to see her not just beaten but destroyed and humiliated, dressed in an orange jumpsuit and locked away. And what we saw on Tuesday night was the delirious loathing of the torch-bearing mob. Indeed, just after I wrote the above line, Ben Carson took the stage and tried to link Hillary Clinton to Satan, via her college hero, Saul Alinsky. ""Are we willing to elect as president somebody who has as their role model somebody who acknowledges Lucifer?"" he asked. The Trump campaign has a way of turning dog whistles into howls, of making the subtext text; this time it happened within the course of two hours. Compared to Carson's speech, Christie's seems almost ordinary. In the age of Trump, what was jarring  at the beginning of the night is no longer remarkable by the end. That should shock us all."

Assuming Donald Trump loses in November, as seems more likely than not, one can certainly imagine the GOP descending into a civil war. Pro-Trump Republicans might blame anti-Trump Republicans for a narrow defeat. Republicans of a libertarian bent might blame GOP populists for Trump's rise, and the populists might start blasting the libertarians as RINOs. With such a divided party, and with a brand so tarnished by Trump's noxious rhetoric, how could Republicans ever recover? It's pretty simple. Republicans will recover because if Hillary Clinton is elected president, something will go wrong on her watch, and voters will blame her whether she is responsible for that failure or not. When this happens, swing voters will turn to the GOP. They won't do this out of any great enthusiasm for the Republican message, to be sure. But they'll do it, because they will have only one serious opposition party to choose from. America's two major political parties, and the politicians who campaign under their banner, can be awfully flexible. Take Rudy Giuliani, one of the ""stars"" of Monday night's underwhelming lineup of GOP speakers. Over the course of a long political career, Giuliani has gone from suing the federal government to shield unauthorized immigrants from deportation to endorsing a presidential candidate who has made mass deportation the centerpiece of his campaign. Has Giuliani ever bothered to explain his change of heart? Of course not, because his rationale is blindingly obvious. When he was running for mayor in a mostly liberal, majority-minority city, Giuliani had to convince voters that he wasn't a heartless right-wing ogre. By the time he addressed the Republican National Convention in 2004, however, he had left local politics behind. With an eye toward the future, Giuliani offered a stirring defense of George W. Bush's freedom agenda in Iraq and Afghanistan. A few years later, when he ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2008, Giuliani tried to energize hawkish conservatives by bashing Ron Paul's isolationism. Now, in the age of Trump, he's attacking Hillary Clinton for waging a reckless war in Libya, and for not putting America First. The mind reels--until you realize that Giuliani represents just one of the more brazen examples of a common phenomenon. He is an opportunist. And in politics, as in most endeavors, opportunists usually prosper. People don't generally think of themselves as craven opportunists, and I'm pretty sure that Rudy Giuliani believed everything he yelled at the assembled delegates on Monday night. But elections are about winning, and when the playing field changes, politicians either change with it or they die a slow, principled death. One of the reasons Trump is the Republican presidential nominee is that the party's leading lights--the Paul Ryans, Ted Cruzes, and Marco Rubios--failed to fully grasp the implications of Barack Obama's rise. To massively oversimplify matters, Obama has made the Democratic Party more attractive to college-educated social liberals who've fared well economically in recent years while further entrenching the party's advantage among minority voters who feel they're better off than their parents. At the same time, he's made the Democratic brand far less congenial for working-class whites, particularly those of a more culturally conservative bent. These voters often don't feel better off than their parents, and they're pretty pessimistic about America's Obama-ized future. White working-class voters have long been the heart of the Democratic primary electorate, but that's far less true today than it was as recently as eight years ago. In a recent article in National Review, political strategist Luke Thompson details how Hillary Clinton forged a powerful alliance of white working-class men and women and moderate suburbanites to nearly win the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. Yet Clinton was bested by Barack Obama, who built a rival coalition that united college-educated whites and minority voters. Had the Democrats not already lost large numbers of white working-class voters in previous years, it is hard to imagine this Obama coalition prevailing. But the Democrats moved to the left during the Bush years, and Obama's presidency cemented this shift. According to Thompson, the policy agenda pursued by Obama on issues ranging from energy (coal sucks) to immigration (more please) to free trade (for it) delighted the voters that won him the Democratic nomination while alienating many of the white working-class voters who had backed Clinton. The result is that many of these voters found themselves politically homeless, and open to the right pitch from a Republican. Back in December, Nate Cohn of the New York Times found that Obama-hating white ex-Democrats played a big part in Donald Trump's early success in the polls. Had it not been for these Democratic defectors, perhaps Trump would have been a mere footnote. These inter-party shifts have happened before. In The Lost Majority, political analyst Sean Trende made the deceptively simple argument that neither of our two major political parties will ever win a permanent victory, and he proves his point by documenting all of the supposedly durable partisan majorities that have faded away in decades past. The most successful political parties are expansive coalitions that include many different groups. Almost inevitably, these different groups have clashing interests. Holding these coalitions together is really hard, not least because the opposing coalition is always trying to woo dissenters. If we look at the Democratic and Republican parties as they stand right now, it's easy to see why many Republicans are feeling so dour about their party's prospects. The GOP relies heavily on older non-college-educated white voters, and this is a constituency that will represent a declining share of the electorate over the coming decades. Democrats, meanwhile, do well with groups that are expected to grow, like Latinos and college-educated whites. Over time, however, tensions and contradictions are likely to emerge within the Democratic coalition. Imagine if young working-class Latinos who back Democrats start backing candidates who want to raise taxes on the rich to finance social services designed to benefit their growing families. At least some aging upper-middle-class whites might object to these calls for higher taxes, and they'll start thinking very hard about backing anti-tax Republicans. Granted, there will be some older upper-middle-class whites who started voting for Democrats in their youth and who'd never defect, regardless of the implications for their pocketbooks. But there will always be some who'll be willing to bolt, and political professionals will work hard to pry them loose. Don't believe that the post-Trump GOP will ever be able to pick off some of today's Democratic voters? Don't forget that George W. Bush led the United States into a quagmire in Iraq that led to the deaths of thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. Bush then presided over the greatest economic calamity since the Great Depression. Those disasters didn't prevent Republicans from doing really well in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections. And if Republicans had nominated almost anyone other than Trump this year, including creepy Ted Cruz, they'd have a better-than-even chance of recapturing the White House. Did Republicans bounce back from the low ebb they reached at the end of the Bush presidency by devising bold, innovative policies for America's future? Not really. Throughout the Obama years, congressional Republicans have barely kept it together, divided between those who want to shrink popular government programs and those who are so serious about wanting to shrink popular government programs that they are willing to force the United States government to default on its debt obligations to get their way. Nevertheless, Republicans have won elections by appealing to white working-class voters, and they'll keep working that angle for as long as they can. Sooner or later, the GOP will have to retool itself to reach other constituencies, too. But that will likely be easier than you think to pull off. For one thing, native-born working-class Latinos are not totally unlike their white counterparts, and they might be open to some of the same political appeals. If Trump drives America's college-educated upper-middle class to the Democrats, Republicans just might start calling for hiking taxes on the college-educated upper-middle class to finance child credits for growing Latino families. And have you noticed that Republicans don't talk about Obamacare nearly as much as they used to?

Since the vast majority of delegates are bound, there's really no need for this in-person ceremony of humans shouting out their required votes, other than to offer each delegation a 20-second pitch about the greatness of their home state. The RNC and the Trump campaign would quite prefer that there be no opportunity for nationally televised human agency and that a final vote be announced simply, with no frills. Because there will still be anti-Trumpers, spurned, looking to humiliate the Trump-RNC axis.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/melania_trump_was_bad_all_the_other_speakers_were_terrifying.html	"CLEVELAND--The first day of the Republican National Convention opened in chaos and ended in disaster. We've covered the chaos, but the disaster requires a little explanation. That night, the headline speech belonged to Melania Trump, Donald Trump's wife. Even with Trump's rock-god entrance, the address itself was standard fare--a political wife softening her husband's image and introducing him to the world at large. She hailed his decency, asserted his kindness, and praised him as an ideal husband and father. She didn't stun, but she didn't fail either, giving the best address of the night. Until it unraveled. A Twitter user discovered that at least two paragraphs of Melania's speech had been plagiarized from Michelle Obama's speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2008. Side-by-side video confirmed the stunning similarities. What was poised to be a triumphant night for the Trump campaign abruptly turned into a fiasco. At the time of this writing, Trump and the Republican National Committee were still defending Melania's plagiarism, doubling down in a remarkable display of stubborn intransigence. There's no way to spin this as good for the Trump campaign. It's a disaster, full stop. But there is surely at least some upside in the idea that the media is talking about a plagiarism scandal instead of the parade of ethno-nationalist bigotry that defined all of the rest of Monday night. If you watched the RNC on television, you saw the highlights--Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump, Melania Trump, and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst. But if you were there, in the audience, you saw the full array of speakers. And the overriding theme was fear--fear of a brown horde. Let's start from the top. After forgettable speeches from D-list celebrities such as Scott Baio (most famous, at present, for tweeting a sexist photo of Hillary Clinton) and Antonio Sabato Jr. (a one-time underwear model who insists that Barack Obama is a Muslim) came a string of speeches devoted to the many ways Obama and Clinton have empowered or even supported groups portrayed as deadly threats to American security. So, the mother of one of the men killed in Benghazi--Patricia Smith, mother of Sean Smith--condemned Clinton in the harshest possible terms. ""I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son,"" she said, before winning a roar from the crowd with: ""Hillary for prison. She deserves to be in stripes."" On that score, Mark Geist and John Tiegen, former members of the Benghazi Annex Security Team, offered a graphic retelling of the assault in Benghazi, Libya, along with a condemnation of then-Secretary of State Clinton for ""failing to protect her people on the ground."" Having covered the threat from ""radical Islam,"" the speakers moved on to the perceived threat from the border. Attendees watched a video from Kent Terry and Kelly Terry-Willis, siblings whose brother was killed on duty as a border patrol agent. They heard from Mary Ann Mendoza, whose son was killed in a car accident involving an unauthorized immigrant, followed by Sabine Durden, whose son also died in a similar car accident, and concluding with Jamiel Shaw, whose son was killed in a gang shootout involving an unauthorized immigrant. Each speaker endorsed Trump's call for a wall on the Mexican border, which gave clarity to the overall message: that Mexico sends crime to the United States and that ""illegal aliens"" (to use Mendoza's term) are an imminent threat to the safety of you and your family. That unauthorized immigrants have a lower violent crime rate than native-born citizens didn't enter the conversation. (If you're skeptical that this message is racist, replace ""illegals"" with ""blacks"" or ""Jews"" and consider how it sounds.) With Muslims and immigrants out of the way, the convention moved to black activists. David A. Clarke Jr., the black sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, gave a pointed critique of the Black Lives Matter movement, calling it ""anarchy,"" praising the recent acquittal of the officer charged in the 2015 death of Freddie Gray (which brought cheers from the audience), and accusing police reform activists of pushing a ""hateful ideology."" Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who came later in the night, took a similar tack, blasting activists and accusing President Obama of bending to the will of ""Islamic extremist terrorism."" Terrorism. Immigration. Crime. Three fears that dominated the rhetoric on Monday night. And that rhetoric came with targets: ""radical Muslims,"" ""illegal aliens,"" and Black Lives Matter. As one Republican wonk wrote after witnessing this parade of speakers, ""The Trumpified GOP had only two policy proposals last night: Deport more Mexicans, and kill more Muslims."" There is no ""pivot,"" no ""general election Trump."" The Donald Trump who shot to the top of the GOP primary with a message of fear and nativism--who accused Mexico of sending ""criminals"" and ""rapists"" and proposed a ban on Muslims--is the Donald Trump who will claim the nomination on Thursday. That's the story of Monday night. That's the story of this Republican convention. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Melania Trump's Speech Was a Goof.

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/rudy_giuliani_is_a_different_man_from_the_moderate_mayor_of_new_york.html	"Exactly 20 years ago, as the Boston Globe's New York bureau chief, I interviewed Mayor Rudy Giuliani in his office in City Hall. The 1996 Republican Convention was going on in San Diego, and I asked him why he wasn't there. ""It's not my sort of thing,"" he replied. ""I'm much closer to moderates in both parties than to extremists in either."" That was a long time ago. Four years later, he was preparing to run against Hillary Clinton in what many foresaw as the most exciting Senate contest of 2000. But he dropped out before the race got under way, reeling from a cancer diagnosis, a divorce, and the realization that his heart wasn't in it. He skipped a major fundraising lunch in Albany to attend a Yankees game (a move that spoke well of him). When he withdrew, he said of Clinton, ""She's a nice lady."" That too was a long time ago. A year later came the Sept. 11 attacks, and Giuliani stood firm, read Churchill's memoir of the London blitz, and performed admirably as the spirit of a brave city. Then, gradually, he started believing his own hype, started giving speeches not just on urban affairs and crime-fighting (for which he had demonstrable expertise) but also global terrorism (about which he knew little). He started insinuating himself into the Republican Party. He made a disastrous run for president in 2008, ending up with one delegate after spending $50 million. Some said that he was too liberal for the Republican Party. (He advocated gun control, gay rights, abortion rights, and immigration reform, as do most New York mayors by nature.) He may have come to the same conclusion. He turned to the right. And that brings us to his speech Monday, on the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention, a speech that would have made the mayor of 20 years ago roll his eyes and giggle. Self-righteous and bombastic as he has become in recent years, I have never seen him--I have never imagined him--huffing and puffing with such fire and brimstone. Or spewing such rank nonsense. Boasting that he changed New York ""from the crime capital of America to the safest large city in America,"" he said, ""What I did for New York, Donald Trump will do for America."" Stipulating that he played a role in cutting crime in New York (and I think he did, to some extent), what did he do? Most pertinent, he appointed William Bratton as his police chief, who tracked crime with daily computer statistics (before then, there were only quarterly statistics), then instantly redeployed cops to neighborhoods where crime was spurting. He also arrested people for committing small crimes, and many of those people, it turned out, were wanted for large crimes. Other things were happening in society, too. But these techniques and the surrounding circumstances have no application to the fight against global terrorism. Nor does the sophisticated approach that Giuliani and Bratton brought to urban disorder have any resemblance to Trump's attitude to anything. Then Giuliani delved into the shallowest realm of Trump's attack on Obama's (or Obama-Clinton's) counterterrorism policies--the refusal to call our enemy by their name: as he bellowed it, ""Islamic extremist terrorism"" (words that drew an enormous ovation). Obama has addressed this critique: It is silly to believe that, if only he uttered those three words (like ""Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!""), the bad guys would turn and run--or anything different would happen whatsoever. ""If they are at war against us,"" Giuliani roared, ""we must commit ourselves to unconditional victory against them."" What does that mean? What does the United States or the West have to do to achieve that goal? I ask Giuliani and others who speak in this language to put forth a three-point outline, a 100-page treatise--some idea of what new policies, tactics, or strategies they have in mind. I honestly don't know, and I'm pretty sure they don't either. In the next sentence (right after ""unconditional victory against them""), Giuliani said, ""This includes undoing one of the worst deals America ever made""--the nuclear deal with Iran. Giuliani claimed that this deal ""will eventually let them become a nuclear power."" Meanwhile, it's having us pour billions of dollars into a country ""that is the world's largest supporter of terrorism,"" adding, ""We are actually giving them the money to fund the terrorists who are killing us and our allies. Are we crazy?"" (The crowd yelled, ""Yes!"") There are so many falsehoods and confusions to parse in this passage. First, the nuclear deal is holding up quite well. Iran has dismantled the centrifuges, reduced the enriched uranium, exported the heavy water, and let in the IAEA inspectors and cameras, just as the deal required. Second, the money we're sending them--which turns out to be a lot less than they expected--is their money, which was frozen as a result of their nuclear program, with the implication that it would be unfrozen if the program was dismantled; the program has been dismantled, so the funds are unfrozen. Third, Giuliani seems to believe--or wants to make the audience believe--that Iran is funding the terrorists who are attacking the United States and our allies, when in fact Iran (a Shiite-led country) deeply loathes ISIS and al-Qaida (a Sunni movement). In fact, after the 9/11 attacks, Iran shared intelligence on al-Qaida with U.S. diplomats. Today, Iranian-backed militias are fighting against ISIS forces in Iraq. Some U.S. officials are leery of this fact, not wanting Iran to emerge as a strategic winner in this contest, but, like it or not, in the fight against ISIS, the United States, the West, and Iran are on the same side. If you define the enemy as ""Islamic extremist terrorism,"" you miss these subtleties. You think Shiite extremists, Sunni extremists, Kurdish extremists, and lone-wolf killers in the West are all the same, are driven by the same motives, and can be fought or disarmed in the same way. This is the danger of describing these conflicts in terms of such simplistic slogans. Obama's (and Clinton's) reluctance to recite these labels stems not from ""political correctness"" but from an understanding of the world's complexities and the true nature of this fight. ""Greatness!"" Giuliani screamed at the top of his lungs at the end of his speech. The crowd went wild. But if terrorists were watching, believe me (as Trump likes to say), they were not impressed.

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/the_gop_is_sick_and_the_never_trump_floor_fight_was_a_symptom.html	"CLEVELAND--Look around the main hall at the Republican National Convention and you see the trappings of party unity. Delegates adorned in ""Trump-Pence"" buttons and hats with the real estate mogul's simple slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" A lineup of speakers who attest to Trump's greatness and his fitness for the presidency of the United States. Tables and tables and tables of pro-Trump merchandise. That unity is a facade. Sixty percent of Republicans are dissatisfied with Donald Trump as their prospective nominee, according to NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. Just 38 percent are satisfied. Most of the unsatisfied will vote for Donald Trump. But some fall into the Never Trump faction of the Republican Party. And on Monday, those voters made their stand against a Republican establishment intent on blocking any challenge to Trump as nominee. Three hours after the convention began in earnest, Republican Chairman Reince Priebus moved to approve the rules package that set the parameters for the convention. Almost immediately, anti-Trump delegates began clamoring--screaming, even--for a roll call vote, to force each delegation to announce its support for or opposition to the package, and by extension, its support for or opposition to Donald Trump. It's worth a moment for context. There was a point in American politics where convention delegates chose nominees through days of jockeying and fighting, sometimes culminating in epic floor fights over ballots and procedures. The rules and rituals of the modern convention reflect that period, even as voters ultimately determine the nominee of the party. The modern presidential convention is less of a smoke-filled room and more of a trade event, where people mingle and commiserate, then ratify the results of the primaries in a grand display of unity. The rules matter, but most of the time, they don't matter that much. Which is what made Monday's spectacle all the more remarkable. There was no chance that Never Trump delegates would derail the real estate mogul's nomination, not least because they lacked a viable and legitimate alternative. At most, they might force RNC leaders to honor and acknowledge their dissent. But that would undermine the entire goal of the convention, which is to project unity ahead of the general election. So, when those Never Trump delegates shouted for a roll call vote, the acting convention chair--Arkansas Rep. Steve Womack--ignored the chant and declared the rules approved. The ""ayes"" had it. Before Womack could move on, he was shouted down, as pro- and anti-Trump delegates went back and forth on the floor, screaming in a battle of wills. Womack retreated and then returned to try again. He asked for a vote. He declared the rules approved by voice vote. And he noted that Never Trump forces had fallen short. They needed seven delegations to force a roll call vote. They had six. Like that, the fight was over. In their final push against the GOP's presumptive nominee, the Never Trump forces fell short. It wasn't a total failure. No, they couldn't overtake a Republican establishment that wanted to put a lid on any discord. But in forcing the question--in generating enough heat to disrupt the proceedings, if only for a moment--the anti-Trump delegates emphasized the degree to which this a Potemkin convention for a party that's torn and divided over its nominee. Look at the schedule of events here in Cleveland. If the speakers aren't from Trump's immediate family, they're third- and fourth-string Republican politicians, whose national stature is slight. Neither Mitt Romney nor John McCain--the past two Republican nominees for president--are present. The same goes for the past two Republican presidents. Neither George Bush nor his father will make an appearance at the RNC. Ohio Gov. John Kasich? Not attending, much to the chagrin of the Trump campaign. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the one-time wunderkind of the Republican Party? Not attending, but sending a prerecorded video message. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a conservative darling? Not attending. Of the 54 Republicans who serve in the Senate, 21 aren't attending. And several of the most popular Republican governors in the country--Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Nikki Haley of South Carolina--are sitting this convention out. A strong and confident political party doesn't struggle to tamp down discord or bring its brightest stars to the fore. But, as a national entity, the Republican Party is neither strong nor confident. It's sick, worn down by its own pathologies and contradictions. And in its sickness, it's been overtaken by Donald Trump. For as much as we might treat this as a farce and a joke, it's neither. Through his campaign, Trump has conjured some of the darkest forces in national life. He has brought them to the fore. And come Thursday, the Republican Party will elevate him--and his movement of aggressive, racist nationalism--to the highest summit of American politics. It's history. The ominous kind.

Barack Obama has made the racial divide worse. There's a good chance you've heard this before. It sprouted up in the fever swamps of the right wing after the president gave his sympathy to the family of Trayvon Martin in the wake of the teenager's death in 2012. A year later, when a jury acquitted the shooter, George Zimmerman, those voices rose again to denounce Obama as a ""race-baiter."" When Obama spoke on discord in Ferguson, Missouri, and urged understanding, conservatives accused him of stoking racial fires. When he spoke on the disorder in Baltimore, and urged calm, conservatives said he ""inflamed"" tensions. After anti-racist protests roiled college campuses last fall, leading Republicans blamed him for worsening ""race relations."" And now, after a week of anger and anxiety, a chorus of conservative and right-wing voices agree: Obama caused this conflict. ""In Dallas, Tuesday, President Obama will be trying to calm racial tensions that his own behavior has done much to aggravate,"" said Fox News' Brit Hume on Monday. ""From his denunciation of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, police as acting, quote, stupidly in the arrest of law professor Henry Louis Gates, to his assertion that the motives of the Dallas cop killer are unclear, they aren't."" ""Mr. President, you've done nothing but tell us we deserve it. You've done nothing but look back in the rearview mirror,"" conservative personality Jeanine Pirro said of the shootings in Dallas. ""More than seven years into the administration of the nation's first black president, Americans are more deeply divided on race then they have been in decades,"" wrote Steven Malanga for City Journal. ""Their own president has fostered the divide."" His label-mate, editor-at-large Myron Magnet, was even fiercer in his condemnation: ""If you want to ignite race riots, a sure-fire way to do it is to stir up black hatred and suspicion of cops, which will in turn make cops warier of blacks and more trigger-happy, and so on, until an explosion occurs. So thanks, President Obama. You have set back American race relations by 50 years."" On offer in each argument is the notion that--through his commentary, through his politics, through his mere presence--Obama interrupted a Whiggish progression toward racial harmony. Remove him from the equation, they say, and we don't have the race turmoil of the past seven years. That notion is nonsense, an updated spin on the old idea of an outside agitator. It depends on a deliberate miscasting of Obama's rhetoric which, as we saw at Tuesday's memorial in Dallas, is defined by its call for reconciliation and unity. And it rests on outright ignorance of public opinion. In the years before Obama (and after Hurricane Katrina), black Americans were increasingly discontented with ""race relations"" in the United States. The phrase itself explains part of the story. ""Race relations"" is used in most polling and public discussion of the racial divide but it's fundamentally evasive and inaccurate, which is why I use scare quotes here. The problem of race isn't that blacks and whites (or other groups) don't get along. The problem of race is that blacks and other nonwhites face unfair treatment and material disadvantage. The problem of race is that the descendants of enslaved people, and those in close social and economic proximity to them, have been marked for aggression, predation, and deprivation by the dominant socioeconomic group, and suffer as a result. When black Americans say they are pessimistic about ""race relations,"" what they mean is they are unhappy with that treatment. An America that euphemizes this grievance as a matter of ""race relations,"" and in the process consecrates race as a natural category, is an America that still isn't confronting its reality. On the eve of Obama's election, just a scant minority of blacks agreed those relations were ""generally good."" Far from causing division, Obama's rise and success brought a new period of racial optimism as black Americans found faith and hope in the fact of his elevation. But that optimism shook against a fierce--and sometimes racist--backlash to the president, finally tumbling as blacks watched video after video of police violence, with little accountability for the killers and little sympathy for the victims. If ""race relations"" are indeed at a low, if Americans are more divided over racism and a path forward, it's not because Obama gave measured sympathy to the family of a Florida teenager, or voiced a common frustration among black Americans. By that standard, we should blame Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott for ""dividing Americans"" after he testified to the reality of racial profiling. No, black Americans--and Americans writ large--are reacting to facts on the ground, killings, and other incidents that put racial inequality into stark relief. To blame Obama for discord--rather than the actual abuses and inequalities that drive the reaction--is a classic example of anti-anti-racism, wherein efforts to address and combat racial bias are reckoned a larger problem than the bias itself. And in the same way, Obama's willingness to speak to and for black Americans as a black American marks him as the real racist, maligned for acknowledging the reality of racism. It's a bizarro view of American life where racial discord is caused by speaking out about discrimination, not by discrimination itself. It's rich that this argument has currency at the same time that Donald Trump is preparing for his coronation as the presidential nominee of the Republican Party. After years of accusing Obama of fostering racial hatred, of slamming basic empathy as some attack on white Americans, these conservatives--men like Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani--are primed to nominate a man whose political persona is built on actual prejudice and bigotry. A man who casually spreads racist and anti-Semitic propaganda. A man who incites fear and racial hatred for political gain. Soon enough, these conservatives will take a man who stands as the true avatar of their anti-Obama projections and proclaim him their standard-bearer for president of the United States."

He stood 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighed 300 pounds. His arms were tattooed. His head was shaved. He once played semipro football. If you'd met him in a dark alley, he might have scared you. But he had a big heart, too. Last week, just before he was fatally shot, he bought dinner for a homeless man. Michael Krol was almost as imposing: 6 feet, 4 inches, a standout at pickup football. He used to work as a hospital security guard. He didn't just patrol the building. He attended to whatever the patients needed. If they had to go to the bathroom, that's what he helped them do. Brent Thompson served in the Marines and did security work in Afghanistan and Iraq. He looked like the kind of guy you'd send somewhere to break heads. But that wasn't his style. When he came home and took a job in law enforcement, his bosses sent him to the roughest neighborhoods because he treated everyone with respect and never lost his cool. Ahrens, Krol, and Thompson were cops in Dallas. On the night of July 7, they and two of their colleagues, Michael Smith and Patrick Zamarripa, were shot and killed by a sniper. Thompson had just gotten married. Zamarripa had a 2-year-old daughter. The sniper, who was black, purportedly told police he wanted to kill white people, especially white cops. But several of the 12 officers he shot were Latino. One was a gay man from Puerto Rico. Another was a young woman who had worked in Hispanic community outreach. The sniper said he was angry about police killings of two black men: Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on July 5 and Philando Castile in suburban Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, on July 6. But the officers he shot in Dallas had nothing to do with those deaths. In fact, the Dallas Police Department was pioneering reforms to prevent such incidents. And on the night its officers were gunned down, they were protecting people who were protesting the deaths of Sterling and Castile. So why were these cops targeted? Because they were cops. ""He was killed for one reason,"" says Thompson's former boss. ""He was wearing a uniform."" In other words, they were killed because they fit a profile. The shooter identified all police officers as threats, based on a common visible characteristic, regardless of who they were. In the community of law enforcers and their families, wearing blue has always signified both risk and pride. ""From the moment you put on that uniform,"" President Obama observed at a memorial service for the Dallas officers on Tuesday, ""you have answered a call that at any moment, even in the briefest interaction, may put your life in harm's way."" The attack in Dallas has alerted many Americans to an additional risk. It's not just the job that's dangerous. It's the uniform itself. Ahrens, Krol, Smith, Thompson, and Zamarripa weren't just killed in the line of duty. They were marked for death, not for anything they had done but because they wore blue. Every officer knows this is unjust. ""Underneath that blue, underneath that badge, we're people just like you,"" a wounded officer, Jorge Barrientos, told the Dallas Morning News. ""We love the community. We love the people we serve. ... Stop dividing each other into different groups ... We're the same."" That's a compelling message. But it might be said, just as eloquently, of people who wear a different kind of uniform. It's a uniform you're born with and can never take off. It can make you an object of fear, suspicion, and blame. It can make you a target. The uniform is black, and it's made of skin. This is the uniform Alton Sterling was wearing while selling CDs outside a convenience store in Baton Rouge. A homeless man pressed him for money. At some point, Sterling indicated that he had a gun. ""I told you to leave me alone,"" he told the man. So the man called 911. The call was relayed to officers as a report that Sterling had ""threatened someone with a gun."" Two videos of the fatal incident have been released. They don't show what happened when police first arrived. In one video, Sterling appears to be standing in front of a car. The officers tase him and tell him to ""get on the ground,"" but he doesn't seem to move. So an officer tackles him. While he's pinned down, an officer shouts that Sterling has a gun. Shots ring out. A subsequent police affidavit says Sterling ""attempted to reach for the gun from his pocket"" and ""the officers fired their police-issued duty weapon at the subject to stop the threat."" Sterling had a long rap sheet, including aggravated battery, domestic abuse battery, sex with a 14-year-old, and illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance. But there's no sign that the cops knew any of that. All they knew was what they saw--a big black man--and what they had heard: that he had a gun. If you're white, the sequence in the video seems bizarre. You don't get tackled while standing still. You don't get shot four or five times, from point-blank range, while you're pinned down. Nobody is that scared of you. Nobody treats your life that cheaply. And nobody says you had to die because--contrary to the testimony of the store owner who was standing right there--you ""attempted to reach for"" a weapon. Philando Castile wore the same black uniform. A day after Sterling's death, he was driving through a largely white suburb of Minneapolis-St. Paul. An officer saw him and told colleagues he was going to pull the car over because the driver and the person in the front passenger seat--which turned out to be Castile's girlfriend--""look like people that were involved in a robbery"" reported days earlier. ""The driver looks more like one of our suspects, just because of the wide-set nose,"" the officer said in a radio exchange. A video of Castile's death, taken by his girlfriend, doesn't show the whole encounter. It shows a freaked-out officer pointing a gun through the window of the car--having fatally shot Castile--and shrieking, ""I told him not to reach for it!"" The girlfriend calmly replies: ""You told him to get his ID sir, his driver's license. ... You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir."" She is ordered out of the car at gunpoint, with a stream of frantic orders--""Keep 'em up!"" ""Face away from me and walk backwards!"" ""Get on your knees!""--that would rattle anyone. One mistake and you're dead. Again, if you're white, it's almost impossible to imagine yourself in this situation. Castile was in a car with his girlfriend and her 4-year-old daughter. He was a school cafeteria supervisor. Colleagues called him warm, friendly, humble, loving, calm, smart, kind, gentle, and respectful. As a motorist, he had previously been cited for driving with a suspended license, lacking proof of insurance, speeding, and not wearing a seat belt. But none of that warranted a pullover at gunpoint. Apparently, to avoid misunderstandings or a nasty surprise, he told the officer he had a licensed firearm. The officer, having instructed Castile to produce his license and registration, decided that he was reaching for his gun and shot him to death. The officer's lawyer claims that he ""was reacting to the actions of the driver"" and that the shooting ""has nothing to do with race and everything to do with the presence of a gun."" But it's obvious from the video and from the radio traffic that the officer, based on an imputed resemblance that was hardly more than racial profiling, created a confrontation he couldn't emotionally handle. Then, uncertain about what Castile was reaching for, he pulled the trigger. Every decision the officer made, starting with the pullover, was colored by race. You can argue that Sterling had a criminal record, that the video of Castile's death doesn't show what he was doing before he was shot, and that both men were armed. But scroll down the long lists of black people killed by police, and you'll soon run out of excuses. What about Walter Scott, who was shot in the back while fleeing? Or Sandra Bland, who was pulled over for not using her turn signal, threatened with a Taser, and jailed until she hanged herself? If you're black, you can put on nice clothes or drive a nice car. But you can never take off the uniform. Why was Don Lemon tailed and accused of shoplifting a CD player he had bought? Why was Sen. Tim Scott, earlier in his political career, pulled over seven times in a year? Why was Eric Holder, as a young man, pulled over twice and subjected to a weapons search? Why was Henry Louis Gates Jr. arrested in his own home after a white woman told police she had seen two black men--one of whom was Gates--trying to force open the front door? In each case, you can argue the details. But the pattern is unmistakable. That doesn't mean all cops are biased. People who wear blue aren't all the same. But people who wear black aren't, either. It's easy to forget this when you focus entirely on defending police. That's what seems to have happened to Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York. ""You've got to teach your children that the real danger to them is not the police,"" he told black parents in a Sunday interview on Face the Nation. ""The real danger to them, 99 out of 100 times, 9,900 out of 1,000 times, are other black kids who are going to kill them. That's the way they're going to die."" Giuliani said if he were a black father, he'd tell his children: ""Be very careful of those kids in the neighborhood, and don't get involved with them, because, son, there's a 99 percent chance they're going to kill you, not the police."" Giuliani exaggerated the numbers. But that's not the problem with his analysis. The problem is that if police use statistics like these to decide who should be pulled over, tased, tackled, or shot--consciously or unconsciously--you'll see a lot of harmless black people arrested or killed. And that's exactly what has happened. It's not necessarily malice. It's math. So, yes, mourn for the fallen officers in Dallas. They didn't deserve to die just because they wore the same uniform as the shooters in Baton Rouge and Minneapolis. But think about the other uniform, too, the one that puts people on the wrong end of a traffic stop or a gun barrel just because they fit the profile.
