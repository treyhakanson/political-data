Throughout the night, delegates chanted ""U-S-A"" to drown out any hecklers and waved giant American flags, visible from every seat in the arena. Speakers praised police officers for their work while veterans took the stage to praise old comrades and stress the need for unity. The father of a fallen soldier waved an actual copy of the Constitution in the face of the party's opponent, Donald Trump, and in her speech at the end of the night, Hillary Clinton was careful to give her unqualified praise and support to those public servants who ""run into danger."" But that first glance is misleading. Look at Thursday's events again and you'll see the qualities that made the convention a distinctly Democratic affair. In this celebration of American strength and greatness, the faces were overwhelmingly black and brown. The father representing his son to the world and rebuking Donald Trump's attacks? A Muslim American immigrant. The Medal of Honor winner speaking for veterans who might lose out in a Trump administration? Another immigrant. The parents honoring their son, a police officer who died on duty in Cleveland? They were black. From Monday to Thursday, each night of the Democratic National Convention was marked by incredible diversity, represented by a wide array of colors and creeds. They weren't just voices of normalcy--people who represent the extent to which Democrats have claimed the mantle of ""normal"" America, where normal includes nonwhites, unauthorized immigrants, and the LGBTQ community. They were also voices for optimism. It was the startling fact of this entire convention. On Monday alone there was Michelle Obama and her forceful defense of America's ""greatness"" and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker's attempt to raise his profile with a soaring national speech. All week long, if you craved a message of optimism, your best bet was a brown or black face. But that makes sense. Despite deep problems of discrimination and racial inequality, it's nonwhites--blacks, Hispanics, and other groups--who have the most optimistic view of the United States and its future. For them, the country is closer than not to its self-conception as a city on the hill, and for good reason. If you're black, if you're Latino, if you're gay--life is unquestionably better now than it was in the past. In the hands and mouths of underrepresented groups, these symbols of patriotism and national pride took on new meaning. This wasn't a crude jingoism. It was an expression of pluralistic nationalism and deep civic pride, a progressive patriotism that acknowledges the nation's failures but strives to overcome them. What is remarkable is the extent to which this kind of patriotism--and much of the mood surrounding the convention--is rooted in black traditions of political and religious rhetoric. In ways small and large, the lifeblood of the Democratic National Convention was the black church. You saw this, in a literal way, with the stream of black politicians and black religious leaders who took the stage. The Rev. William Barber, the North Carolina preacher and head of his state's NAACP who founded the ""Moral Mondays"" movement, gave a speech that was emblematic of the language on display, a language and cadence drawn from the traditions of the black church. ""Now, my friends, they tell me that when the heart is in danger, somebody has to call an emergency code, and somebody with a good heart will bring a defibrillator to work on the bad heart,"" said Barber in his thundering address. ""[W]e are being called like our foremothers and fathers to be the moral defibrillators of our time. We must shock this nation with the power of love. We must shock this nation with the power of mercy. We must shock this nation and fight for justice for all."" Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver kept up this theme of defiant optimism in his peroration on Thursday. ""They threw her down as the first lady, but she didn't stay throwed!"" he bellowed, referring to Hillary Clinton. ""They threw her down as a U.S. senator, but she wouldn't stay throwed! They threw her down as a secretary of state, but she wouldn't stay throwed! They threw her down in this very campaign--this campaign--but she won't stay throwed! No, she ain't gonna stay throwed! She won't stay throwed! She won't stay throwed!"" It has become commonplace to say that the Democrats presented an uplifting view of the United States to contrast with the darkness of the last week's Republican National Convention. It is tempting, even, to invoke Ronald Reagan's ""Morning in America,"" especially since Clinton used the phrase in her speech. But pay attention to the tenor of this optimism, to the rhythms of its expression. It isn't the self-satisfaction of Reagan, champion of the status quo. It is hard-won hope, an optimism born of struggle. It's the ""Mothers of the Movement,"" whose grief fuels hopeful activism. ""We're going to keep telling our children's stories and urging you to say their names,"" said Lucia McBath, mother of Jordan Davis, who was slain in 2012. ""We're going to keep building a future where police officers and communities of color work together in mutual respect to keep children, like Jordan, safe."" It's the difference between Reagan's eternal lights ""in this springtime of hope"" and Maya Angelou's ""still I rise,"" one of the refrains of this week. This progressive patriotism wasn't just a cudgel to use on Donald Trump, whose solipsism and fearmongering have exposed him to a Democratic attack on the basis of values and temperament. It was part of the bedrock of the argument against Trump and Trumpism--that he and his cause were fundamentally un-American, that electing him would deal an irreparable blow to the bonds of multicultural democracy. And so we have Monday's speech from Michelle Obama, which stands as a paean to that conception of democracy. We have Wednesday's speech from Barack Obama, in which the president made a vigorous defense of American pluralism. ""Fair to say, this is not your typical election. It's not just a choice between parties or policies, the usual debates between left and right,"" said Obama, emphasizing the extent to which he views Trump as a threat to America's democratic traditions. ""This is a more fundamental choice--about who we are as a people and whether we stay true to this great American experiment in self-government."" And we had Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech, which continued this theme of pluralism and patriotism and reinforced the idea that this election, more than anything, was a fight for democracy. ""Remember: Our founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power,"" Clinton said. ""Two hundred and forty years later, we still put our faith in each other."" The Thursday session of the Democratic National Convention opened with a procession and color guard from Civil War re-enactors, who arrived on stage in full regalia. These weren't any re-enactors. They were re-enactors of the United States Colored Troops, the regiments of free and newly freed blacks who fought for their freedom in the Civil War. Their courage and valor was one of the catalysts for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery. Those re-enactors represented those Americans who took action to prove their citizenship--to prove their bona fides as Americans. And in turn, the effort to pay them their due inaugurated America's great experiment in multiracial democracy, which has ebbed and flowed with the tides of history and circumstance. It was in that display that you saw the broader mood and message of this week, one that harks back to the moment just before the War of the Rebellion, when the nation was on the brink of crisis. ""Those bonds of affection; that common creed,"" President Obama said, and I thought of Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural, an argument for union and in defense of republicanism. ""We are not enemies, but friends,"" Lincoln said. ""We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."" The Democratic Party believes that Donald Trump is a unique threat to American democracy--a threat to our experiment in representative government. At its essence, this convention is their first inaugural, their message to a country on the eve of a world-defining election. ""This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it,"" said Lincoln in his address. Grounding themselves in an optimism born of struggle, Democrats are asking those people to continue the struggle for equality, the fight to make a ""more perfect union."" To turn back Trump and assert the dignity of all Americans, hopeful that with hard work, the problems of today will give way to better prospects and a better future.

1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/twitter_commentary_on_night_4_of_the_dnc.html	It has all been building to this: Thursday night, the fourth night of the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton will accept her party's nomination for president of the United States. In the hours before she does so, her praises will be sung by a host of politicians and activists--as well as Carole King, who will literally sing them using music. Andrew Cuomo, Sherrod Brown (who was under consideration for Clinton's running mate spot), and the elusive Chelsea Clinton are among the other presenters. Twitter was aglow on Wednesday with beleaguered conservative pundits praising Barack Obama's rousing speech. Will they do the same for Hillary?

It is their last big moment to register complaints or promote their issues at a spectacle viewed by some 20 million people. So what are they planning to do? They won't say. It's partially because they don't want ""Hillary's people"" getting word of it. Another reason? They may not be sure themselves of what they're doing until the moment arrives. ""Hahahahaha,"" laughed California Sanders delegate John Schnitzer as he walked out of a closed-door meeting for Sanders delegates in the downtown Marriott on Thursday afternoon. I had asked him for tonight's plan. ""I can't say anything. I'll just say: Of course we had discussions. We talked about it. I can't say what we're going to do. I just want to say that we're doing everything we can to get a message out."" ""There's a lot of talk about a lot of things,"" said Jose Caballero, a Sanders California delegate from San Diego who serves as an ambassador between the state's Clinton and Sanders delegates. ""We all talk [at the closed-door meetings] about what actions we're going to do--make sure we're not being disrespectful ... or not being seen as rabble-rousers,"" he added, noting that the criticism of Sanders delegates from the convention's first session had been received. ""So we've been very disciplined about how we've been protesting the last couple of days--very visual, not as loud."" So what's going down tonight? Where's the action gonna be? Caballero began to talk of certain strategies under discussion, but then cut himself off. ""Is this going to go to print right now?"" It's not even that they have some exquisitely detailed plan ready to be executed with a series of nods between the principals, Return of the Jedi style. These are progressive activists. Vertical command structures aren't how they roll. If anything is going to happen, it's going to be organic. ""Let me put it this way,"" said Norman Solomon, a California Sanders delegate and coordinator of the 1,250-member Bernie Delegates Network, when asked what was in store for tonight. ""Last night, when I was with the California delegation, and the chants started 'NO MORE WAR' ""--this happened during former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's speech--""I was very surprised. I had no expectation of it."" That, he explained, was started by the Oregon delegation and picked up by the Californians and others. The protests move horizontally. If there's going to be a multistate walkout, it won't be at the snap of the fingers. One delegation will start moving, and then the others will suddenly find their own feet moving underneath them toward the exits, swept up in the moment, much as Tuesday's walkout unfolded, much as--in a way--the small-potatoes campaign of a rumpled socialist coalesced into a national movement. ""I'll put it this way,"" Solomon reiterated. ""I would be astonished if everybody just sort of sat and clapped."" Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	"Chants? A ""Visual"" Protest?

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/donald_trump_was_joking_when_he_said_russians_should_hack_hillary_clinton.html	"Wednesday afternoon, Donald Trump invited a foreign power to hack Hillary Clinton. ""Russia, if you're listening,"" he said. ""I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."" In a statement, Clinton aide Jack Sullivan succinctly declared the remark ""a national security issue."" So it was. It was also, according to Trump, a joke. Early Thursday, the Republican presidential nominee had this exchange with Fox News' Brian Kilmeade after Kilmeade told him that a second Clinton aide, Robby Mook, had called the comment a ""national security issue."" Trump: You have to be kidding. His client, his person deleted 33,000 emails illegally. You look at that. And when I'm being sarcastic with something-- Kilmeade: Are you being sarcastic? Trump: Of course I'm being sarcastic. He then recited his usual talking points about how ""disgraceful"" the Clinton email situation is. Some have been quick to identify this as another of Trump's embarrassing reversals. ""Trump walks back dare for Russia to hack Clinton email,"" reads CBS's headline. It's very clear to me, though, that Trump was trying to be funny. ""If his comment about Russian hackers really was intended as a joke, it clearly missed,"" my colleague Josh Voorhees wrote on Thursday. This is absolutely correct: It was a failed, destructive attempt at humor, but an attempt nonetheless. We can say this was a joke without dismissing its gravity, and we can say it was a joke without excusing him. But we have to say it was a joke, because it was a joke. A very, very bad one. Trump's joke on Wednesday was borne of two specific, pre-existing shticks. The first, about hacking, originates with Trump. The other, about Clinton's emails, is a GOP staple. First, the hacking. As others have observed, Trump has literally called on hackers to target his enemies. These are jokes. Their tone is sardonic. Trump's attitude here is like that of a teacher with a soft spot for a louse. His address to them--""Attention all hackers""--is a stand-up bit. It is not intended to be taken seriously by the world's leading experts in internet black ops. Hacking can be a type of spying. For Trump, the important thing to understand about spying is that everybody does it. Getting spied on is a great indignity. It is very sad when it happens to you. But it is amusing when it happens to other people. This is in reference to the many failures of the Obamacare website healthcare.gov: Hacking is, in other words, a kind of prank. Asking Russia to hack Clinton's emails--that's a funny idea, in Trump land. Trump's other source material here is Hillary email jokes, which are not local to him. When Clinton told Trump to ""delete"" his account on Twitter, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus had a witty comeback: So did South Carolina congressman Jeff Duncan: A writer for AM New York counted seven Clinton email jokes at the Republican National Convention. This was Chris Christie's:"	How to Tell When Donald Trump Is Joking

That might not please the hecklers on the convention floor. But it's a good thing for the party and for Hillary Clinton. Monday, the first night of the convention, was for the left. There were nods to traditional values, but the main theme was progressive populism. The stars were Bernie Sanders, Michelle Obama, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. On Tuesday, the conversation began to turn toward the center. Amid the usual ethnic and gender politics, a video described how Clinton, after the defeat of her health care initiative in 1994, worked with Republicans to get health insurance for children. Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and DNC chairman, addressed ""the millions of Republicans who don't recognize the party they saw and heard in Cleveland."" Bill Clinton, the great triangulator, boasted that his wife ""repeatedly drew praise from prominent Republicans"" as a senator and as secretary of state. On Wednesday, some speakers, particularly Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, were still using Donald Trump's sins to bash Republicans. But more were courting GOP defectors. Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, contrasted Trump with Ronald Reagan. John Hutson, a retired admiral, said he used to vote Republican but was now supporting Clinton. A video of former national security officials condemning Trump featured one Republican luminary after another. This kind of talk galls some delegates. On Wednesday, there were chants and outbursts when Hutson spoke, when Sen. Tim Kaine accepted the party's nomination for vice president, and when Leon Panetta, President Obama's former CIA chief and defense secretary, addressed military issues. ""No more war!"" some people shouted. ""No more drones!"" said others. Many protested Kaine's support of trade agreements. The disruptions stopped Hutson cold and made Panetta, even on TV, difficult to hear. These attacks on the party's centrist wing are foolish. Look at the latest polls. In a CNN/ORC survey taken July 22 to 24, 88 percent of self-identified Democrats supported Clinton. But Clinton trailed Trump overall because she drew only 37 percent of independents and 8 percent of Republicans. In a CBS News survey, she got 84 percent of Democrats but trailed Trump because only 35 percent of independents and 6 percent of Republicans supported her. The left isn't big enough to win this election. Clinton needs the middle. Trump presents an unusual threat but also an unusual opportunity. He's invading Democratic turf by running against free trade, entitlement cuts, and military interventionism. Democrats would be foolish not to counterattack on Republican turf. They can court center-right voters who feel betrayed by Trump's desertions of conservative principle, or who are put off by his bigotry, low character, and temperamental unfitness for office. In Wednesday's convention speeches, President Obama, police chiefs, and relatives of cops talked about gun control as a law-and-order issue, protecting officers who are ""outgunned by weapons of war."" Speakers hammered Trump for insulting prisoners of war and lying about his donations to organizations that support veterans. A video showed Republican Sen. Marco Rubio agreeing that Trump's jab at John McCain for being captured in Vietnam disqualified Trump from the presidency. ""Donald, you're not fit to polish John McCain's boots,"" said Hutson. Two former Marines hit Trump with the kind of language normally heard at a Republican convention. One said Trump ""praises dictators who've killed Americans."" Another fumed that Trump ""questions the loyalty of those who served our country, without ever himself serving."" Panetta, noting Trump's bromance with Vladimir Putin, challenged the Republican nominee's patriotism. ""Donald Trump today once again took Russia's side,"" said the former CIA boss, addressing the apparent Russian hack on the Democratic National Committee. He's ""asking one of our adversaries to engage in hacking or intelligence efforts against the United States of America."" The three most important speakers of the night appealed directly for Republican support. Michael Bloomberg, the former GOP mayor of New York, told the crowd he disagreed with Democrats on education reform, cutting budgets, and demonizing capitalism. But he urged fellow independents to support Clinton as the only ""sane, competent"" candidate in the race. Kaine opened with a ""Semper Fi"" to his son in the Marines. He recalled his own Jesuit schooling and his time as a missionary. He talked about ""faith, family, and work."" And he spoke extensively about Republican opposition to Trump. Kaine praised his father-in-law, a former Republican governor of Virginia, for supporting civil rights and voting for Democrats. He hailed Barbara Bush for spurning Trump as a misogynist. He pointed out that Ohio Gov. John Kasich had refused to attend Trump's convention even though it was held in his own state. ""If any of you are looking for that party of Lincoln,"" Kaine told disaffected Republicans, ""we've got a home for you right here in the Democratic Party."" Obama, too, contrasted Trump with Reagan. He said his own Midwestern ancestors were mostly Republicans but didn't like bullies or braggarts. Obama blasted Trump as a fake hawk who ""cozies up to Putin, praises Saddam Hussein,"" insults the military, and undermines NATO. ""What we heard in Cleveland last week wasn't particularly Republican,"" said the president. ""And it sure wasn't conservative."" If you're a Sanders fan, these messages aren't aimed at you. But they matter. If you can't stand a party that reaches out to center-right voters on issues such as religion, law enforcement, and the use of force, you'll lose. You'll get a Republican president, as you did in 2000. But this time it will be much, much worse. ""If you want to fight climate change,"" Obama pointed out, you've ""got to reach out to the coal miner who's worried about taking care of his family."" To fight gun violence, you've got to connect with ""gun owners who agree on things like background checks."" And you can't reject Clinton ""just because she might not align with you on every issue,"" said the president. ""Democracy isn't a spectator sport."" Compromise, in Obama's view, is a matter of pragmatism. But it's also about intellectual humility. Clinton ""understands that most issues are rarely black and white,"" said the president. ""Democracy doesn't work if we constantly demonize each other. ... We have to listen to each other, and see ourselves in each other, and fight for our principles but also fight to find common ground."" That's an apt message to a party that prides itself on diversity. Sometimes, inclusion isn't just about race, religion, or gender. It's about ideas. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Democrats Are Borrowing the Language of Conservatism. Will They Win Over GOP Defectors?
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/michael_bloomberg_s_endorsement_of_hillary_clinton_shows_the_democrats_are.html	"There are very few endorsements that are going to matter in this presidential election, but Michael Bloomberg's might be one of them. On Wednesday night in Philadelphia, the three-term mayor of New York City called on his fellow independents to vote for Hillary Clinton. ""I am asking you to join with me not out of party loyalty, but out of love of country,"" Bloomberg said. Why? Is it because he's so enthusiastic about her many virtues? Nope, it's because a Trump presidency would be an unmitigated disaster: ""He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence in the world, and make our communities less safe."" Ouch. Bloomberg's savage attack lines may well give Clinton a boost in November. But it was not so long ago that he thought seriously about running for president himself. Fearing voters might be left with a choice between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, the centrist billionaire devoted substantial time and resources to laying the groundwork for an independent presidential campaign, an idea he'd toyed with for years. When it became clear Clinton would prevail in the race for the Democratic nomination, Bloomberg broke the hearts of hundreds of high-priced political professionals by deciding not to run. What tipped the scales for Bloomberg? It certainly wasn't a reluctance to spend money on a presidential campaign. In addition to the tens of millions he spent to win three terms as mayor in the nation's most expensive media market, he's devoted millions more to promoting gun control, comprehensive immigration reform, and a host of other causes. It doesn't hurt that Bloomberg has amassed a fortune more than 10 times as large as Donald Trump's. Nevertheless, Bloomberg concluded the most likely result of his candidacy would be to tip the election to either Trump or Ted Cruz, both of whom he condemned as divisive nativists. Had Bloomberg done nothing more than stay on the sidelines, the Clinton campaign would have been quite content. The fact that he showed up at the Democratic convention is icing on the cake. It is also, I suspect, a sign of things to come. To most sophisticated political observers, the main takeaway from this year's Democratic presidential primaries is that the party is moving decisively to the left, as demonstrated by the outpouring of votes, enthusiasm, and small-dollar donations for Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont who joined the Democratic Party only very reluctantly. The fact that Sanders energized younger Democrats more than older ones has been taken as a sign that the future belongs to left-wing Democrats who will follow in his footsteps. There is, however, another possibility: What if the Democratic Party's future winds up being more Bloomberg than Bernie? To conservatives, Bloomberg has long been a donkey in elephant's clothing. Before running for mayor of New York in 2001 as a Republican, he'd been a Democrat for years: By all accounts, he ran as a Republican primarily to avoid an expensive race for the hotly contested Democratic mayoral nomination. When Bloomberg re-registered as an independent in 2007, it was a much better fit. Mitt Romney did try to wheedle an endorsement out of Bloomberg in 2012, and Bloomberg told friends he thought Romney would be better at running the country than Obama per a private conversation that was leaked to the New York Times. But Bloomberg never took the idea of endorsing Romney seriously in light of their strong disagreements over abortion and gun control. In his last-minute endorsement of Obama's re-election bid, Bloomberg strongly implied that Romney's views on social issues were a dealbreaker. It turns out Bloomberg wasn't alone in this regard. There are millions of voters like Bloomberg--call them the ""Bloombourgeoisie""--who might have voted for Romney if not for his stances on social issues, just as there are millions of voters who never would've voted for Romney if he hadn't flip-flopped on abortion, and if he'd supported an amnesty for unauthorized immigrants. Republicans have built a coalition that is a far better fit for culturally conservative working-class whites than it is for the Bloombourgeoisie. If Donald Trump is any indication of where the GOP is heading, that trend will continue in the years to come. Recently, Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the think tank New America, argued that Democrats have replaced Republicans as the preferred party of America's wealthiest voters. In 2012, Barack Obama won a larger share of the vote of households earning $220,000 or more than Mitt Romney, the first time since 1964 that voters in the top 4 percent of household incomes backed a Democrat over a Republican. It's a safe bet that many of these well-off voters chose Obama over Romney for the same reasons Bloomberg did: RINO Romney was just too right-wing for their tastes. And if these voters couldn't warm up to Romney, you can only imagine how they'd feel about Trump. For most of the past half-century, the Republican edge among the rich has been quite substantial. But since 2000, it's been drifting downward, a development that Drutman attributes to the Democrats' rising strength among educated voters coupled with the fact that today's rich voters are more highly educated than rich voters of decades past. It's also the case that for many upper-middle- and upper-upper-income voters, tax cuts are not nearly as big a draw as social liberalism. What's a slightly smaller federal tax burden worth to a voter who's already pretty comfortable? Besides, on issues like free trade and balanced budgets, Hillary Clinton is far more ""conservative"" than Trump, a populist who favors tariffs, border walls, and policies that would cause deficits to balloon. Indeed, as far as Clinton is concerned, Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is probably a bigger threat to peel off votes from the socially liberal rich than Trump is. Which brings us back to Michael Bloomberg, the consummate ""socially liberal, fiscally conservative"" political figure. This is not to say that Bloomberg's a libertarian, as evidenced by his jihad against cigarette smoking and sugary soft drinks and his defense of stop-and-frisk. Instead, he is best understood as a business-friendly moderate, a politician who's never seen eye-to-eye with liberals who are exercised by rising economic inequality. To Bloomberg, it's perfectly natural that a city like New York would be extremely unequal--what else do you expect when you have an economy in which low-wage immigrants make a living by catering to the needs of high-wage professionals? Having made his fortune by putting high-tech terminals in the hands of Wall Street traders, Bloomberg isn't one to bad-mouth the big banks either. After all, it's bankers' bonuses that keep cab drivers, doormen, and servers of all kinds employed. Where Bloomberg parts company with let-them-eat-cake types is in believing that low-wage workers should be provided with Medicaid, SNAP, and high-quality charter schools for their kids, because it's the right thing to do and because, to be blunt, it's an insurance policy against a reprise of the French Revolution. It's not an entirely crazy political philosophy, and it's shared by a decent number of upscale urban liberals and suburban moderates. Bloombergism is not far off from the progressive Republicanism once represented by Nelson Rockefeller and Jacob Javits. What it's emphatically not is Sanders-style socialism, which holds that the chief threat to democracy is the outsized power of ""millionaires and billionaires"" like, well, Michael Bloomberg. Going forward, one can imagine a battle for the Democratic Party's soul that will pit the Bloombourgeoisie against the Sandernistas with both factions fighting to win over working- and lower-middle-class minority voters. The Republicans, meanwhile, might evolve into a more populist party that rails against the plutocrats of Wall Street and Silicon Valley--the spiritual homelands of the Bloombourgeoisie--just as much as they rail against unauthorized immigration. Is this future inevitable? Not at all. But it is looking ever more plausible. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Michael Bloomberg's DNC Speech Proves It: The Democrats Are Now the Party of the Rich

Even in polls where majorities say they distrust her and dislike her, Clinton wins resounding marks on her ability to be president. It's not in question. Where Hillary struggles is in the more elusive qualities. Voters don't trust her. She doesn't seem approachable. Or relatable. Or honest. If the first night of the Democratic National Convention was designed to build up party unity and defuse the tension of the primary, the second night was devoted to dealing with this problem--humanizing Hillary Clinton. And so, viewers were treated to a march of stories and testimonials. Up first were the ""Mothers of the Movement,"" black women who had lost sons and daughters to police or vigilante violence. They testified to the lives and legacies of their children, and attested to Hillary Clinton as a woman who cared, who spoke to them, who treated them with respect and dignity, who represented their interests as citizens. There's wide room to contest Clinton's record on criminal justice, but as stagecraft, this was effective. What followed were words from 9/11 first responders, who like the mothers, testified to Clinton's loyalty and kindness, the extent to which--in their eyes--she was trustworthy. I'm sure you can see the pattern building. Each speaker or set of speakers was placed for this purpose, to reintroduce Hillary Clinton to the public--not as a hypercompetent diplomat or a steely-eyed legislator, or indefatigable presidential candidate, but as a relatable, good-hearted, and fundamentally decent woman. All of it culminated in Bill Clinton. His was the last address of the night, and it was the one most clearly devoted to painting a different portrait of Clinton. And who is Hillary, according to Bill? Hillary is the girl across the room, whom he pursued until she agreed to marry him. She's the woman who pushed and encouraged him as he made a career in politics. She's the devoted mother who gave her all to raise their daughter. She's the ""change maker"" who worked behind the scenes to improve life for the marginalized and disadvantaged. She's his best friend and an invaluable partner in life. ""I just went ahead and asked her to take a walk down to the art museum,"" he said, describing their first date. ""We've been walking, talking, and laughing together ever since. And we've done it in good times and bad, through joy and heartbreak."" As Bill sped toward the conclusion of his speech--both a loving tribute to and brief for his wife--he posed a question to the audience, and the American public writ large. ""If you win elections on the theory that government is always bad and will mess up a two-car parade, a real change maker represents a real threat,"" Clinton said. ""Your only option is to create a cartoon alternative, then run against the cartoons. Cartoons are two-dimensional and are easy to absorb. Real life is complex and hard to absorb."" It's a simple argument. If Hillary seems bad, it's because her opponents have demonized her, crafting a caricature that doesn't represent the actual Hillary. But Bill wants to do more than dispel the caricature. He wants you, the viewer, to understand that he loves Hillary Clinton, that she's a genuine person, that she's the most important part of his life, and that he's willing to give this intimate, personal, and awkward speech if it means you'll see her like he does. Whether or not you believe Clinton--whether or not you buy this piece of political mythmaking--what's striking is the degree to which it was simultaneously mundane and momentous. Structurally, Clinton gave the classic speech of a political spouse. He sounded more like Ann Romney than, well, Bill Clinton. And it was made doubly unusual by the fact that Hillary Clinton is among the most famous women in the world. Americans both know her and find her impenetrable. At the same time, this is a former president (and a man) speaking on behalf of his wife, in a speech that emphasizes Hillary's womanhood. It's a speech in which Clinton--speaking about Hillary's pregnancy--casually referred to the moment her water broke. The political question, as always, is whether this moves the needle. If not for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton would be the most unpopular major party nominee in modern history. And part of that is distrust, fueled both by her actions and the swirl of attacks and innuendo that surround Hillary, and have surrounded her for years. If Bill Clinton still has the old magic, if he can still captivate an audience and bring them along, then Hillary is fine. But there's a chance the dislike and distrust is too deep-seated, and that nothing--not even a love story from the former president of the United States--will change that.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/the_democrats_are_the_party_of_traditional_values.html	"On Monday night, Sen. Al Franken urged attendees at the Democratic National Convention to spend more time working for the party. ""Many of you have families. Ignore them,"" Franken said. ""Kids love it when their parents aren't home. An 8-year-old kid can teach a 4-year-old kid to use a microwave oven. ... You have work to do."" It's hard to imagine anyone telling that joke at a Republican convention. Republicans always present themselves as the party of family values. At their convention last week, Donald Trump declared himself the candidate of law and order. He brought evangelical speakers to the stage to talk about faith. He called Hillary Clinton a crook. Democrats have a hard time connecting with voters who care about God and morals. But every four years, they try. This year, they have an opportunity. In previous presidential elections, Republicans have nominated war heroes (Bob Dole, John McCain) and men of integrity (George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, Mitt Romney). This time, the GOP has nominated a mean, foul-mouthed charlatan and bigot. On Monday night, Democrats savaged Trump's business record. But they focused less on his wealth than on his betrayal of the ethics of capitalism. Many people on the left forget that capitalism isn't just an economic system. In the writings of Adam Smith, and in how it's understood by ordinary people, capitalism is also a moral system. Americans expect people in business to follow certain rules. Anyone who breaks those rules risks a political backlash. In this respect, Bernie Sanders and his Monday night warmup speaker, Elizabeth Warren, are often misunderstood. Sanders is a raging moralist. In his speech, he denounced the ""greed"" and ""recklessness"" of Wall Street and pharmaceutical giants. He denounced the lopsided distribution of wealth as ""not moral."" Warren, too, is a preacher, but her creed isn't socialism. It's fair-minded capitalism. Six times in her address, she used the word ""cheat."" She blasted Trump for cheating workers, students, and investors. She talked about rules, fraud, and accountability. Throughout the day, speakers hammered Trump for ""bilking,"" ""conning,"" and ""scamming"" not just people who gave him their labor but those who gave him their capital. They attacked Trump from the standpoint of Adam Smith, not Karl Marx. Franken joked that Trump University taught Bankruptcy 101: ""how to leave your partners holding the bag."" Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, added: ""Donald Trump has different values. He built his career by ripping people off, stiffing contractors, and skipping out on his bills."" Trump is also mean and petty in his treatment of others. This gives Democrats an opening to frame his unfitness for the presidency as a character issue. In 2000, George W. Bush ran for president as the candidate who would restore honor to the Oval Office. Now the tables are turned. On Monday night, Michelle Obama and other speakers talked about the president as a ""role model."" Jarron Collins, a former NBA player who is now an assistant coach, asked: ""How do you tell your kids not to be a bully if their president is one?"" Of the many groups Trump has insulted, Democrats targeted the ones most likely to elicit sympathy across the political spectrum. One was disabled people. Another was women. A third was veterans. ""We've watched [Trump] demean the service of [John McCain], saying he's not a war hero"" because McCain was captured, Sen. Cory Booker said. ""Would he say that to the brave men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan, right now risking capture or worse?"" The Democrats' more ambitious project, however, is to present Trump's use of ethnic prejudice not just as a matter of identity politics but as a moral issue. ""Too many of our children are watching and learning the wrong lessons from Donald Trump,"" warned Rep. Linda Sanchez of California. Sanchez recalled a recent high school basketball game at which white students chanted ""Build That Wall"" to taunt Hispanic players on the other team. ""A Trump presidency would be a signal to our children that we condone this kind of behavior,"" said Sanchez. ""Who we vote for says a lot about our values."" Democrats are learning to present conservative cultural arguments for positions that used to be perceived as subversive. One is the legalization of undocumented immigrants. The traditional view is that people who entered the United States without going through a legal process broke the law and skipped the line and that this is wrong. That's true, but it's not the end of the story. In most cases, the immigrant brings a family, becomes a faithful worker, and joins a community. To deport him, you have to tear apart the piece of the social fabric he has created. That's why we heard a lot on Monday about ""hard-working"" immigrants who ""pay taxes and raise their families"" in the United States. ""When Donald Trump talks about deporting 11 million people, he's talking about ripping families apart,"" said Astrid Silva, an immigration activist. Lily Eskelsen Garcia, the president of the National Education Association, added, ""Hillary Clinton believes in keeping families together."" Democrats have also adjusted their language on women in the workplace. Clinton likes to joke about playing the ""woman card."" But on equal pay, her party is playing the family card. ""Families rely on women's income, but we still don't have equal pay for equal work,"" complained Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey agreed: ""When a single mom earns an equal wage for equal work, it empowers the most important building block in all of our nation. And that is the family."" Liberals aren't always comfortable with this kind of talk. They're skittish about religion, lifestyle norms, or anything that smacks of judgment. But judgment, like sex, is something we all do, even if we don't admit it. We might as well do it right. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/the_dnc_hack_is_watergate_but_worse.html	A foreign government has hacked a political party's computers--and possibly an election. It has stolen documents and timed their release to explode with maximum damage. It is a strike against our civic infrastructure. And though nobody died--and there was no economic toll exacted--the Russians were aiming for a tender spot, a central node of our democracy. It was hard to see the perniciousness of this attack at first, especially given how news media initially covered the story. The Russians, after all, didn't knock out a power grid. And when the stolen information arrived, it was dressed in the ideology of WikiLeaks, which presents its exploits as possessing a kind of journalistic bravery the traditional media lacks. But this document dump wasn't a high-minded act of transparency. To state the obvious, only one political party has been exposed. (Selectively exposed: Many emails were culled from the abridged dump.) And it's not really even the inner workings of the Democrats that have been revealed; the documents don't suggest new layers of corruption or detail any new conspiracies. They're something closer to the embarrassing emails that fly across every office in America--griping, the testing of stupid ideas, the banal musings that take place in private correspondence. The emails don't get us much beyond a fact every sentient political observer could already see: Officials at the DNC, hired to work hand in glove with a seemingly inevitable nominee, were actively making life easier for Hillary Clinton. It didn't take these leaks to understand that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a hack and that the DNC should be far more neutral in presidential primaries. What's galling about the WikiLeaks dump is the way in which the organization has blurred the distinction between leaks and hacks. Leaks are an important tool of journalism and accountability. When an insider uncovers malfeasance, he brings information to the public in order to stop the wrongdoing. That's not what happened here. The better analogy for these hacks is Watergate. To help win an election, the Russians broke into the virtual headquarters of the Democratic Party. The hackers installed the cyber-version of the bugging equipment that Nixon's goons used--sitting on the DNC computers for a year, eavesdropping on everything, collecting as many scraps as possible. This is trespassing, it's thievery, it's a breathtaking transgression of privacy. It falls into that classic genre, the dirty trick. Yet that term feels too innocent to describe the offense. Nixon's dirty tricksters didn't mindlessly expose the private data of low-level staff. We should be appalled at the public broadcast of this minutiae. It will have a chilling effect--campaign staffers will now assume they no longer have the space to communicate honestly. This honest communication--even if it's often trivial or dumb--is important for the process of arriving at sound strategy and sound ideas. (To be sure, the DNC shouldn't need privacy to know that attacking a man for his faith is just plain gross.) Open conversation, conducted with the expectation of privacy, is the necessary precondition for the formation of collective wisdom and consensus. If we eviscerate the possibility of privacy in politics, we increase the likelihood of poor decision-making. It is possible to argue that Russia is just behaving as great powers often do. States try to manipulate opinion beyond their borders. Barack Obama recently attempted to sway the British public to reject Brexit; we don't just broadcast the Voice of America to expose the world to jazz. Russia does this, too. It has a website and television network, Russia Today. We might not care for Russia Today and its propagandistic coverage, but it operates in the open. It uses reporting and opinion to sway hearts and minds. The interconnected nature of the world means that it would be malpractice for states not to make the best case for its policies to enemy and ally alike. The United States is better when it understands the world and argues with it. Still, we have a clear set of rules designed to limit foreign interference in our elections, to protect our sovereignty. We should be open to rational arguments from abroad but terrified about states playing a larger role than that. This is why we don't let foreign entities make campaign contributions. We don't allow noncitizens to vote. Consider our reaction, if an American political leader had pulled this stunt: He would be prosecuted, and drummed from political life. These are unacceptable tactics for an American; they can hardly be more tolerable when executed by a foreign power that wishes us ill. The DNC dump may not have revealed a conspiracy that could end a candidacy, but it succeeded in casting a pall of anxiety over this election. We know that the Russians have a further stash of documents from the DNC and another set of documents purloined from the Clinton Foundation. In other words, Vladimir Putin is now treating American democracy with the same respect he accords his own. The best retaliation isn't a military one, or to respond in kind. It's to defeat his pet candidate and to force him to watch the inauguration of the woman he so abhors.

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/democrats_aren_t_in_disarray_a_minority_of_berniacs_are_in_a_snit.html	"PHILADELPHIA--On the opening day of the Democratic National Convention, it seems as if Democrats are in actual disarray. It's hard to type that with a straight face, ""Dems are in disarray"" being such a sturdy cliche of political journalism. But the headlines today seem to be getting at some undeniable rifts in the party. Leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee show disdain and anger for Bernie Sanders, undermining its claims of neutrality in the primary and leading to the much-sought ouster of Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz from her position at the top of the DNC. On the streets, frustrated Sanders delegates are knocking Hillary Clinton, Wasserman Schultz, and the party nominee for vice president, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. As governor of Virginia, Kaine walked a delicate line, pleasing liberals with fights against the National Rifle Association and the state's major tobacco growers and appeasing conservatives with his ""personally pro-life"" politics and support for anti-abortion messages, like the ""Choose Life"" license plates he authorized while in office. Kaine left office in 2009--governors of Virginia are limited to one term--but returned to statewide politics in 2012 as a successful candidate for Senate. As a senator, he's been a team player, voting with the Obama administration on most of its priorities, and amassing a largely liberal record. But in his 10 years on the state and national stage, Democratic politics have moved to the left. The party grassroots wants a liberal champion, if not for the top of the ticket, then at least for vice president. Kaine doesn't fit the bill, and those frustrated Sanders delegates are angry. ""If Clinton has reached out to Bernie supporters, it appears that she has done so to stick triangulating thumbs in their eyes,"" said Norman Solomon, coordinator of a group which claims to represent hundreds of Sanders delegates at the convention, to the Washington Post. You heard similar language--or at least a similar tone--from Sanders surrogates like actress Rosario Dawson, who told a collection of Bernie supporters and delegates that they should press on with their demands, regardless of what happens. ""If Trump wins,"" she said, ""it's not our fault."" But for all of this anger and apparent discord--which included a room of Bernie backers booing the Vermont senator for endorsing Hillary Clinton--it's not clear the Democratic Party is in actual disarray. Yes, there are angry and discontented delegates who supported Bernie Sanders in the primaries. Some are avowedly anti-Hillary and believe Sanders was sabotaged by the DNC in an effort to subvert the will of Democratic voters. There is no evidence that this is true. If, in January, you looked at nothing but the demographics of Clinton and Sanders support, you could have predicted the outcome. Here's what I wrote at the beginning of the year. ""If Sanders can break or subvert Clinton's relationship with black Democrats, he can win. If he can't, he won't."" More important than the mechanics of the primary, however, is the simple fact that these delegates--these vehemently anti-Clinton voters--are an unrepresentative minority of all Bernie supporters. Of the voters who backed Sanders throughout the course of the Democratic primary, 90 percent support Clinton, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center. Of those who switched from Clinton to Sanders or from Sanders to Clinton, 88 percent now back Clinton. Even with a third-party candidate in the mix, as noted by Harry Enten of FiveThirtyEight, the picture is one of general unity, with around a third of Sanders' primary voters rejecting the Clinton ticket. And those voters are neither regular voters nor consistent Democrats. Many are voters who normally support third-party candidates, but who signed on to Bernie's campaign because of its distance from the Democratic establishment. None of this is to say that everything is fine for Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Despite its ugliness (or perhaps, because of it), Donald Trump has earned a ""bump"" from the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, unifying Republicans behind his candidacy and winning some independents to his side. Depending on where you look, Trump is either tied with Clinton or leading. Restrict yourself to polling averages, and you see a similar story: Trump has stabilized and pulled himself even with Hillary Clinton. Convention-day discontent aside, the Democratic Party is largely unified behind Clinton, in part because the party is unified behind Barack Obama, her most consequential booster. But if Trump's momentum is any indication, mere unity isn't enough. Clinton will have to find a way to pull those discontented Bernie supporters into the fold, and keep them from drifting to third-party candidates, or even from backing Trump. It's easier said than done. Before Clinton announced Kaine for vice president, she floated Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in the form of a joint campaign appearance. Warren is fiercely popular with these Sanders voters, but in the wake of her endorsement, she was hit with their ire, condemned for backing Clinton. And as we saw Monday afternoon, even Bernie can't temper their anger. Which leaves us with a series of questions. For as much as they say they want a progressive path for the future of the country--a ""political revolution,"" as it were--are they willing to enter any coalition to achieve it? Is there anything Clinton (or Sanders or Warren) can say or do to attract their support? Are they here to win, or are they here to perform? Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/07/the_people_who_hate_hillary_clinton_the_most.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. In 1996, the New Yorker published ""Hating Hillary,"" Henry Louis Gates' reported piece on the widespread animosity for the then-first lady. ""Like horse-racing, Hillary-hating has become one of those national pastimes which unite the elite and the lumpen,"" Gates wrote. ""[T]here's just something about her that pisses people off,"" the renowned Washington hostess Sally Quinn told Gates. ""This is the reaction that she elicits from people."" It might seem as though nothing much has changed in 20 years. Many people disliked Hillary Clinton when she first emerged onto the political scene, and many people dislike her now. She is on track to become the least popular Democratic nominee in modern history, although voters like Donald Trump even less. But over the last two decades, the something that pisses people off has changed. Speaking to Gates, former Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan described ""an air of apple-cheeked certitude"" in Clinton that is ""political in its nature and grating in its effects."" Noonan saw in Clinton ""an implicit insistence throughout her career that hers were the politics of moral decency and therefore those who opposed her politics were obviously of a lower moral order."" Noonan's view was a common one. Take, for example, Michael Kelly's 1993 New York Times Magazine profile, mockingly titled ""Saint Hillary."" ""Since she discovered, at the age of 14, that for people less fortunate than herself the world could be very cruel, Hillary Rodham Clinton has harbored an ambition so large that it can scarcely be grasped,"" Kelly wrote. ""She would like to make things right. She is 45 now and she knows that the earnest idealisms of a child of the 1960s may strike some people as naive or trite or grandiose. But she holds to them without any apparent sense of irony or inadequacy."" Kelly's piece painted Clinton as a moralist, a meddler, a prig. Few people dislike Hillary Clinton for being too moralistic anymore. In trying to understand the seemingly eternal phenomenon of Hillary hatred, I've spoken to people all around America who revile her. I've interviewed Trump supporters, conventional conservatives, Bernie Sanders fans, and even a few people who reluctantly voted for Clinton in the Democratic primary but who nevertheless say they can't stand her. Most of them described a venal cynic. Strikingly, the reasons people commonly give for hating Clinton now are almost the exact opposite of the reasons people gave for hating her in the 1990s. Back then, she was a self-righteous ideologue; now she's a corrupt tool of the establishment. Back then, she was too rigid; now she's too flexible. Recently, Morning Consult polled people who don't like Clinton about the reasons for their distaste. Eighty-four percent agreed with the statement ""She changes her positions when it's politically convenient."" Eighty-two percent consider her ""corrupt."" Motives for loathing Clinton have evolved. But the loathing itself has remained constant. * * * Brian Greene is a 49-year-old accountant and financial analyst who lives in the Chicago suburbs. He was a conservative in the 1990s and despised both Clintons. ""I thought she was someone who came off as a bit entitled and kind of full of herself,"" he says of Hillary. His view then, he says, was that she was ""Bill without the charisma."" Greene became disillusioned with the right due to the Iraq war; he supported Howard Dean in 2004 and now describes himself as a libertarian-ish liberal. Yet while his politics changed, his aversion to Clinton did not. He actually voted for her in the Illinois primary--Sanders, he says, didn't seem like a plausible president. But he did so with a complete lack of enthusiasm. Had the Republicans elevated someone ""sane"" such as John Kasich, he says, he'd return to the GOP in November. ""She strikes me as so programmed and almost robotic,"" he says of Hillary. ""I don't think her recent move to the left, or being more populist recently, is part of who she is but more of a reaction to Sanders in the race."" Greene says he'd have preferred to vote for Elizabeth Warren, even though Clinton's more centrist politics are closer to his own. He's not sure that likability should matter to him, but it does. ""I like to think it's more about policy and what they do, but for me it's like, do you want to see this person on television for eight years, or four years,"" he says. ""For better or worse, the president is someone who represents the country and will be part of your life."" There are certainly people who don't like Clinton because they don't like her record and her proposals. Marcella Aburdene, a 31-year-old market researcher in Washington, D.C., has a Palestinian father and is horrified by what she sees as Clinton's hawkishness and allegiance to Israel. ""She is disingenuous and she lies blatantly, but that's what a lot of politicians do,"" Aburdene says. ""It's definitely more of a policy issue for me."" She plans to vote for the Green Party's Jill Stein in November. For many, however, resistance to Clinton goes beyond policy. ""It's not that I just don't like Hillary's positions,"" says Margo Guryan Rosner, a Los Angeles songwriter (her work has been recorded by Julie London, Mama Cass, and Harry Belafonte, among others) and Sanders devotee. ""I don't like her."" Like many of the people I spoke to, Rosner's antipathy doesn't follow a precise ideological trajectory. Now 78, she says her negative feelings about Clinton first arose during Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. Rosner says she was especially irritated when, in response to criticism of her work at the Rose Law Firm, Hillary said, ""You know, I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession."" ""That bugged me,"" says Rosner. ""She was putting down regular women, people who stay home and take care of kids and bake cookies."" It's not that Rosner was offended on behalf of housewives; she herself has always had a career. ""I just thought it was a stupid comment,"" she says. ""I don't think she's as smart as most people think she is, or seem to think she is."" Rosner also makes a fairly standard progressive case against Clinton. ""I don't like her support for the Iraq war,"" she says. ""She didn't support same-sex marriage until it became a popular issue. Her email stuff--she is the only one that would not testify, and I think that's bullshit. I don't like her friendship with Netanyahu. I think they've destroyed the Middle East with Iraq. I don't like that she takes money from big banks. She doesn't support universal health care. For all those reasons. I think she's more a Republican than a Democrat, and I refuse to vote for Republicans, ever."" All the same, Rosner says she would happily vote for Joe Biden, who also voted for the Iraq war. In the Senate, Biden was known for his deep ties to the credit card industry, and as a presidential candidate, he didn't support universal health insurance. ""Yeah, Biden does not have all the positions I would like, but he has a certain kind of humanity that touches me,"" she says. Several of the people I spoke to see Clinton as lacking in humanity. It's not just that they don't like her--they also feel, on some level, that she doesn't like them. ""I don't think she has a clue what people in my position need in life and certainly wouldn't stoop to, quote unquote, my level,"" says Mindy Gardner, a 49-year-old in Davenport, Iowa, who works in the produce section of a Hy-Vee grocery store. ""If I could make her a profit she'd be my best friend, but I can't, so she doesn't know I exist."" Gardner, who raised two children as a single mother, says she felt vaguely positive about Bill Clinton when he was elected in 1992. In 2008, she supported John McCain, and in this election she's become a passionate Sanders backer. She sees Hillary Clinton as integral to the economic system that has left her struggling. ""I've been working since I was 12. It seems like when I was working as a kid, my money went further than it does now as an adult, just trying to feed the kids. I could work 40 hours a week and go live in the Y because that's all you can afford,"" she says. The Clintons, says Gardner, ""removed a lot of sanctions against companies and changed a lot of laws so companies could pay their workers less, fight unions, fight health care."" Employment used to come with security and benefits, she says. ""That was just common knowledge, all those things you got when you worked your butt off for a company."" Clinton, she believes, had a hand in taking all that away. ""Bill and Hillary's friends were all rich, they were the ones who owned all these companies, why not use your power to let everyone in your circle get as rich as humanly possible?"" Several of the policies Clinton has put forth would help Gardner. When I ask her about Clinton's proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 per hour, Gardner says, ""I would like to make $12 an hour, that would be nice."" But it almost doesn't matter what Clinton's policies are, because Gardner doesn't trust her to enact any of them. ""If she was moving her lips she was probably lying about it,"" she says. * * * Some who loathe Clinton see her as the living embodiment of avarice and deception. These Clinton haters take at face value every charge Republicans have ever hurled at her, as well as dark accusations that circulate online. They have the most invidious possible explanation for Whitewater, the dubious real estate deal that served as a pretext for endless Republican investigations of the Clintons in the 1990s. (Clinton was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, though one of her business partners, James McDougal, went to prison for fraud in a related case.) Sometimes they believe that Clinton murdered her former law partner, Vince Foster, who committed suicide in 1993. They hold her responsible for the deadly attack on the American outpost in Benghazi, Libya. Peter Schweizer's new book Clinton Cash has convinced them that there was a corrupt nexus between Clinton's State Department, various foreign governments, and the Clinton family's foundation. Most of Schweizer's allegations have either been disproven or shown to be unsubstantiated, but that hasn't stopped Trump from invoking them repeatedly. In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, he accused Clinton of raking in ""millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers."" As former New York Times editor-in-chief Jill Abramson wrote, ""I would be 'dead rich,' to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I've spent covering just about every 'scandal' that has enveloped the Clintons."" After all that investigation, Abramson concluded that Clinton ""is fundamentally honest and trustworthy."" But the appearance of perpetual scandal surrounding Clinton can make it seem as if she must be hiding something monstrous, especially to those who are predisposed against her. ""I think that Hillary Clinton is a sociopath, so I think that her main interest is in her pocketbook, and I think that's obvious from looking at the Clinton Foundation,"" says Uday Sachdeva, a 22-year-old Trump supporter from Georgia who is about to start medical school. Sachdeva, the son of Indian Hindu immigrants, produces a podcast about sports and politics with a childhood friend, and he offers a precisely detailed--if hallucinatory--Clinton demonology, like a fantasy-football obsessive spitting out statistics. ""There's 47 suspicious deaths around Hillary Clinton. Eleven of them are her personal bodyguards, and you have Bill Clinton's alleged rape victims,"" he says. He lists a number of these figures, explaining the dubious circumstances of their demises. Some of the names are familiar, like McDougal, who died of a heart attack in a Texas prison in 1998. Others are more obscure, at least to anyone who hasn't put in hours on conspiracy websites. ""Paula Grober, Clinton's interpreter for the deaf, traveled with Clinton from 1978 to 1992, died in a one-car accident,"" Sachdeva says. ""There was another one where they found the brakes cut of a motorcycle and he slammed into the back of a truck. That would be Keith Coney."" (According to Clinton conspiracy theorists, Coney, 19, had information about the death of two 17-year-olds who'd witnessed a drug-smuggling operation linked to Bill Clinton.) ""It's just a bunch of suspicious circumstances that all these people were friends of Hillary Clinton,"" Sachdeva says. I asked him where he was getting his information, and he listed a number of sources, including Snopes.com--which has indeed reported on rumors about the Clinton body count but only to debunk them. When I mention this, Sachdeva is unfazed. ""I have a propensity to think that there's a little bit of fire in the smoke,"" he says. Not all the likely Trump voters I spoke to were quite so febrile, but like Sachdeva, they express a loathing that transcends ideology. Denny Butcher, a 44-year-old Army veteran in Raleigh, North Carolina, thinks Barack Obama's politics are worse than Hillary Clinton's but finds Obama far more personable. ""I was against him from the very beginning, because I feel like he is about as left as left can be, until Bernie Sanders came along,"" Butcher says of Obama. ""He believes the opposite of what I do on almost every issue."" All the same, he says, ""If I met Barack Obama on the street, there's a good chance I'd say he's a decent guy. I don't get that feeling from Hillary Clinton. I don't feel like she's a likable person at all. At all. I think she feels like she's above the law, and she's above us peasants."" Butcher was raised to be a Democrat, and he voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. He's since moved right and voted for Ted Cruz in the North Carolina primary; he plans to vote for Trump in the general. He always disliked Hillary, he says, and his distaste intensified when, as first lady, she was put in charge of health care reform. ""I felt like she's not an elected official and she's trying to take liberties with a position that was an unelected position. I felt like it was not her job to be involved with legislation,"" he says. In Butcher's aversion to what he perceived to be Clinton's sense of entitlement, I started to see how contemporary loathing of Hillary overlaps with the '90s version. Her enemies' caricature of her has flipped from Madame Defarge, Charles Dickens' revolutionary villainess, to Marie Antoinette, symbol of callous aristocracy, but the sense of Clinton's insulting presumption has remained constant. Aside from Al Gore, whoever Bill Clinton had put in charge of health care reform would have been unelected; presidents make lots of appointments that have legislative consequences. (No one elected Robert F. Kennedy to be John F. Kennedy's attorney general.) To me, at least, it sounded as if Butcher was angry that Hillary had stepped outside the role of a typical first lady, that she had transgressed certain gender constraints. But like most Hillary haters, Butcher rejects the idea that gender has anything to do with his antipathy. ""Not at all,"" he says. ""Absolutely not. Nope."" Also like a lot of people who despise Clinton, Butcher finds her invocations of gender infuriating. ""I think she's trying to tell people, 'Vote for me because I'm a woman,' "" he says. ""Ignore the fact that I have accomplished practically nothing significant in my whole career in the public eye, but I'm a woman, so vote for me."" Listening to Butcher brought me back to Rosner. Their politics are very different, but their assessments of Hillary Clinton are strikingly similar. Like Butcher, she's irritated by what she sees as Clinton's gender-based pitch. ""She's a grandmother. So am I. Big deal,"" Rosner says. Like Butcher, Rosner felt that Clinton had overstepped as first lady. ""She and her husband were putting her right out in front, and she didn't handle herself well,"" she says. ""She certainly wasn't a Michelle Obama."" Unlike Hillary, says Rosner, Michelle Obama ""seems to say the right thing at the right time, and she is very supportive of her husband and her children, even staying in Washington after they leave office so that one of her children doesn't have to switch schools. That's a big deal."" Rosner may be very liberal, but not all our gut reactions are governed by politics. * * * It could be that the reasons people give for disliking Clinton have changed simply because she herself has changed. She entered the White House as a brashly self-confident liberal. Early on, some of the president's advisers sought to undermine her plans for health care reform because they were thought to be insufficiently business-friendly; in response, Carl Bernstein, one of her biographers, quotes her snapping at her husband, ""You didn't get elected to do Wall Street economics."" Then, after the epic repudiation of the 1994 midterms, in which Republicans won a House majority for the first time since 1952, she overcorrected--becoming too cautious, too compromising, too solicitous of entrenched interests. As she would say during her 2000 Senate campaign, ""I now come from the school of small steps."" In other words, people hated Hillary Clinton for being one sort of person, and in response to that she became another sort of person, who people hated for different reasons. But this doesn't explain why the emotional tenor of the hatred seems so consistent, even as the rationale for it has turned inside out. Perhaps that's because anti-Hillary animus is only partly about what she does. It's also driven by some ineffable quality of charisma, or the lack of it. No doubt, this quality is gendered; Americans tend not to like ambitious women with loud voices. As Rebecca Traister wrote in her recent New York magazine profile of Clinton, ""It's worth asking to what degree charisma, as we have defined it, is a masculine trait. Can a woman appeal to the country in the same way we are used to men doing it?"" Elizabeth Warren's forthright authenticity is often favorably contrasted with Clinton's calculated persona, but when Warren was running for Senate against Scott Brown, she was also widely painted as dishonest and unlikable. (According to one poll, even Democrats found Brown more personally appealing.) This fits a broader pattern. Marianne Cooper, a sociologist at Stanford's Clayman Institute for Gender Research and the lead researcher on Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In, says that women who are successful in areas that are culturally coded as male are typically seen as ""abrasive, conniving, not trustworthy, and selfish."" What's happening to Clinton, says Cooper, ""happens to a lot of women. There are millions of people who will say about another woman: She's really good at her job, I just don't like her. They think they're making an objective evaluation, but when we look at the broader analysis, there is a pattern to the bias."" Among hardcore Trump supporters, the misogyny often isn't subtle. The Republican National Convention seethed with a visceral, highly personalized, and highly sexualized contempt toward Clinton. Men wore T-shirts that said, ""Hillary Sucks but Not Like Monica"" on one side and ""Trump That Bitch"" on the backs. Buttons and bumper stickers read, ""Life's a Bitch: Don't Vote For One."" One man wore a Hillary mask and sat behind a giant yellow sign saying ""Trump vs. Tramp."" Another, an RNC volunteer, was dressed up like Septa Unella from Game of Thrones and held a naked blowup doll with Clinton's face attached, re-enacting a scene in which Cersei Lannister, a murderous queen, is stripped naked and marched through the streets before jeering throngs. The right-wing fantasy of seeing Clinton degraded and humiliated has rarely been performed so starkly. Most Americans, however, are not frothing partisans. For many of them, something in addition to sexism is at work in Clinton's unpopularity--some mystery of mass media connection. There's a reason actors do screen tests: Not everyone's charm translates to film and video. For as long as Hillary Clinton has been in public life, people who've met in her person have marveled at how much more likable she is in the flesh than she is on television. ""What's remarkable isn't that she can be funny, spontaneous, and mischievous, and has a loud, throaty laugh; what's remarkable is the extent to which she has sequestered her personality from the media,"" Gates wrote in 1996. Twenty years later, Traister discovered a similar disconnect. ""The conviction that I was in the presence of a capable, charming politician who inspires tremendous excitement would fade and in fact clash dramatically with the impressions I'd get as soon as I left her circle: of a campaign imperiled, a message muddled, unfavorables scarily high,"" she wrote. ""To be near her is to feel like the campaign is in steady hands; to be at any distance is to fear for the fate of the republic."" Republican strategist Katie Packer sees parallels between Clinton and Mitt Romney, for whom Packer served as deputy campaign manager in 2012. ""In a lot of ways her weaknesses are very similar to Mitt's weaknesses,"" Packer tells me. ""She's somebody who is kind of a policy nerd, somebody who is very solution-oriented. She just does not have great people skills. Because of that, whenever something goes wrong, people don't give her the benefit of the doubt. They don't trust her."" Politically, this is a hard dynamic to overcome; Clinton's efforts to appear relatable only make her seem more calculating. ""It comes across as stilted and staged and for a purpose, so it defeats the purpose,"" says Packer. The analogy only goes so far, however, because Romney never attracted the amount of venom that Clinton has, either from within or without his party. Which leads us back to gender. Packer is the co-founder of Burning Glass Consulting, an all-female firm that specializes in helping Republican candidates reach female voters. She has spent a lot of time studying how people react to female candidates. ""The benefit you get from being a woman running is, No. 1, you're seen as more empathetic, more relatable, having deeper feelings about things, not just approaching things in an unemotional way,"" Packer says. ""And 2, you're seen as not a typical politician."" If that's true, it's possible that when a woman approaches politics in a coolly pragmatic way--when she shows herself to be, in many ways, a typical politician--it makes people particularly uncomfortable. If Packer is right, not only is Clinton not behaving the way a woman is supposed to behave; she's not behaving the way a woman politician is supposed to behave. She's not a mama grizzly like Sarah Palin circa 2008 or a brassy dame like former Texas Gov. Ann Richards. ""Because she's not very good at these qualities that are viewed as more feminine, she loses the benefit on that front, too,"" says Packer. For Democrats, the silver lining is that Clinton's running against Donald Trump. ""I think she won the lottery ticket,"" Packer says. According to Packer, there's a way to make independent and moderate Republican women soften toward Hillary Clinton: Go after her husband's infidelity. ""One thing that causes them to come to her defense is when they feel like she's being blamed for her husband's bad behavior,"" Packer says. Trump has done exactly that, attacking Hillary as an ""enabler"" of her husband's sexual misdeeds. ""The one Republican who is incapable of not bullying her is going to be her opponent,"" says Packer. ""The one Republican who is incapable of showing any empathy in his own right is going to be her opponent."" That makes it more likely that many voters will do what Brian Greene did and vote for Clinton despite their distaste. Should that happen, it remains to be seen if Hillary hatred shapes her ability to govern. Cooper thinks it's possible that once she's no longer explicitly competing for power, the widespread public dislike of her might ebb. ""When she announces she's running for something, her unfavorability increases,"" Cooper says of Clinton. ""When she's in a role, her favorability starts to creep up again."" Figures from the Pew Research Center bear this out. Clinton's favorability ratings fell to 49 percent when she was running for Senate in 2000, then went up to 60 percent when she entered office. They've fallen below 50 percent during both presidential campaigns but reached 66 percent when she was secretary of state. ""It may be that the moment she starts to claim more power, it elicits a negative response,"" Cooper says. We might soon find out if the same thing happens once the power is hers."	Why Do People Hate Hillary Clinton So Much?

That's what it felt like outside the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where burly hellfire prophets hoisted signs condemning sinners, Hare Krishnas chanted, and protesters and Trump supporters swirled together in packed streets while rows of stone-faced police lined the sidewalks. But the end-of-the-world feeling came from more than just the throngs of believers. It came from the fact that a bizarre and inconceivable calamity has been visited upon us, and yet ordinary life grinds on. A major party has just nominated Donald Trump for president. In the end, the feared clashes between protesters and armed Trump supporters never came to pass. Only a few hundred demonstrators showed up on Thursday, and an endless flow of cops massed around them every time they made a move. The shocking scenes were all inside the oval bowl of the Quicken Loans Arena, where Donald Trump presided over the most base and demagogic convention in modern history. It was poorly run, though that is of secondary importance. The convention made it clear that Trump lacks management skills and can't even put on a good show, the one thing that even those who despise Trump thought him capable of. It consisted of long stretches of soporific tedium with brief bursts of absurdity, ugliness, and chaos--Melania Trump plagiarizing Michelle Obama, Chris Christie presiding over a mock show trial, Ted Cruz being booed off the stage. All of this bodes ill for Trump's ability to govern a country. Nevertheless, we should be glad for his indiscipline, because the one thing standing between Trumpism and full-blown fascism is Trump's lack of organizational skills. He has no cadres or shock troops. There's just him, a few lackeys, and the mob of atomized voters who've elevated him. On Thursday night, he was introduced by his daughter Ivanka, who seemed to be speaking about another man entirely. She invoked the gender pay gap--a gap many on the right deny exists--and said that her father ""will fight for equal pay for equal work."" This is not a promise that Trump has made before. It was certainly heartening to hear such progressive ideas voiced at a Republican convention. But as the crowd cheered sentiments that were diametrically opposed to everything they claimed to believe yesterday, it underscored the degree to which the party has been intellectually gutted. The GOP is now purely a cult of personality. Trump entered to the soundtrack of the Harrison Ford movie Air Force One. His speech--on a night dubbed, perversely, ""Make America One Again""--showed his eagerness to play to the mob's lowest impulses. The rate of violent crime remains far lower than it was when Barack Obama took office--never mind during the administration of George W. Bush--but Trump conjured a country beset by crime and disorder, crying out for a strongman to put things right. ""Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities,"" he said. ""Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end. Beginning on January 20, 2017, safety will be restored."" He had little to say about how this remarkable feat would be accomplished, beyond building a border wall. ""The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015,"" he said. ""They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources."" The convention has repeatedly focused on violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, despite the fact that first-generation immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans. In his speech, Trump continued waving the bloody shirt. He invoked the story of Sarah Root, a young woman killed by an undocumented drunk driver. ""I've met Sarah's beautiful family,"" he said. ""But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting."" Cries of ""BOOOOOO"" echoed through the hall. ""One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders,"" said Trump. In a way, ""Make America One Again"" was an apt slogan. Nothing unites people like a shared hatred. Trump shows us a party bound not by a common ideology or political project but a common identity. ""This is a very dark and frightening speech,"" former George H.W. Bush speechwriter Mary Kate Cary tweeted on Thursday night. It was a dark and frightening week. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Republican Party Is Out of Ideas.

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/trump_was_too_dark_scary_and_unhinged_at_the_rnc.html	"The fact that we all knew it was coming didn't make it any less grotesque. The takeover of the Republican Party by a dangerous demagogue and his disgracefully supportive family has been discussed and chewed over ad nauseam. But the particular nature of Donald Trump's convention speech, with its almost comically overstated (and utterly distorted) fearmongering, was particularly alarming for people who care about quaint notions like democracy and liberty. And yet, the speech also displayed for viewers the reasons that Trump is unlikely to win in November. For all the talk of his political jujitsu, he doesn't have the skill or self-control of a truly adept autocrat. Trump's speech left no doubt that he is an uninhibited authoritarian who would wreak havoc on the country and the world if elected. When the text of Trump's speech leaked Thursday afternoon, pundits focused, correctly, on how dark it was, and how terrifying a picture it painted of present-day America. And, indeed, the written speech was gloomy and apocalyptic. But it was nothing compared to the speech as delivered by a red-faced, angry madman. Taking a page from Rudy Giuliani's playbook, Trump yelled out some of his lines, scowled with abandon, and relished only in the doom and gloom he was selling. Trump's plan for the country became clearer Thursday night: He is painting the United States as a country essentially on the verge of a breakdown, and thus a country that needs to take extraordinary measures to be rescued. Hence the focus on crime, terrorism, and social decay; hence the misleading statistics and dark warnings about the future. The goal is to win the election, but it is also to set up a narrative about the country Trump would be taking over. A state of emergency calls for extraordinary measures. The problem for Trump, and the saving grace for the world, is that he isn't quite good enough to sell his message. The address was horrifyingly bleak and scary; it was also much too long, much too dark, and much too unfocused. Trump's shouting was jarringly out of sync with other passages of the speech; his utter lack of policy specifics will be noticed even by people who do not write about policy for a living; and his tone prevented the ostensibly lighter passages from registering. The speech--which ran until well past 11 p.m. on the East Coast--is not the last thing you want to watch before bed. It had such strong fascist undertones, and so many foreboding passages, that it kept reminding me of Ridley Scott's famous ""1984"" ad for Apple. This inability to temper himself, intimately connected to his inability to control his temper, is what has hamstrung Trump all along. Trump couldn't just make a strong case about stopping immigration. No, he had to call Mexicans rapists and question the impartiality of an American judge. He couldn't just speak out against ISIS. No, he also had to call for a total ban on Muslims coming to the United States. Although Trump generally stuck to the text of this speech, and didn't go off-script as some of his advisers and anxious Republicans surely feared, he still turned in a typically loony Trumpian performance, because that's him. There is nothing else. If there were, Hillary Clinton would be in trouble. And that's the really scary thing. It's worth considering what Trump has unleashed, not just in terms of nativism and bigotry, but in proving that white nationalism has a real base. The fear, then, isn't just that Trump could win, which he could, despite his low odds. The fear is that a better, cooler, more polished version of Trump could rise in his wake. That is a prospect, and a danger, that will not disappear no matter what happens in November. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Trump Is Unhinged.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/how_the_berners_final_protest_went_bust.html	"PHILADELPHIA--You could not speak long with a Bernie Sanders delegate from California before hearing about the latest seating drama. ""It seems like [the Clinton delegates] are getting more and more frustrated,"" said Jose Caballero, a young, suited Sanders delegate from San Diego. We were sitting in the second-to-last row of the Wells Fargo Center on Thursday afternoon. Sanders supporters had taped the last two rows off for themselves, in solidarity, after a series of perceived slights from the Clinton delegates up in front. Caballero pointed to a Clinton delegate wearing pink sitting near the front. ""She literally picked up our stuff and sat in our seat, and took our seat,"" he said. ""And we're like, 'Hey, we're sitting there, that person will be right back,' and she's like, 'Nope, I'm taking this seat.' "" It was an intentional effort, he said, to take up what seats they could by the front, thus keeping Sanders supporters out of the limelight. Stories abounded Wednesday night of Clinton fillers streaming into their Sanders seats whenever they got up and refusing to leave. For Thursday night, Northern California whip Robert Shearer said, the Sanders folks would have their section ""shut down,"" with people monitoring who came in and out. How you feel about the Clinton delegates here will depend in large part on whether the Sanders delegates and their stunts have exhausted your store of patience. A band of hardcore Sanders delegates, primarily from activist-rich states such as California, Washington, Oregon, or Colorado, have interrupted the speeches of everyone from Rep. Elijah Cummings to former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. They staged a walkout Tuesday afternoon and held a sit-in by the media tents to grab attention for themselves, just as Hillary Clinton became the first woman ever to received a major party presidential nomination. Comedian Sarah Silverman spoke for millions and millions of Americans on Monday night when she told the ""Bernie or Bust people"" that ""you're being ridiculous."" This was the psychic distance many Democrats had traveled over the course of the convention, as regards the Bernie dead-enders: from ""You're being ridiculous"" to, what the hell, let's just steal their seats. It would be too simple to explain the Bernie diehards' protests as a never-ending sour-grapes snit about how their man lost. No, they're not happy about that, and many of them can quote leaked Democratic National Committee emails by heart to explain how the nomination was ""rigged."" But their protests haven't really been about Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. They haven't been about refusing to vote for Clinton, either. They're split on that. These are people of all ages, though trending much younger than the Clinton delegates, who are typically new to the Democratic Party. Very few of them have been delegates before. They've never been this close to the spotlight or a television audience of 25 million. They made a pledge to the Sanders supporters they represent back home and to the ""political revolution"" they feel is only just beginning, not just to be spectators at the convention but active participants, whether the DNC or the Clinton campaign--or Bernie Sanders himself--want them to be or not. ""The people who elected us elected us for a reason,"" Caballero said. ""And that's not just to support Bernie, but to support the issues that he cares about."" They have their own political pressures, and they've been acting on it. For example: It's hard to exaggerate the extent to which Sanders delegates hate Trans-Pacific Partnership and want to make their hatred of TPP known at all times. It's become vague shorthand for all that is wrong with heaven and Earth, right up there with ""neoliberal."" When protesting delegates decided, after the criticism following their Monday disruptions, to move toward more ""visual"" protests, the signs they chose to hold up during the speeches of Sen. Tim Kaine or President Obama were the ones protesting TPP. Caballero, who serves as the Sanders California delegates' ambassador to their Clinton counterparts, said that prior to Wednesday's session, he got a call from the ""Clinton people"" asking them to back off of another visual protest they had in mind. ""We had inflatable 'O's, that were Barack Obama 'O's, but people were Sharpie-ing 'NO TPP' on them."" The ""Clinton people"" told him that they could not inflate them because it was a ""security risk,"" and that the Secret Service might pull their credentials if they inflated them. He called them back and asked if it would be OK to display them if they weren't inflated. ""They said, 'Yes, that's OK. Don't throw them.' And we were like, we're not going to throw them."" What were Sanders supports facing heading into the convention's final night? ""There's psychological pressure, there's political pressure, there's media pressure, there's physical pressure sometimes, like not allowing people to take their seats,"" said Norman Solomon, coordinator of the Bernie Delegates Network. ""I would say that in general there's enormous pressure to be placid. And I think it was von Clausewitz who said, 'Every conqueror is a lover of peace.' And let's face it, Hillary Clinton is a conqueror."" Sanders himself might be ""in a box"" of political pressure, Solomon said, and now so were his delegates--especially as the campaign headed into the final night. ""But we have a bigger box,"" he added, ""with more elbow room."" How much room, though? The ""Hillary people"" were watching them, a half dozen or so Sanders delegates told me, which was why they didn't want to advertise their plans for visual protests, chants, walk-outs, or anything else they had in mind for the evening. The Hillary people were watching, too. They distributed instructions to their delegates on how to counter-chant the protesters. Among the recommendations: ""U-S-A!"" to drown out chants of ""NO MORE WAR!"" Several waves of this chant/counter-chant routine cycled through during Gen. John Allen's aggressive speech--which had the ironic effect, at least for the viewers back home, of making it sound as if the Democratic delegation had been overcome with uncontrollable waves of ecstatic patriotism. ""Chants,"" Caballero had told me earlier in the day, ""don't really work anymore."" As Clinton's speech approached, it wasn't just her campaign and the DNC trying to sniff out disruptions to the historic moment, either. ""On Monday when Bernie gave his speech to the Democratic Convention, Secretary Clinton's campaign asked her supporters to be respectful and they were,"" a text message from the Sanders campaign went out to his delegates. ""As a courtesy to Bernie, our campaign would greatly appreciate it if you would extend the same respect during Secretary Clinton's speech."" ""Word on the street is Hillary may apologize to us for three minutes before her speech,"" a California delegate texted me before just before the speech. It wasn't three minutes, and it wasn't an apology for whatever offenses she'd committed. But Clinton did throw them a bone near the beginning of the speech. ""I've heard you,"" Clinton said. ""Our country needs your ideas energy and passion. That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America. We wrote it together. Now let's go out and make it happen together."" That gesture didn't get them all to shut up. But it certainly worked on some--or at least it gave them the excuse they were looking for to stand down. If the hardcore Sanders delegates had one unequivocal success during the night, it was in making themselves visible. About 100 or 200 of them wore neon-green T-shirts that made them hard to miss throughout the night's proceedings. Pockets of them protested during Clinton's speech. A few Hawaii delegates held up signs for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, while the Washington and California protesters held signs about WikiLeaks and TPP. Pretty consistently throughout the night, a shout would erupt from one section of the floor, and five times as many voices would instantly start chanting in response, ""HILL-AR-Y, HILL-AR-Y."" It was a whack-a-mole effort, but it prevented any disruptive effort from sustaining. As Clinton's speech neared its end, a California delegate texted me that there would be a walkout ""seconds after the speech."" I made my way down and saw about 10 or 12 California delegates hovering outside their section, talking among themselves, sort of agitated and definitely not moving toward the exit. ""Some people [in the delegation] definitely think other ways are the ways forward,"" Robert Shearer, the Northern California whip, said to me with clear disappointment. ""I felt we shouldn't have even let her speak."" Other delegates just wanted to watch the celebration, as balloons fell to the convention floor. Out of respect.

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/an_interview_with_anne_applebaum_on_the_russian_hack_of_the_dnc.html	"A trove of hacked emails has ignited a raging controversy about the Democratic National Committee's impartiality and triggered the resignation of its chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. It's also spotlighted the now-visible hand of Russia in the U.S. presidential election. Russia appears to have carried out the DNC hack in an attempt to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign for the White House and bolster Donald Trump's, the latest in a running list of apparent connections, shared traits, and common interests weaving Trump and Putin together. On a recent episode of Trumpcast, Slate's daily podcast about the Republican presidential candidate, Jacob Weisberg spoke with author and Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum about the hack. The topics they discussed include Russia's recent track record of interventions in other nations' democratic elections, Trump's high regard for Putin, and whether he truly is a modern-day Manchurian candidate. A transcript of that interview is below. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Jacob Weisberg: So, I have to say, you have been the person I know who has been talking about this the longest--this being Putin's intervention in the elections of democratic countries. Anne Applebaum: Yes, there is a pattern now of different types of interventions, whether through open funding--Russia openly funds Marine Le Pen, who's a far-right leader in France--or through hacking and email leaks and taping scandals, which have unfolded in several East European countries. The interesting thing about Russia's intervention in other elections is that it's very tailored to the particular country. It's not ideological. In other words, in the olden days, the Soviet Union supported Communist parties all over Europe and all over the world. And now it looks like the pattern is that Russia intervenes in order to create disruption and chaos in Western democracies, thereby to weaken them, thereby to weaken the European Union and NATO. And, if I'm honest, it hadn't really occurred to me that the U.S. electoral system was weak enough for the Russians to be able to influence it, but it looks like almost exactly the same pattern is now in play in the United States that we've seen play out in other European countries. Weisberg: Did you think the Russians would go this far, that they would try to have an impact on an election in the United States? Applebaum: You know, I didn't think about the United States because I thought the United States is too big, American politics isn't moved by these smaller amounts of money the way that Czech politics are or Polish politics are. But I hadn't thought through the idea that of course through hacking, which is something they're famously very good at, that they could try and disrupt a campaign. And of course the pattern of this is something we've seen before: There's a big leak, it's right on an important political moment, it affects the way people think about the campaign, and of course instead of focusing on who did the leak and who's interest it's in, everyone focuses on the details, what's in the emails, what did so-and-so write to so-and-so on Dec. 27, and that's all that gets reported. But no, I didn't think they would--I didn't think it could be done in the United States. But yes, obviously, they've done it. Weisberg: You said a moment ago that you think Russia basically is making mischief in other countries' elections. But here it certainly looks like there's an ideological alignment, particularly on the issue of pulling out of NATO. I mean, last week Trump gave an interview where he said, you know, that the NATO alliance is somehow contingent on whether he thinks the other members of the alliance have done their fair share. Applebaum: Yes. I meant not ideological in the sense that Russia will back the far right in some countries, it'll back the far left in other countries, and clearly in the United States Russia is backing Donald Trump. It's hard for me to tell you what he is exactly, but he doesn't fall into any classic political categories. But they are certainly backing him because he aligns with their interests, and he does that in a number of ways. No. 1 is that he, as you say, has been very skeptical of NATO and actually of other U.S. alliances all around the world. No. 2 is that he has deep business connections to Russia, and the Russians like having relationships with people who they have some money linked to. They like knowing stuff about people, they like having what they would call kompromat, or details, about people. And I'm not saying they have anything specific on Trump, but they know a lot about him because he's been operating there as a business man. They also like him because he has, working for him directly, somebody who they know very well. His campaign manager is Paul Manafort, who was for many years working in Ukraine on behalf of Viktor Yanukovych, who was the pro-Russian president of Ukraine who escaped Ukraine after the Maidan revolution in 2014. And Manafort knows very well all these tactics. He used them in Ukraine. This is very much Ukrainian-style politics: nasty leaks, Twitter trolls, the use of thugs at meetings, this is all very East European. And of course Manafort himself has deep links to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs, and therefore via them to the Kremlin. So the idea that they would want Donald Trump as president is not remotely surprising. It's not even secret. You didn't need to be conspiratorial-minded to see it. He's got these connections, he's got these political views that they like, and he's surrounded by people they know. Weisberg: But even from the beginning of the campaign, Trump's positive comments about Putin have stood out as shocking among a litany of shocking things he's said. From the beginning, his admiration of Putin as a strong leader jumped out. He doesn't just seem to like Putin the way he likes other people with authoritarian or dictatorial instincts. He really seems to have a relationship with him. Applebaum: I think he admires Putin because Putin is what he aspires to be. You know, Putin is on the one hand an extremely wealthy man who is at the head of what is in effect a kind of criminal empire. He has no opposition. He has tamed the media. He controls business, and he is someone who has combined business and politics and is surrounded by people who operate the same way in a way that Trump clearly aspires to. You know, it's this combination of mixing your business interests with your political interests that's so typical of the post-Soviet world. And I think Putin is in some ways the role model for Trump. It's not as if he aspires to be some sort of ascetic, Chinese, secretive Mandarin. He really wants to be Putin. And even aesthetically, the vulgarity of the Russian oligarchy, the kind of houses they live in--they're a lot richer than Trump, actually, as well, so he may aspire to that too--the kinds of women they're surrounded by, the way they live. This is what Trump wants to be. And so I think it makes sense that he admires Putin. Weisberg: So if Trump Tower seems a little tasteful to you, then you can go the oligarch route. Applebaum: Yes, exactly. Trump Tower is a beacon of aesthetic appeal by comparison to what the oligarchs build in their so-called cottages outside of Moscow. So he fits right into their aesthetic, he fits right into the way they think and the way act. Except of course they're more powerful than he is. And he aspires to be more powerful, and therefore he aspires to be more like them. Weisberg: They're also his biggest investors now. American banks don't lend Trump money anymore because he stiffed them after going bankrupt. His biggest investors are Russian oligarchs allied with Putin. Applebaum: Yes, this is something I hadn't fully realized until recently: the degree to which his business seems to survive on Russian money, including some rather dodgy Russian money. There was a description of one of his companies that describes how money would suddenly appear from Kazakh bank accounts to keep it going. And boy do I recognize that. That's a way in which business is done in the former Soviet Union. This of course is what the Russians like about him: He owes them something, he's entangled with them, they know stuff about him, they know details about him. This week they're leaking stuff about the DNC that they hacked, but of course if they want to control Trump they might try to leak stuff about him. When they think about him, they think ""Aha, here's somebody we have something on. Here's somebody we can find a way to use."" Weisberg: There was one other incredibly sinister tidbit from the Republican convention. Trump didn't care about anything in the platform, but he made a big point about getting the plank removed that said Republicans supported helping Crimea resist the Russian invasion. He got that taken out. Applebaum: Yeah, I have to tell you, when I saw that, alarm bells went off. When I saw that very specific thing being done, particularly given that the Trump campaign was apparently not that much interested in the rest of the platform, most of which is far more conservative than anything that he stands for. When I saw that they were specifically interested in that, I thought either they're trying to show someone in Moscow, Look, we really have influence, so you can go on helping us, or there's someone on his staff who genuinely believes that and wants to push it through. If you think about it in the grand context of American politics, Ukraine is not very important, and I say that as someone who's writing a book about Ukraine. The fact that that's the only issue they care about--why? What could be the reason for that unless they're doing somebody a favor or showing somebody how important they are? Weisberg: Given our history, one is very hesitant to start using words like ""dupe"" or ""stooge"" or ""tool"" or ""agent."" But boy, it was hard not to think of the phrase ""Manchurian candidate"" when you heard that story. Applebaum: I thought of it immediately. But of course the weird thing is that The Manchurian Candidate, if you remember the plot, involves someone being hypnotized, all that weird stuff. This is all very open. The relationship of Trump to Russia has been reported on, and the activity to change the Republican platform happened openly, and Trump's support for Russian policy--Russia's views of Europe and its views of NATO--have been stated. So it's not like this is secret. What I'm describing isn't a kind of deep conspiracy. You don't have to believe in something very mystical and weird in order to see what's happening. It's absolutely unfolding in public. It's a kind of postmodern version of the Manchurian candidate. It's the Manchurian candidate, everybody knows it, and nobody's reacting. Weisberg: If a Democrat did this--I mean, Obama would be vilified for being a little soft on Putin at an ordinary Republican convention. And here you have a Republican candidate who is completely capitulating for what look like personal financial reasons, and it doesn't actually seem like anybody cares. Applebaum: No, it doesn't. It certainly doesn't seem like the Republican Party cares, which is mystifying given the historical record of the Republican Party. But I'm wondering whether television stations care. As it's become clear in the last 48 hours that this leak is coming from Russia, I'm waiting for shock, horror. I'm waiting for television announcers to start talking about it. And actually, of course. they're not. They're focusing on the details of the leak, and as I said who wrote what to whom on Dec. 27. Which is, of course, what the Russians knew would happen, because this is always what happens when these things are leaked. It was different but a kind of parallel story in Poland, with leaked secret tapes. And once again, no one was asking where the tapes come from or why they mysteriously appeared at this particular moment, why they reappeared at the time of the election campaign. People just wanted to know what was in them. And that's human nature, and that's also the nature of the modern media. It's very focused on sensational detail and it's not focused on the bigger issue and why this thing is happening now. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

He has since introduced several new, also nameless friends. Meet some of them below. Japanese friends ""I talk about Japan. Love Japan, many friends in Japan, great country.

(Scranton, Pennsylvania, July 27, 2016) A friend who planned a trip to France ""You see what happened to the French priest? A friend of mine he said he was going to France, like three-four months ago. I saw him yesterday, I said, 'How'd ya like France?' He said, 'I wouldn't go to France. I wouldn't go to France.' Because France is no longer France. France is no longer France. They won't like me for saying that.""

They're gonna own her. Don't forget I used to be on the other side of the equation. I used to be establishment.

(Raleigh, North Carolina, July 5, 2016) Friends who prefer the acronym ISIS to ISIL ""[Obama] says ISIL, and you know, it's almost like he does it to make people upset. I've had so many people say, 'Why doesn't he just says ISIS?' Forgetting about definitions.

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/how_the_dnc_wrote_the_speech_for_jensen_walcott_and_jake_reed.html	"PHILADELPHIA--For all the attention paid to blockbuster speeches by VIPs like Michelle Obama and Joe Biden, names like this make up a small percentage of the slate at the Democratic National Convention. On the undercard are dozens of speakers with far lower profiles--many unaccustomed to addressing a crowd, almost none experienced in addressing a television audience of 20 million. Folks like this get funneled through the convention's speechwriting operation. And that's where the not-inconsiderable task begins of making human beings sound like human beings. Take, for instance, Jensen Walcott and Jake Reed, who'll be on stage and TV tonight in prime time. These two 17-year-old friends got hired at a Pizza Studio in Kansas City, Kansas--both on the same day, both with the same level of pizza-related experience. Yet when they congratulated each other on Snapchat, the story goes, Jensen realized she'd been offered a lower salary ($8 an hour) than her male friend Jake ($8.25). She asked her boss to explain the pay disparity. Instead of getting justice, both teens got fired. Cue a ton of media coverage and, whoa, a tweet from Hillary Clinton: Eventually, the teens were invited to speak at the DNC. ""I wasn't sure what I was going to talk about, besides just telling my story,"" Jensen says. And here's where the speechwriting machine kicks into gear. Jensen and Jake were assigned one speechwriter from among the 20 or so who work in a basement space here at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia--where rough drafts fly off the printers at all hours and writers shout, ""What did you think of that new last line?"" across the room to colleagues. The teens' designated speechwriter gave them a choice: Craft your own speech and I'll edit it, or give me some bullet points, I'll write the speech, and you can revise it. The teens chose the latter. So the speechwriter emailed back and forth with them, watched interviews they'd done on TV, and tried to capture their voices and story in just a couple hundred words. David Litt helped write speeches for President Obama for several years, and he worked in the speechwriting boiler room at the 2012 DNC. (He's at the convention this year as head writer and producer for Funny or Die's politics arm in Washington, D.C.) Litt describes the whirlwind speechwriting experience at a convention as ""all the intellectual work of speechwriting with all the energy of field organizing. It's like taking final exams 12 hours a day for 10 days straight."" Most speechwriters work with 10 speakers at a time. Some speeches get locked down well in advance, but some are still in flux 30 minutes before showtime. Amateur speakers like Jensen and Jake can in some ways be easier to deal with than a midlevel politician. ""Some of these people have a stump speech they're comfortable with,"" Litt says, ""and they're also used to being the most important speaker everywhere they speak. You might be a congressperson who's served for 18 years, but today you're just one of dozens of warmup acts. In those cases, it's about figuring out what to cut. ""The biggest reason it goes down to the wire is if you get a busy principal who doesn't do any work in advance. If they're not really engaged until the last minute, that generally ends in a rush. Maybe you tell them this 10-minute speech needs to be five minutes and they just don't get back to you."" Speechwriting on scene, for a live TV show, requires flexibility. ""No one here would have expected that the opposing nominee would invite a cyberattack on the United States while the convention is going on,"" Litt says. ""And in a situation like that, it's deciding whether or not to react. You don't want to see something on Twitter and make the whole speech about that. But you also don't want to be out of touch and not responding to issues people are focused on. I'd say that's why the speechwriters get paid big bucks, but most of them are here as volunteers or taking huge pay cuts."" The speechwriting team will work with a speech prep team (""a slightly different subgenre of professional services,"" Litt explains) to walk the speaker through the whole spectrum of his or her performance. A keynote speaker might practice a speech several times over multiple days. But an amateur speaker will generally get only 30 minutes or so of prep, with one or two quick run-throughs. ""A lot of people aren't used to talking for TV,"" Litt says, ""and when you're in a huge room like this arena, you need pointers about how to respond. Because you might hear the crowd go crazy, and want to wait for them to stop applauding, but that doesn't work on TV--you need to skip just a beat and then continue. Or someone's shouting something, and you might want to react, but people can't hear the shouting on TV so you've got to keep going or the viewer won't understand what's going on."" Speaking in front of both a crowd and a TV audience requires a certain sort of emotional calibration. ""If the crowd gets into it, you have to be more controlled,"" Litt says. ""You don't want to sound like you're yelling. What Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton did really well is speak to the viewer at home. It's a different set of skills. They're not matching the energy of the crowd--they're a little less, they're letting the crowd come to them. Jennifer Granholm in 2012 had a good speech, but people in the room were going crazy. And what seemed energetic from her in the room and got people fired up, on TV it was adding 10 decibels. The Dean scream is another good example of that. To people in the arena, it didn't sound like a huge moment, but if you're right in the mic, it's very different."" For Jensen and Jake's speechwriter, the biggest challenge was the time constraint. In fewer than 300 words, the teens would need to tell their story, explain their connection to Hillary, and somehow hit on the theme of the convention: ""stronger together."" The first draft of their speech was split into two sections--first one teen speaking, and then the other. But Jensen and Jake asked for a little more back and forth. ""He's always finishing my sentences when we do interviews,"" Jensen says. ""We're good friends, and we wanted people to see we have a connection."" And here's where the convention theme got woven in. The teens wanted to express how important it is to ""stand up for each other."" The speech went to the research department, where it passed the fact-checking and plagiarism tests. The campaign signed off on the speech's message. And on Wednesday afternoon, Jensen and Jake arrived at the arena for their walk-through. They were brought to the rehearsal space (actually, the Philadelphia Flyers locker room) with a practice lectern and teleprompters. ""The teleprompters are huge and right in front of your face,"" Jensen says, ""so it was hard not to read along on them when Jake was talking. I had to remind myself to look at him instead."" They were reminded to talk over applause, instead of waiting. ""The microphone is louder than the crowd,"" Jensen notes, ""so you don't need to yell."" Jensen got one main critique during her practice round. ""Slow down. I'm a very fast talker. Especially when I'm nervous,"" she says. ""And I wasn't nervous at all, but then I saw the Wells Fargo Center and how many people will be there."" I ask her what the biggest crowd was she'd ever previously addressed. ""About six people."" If all goes well, Jensen and Jake speaking to each other on national TV will sound like a reasonable approximation of Jensen and Jake hanging out with each other in Kansas. It turns out the process to achieve that effect requires multiple trained professionals and hours of effort. And that goes for all the other speakers, too. As you watch Thursday night, take a moment to consider the gears that turn behind the watch face. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Two Anxious Teens Will Be Speaking Tonight. Here's How the DNC Wrote Their Speech.
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/the_democrats_make_their_pitch_to_a_new_silent_majority.html	"PHILADELPHIA--Donald Trump wants to run his campaign like Richard Nixon in 1968. He appeals to ""law"" and promises ""order"" in a chaotic, frightening world. But Trump misses a key part of Nixon's message--his appeal to the ordinary people. In that campaign, Nixon called out to the ""voice of the great majority of Americans, the forgotten Americans, the non-shouters, the non-demonstrators."" He spun a narrative of normalcy. ""[T]hey are black, they are white; they're native born and foreign born; they're young and they're old,"" he said. ""They're good people. They're decent people; they work and they save and they pay their taxes and they care."" Nixon positioned his campaign, and the Republican Party, as the party of ""normal"" Americans, the party of the ""silent majority."" Trump didn't make this move, because he couldn't. He's a reality television star whose life was lived in tabloids, whose brand is the outrageous and nonsensical. He's decadent, extravagant, and proudly contemptuous of modesty in any area of life. His majority, if he has one, is a loud majority and an angry majority, not a silent one. On the third night of its national convention, the Democratic Party worked to flip the script. Using a broad roster of speakers, from Vice President Joe Biden and vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, long-time national security official Leon Panetta, and eventually President Barack Obama, Democrats recast theirs as the party of normalcy and the champion of those decent people. But where Nixon spoke to a silent majority of white Americans, the Democratic Party wants to speak for a broad and diverse tapestry of blacks, immigrants, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and the college-educated, especially among white Americans. It's that last category of voters that got the most attention on Wednesday. From 1952 until 1980, Democrats held a disadvantage among college-educated whites. As the party of unions and the welfare state, they counted instead on support from working-class whites. But since 1980--and especially in the last decade--this has flipped. Increasingly, the Democrats' most reliable white supporters come from the college-educated cohort, while Republicans find themselves with a large and growing share of working-class whites. You see this in the polls. According to the ""Upshot"" model at the New York Times, Clinton leads Donald Trump by 9 points among white women with a degree and 3 points among white men with a degree. Trump, by contrast, leads Clinton by 3 points among white women without a degree and by a whopping 14 points among white men without a degree. Democrats know they need to stanch the bleeding with working-class white men, and there's a strong chance that Joe Biden, who delivered an intimate and arresting speech Wednesday night, will have that task in the fall. But they also see a distinct opportunity with college-educated whites and a real chance to widen the margin among college-educated white men and women. As such, the Wednesday roster featured names and figures who spoke to the concerns of those voters. Erica Smegielski, whose mother was killed in the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, was there as an advocate for gun control, a popular position among college-educated whites. Christine Leinonen lost her son in the Pulse attack in Orlando, Florida, and spoke both to gun control and fears of terrorism. Likewise, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords appeared on stage as one of the most famous survivors of a mass shooting.* The headline speeches came from figures of authority--all white men--who in different ways sought to delegitimize Donald Trump and persuade the most Republican-leaning whites with degrees to switch sides and abandon the GOP in favor of the Democrats, presented as a party of almost staid responsibility. Panetta, a former congressman, secretary of defense, and CIA director, vouched for Hillary Clinton's national security credentials and condemned Donald Trump as fundamentally unfit to lead the nation's armed forces. Retired U.S. Navy Adm. John Hutson did the same. Coming from the right of the Democratic Party was Michael Bloomberg, who slammed ""party politics"" and used his cred as an independent to endorse Clinton as ""the responsible choice."" ""Today, as an independent, an entrepreneur, and a former mayor, I believe we need a president who is a problem solver, not a bomb thrower,"" he said. ""And I know Hillary Clinton can do that because I saw it firsthand."" Bloomberg used his stature as a billionaire to attack Trump's businessman bona fides. ""I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one."" Kaine also took on this task, introducing himself as a pragmatic politician of faith and decency. Kaine, like Bloomberg, is pitched to those college-educated whites who crave normalcy and want to feel comfortable voting for Democrats. Of course, the capstone to the night was President Obama, who gave a stirring defense of his administration, a full-throated endorsement of Hillary Clinton, and who made the case for American pluralism and American democracy, as juxtaposed with Donald Trump, the strongman. Borrowing from Lincoln, Reagan, and presidents in between, Obama used his authority and his biography to offer up the Democratic Party and Clinton as the choice for America's traditional values, as expressed by a multitude of creeds and colors. It was an appeal to what the president, elsewhere, has called ""the goodness and decency and common sense on the ground,"" all of which exist apart from our ""rigid, dogmatic, often mean-spirited politics."" ""America has changed over the years,"" Obama said Wednesday. ""But these values my grandparents taught me--they haven't gone anywhere. They're as strong as ever, still cherished by people of every party, every race, and every faith. They live on in each of us. What makes us American, what makes us patriots, is what's in here. That's what matters."" A modern-day silent majority, diverse and pluralistic. That's the pitch. We'll know soon enough if it works. *Correction, July 28, 2016: This article originally misspelled Gabrielle Giffords' first name. (Return.) Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/donald_trump_isn_t_a_manchurian_candidate_trump_and_putin_are_using_each.html	"Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are both lying. Only one of them, however, is cunning; the other is gaffing his way toward treason. Trump has emphatically denied ties to Russia--a claim refuted by his Twitter feed and a cursory Google search. Putin says his government had nothing to do with the hack of the DNC computers, even though it carelessly left a trail of crumbs tracing back to his intelligence services. The cunning liar is exploiting the blundering one. Let's be clear: Trump isn't a Manchurian candidate. He's not taking orders from the Kremlin. As I wrote on Friday, Trump is a useful device for Putin--a way to hurt the United States and perhaps a way to exact revenge on Hillary Clinton. Putin has made a habit of supporting far-right candidates who undermine his foes in Europe; perhaps he never could have imagined such a character taking root on American soil. Trump's reasons for aligning with Putin have been more innocent, if no less dangerous. Trump is a real estate guy who sucks up to power to get buildings built. And he desperately wanted to build in Russia--the dream of Trump Tower Moscow has been a constantly recurring one. ""We will be in Moscow at some point,"" he once proclaimed. When he took his many trips to Moscow, Trump praised authorities so that he could get the necessary approvals. His kind words to Russian leaders and his personal style endeared him to the country's new elite. Trump is baldly denying these efforts--""I have nothing to do with Russia,"" he said on Wednesday. It's true that his Moscow building never broke ground, but Russian investment flowed to his properties. ""Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,"" Trump's son, Donald Jr., once bragged. ""We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."" Or as Trump himself once put: ""The Russian market is attracted to me."" This investment wasn't incidental to Trump: It was essential. After his 2004 bankruptcy, the big banks wouldn't touch him. Who would? He had a record of litigiousness and going belly up. But Russian investors helped prop up Trump's megabuilding projects, which were crucial to his image as a man who makes things, not just a reality television star. There would be no Trump SoHo, for instance, without capital from Russia. As one lawsuit alleges, the money arrived at Trump projects through an Icelandic investment fund ""in favor"" with Putin's elite and through mysterious infusions of cash from Russia and Kazakhstan into the accounts of his partners. It's not hard to see why this dependence, and his fawning words about Putin, would endear him to the Kremlin. Putin would be foolish not to lend Trump a quiet hand. And, indeed, his inner circle has made little secret of its rooting interest in the Trump campaign. Russia Today, Putin's primary propaganda vehicle, routinely trashes Hillary Clinton and praises Trump's courageous stances. Perhaps our intelligence community has a better sense of the ultimate goal of Russia's hack. But it doesn't take much imagination to describe the relationship between the Kremlin and Trump campaign as symbiotic. Let's review the events of the past few weeks. First, Trump softened the Republican Party's stance on Ukraine; then Trump announced that he wouldn't come rushing to the aid of NATO allies invaded by Russia. That was followed by the leak of the Democratic National Committee emails, on the eve of the convention--an event that Julian Assange implied was intended to injure Hillary Clinton. It's hard to imagine that this chain of events was coordinated. Yet Trump and Putin profited from one another in measurable ways. At Wednesday's press conference, Trump made clear that he wasn't standing in Putin's way. He wouldn't ask Putin to desist from hacking his enemy; instead, he mused aloud about how he hoped Russia would obtain Hillary Clinton's email. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" he announced. The only way to procure those emails would be to steal them. What's more, those aren't campaign documents from low-level staffers or hacks at a political party: He's advocating the Russians steal documents produced by the secretary of state--and he wants to broadcast them to the world. (Later he suggested it would perhaps be more appropriate for Russia to share them with the FBI.) It was grossly negligent for Hillary Clinton to leave her emails so exposed, and she should be shamed and hounded for her indifference to cybersecurity. But that's a sin of omission. By any moral calculus, Trump just committed a far worse offense. He advocated that a foreign country commit espionage in order to weaken his political opponent. Pause to consider: The Republican presidential nominee wants another country to steal secrets from the United States and not in the interests of exposing military misadventures or for some high-minded reason. He wants to expose American secrets in order to hurt his foe. Nixonian doesn't even begin to capture it. Read more Slate coverage from the 2016 campaign."	Donald Trump Isn't a Manchurian Candidate. Trump and Putin Are Using Each Other.
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/the_gop_is_no_longer_the_party_of_national_security_it_can_t_be_with_trump.html	"Donald Trump's already notorious press conference on Wednesday morning managed to achieve a near perfect synthesis of Trumpism, by turns shocking in its transgressions and terrifying in what it portends. In between scolding a female reporter and calling Barack Obama, the man Trump hopes to replace, ""the most ignorant president in our history,"" Trump, astonishingly, invited Vladimir Putin's Russia to ""find"" and distribute Hillary Clinton's emails. With his comments Wednesday, Trump has finally knocked over what was once a pillar of the Republican Party's system of beliefs. For decades, the party has stood united behind the principle that the United States must have a strong national defense, take aggressive behavior by adversaries seriously, and confront threats with resolve. The primary enemy during most of this time was first the Soviet Union, and later a newly ambitious Russia, led by Vladimir Putin. In 2012, Mitt Romney labeled the country our top ""geopolitical foe."" Whatever you think of this posture--which too often involved smearing domestic opponents of a strong defense and those who registered even the smallest bit of sympathy for foreign enemies or rivals--it was at least consistently held and could be thoughtfully defended. Republican hawkishness united social conservatives and fiscal conservatives; it united the GOP base and the GOP establishment; and it defined the GOP in the minds of voters as the party of strong thinking about national defense. Trump has already undermined the Republican Party's supposed advantage on national security with his confusing and contradictory positions on foreign affairs: Sometimes he calls for a retreat from the world stage, other times he speaks darkly of secret plans to destroy ISIS, which he accuses Obama of treating with kid gloves. But by suggesting, last week, that the United States might withdraw from NATO, and on Wednesday inviting Russia to steal American data, Trump has shown just how hollow the Republican posture as defenders of our national security has become. That members of the Republican establishment can stand idly by as their nominee wields our foreign policy as a cudgel against his political enemies--and a tool to get himself elected--is the latest evidence that the party is ideologically bankrupt. Imagine for a moment that the Democratic Party's nominee announced that health care is not an issue that should concern the government and that people should be on their own--regardless of their needs--to pay their health bills. It's the nearest equivalent I can think of to what Trump has just done by spitting on an idea so foundationally important to the Republican Party. Of course, no Democratic nominee would do such a thing. Whatever its myriad faults, the Democratic Party is not on the verge of falling victim to a demagogue; it is not, fundamentally, broken. The Republican Party is. For people who never liked Republican foreign policy and think it is long overdue for a rethink, remember this: Trump isn't repudiating GOP doctrine in a serious way. Instead, he is doing so by inviting Vladimir Putin to meddle in an American election and all but daring him to attack American allies by saying he wouldn't necessarily abide by NATO's promise to protect them. (Those who rightly criticize much American behavior during the Cold War would do well to remember that the collective security provided by NATO was one of the few indisputable achievements of that period.) It's of course possible that Republicans like John McCain and Marco Rubio will come out in the next few days, denounce Trump, and withdraw their support for him. It's also possible that the moon landing was staged. The reason it is unlikely that GOP hawks will turn on Trump is the same reason they offered support to him in the first place: They are key members of a party that has decided to put short-term self-interest ahead of principle.

The sound of disgruntled Bernie Sanders supporters permeated virtually all the speeches at the Democratic National Convention on Monday--even as Sanders himself was speaking. Now, on Day 2, it remains to be seen whether Sarah Silverman's chastisement of the Bernie-or-bust crowd, Michelle Obama's impassioned call for party unity, and Bernie Sanders' own endorsement of Hillary Clinton will together be enough to mollify the die-hards during Tuesday night's keynote from Bill Clinton.

Where the RNC often seemed designed to show off Donald Trump's kids, for example, many of the DNC speeches instead focused on the dangers Trump presents to your children. The most striking divergence, however, arose almost in passing, when Elizabeth Warren spoke briefly of Martin Luther King Jr., a man whose legacy was also repeatedly invoked in Cleveland. Where Warren drills down into the specifics of King's thought, Republicans turned him into a defender of their own thinking. The contrast reveals a great deal about the ways the two parties have laid out their respective positions: The RNC's version of Martin Luther King Jr. is little more than a convenient, vacuous myth, an empty caricature with which speakers papered over and justified the racist, fearmongering ideologies they espoused on stage. As Slate's Isaac Chotiner writes, Warren spent most of her speech launching a series of excoriating--but specific--attacks on Trump, both the man and the brand. Though she drew on the familiar and frighteningly massive catalog of offensives, her most perspicuous broadsides may have been against Trump's lack of substance. ""Did you hear any actual ideas?"" she asked at one point, smirking professorially. Warren, for her own part, laid out few plans or proposals of her own, opting instead for a pugnacious elaboration of the differences between the two parties. Nevertheless, even when she was dismissing Trump's proposed border wall as ""stupid,"" her speech was still a smart one, focusing on both intellectual and ideological particulars. Nowhere was that more apparent than in her account of King, a moment that deserves to be quoted in full:"	In a Few Sentences, Elizabeth Warren Exposed the GOP's Pet Myths About MLK

Actually, in Philly, where the Democratic National Convention kicks off Monday night. Depending on where you get your news, the party is ""in chaos,"" ""in disarray,"" or probably OK. Emails leaked on Friday suggest that DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz favored Hillary Clinton in the primary. As a result, Wasserman Schultz has been erased from the convention--she won't even gavel it in--and will be resigning as soon as it is over. That didn't fix everything, though. Some Bernie Sanders delegates have been chanting the anti-Clinton slogan ""Lock her up!"" from the convention floor. A group of them booed Sanders himself earlier Monday when he urged them to support Clinton and may do so again when he speaks Monday night.

Bernie Sanders on Monday was nearing the end of his address to a rowdy group of roughly 2,000 delegates and supporters in the Pennsylvania Convention Center, a hub for off-site Democratic National Convention activity. He had rattled off a checklist of his political revolution's conquests thus far: 46 percent of pledged delegates, five state party chairmanships, the ""most progressive platform in history,"" and, most recently, the head of archvillain DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. ""How do we continue the political revolution?"" he asked. ""No. 1 in my view--and this is not easy stuff given the nature of corporate media in America--we have got to be strong and consistent in making it clear that what we want to achieve is nothing less than the transformation of American society."" Rapturous applause. Point No. 2 for continuing the revolution, though, concerned the more immediate future. ""Immediately--right now--we have got to defeat Donald Trump,"" Sanders began. ""We'll do it with you!"" one delegate standing near me shouted. But Sanders didn't mean it like that. ""We have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine,"" he said, a bold line in a room like this. The delegates' loud boos overrode the applause in the convention center ballroom, and Sanders was unable to resume speaking for another 30 seconds. ""This is the real world that we live in,"" Sanders added, resigned. He wrapped up his speech not long thereafter, as portions of the crowd, compartmentalizing away what Sanders had just said, continued with shouts of ""WE WANT BERN-IE!"" If one thing has become immediately clear in the first day of the Democratic National Convention, it's that Sanders may be done with his own campaign, but a huge chunk of his delegates are not--and Sanders nudging his supporters to fall in line behind the Clinton-Kaine ticket is not going to do the trick. These delegates, many of them swept into politics for the first time by the Bernie revolution, are acting on their own grassroots prerogatives now. They have internalized a central message of his campaign: Good politics happens when the bottom pressures the top. And they couldn't care less what their icon instructs them to do. Norman Solomon, national coordinator of the Bernie Delegates Network, refuses to say that he has any control over the Sanders delegates that he coordinates. ""We are not, as a network, a directive network,"" was the first thing Solomon, a lifelong progressive activist and writer, and for this week a California delegate, said at the group's media briefing Monday morning at a downtown Philadelphia Marriott. ""We are a reflective network. We reflect the viewpoints and policy and options of the Sanders delegates at this convention."" No one can tell the members of the BDN--roughly 1,250 delegates total, Solomon said, or two-thirds of all Sanders delegates at the convention--what to do, or how to act, or whether to throw a wrench or several into Hillary Clinton's carefully choreographed four-day PR extravaganza. Hillary Clinton cannot. Debbie Wasserman Schultz cannot. Norman Solomon cannot. Bernie Sanders cannot. As a reflective network, the BDN surveys its ranks via straw polls and passes that information back to its members. It doesn't get 100 percent participation in its surveys, and those who do participate in the surveys may well be the most hardcore insurrectionaries of an insurrectionary group. But in a survey conducted 10 days ago, the BDN asked whether Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine would be ""acceptable to them as a choice for the vice presidential slot."" Only eight delegates, or 2.8 percent, said he would; 251 delegates, or 88.1 percent, said he wouldn't. The structure of the group makes it impossible to suss out its intentions. Solomon appeared with two other California Sanders delegates on Monday morning, Karen Bernal and Manuel Zapata, and because they refuse to speak for anyone else, it was impossible to get them to explain crisply what disruptive action they were considering. Much of the press conference was spent litigating pronouns. But there are a few options that, perhaps, maybe, some indeterminate number of Sanders delegates might consider to meet certain goals. The first thing Solomon, Bernal, and Zapata would want is for Wasserman Schultz to be fired anew, this time from the honorary-chairwoman sinecure the Clinton campaign offered her when she resigned from the DNC. ""I don't think we could say that her resignation represents her being tossed overboard by Hillary Clinton,"" Solomon said. ""She was ferried quickly by a lifeboat to an executive suite of the Hillary campaign."" In addition to pushing to refire Wasserman Schultz, at least some Sanders delegates are considering walking out of either or both of Clinton's and Kaine's speeches, or circulating a petition to bring an alternative vice presidential nomination to the floor. There would also be marches, posters, and other standard elements of left agitprop. And there might be a surprise, too. Solomon said that the precise ""configuration"" of Clinton-trolling activity had yet to be determined. He instructed reporters to check back in another 23 hours. Solomon made clear, though, that there is nothing Sanders himself can do to stop them from coordinating disruptions, should he choose to insert himself--though Sanders delegates would certainly listen to his or anyone else's ""advisement."" ""We take very seriously the principle that Bernie enunciated time and time again throughout the campaign,"" Solomon said. ""That social change that's worth a damn always comes from the bottom up, the grassroots, not from the top. As beloved as Bernie is, his brilliance includes the fact that he's not running the show. He's not running the social movements. It is activists, including the Bernie delegates, who will make the social change in this country."" A lot of Bernie delegates booed him Monday when he urged them to vote for Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine. They will probably do likewise when he urges the full convention to do the same during his speaking slot Monday night. One wonders whether he won't be pleased with such booing. Solomon is right: This is exactly what he wanted from his campaign--a movement that would endure on its own momentum well after his campaign was finished and the spotlight of a presidential candidacy had moved on. Some delegates may think he's selling out to the establishment. He can't say it, but at least part of him must see their unwillingness to follow him as a sign of his victory.

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/my_quest_to_find_jeb_bush_s_delegates_at_the_rnc.html	"CLEVELAND--They are the rarest of objects. Only three exist in the universe. Each one cost $53 million to make. I speak, of course, of Jeb Bush's delegates to the GOP convention. Jeb campaigned earnestly--and, yes, expensively--for the better part of a year, yet this lonely trio was the sum fruit of his efforts. These three brave souls were appointed his banner bearers and asked to trudge here from New Hampshire, to ... do what, exactly? To register a pitiful scatter of votes for their guy--a man who wasn't there and couldn't win? To notarize the victory of his most despised rival? Or perhaps to insist, in some small way: Hey, Jeb existed. In my imagination, these three knights of Jeb, trembling and unarmored, stand across a muddy battlefield from the 1,543 Donald Trump delegates. The Trump horde beats its chest, cackles derisively, rushes forward. The Jebbites close their eyes and await release from this cruel world. Over the course of the convention, I became obsessed with the idea of finding them. I yearned to view the Jebbite trinity in the flesh. To hear their proud little voices piercing the Trumpian din. To me (with my documented soft spot for Jeb), they were somehow apart from the rest. A nobler breed. More precious than Rand Paul's pair of delegates or Ben Carson's magnificent seven. As it turns out, Jeb's delegates were seated comfortably somewhere down there on the air-conditioned convention floor, dotted among their friendly Republican colleagues, invited to assimilate. They were of little use to anyone--their numbers too few to sway any rules votes or be relevant in some sort of coup--and so could be safely ignored. Eventually, via asking around and generally being a pest, I found my first Jebbite: His name was Paul Speltz. He was a kind, portly fellow with a head of snowy hair and an apple-cheeked visage--sort of like a well-fed, senior citizen cherub. I asked him how it was that he had become a synecdochical representation of large-scale failure. Just kidding: I asked him how he'd come to be a delegate for Jeb. It turns out that Speltz has known the Bush family for decades. He'd served as an official economic emissary to China, designated by George W. Bush's treasury secretary. And he'd supported Jeb while he was in the race. ""I just talked to Jeb yesterday,"" he told me, during a break between speeches from the stage. ""He's down in Florida, relaxing. He thinks what's going on here is very ... interesting."" I asked Speltz if he agreed with me that Donald Trump, character-wise, is everything Jeb is not. ""Jeb Bush is earnest, warm, and a gentleman,"" he replied without fully taking the bait. ""Donald Trump is a new kind of candidate. He's a different kind of a guy."" At this point, Corey Lewandowski--one of Speltz's fellow New Hampshire delegates, who also happens to be Trump's awful former campaign manager--came into our orbit, standing a few feet away. I asked if Speltz held any grudge. ""Corey's a good guy,"" he said. ""I met yesterday with him to make sure he'd call out Jeb's votes when he made our announcement to the convention. He did a good job. We accurately represented the voters of New Hampshire. I think Jeb won a couple of delegates in South Carolina, too, but they threw all their votes to Trump here. That was a little bit unfortunate. They could have given Jeb his delegates. Trump was going to win anyway."" Surely, I thought, Speltz must harbor lingering resentment toward the nominee, given that Trump had seized every possible opportunity--during the primary campaign and even after it had ended--to cruelly insult Jeb. ""It wasn't Jeb's style, it wasn't his personal preference to have that be the tone,"" Speltz said. ""But that's yesterday. There's yesterday, there's today, and there's tomorrow."" Would he vote for Trump in the general election? ""There's a little time involved here--we are kind of watching,"" he said. ""But I'm voting for the Republican Party. The most important thing is to defeat Hillary Clinton. We're Republicans and we're going about trying to unite."" This was not exactly what I hoped to hear when I began my quest: I was disappointed on Jeb's behalf. Here was one of Jeb's own very hard-won delegates ignoring Jeb's clearly stated clarion call not to vote for Trump in November. What does $53 million get you these days, anyway? And again, why were these non-Trump, off-message delegates even here? To wallow in the buffets? To watch balloons drop? To schmooze? Well yes, certainly to schmooze. But wasn't there more to it than that? Were they not also on hand to each embody the ethos of the man who'd designated them his representatives? Who, I wondered glumly, would be a full-throated champion for Jeb? About an hour later, a second Jeb delegate arrived in the arena. Melissa Stevens is a 36-year-old stay-at-home parent and local town councilwoman back home in New Hampshire. She'd been a Jeb supporter since last summer, had done a lot of events, and had met Jeb and the Bush family. ""I met a lot of candidates in New Hampshire, in hotel lobbies,"" she said. ""I never had any regret about choosing Jeb when I was deciding who to support."" She described him as friendly, intelligent, and ""humble."" On the first day of the Cleveland convention, Stevens told me, she'd proudly sported her Jeb T-shirt. A few Trump fans harassed her, but she didn't care. ""I wouldn't be here without Jeb,"" she said. ""I felt I owed at least that much to him and to his supporters."" Stevens refuses to fall in line with Trump. ""I'll leave my presidential ballot blank in November. Or I'll write Jeb in,"" she said. ""Jeb presented concrete policy positions. He's a wonk. He had a record I could look at in Florida. That made me comfortable. Trump hasn't presented much in terms of policy detail, and he's never served as a politician, so we really don't know what we're getting. That makes me nervous. "" I asked her: Did it give her any pause that her cost to Jeb equaled the approximate annual GDP of Uruguay? ""I think I'm worth every penny,"" she said with a huge grin. There was one last Jeb delegate in the triumvirate. I waited and waited for her on the arena floor, but I never found her. She didn't respond when I emailed, texted, and phoned. And thus, my mission failed. I had found a 66 percent majority of Jeb delegates, yet I'd fallen short in the end. It seemed vaguely appropriate: What was the Jeb! 2016 campaign all about if not brutally thwarted expectations? Still, as I watched Trump speak on the convention's final night--shuddering at the bleak vision of America he proffered, dreading a life lived beneath his thumb--it really did hearten me to know that out there in the crowd, staring back at him, was Melissa Stevens.

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/donald_trump_should_have_channeled_pat_buchanan_in_his_convention_speech.html	"Donald Trump needed to do more in his address to the Republican National Convention on Thursday night than prove to gut-level conservatives that he's one of them. He's mostly done that, to the chagrin of conservative dissenters who continue to see him as a loathsome fraud. What he hasn't done is convey any measure of humanity, decency, and concern for others. There were lines in his painfully long convention speech that tried to do just that--for example, his warm references to LGBTQ Americans, and his insistence that children living in crime-ridden inner-city neighborhoods had ""the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America."" But those lines didn't quite connect. His arrogance and his bluster shone through. To soften his image, Trump ought to have turned to an unlikely source. He should have taken a page from Pat Buchanan, a man who is in many ways Trump's spiritual predecessor. Though both Buchanan and Trump have indulged in inflammatory racial rhetoric, and though both stood against the conservative mainstream to champion economic nationalism, the two men couldn't be further apart in their intellectual sophistication and their sense of poetry. And while Buchanan came to his blend of traditionalism and nationalism honestly, one still gets the sense that Trump simply saw an opportunity to exploit the GOP's working-class primary electorate and went for it. If you want to understand the logic behind Trump's speech, I'd recommend reading The Three Languages of Politics, a little-known gem of a book self-published by economist Arnold Kling in 2013. Kling argues that liberals, conservatives, and libertarians all have different mental shortcuts to make sense of big moral and political questions. Liberals see themselves as the champions of the oppressed, and they celebrate those who stand with the oppressed and against oppressors. Libertarians think in terms of freedom and coercion. The bad guys are those who force others to act against their will while the good guys defend personal choice and voluntary agreement. Conservatives see the world through the lens of civilization and barbarism, and they see themselves as the guardians of institutions that guide us toward civilized behavior by imposing constraints and, when necessary, physical force. Those who threaten the forces of order are the enemy. To those of us who think of politics in ideological terms, this might not compute. Surely conservatives are believers in free markets, low taxes, and a strong national defense? By that definition, it's not at all clear that Trump passes muster. But when we think of conservatism as a kind of language or a psychological predisposition, Trump's appeal makes a lot more sense. You can see why a conservative might hear Trump's paeans to ""law and order"" and his promises to shield law-abiding Americans from dangerous outsiders differently from a liberal. Whereas a liberal might be attuned to the ways police officers abuse their authority, a conservative sees the police as civilization's first line of defense. Trump's frequent references to the bravery of the police and the iniquity of President Obama's (supposed) attacks on law enforcement were about more than giving cops their due. They were about underscoring the fact that Trump is on the side of the forces of civilization. Though Trump clearly connected with many conservatives on Thursday night, he nevertheless would have done well to study Buchanan's haunting address to the 1992 Republican National Convention. If you recall the speech at all, it's probably for its hard-edged call for a culture war. In his evocative conclusion, Buchanan celebrated the National Guardsmen who restored order to riot-stricken Los Angeles, then urged his fellow conservatives to follow their lead: ""And as those boys took back the streets of Los Angeles, block by block, my friends, we must take back our cities, and take back our culture, and take back our country."" Naturally, Americans of a more liberal bent couldn't help but wonder if Buchanan meant to take the cities and the culture and the country back from them. (To be totally clear: He did.) But there was a more elegiac aspect to Buchanan's culture war speech, in which he spoke movingly of the women and men he had met on the campaign trail who feared for their economic futures. He urged the Republican delegates to recognize these people as their brothers and sisters:"	Donald Trump Should Have Channeled Pat Buchanan in His Convention Speech. Seriously.

There was no exciting floor fight leading to multiple rounds of voting. There was no Mitt Romney. There was no reality-show reveal in which Donald Trump, with hundreds of thousands of potential consumers watching the convention on TV, walked on stage, looked directly into the camera, and pitched Trump time shares rather than himself as president. Donald J. Trump, a vulgar and reprehensible man who has vowed to build walls and ban Muslims, who has endorsed torture against terrorists and violence against his detractors, who said he could stand on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and not lose voters (and worst of all, be mostly right about that) will be the Republican nominee for president in 2016. Though some Republicans have cycled through the stages of grief to reach acceptance, I have not. Denial is not an option any longer, but I'll be stuck on anger from now until November--and probably until 2020. An incoherent, incompetent demagogue who's not even conservative has hijacked one of the two major political parties in the United States. My party. There's plenty of blame to go around, starting first and foremost with a GOP that favored its elites and ignored a working class struggling with the shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy. A working class that's not looking for $15 an hour to flip hamburgers, but for meaningful and dignified opportunities to provide for their families. I will not forget that the media handled Trump with kid gloves throughout the primary, openly admitting he was great for business, letting him get his message out unfettered as he spent only pocket change on his campaign. And it will be a long time before I will feel any loyalty to a party leadership that was so tunnel-vision focused on ""winning"" that it sidled up to Trump the second it became clear he was going to get the required number of delegates. Never mind that more Republicans voted against Trump than for him in the primaries. Never mind that he espoused dangerous ideas that are bad for the party and the country. In ignoring the concerns of sane, thinking Republicans and actively squashing the Never Trump movement, RNC chairman Reince Priebus created a lack of trust that is going to take years to heal (even if Slate contributor Reihan Salam is correct that the GOP will bounce back and retool for the sake of winning elections).* In 1980, with the United States swimming in a stagnant economy, an energy crisis, and lingering bad feelings over a decade of war and foreign-policy disasters--in short, a time when we really did need to Make America Great Again--Ronald Reagan emerged from a rough primary and formed a unity ticket with George H.W. Bush. When he took the stage at that year's GOP convention, he made immediate appeals to the common good and spoke optimistically about the future:"	In the End, There Was No White Knight to Save the GOP
