David French does not get them the rest of the way. Never Trump Republicans like Bill Kristol, and whoever else would rally behind French's potential third-party candidacy, do not take the presidency as seriously as they claim to: If they did, they'd admit that they find Hillary Clinton to be a better choice than Donald Trump. No disrespect to David French. He's an Iraq War veteran who was awarded the Bronze Star. He graduated from Harvard Law School and now is ""an attorney (concentrating his practice in constitutional law and the law of armed conflict),"" according to his National Review biography. He has a National Review biography because he is a staff writer for the magazine. However your mileage may vary on his work, it's an impressive resume and the sort of bio from which one might launch a political career. So for which state senate or congressional race is Kristol trying to recruit French? He's recruiting French for the presidency, you say? That's ridiculous. Kristol's principled case against supporting Trump because he is unsuited for the presidency falls apart when, in scrambling for an alternative, he reached for one of his pals on the nearest conservative-magazine masthead. And you are not qualified to be president if your consideration involved Bill Kristol asking a few months before the election, ""Dude, what about you?"" Even if French were viable, how would a conservative third-party challenge work? It wouldn't, in terms of preventing either Trump or Clinton from winning the presidency, and on net it would smooth Clinton's path to the nomination by splitting Republican votes. The Washington Examiner's Byron York published on Wednesday a pretty comprehensive explanation of how Never Trumpers ""operate on a set of wishful-thinking scenarios in which victory depends on one improbable event after another."" York demonstrates how the paths for stopping either a Trump or Clinton presidency--an outright third-candidate Electoral College victory, a House of Representatives-decided third-candidate victory, each sprinkled with a lot of anything can happen this year! pixie dust--are fantastical, then lists other reasons resisters toss around for boosting a French candidacy. One is a matter of morality. ""They can't vote for Trump, and they can't vote for Clinton, and they can't not vote,"" York writes. ""They believe theirs is a moral decision, and they need a candidate to support."" Ugh, OK. There's nothing less fun than an internet debate about morality but they started it: To support French when you know he has no chance is to circumvent your moral duty, not discharge it. They admit there is no practical reason to vote for French--he's merely a protest receptacle they're using to keep themselves pure. They can do whatever they want; this is not the first time people have cast protest votes. But if Kristol, et al., want a protest vote and acclaim for a principled, moral stand against a completely unfit candidate for the presidency, they're going to have to admit it: They would prefer Hillary Clinton as president over Donald Trump. ""[T]he scenario in which a third party draws just a percentage point or two in a state, ultimately benefiting Clinton, is far more plausible than any other scenario,"" York writes. ""It's the wish some #NeverTrumpers cannot publicly express."" Saying what's plainly obvious--that Hillary Clinton, despite all her flaws, is by a million degrees more qualified to serve as president than Donald Trump just on a simple get-us-through-the-day level--is a dangerous admission for conservative opinion writers like Kristol. They have spent decades selling magazine subscriptions by arguing that Hillary Clinton, a center-left technocrat, is the lowest specimen of life in galactic history. How could they ever admit that she's preferable to Trump? It wouldn't be easy. That's how you know it would be a principled stand. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	David French Is a Dodge. Why Can't Never Trumpers Just Admit They Prefer Hillary?

And the proof of his apparent invulnerability is his success against a field of Republican leading lights. By beating 16 other candidates for the party's nomination, goes the argument, Trump demonstrated his singular strength as a political force. But this is a retcon. Look carefully at the Republican primaries and one fact sticks out: From the time Trump announced his campaign in July to the last stretch of the Iowa caucuses, Trump was untouched by his competitors. Yes, at debates and in forums, they criticized him for insufficient conservatism and bad manners but that was the extent of the pushback with few exceptions (which included juvenile mockery). On core questions of his persona and candidacy--his checkered business record, his shady relationships, his unscrupulous ventures--Republicans were silent. That meant Trump could run for the nomination without having to deal with, or answer, questions about the most embarrassing and controversial parts of his record. Republicans allowed Trump to sell himself as a master businessman, and that's what he did. The reality star and tabloid mainstay thrived in the primary's fetid swamp where--without substantive attacks on his record or persona--he could suck attention from his competitors and avoid serious scrutiny. And it's clear he expects to do the same in the general election, dominating daytime cable airwaves with outrageous statements and conspiratorial attacks--a campaign waged via greenroom and speed dial. But as Trump is learning, to his chagrin, the general is a different environment, and here--where the press has just two targets and he's up against one campaign, not 16--the scrutiny and the pressure are much, much greater. Indeed, the past few days have told us something important: Far from finding strength in the fight for the Republican nomination, Trump was ill-served by the dysfunction of it all. In escaping much of the close examination of a presidential primary, he has entered the general election ill-prepared for the most basic interactions between a candidate and the press. It's how we got the spectacle of Tuesday, when an enraged Trump went on a rampage against journalists after some cursory scrutiny around his much-touted donations to veterans' groups. A Washington Post report found major discrepancies; not only had Trump raised less than he'd claimed at his veterans' fundraiser in January, he hadn't made his promised $1 million donation either. If this were still the Republican primary--during which Trump was running against opponents who dared not touch him, for fear of alienating his supporters--he might have escaped the inevitable blowback that comes with stiffing veterans. Instead, he had to deal with a press that was singularly focused on his actions as the Republican presidential nominee. Which makes sense: It's exactly the scrutiny you receive when you reach this point in American politics. Trump couldn't handle it. During the course of his news conference, he railed against the press corps as ""not good people,"" singled out ABC's Tom Llamas as a ""sleaze,"" and mocked the looks of CNN's Jim Acosta. ""I think the political press is among the most dishonest people that I have ever met, I have to tell you,"" he said. ""I see the stories, and I see the way they're couched."" Trump threw a tantrum. And we're sure to see it again. He isn't just unaccustomed to the attention and scrutiny of the political press; he's temperamentally unsuited to it as well. But this focus on his veterans' activities is just the beginning. The same day Trump fell apart in the face of some basic questioning over his charity, the public won access to unsealed documents in the real estate mogul's legal battles over the now-defunct Trump University, a for-profit school started in 2005. The papers detail an organization that critics describe as predatory and fraudulent. ""I believe that Trump University was a fraudulent scheme,"" said one sales manager in his testimony, ""and that it preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money."" The papers are a gold mine of information that reveal the extent to which Trump lent his name and endorsement to operations designed for no purpose other than to extract wealth from ordinary people. Trump sold his university as a tool that would help everyday Americans improve their financial position, something that would ""teach you better than the best business school."" His employee practices, however, told a story of rapaciousness: Trump University employees were pushed to sell expensive courses, upward of $35,000, to struggling customers in what sounds like a glorified telemarketing scheme. (You can almost imagine employees complaining ""the leads are weak"" to a Trump simulacrum screaming ""always be closing."") Already, Democrats are slamming Trump as a ""con-man who profited off of the misery of others,"" a charge he'll have to respond to. He'll also have to deal with growing and aggressive questions from the press, who will want details on how he ran this and other businesses. And on top of all of this scrutiny and attack, Trump will have to build a campaign operation and continue to unite the Republican Party, a task complicated by his drive to hit all critics, even if they're allies. After Ted Cruz left the GOP race and Trump had all but clinched the nomination, Republicans tried to sell themselves on the idea of a silver lining in all of this: that Trump might be more competitive that he looks, that he might help the party expand in traditionally Democratic states. But if this week is any indication, those hopes are delusions. Trump isn't just a compromised candidate hated by large parts of the electorate--he's hardly a candidate at all, with few of the skills or qualities you need to survive at the highest levels of national politics. Trump has all the markings of a paper tiger, and there's a good chance he'll be torn apart like one, too. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why Donald Trump Is Flailing

They want us to believe that Trump will respect the norms of the post-Holocaust, post-segregation era because they support him. In truth, their capitulation should alarm us. As other countries have learned, the first step in the descent to racism and fascism is to become numb to them. Over the past week, we've received fresh evidence that the numbing process is underway. Since announcing his candidacy, Trump has tested our tolerance. He has insinuated that Cuban Americans, Mexican Americans, and Seventh-day Adventists can't be trusted. He has proposed a ban on Muslims. These statements have thrilled his crowds, and they haven't cost him the support of Republican leaders. In general election polls, he has pulled even with Hillary Clinton. So the assault continues. On Friday, at a rally in San Diego, Trump claimed that the federal judge who is hearing the fraud case against Trump's real-estate ""university"" is biased and corrupt--in part, apparently, because the judge is ""Mexican."" Trump has previously portrayed people as biased or untrustworthy, based purely on Latino ancestry, on at least four occasions. Last summer, after retweeting an allegation that Jeb Bush ""has to like the Mexican illegals because of his wife,"" Trump defended this claim on the grounds that Bush's wife--who had been an American citizen for more than 35 years--was ""from Mexico."" On Dec. 12 and Dec. 29, Trump suggested to Republican audiences in Iowa that they shouldn't vote for Sen. Ted Cruz because ""not too many evangelicals come out of Cuba."" In February, Trump accused Gonzalo Curiel, the judge in the Trump University case, of conspiring against him, calling Curiel ""Spanish"" and ""Hispanic."" When Trump was asked to explain the connection between the judge's alleged bias and his ethnicity, Trump said: ""I think it has to do with perhaps the fact that I'm very, very strong on the border."" Trump's attack on Friday continued in this vein. ""I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump,"" he told a crowd in San Diego. ""His name is""-- at this point, Trump, having raised his voice like a drum roll, held up a piece of paper and pronounced the name carefully, gesturing for effect--""Gonzalo Curiel."" The audience booed, and Trump let the moment soak in, shaking his head in solidarity. Trump told the audience two things about Curiel: that he ""was appointed by Barack Obama"" and that he ""happens to be, we believe, Mexican."" After railing against Curiel and the lawsuit for more than 10 minutes, Trump concluded: ""The judges in this court system, federal court--they ought to look into Judge Curiel."" Trump added, as he often does when bringing up his opponents' ancestry, that it's ""great"" and ""fine"" to be Latino (or, as Trump prefers to call it, ""Mexican""). ""I think the Mexicans are going to end up loving Donald Trump, when I give all these jobs,"" he predicted. But on Monday, Trump's spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, dispensed with his pretense of innocence. She repeated what Trump had suggested in February: that Curiel's ancestry was the reason for his bias. In an interview with CNN, Pierson explained:"	Trump's Attack on a Judge Is an Open Appeal to Racism. Don't Normalize It.

This does not always mean that the press always makes the most of Trump's availabilities or that Trump uses the time to offer thoughtful responses. At his not-infrequent press conferences, Trump typically babbles about his greatness and the weakness of his opponents, and the press laughs along with the shtick, gets its quotes, and moves along. Tuesday's conference was different. It was contentious and uncomfortable, which is to say it was the best Trump press conference yet. The whole reason Trump was testy was that the press had held him accountable over something material and meaningful to the lives of others. Tempers flared on both sides. Trump frequently lambastes the press but usually from his dais at large rallies, leaving members of the press with little recourse other than to keep an eye for incoming spit, tomatoes, batteries, or other projectiles from the inflamed crowd. On Tuesday morning in Trump Tower in New York, though, he did it right in front of their faces. ""The press should be ashamed of themselves,"" he said to the group sitting about 10 feet away. ""I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job."" The press was ""disgusting"" and ""dishonest,"" and one reporter--ABC News' Tom Llamas--was singled out as a ""sleaze."" The argument was over donations to veterans' charities that Trump promised in late January. Trump, you may recall, opted to skip the final debate before the Iowa caucuses over what he believed was a disrespectful statement from that debate's host, Fox News. He counterprogrammed the debate with a fundraiser for veterans' charities. At the time, Trump made a great show of how he had successfully raised more than $6 million for vets. Later some news organizations, led by the Washington Post, tried to track the money and could see that only about half the amount Trump purported to raise had been disbursed. The Trump campaign responded to inquiries about the gap largely by stonewalling reporters requesting a full accounting, or offering lower estimates than what it had claimed to have raised at the time. Only last week did Trump cut the $1 million check he had said he personally would donate--and it appears that wasn't the only check that went out just last week. Trump used the press conference to offer that full accounting of donations, which was all reporters asked to see in the first place. He read aloud each of the 41 groups to whom he had donated and how much had been disbursed to each. The final tally was $5.6 million--still short of the number he had originally claimed he'd raised but close enough to it that further inquiries into the matter might come across as nitpicky. (He argued that more would be coming to get the tally over $6 million.) Semi-long story short: The press performed admirably and forced a presidential candidate to bend to public pressure by asking good questions. If a candidate claims to have raised $6 million for veterans' charities but there's no clear indication that $6 million has been disbursed to veterans' charities, it's the press' job to determine what the hell is going on. One option for the candidate in question is simply to offer the reporters asking the questions what they're looking for. Another is to complain about how the press keeps asking and eventually, after the missing money has become a narrative of some concern to the candidate who consistently pledges to ""take care of the vets,"" to turn over that (mostly) full accounting while calling the press a bunch of scumbags for ensuring that veterans' groups received the money pledged to them. ""Stop using veterans as political pawns,"" Al Baldasaro, a New Hampshire state representative and former Marine who spoke on Trump's behalf at the press conference, instructed both the media and the Clinton campaign. The entire purpose of the inquiry, though, was to ensure that Trump wasn't using veterans as political props. This was accountability journalism done properly. So no wonder, then, that the reporters in attendance were so willing to push back against the insults directed their way. ""You seem to be resistant to this kind of scrutiny, the kind of scrutiny that comes with running for president of the United States,"" said CNN's Jim Acosta, whom Trump then mocked as a ""real beauty"" on TV. Llamas was branded a ""sleaze"" for asking about the gap between the $5.6 million and the $6 million in donations. His question: ""You said you had raised $6 million. Clearly you had not. Your critics say you tend to exaggerate and have a problem with the truth. Is this a prime example?"" Fox News' Carl Cameron asked why Trump was treating questions as attacks, while another reporter asked him if he would need thicker skin as president. But worry not for the insulted reporters. They--well, most of them--can suffer being called mean names, even if the candidate himself cannot. Belligerence in reporters' faces is a sign that the reporters in question have done something worthwhile and, by applying pressure, forced an insecure public figure to bend. ""I'm going to continue to attack the press,"" Trump said when asked whether this is what every day would be like in his White House. And that sounds great. The less Trump gets along with the press corps, and the more the press corps doesn't care because they have the facts behind them, the better. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Media Finally Figured Out How to Rattle Donald Trump
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/is_american_really_in_an_anti_establishment_rage.html	"The great cliche of the 2016 presidential election is that there's an anti-establishment mood in the electorate. That Americans just aren't going to take it anymore. It's why Republicans have picked Donald Trump to lead their party--and their country--for the next four years and why millions of Democrats have lined up behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in his strong primary challenge to Hillary Clinton. And there's evidence to back the claim that we're living in the ""year of the outsider."" More than 78 percent of Americans disapprove of Congress; nearly 65 percent say the country is on the wrong track; and upward of 47 percent of registered voters say they would consider a ""generic third-party nominee."" Together, that is a clear vote of no confidence in our political system. But there's another side to public opinion and when you plumb the facts of how Americans feel and where they stand, you come away with this: Either the country is confused or Americans aren't experiencing a single, generalized frustration. The latter would have profound consequences for how our system deals with the present turmoil. The evidence for confusion is strong. The same people who disapprove of Congress will readily re-elect most members to the House and Senate, as they have in almost every election year in modern memory. The same Americans who say the country is on the wrong track also approve of President Obama's performance 50 percent to 45 percent. Earlier this year, in a survey on public attitudes by ABC News and the Washington Post, just 24 percent of Americans described themselves as ""angry"" about the federal government, the lowest total in five years. Forty-seven percent said they were dissatisfied, which is similarly low compared with previous surveys. Well, what about the economy? Are Americans anxious about where they stand? When asked about satisfaction with their lives versus the country, 85 percent of Americans said they were satisfied, compared with 78 percent in 2013. Consumer sentiment is up substantially over previous years, and the number of Americans who say they are personally worse off has taken a sharp decline since the last presidential election. Indeed, for all the problems in our economy, broad conditions are OK. Layoffs are down relative to where they were four years ago; job openings are up; earnings are up; and gasoline prices are at decade lows. Further complicating the popular portrait of an electorate gone mad is actual voter behavior. For all the talk of anger and dissatisfaction in the Democratic primary, it's also true that a majority of Democrats back the establishment candidate for president, who promises continuity with the Obama administration. And while there's plenty of evidence for the case that Americans are angry with the political system--in a November survey from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, 54 percent said the system was ""stacked"" against them--this doesn't jibe with the fact that most Democrats are fine with Hillary Clinton as their nominee or that--before Trump won--most Republicans were fine with a conventional candidate as theirs. It's hard to build a clear answer from these facts and trends. Conditions are decent; political behavior is largely normal; and when asked, most people express satisfaction and even optimism about their lives--so much that Obama holds the highest approval rating of his second term. Despite this, Americans also insist they're angry about the political system and dismayed at the country's direction. And while primary electorates are far from representative of Americans at large, the obvious popularity of figures like Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump speaks to something brewing in American politics. If anything, at least, we should avoid attributing this unusual election to a general anger. Voters aren't uniformly frustrated or frustrated in the same ways, and whatever anger and frustration they have doesn't translate to broad support for either of the candidates who seek to harness it. What we should do, instead, is try to pinpoint the nature of the most salient kinds of anger and frustration. On the right, the most important dynamic is racial resentment and white status anxiety tied directly to a decline in relative fortunes for white Americans, and the rise of an unprecedented nonwhite symbol in the form of President Obama. On the left, we're looking at the rumblings of a generation hit hardest by the Great Recession caught in the winds of rising global inequality. And insofar as nonwhites are frustrated with their place in society, it likely owes to moments of highly visible and still consequential discrimination, whether it's anti-immigrant bigotry or police violence. But even this complicates the question of discontent. Blacks and Latinos saw the worst of the recession and the recovery: Among Americans, they have the strongest case for disrupting the system. And yet they back Hillary Clinton, who is running for modest gains over the status quo, not political revolution. Perhaps they don't trust the consequences of overturning the present order; perhaps the reality of Obama has deepened their faith in the democratic order as it exists. In practice, all of this means there's no actual constituency for an independent candidacy or third-party movement since these frustrations lie at cross-purposes with each other. Anxious white Americans--Trump supporters--won't sign on to a social-democratic agenda if it includes racial justice. (Which, given the role of nonwhites in sustaining left politics, it has to.) In turn, insecure millennials and older nonwhites won't join a campaign devoted to restoring white dominance. Barring a decisive national majority that can act to satisfy some portion of frustrated America, the best odds are that we're stuck with the present disenchantment. A President Clinton won't be able to stem white anxiety as it's tied to vast demographic changes. And a President Trump--if he follows through on his nativist agenda--will spark new forms of fear and anger. Americans cherish the belief that we can power through our divisions; Obama thrust himself into national prominence on the strength of that idea. But right now, and for the foreseeable future, we may just be at a place where a reconciliation of our foul moods simply isn't possible. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Is America Really in an Anti-Establishment Rage?
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/gary_johnson_needs_to_leave_the_libertarian_party_behind.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. ORLANDO, Florida--It was just a couple of hours before the Libertarian Party's final presidential debate. C-SPAN cameras were firing up; delegates were filing in. But one debate participant was still on the dance floor adjacent to the convention hall, swaying to techno music with a goblet of beer sloshing in his hand. John McAfee, founder of the eponymous anti-virus software company and a major candidate in the Libertarian race, had apparently eschewed traditional debate prep. Instead he was rocking out, pausing only to deep-tongue-kiss his wife--for what seemed an awkward and unnecessarily prolonged span of time--as his mesmerized constituents grew increasingly disquieted. A young man in shorts and combat boots, spotting a break in the frenching, scrambled up to McAfee to shake the candidate's hand and shout, ""You're awesome!"" When I pulled this guy aside and asked why he favored McAfee, he began, ""My main concern is interstate commerce legislation,"" launching a runon sentence that somehow ended, after several minutes and some really surprising detours, with an avowal that ""humans will be displaced by A.I. the same way we displaced the whales and the rhinoceroses, and so it's important to remember that bigotry is better than slavery."" As he reached his conclusion, a woman suddenly towered over us on stilts, wearing 12-foot-wide strap-on butterfly wings and waving a McAfee campaign sign to the beat. That pretty much sums up the Libertarian convention, which met in Orlando over Memorial Day weekend. Our current Donald Trump-shaped moment is almost certainly the party's best-ever shot to a make an impact on a presidential election, as voters disappointed in their major party options look around for an alternative. But after spending 48 hours amid loony Libertarians, it's pretty clear to me that the only way for the party's ticket to succeed in a big way--to get on the debate stage with the major-party candidates in the fall, and to reach double digits in November--is for the ticket to leave the party behind. The convention this year was subject to unprecedented levels of outside scrutiny, a result of 1) the widespread distaste for the two major party candidates and 2) the likelihood that the Libertarians will be the only third-party option to appear on all 50 state ballots in November. The mountain of media credentials issued, according to the party's press operation, was 20 times larger than at any previous Libertarian event. Party chairman Nicholas Sarwark told me he's ""been on the phone with the press pretty much nonstop since Ted Cruz dropped out."" But while all this new attention was welcomed by the party chairman, the rank and file were much less prepared for it and much more ambivalent about it. Some delegates seemed to resent the brighter spotlight, wishing things could go back to how they'd been before--a desire that, when voiced by men wearing T-shirts adorned with stipple-dot portraits of Friedrich Hayek, sounded a lot like a high school kid whining that his favorite indie band had signed with a major label. Meanwhile, others I talked to saw this moment not as an opportunity for Libertarians to meet nonwoke America halfway, but rather as a chance to let their freak flag flap before an exponentially wider audience. And oh, did it flap: Among the leading candidates for the party's nomination were men who, by nigh any external standard, qualify as total nutters. Consider: McAfee--who fled his own Central American residential compound while under suspicion by the Belizean government for the murder of his neighbor; who openly admits that said compound featured a harem of teenage Belizean sex workers; who likes to talk about the time a 16-year-old Belizean prostitute tried to shoot him in the head at point blank range; who bounced around the hotel halls wearing a three-piece suit and a pair of Nikes like some kind of Mad Hatter on meth--had regularly polled in third place for the nomination in the lead-up to the convention and even seemed to have a puncher's chance to win. Further consider: He was barely the weirdest candidate on the scene. Polling second coming into the convention, just ahead of McAfee, was a guy named Austin Petersen. Petersen's 35 and looks 14, but question if he's seasoned enough and he'll yelp, ""Tell that to the Marquis de Lafayette."" His go-to applause line: ""I want gay couples to defend their marijuana fields with fully automatic weapons."" Polling fourth, one slot behind McAfee, was a fellow named Darryl W. Perry, who accepts campaign donations only in the form of precious metals and cryptocurrency and who opted to have his nominating speech delivered by an ""erotic services provider"" who goes by the moniker ""Starchild."" Perry's most animated moment in the debate came when he slammed his fist against his lectern, forehead veins a-popping, as he insisted that 5-year-old children should have the legal right to inject heroin without adult supervision. At the middle of this madness--literally, given that he stood at the center lectern when the debate stage lights flashed on and the microphones went live--was Gary Johnson. Johnson served as the Libertarian presidential candidate back in 2012. He received 1 percent of the vote. You might also remember him as a generally respected former two-term governor of New Mexico who was re-elected by a solid margin. Despite his establishment bona fides, Johnson is still outside the norm for a politician with White House aspirations. He believes in total abolition of the income tax, he has invested in a cannabis company, and he freely admits he's consumed marijuana within the past month. But in the land of the freakish candidate, the merely refreshingly odd candidate is king. Johnson looks like a typical politician, with a typical politician haircut, and he exhibits no outwardly evident desire to surround himself with teenage sex workers. Perhaps because of this, or perhaps in spite of it, he was the clear favorite to win the Libertarian nomination as the debate kicked off. And gosh did that debate demonstrate that the Libertarian Party isn't close to ready--or maybe doesn't ever want to be ready--for political prime time. The moderator routinely got the candidates' names wrong. There was an audio failure that made them sound like they were speaking through kazoos. A man dressed as Jesus Christ walked directly in front of the stage, holding a McAfee sign aloft, and nobody bothered to stop him. Candidate Marc Allan Feldman (oh, right, there was a fifth candidate--an anesthesiologist whom no one had heard of and who had apparently never even voted until after he was 50 years old, who somehow also made it into the debate) performed a bizarre Libertarian rap that had him spluttering sputum into his microphone while delineating the principles of freedom. Throughout all this, Johnson remained calm in the eye of the storm--even keeping his cool when he was roundly booed by much of the audience. The first boos came when Johnson admitted that, given the chance, he would have voted for the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Boooooooo! A second hail of raspberries came when Johnson, alone among the candidates, said he thought a driver's license was a reasonable thing to require before allowing someone to drive. ""I'd like to see some demonstration of basic competency,"" Johnson acknowledged, rather meekly. Boooooooo! (Perry seized the moment, basically insisting that blind 4-year-olds should be legally permitted to drive without any sort of government imprimatur.) When it was over, I found Johnson upstairs at the postdebate party in his campaign suite, looking mildly relieved. When I asked if he'd prepared any tactical plan to deal with these ""nontraditional"" candidates, he said, a little defensively, ""I figure myself to be in the nontraditional category, too. But yeah, all you can do is provide the voice of reason. And I try to provide that all the time. There's a vocal group in there, but I think--outside of a Libertarian convention setting--what I say resonates with most people in a big way."" Johnson was guarded as we spoke, parrying my efforts to get him to admit that the core of his party is a pack of weirdos. So I threw him a change-up: As a marijuana user, did he prefer indica or sativa? (Indica is associated with a couch-bound ""body high,"" while sativa is associated with a thoughtful ""head high."") ""I tell the truth,"" he laughed, ""and in fact I did some marijuana product four weeks ago. It was sativa, and it was one of the Colorado products. But I'm not doing any more right now. The knife needs to be sharp."" The fact that Johnson has managed not to get stoned for a full lunar cycle doesn't exactly make him Mitt Romney, but I guess it's a step on the path to becoming a more widely palatable mainstream candidate. Delegate voting began the next morning. When the first wave of ballots came in, a little before lunch, Johnson was only five votes short of clinching the nomination. One vote had gone to Ron Paul (who wasn't running). One vote had gone to Vermin Supreme (a longtime campaign performance artist who was wandering the convention hall with a rubber boot on his head). Sixty-three votes had gone to Perry (who, oh yeah, I forgot to mention, had spent a strangely inordinate amount of airtime during the debate talking about a trans adult film star named Buck Angel). The media on hand got giddy: a contested convention at last! And now the arm-twisting of delegates began, as candidates wrangled votes for the second ballot. A group of Petersen supporters surrounded Johnson and chanted in his face, ""Austin, McAfee, Perry! Anyone but Gary!"" until Petersen came over and asked them to stand down. The second ballot did it for Johnson. He got 55.8 percent. Petersen conceded, and when I last saw him, he seemed at peace--carrying what appeared to be an antique flintlock pistol through the halls of the hotel. It seemed that Johnson's pleas for compromise and maturity had, in the end, won over the room, despite the room's misgivings. Johnson might be a squishy heretic who wants drivers to continue to obtain driver's licenses. But he's the closest thing this party has to a credible, mainstream advocate for its worldview. Johnson's strong resume and sane, non-Starchild-ish mien might even be enough to get him to 15 percent in the polls during this crazy election cycle (he's already hit 10 percent in at least one of them), and that would mean appearing onstage at the big-league debates in the fall--alongside Hillary Clinton and Trump. Sure, Johnson's a bit of a drip, with little charisma. But if he can articulate a moderate, Libertarian-ish platform, some disaffected voters might be tempted to give the party, or at least the candidate, a look. Fresh off his second ballot victory, Johnson took the stage and begged the crowd to go ahead and nominate his vice presidential choice, former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld. The 70-year-old Weld had only been a Libertarian for two weeks and was guilty of many policy heresies in the eyes of party purists, but Johnson argued that he'd bring credibility--and a fundraising Rolodex--that no other candidate could offer the ticket. I guess Johnson knew that, for all their battiness, even the Libertarians want some standing in the process. Earlier in the morning, I'd spotted Weld sitting all by himself in the back of the convention hall. I asked if I could talk with him, and he patted a neighboring chair and invited me to sit. He was studying an anti-Johnson leaflet someone had been handing out. ""I always like to know what the opposition is saying,"" he explained. ""They don't seem to like Gary's advocacy for a consumption tax. But neither do I. I think it's regressive."" Like Johnson, Weld got booed repeatedly over the course of the convention. Did he think he could square himself with a party that was putting up so much resistance? ""I've read the Libertarian Party platform, and it's pretty good,"" he said, with the air of a man who is pleasantly surprised when he gets his car repair bill. ""There's not a lot in there that's way out. It's all principles of nonintervention and less government. Ninety-eight percent of it was music to my ears."" Weld looked wildly out of place here. I couldn't resist asking if he even knew the difference between indica and sativa. ""I'm so sorry to say, but I've never smoked a cigarette of any kind,"" he said. ""I know--booooring."" Weld failed to clinch on the first nomination ballot. As he waited for the revote, some candidates vying to replace Sarwark as party chair gave their speeches. The first of these put his cellphone on the lectern, played a song into the microphone, and stripped down to his underwear, shaking rolls of fat in some sort of demented burlesque. Several rounds of parliamentary debate followed, as delegates asked if it was possible to strip the stripper of his party membership. It was somewhere in the middle of this that Weld won the nomination on the second ballot. Weld and Johnson walked together down the hotel concourse, headed for their first press conference as a united presidential ticket. They'd won the only real prize at stake in Orlando. No, not the hearts and minds of 1,000 diehard Libertarians. Weld and Johnson don't need them--these guys can get free media on their own, and they can get their funding from their rich Republican #NeverTrump pals and maybe even from the Kochs. The only thing they needed from this convention was the ballot access. With that in hand, Weld and Johnson can now leave Starchild, and the butterfly woman, and Darryl Perry's popping veins, far behind. The press pack trailed the newly anointed duo as they veered into an ancillary ballroom, where the regular convention attendees were not allowed to follow. The weekend was over, and it was suddenly clear that the freaks had lost. We passed a woman who angrily hissed: ""Congratulations, establishment!"" Read more of Slate's 2016 election coverage."

It's why, over the past week, he's worked to dominate the general election's news cycle the same way he dominated the Republican primary's: through attacks and controversy. He has succeeded in yet again blanketing cable news, blocking Hillary Clinton from anything like equal time. The idea is that this will sink Clinton and boost Trump the same way a similar stream of outrageous statements and attacks kept Trump's Republican opponents from building steam with voters and overtaking him in the polls. But there's a problem with this strategy: The same saturation that helped Trump in the primary has harmed him with voters writ large. If Trump means to run the same campaign he used to win the GOP nomination, he'll flounder and lose. First, let's recap the past few days in Trump news. On Monday, he released an Instagram video accusing former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault. A few days earlier, in an interview with the Washington Post, he resurrected conspiracy theories around the 1993 death of White House official Vince Foster, which was ruled a suicide by both law enforcement and subsequent investigations. Despite this, fringe voices on the far right have long argued that the Clintons--who were friends of Foster--were involved in his death. Trump called these theories ""very serious."" On Tuesday, Trump attacked New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, for ""not doing her job,"" an unusual move for a party nominee. By Wednesday, Trump was also fending off attacks around his charitable giving, or lack thereof; not only did he lie about his $6 million fundraiser for veterans' causes (he didn't raise nearly that much), but he never gave a promised $1 million out of his own pocket. And on Thursday, Trump continued a previous thread by mocking Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for her one-time claim of Native American heritage, calling her ""Pocahontas"" and attacking her for her ""big mouth."" To sum up, in less than a week, Trump generated enough offensive rhetoric and bad behavior to fuel a month's worth of negative coverage. If all publicity is good publicity, then it's possible this helps Trump succeed in the general election and keeps Clinton from moving the campaign toward her turf--the realm of plans and issues. Or at least, that's the theory. The numbers tell a different story. The latest national poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal asks respondents to give their feelings on the remaining candidates, from ""very positive"" to ""very negative"" and provides a long-term view as well, with results from as far back as the 1990s. In February 2011--well before Trump announced his campaign--26 percent of Americans said they had a ""very or somewhat"" positive view of the real estate mogul, 29 percent said they had a ""very or somewhat"" negative view, and 40 percent were neutral. By the time Trump entered the race for president in July 2015, after years of sharpening his divisive presence on the national stage, just 16 percent were neutral, versus 26 percent with a positive view and 56 percent with a negative one. What does Trump look like a year later after consolidating most Republicans behind his banner? Just 29 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the real estate mogul. Fifty-eight percent hold a negative one. Just 12 percent are neutral. Look to other polls and you see the same stasis. In June 2015, according to YouGov, 32 percent of Americans held a favorable view of Trump versus 60 percent who felt the reverse. Today, those numbers are 35 percent versus 61 percent, with the largest gains among Republicans (68 percent have a favorable view) and the steepest declines among self-described independents and Democrats. Among the former, Trump's unfavorability rose 15 percentage points to 66 percent. Among the latter, it rose 7 percentage points to 87 percent. Which is just to say that over the past year, Trump's attention-at-all-costs strategy has done nothing but tank his ratings among the public at large, Republicans excepted. This, even after he's cinched the nomination and won over the vast majority of Republicans. Yes, Clinton's ratings are also low (although better than Trump's), but she's also fighting a contentious primary. If and when the Democratic Party unifies, her popularity will go up accordingly as Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents find reasons to like Clinton. And once the race achieves this equilibrium--two nominees leading two united parties--the popularity gap will likely look even worse for Trump, as he will remain a historically unpopular candidate, while she will return to being a modestly unpopular one. All of this raises a question: If the media didn't make Trump popular--if it's actually done the reverse--then how did he win the Republican primary? One answer is that Trump has broken the rules of politics--he's killed the dungeon master, changed the character sheets, rewritten American politics into a game of his own making. This isn't just wrong, it buys into the myth of Trump as a force of will and power who can reshape reality to his liking. The better explanation, the one that treats Trump like an important force but not a dispositive one, is that Donald Trump won the Republican primary because the Republican Party is broken. Years of disdain--for moderation, for compromise, for governance, expertise, and conventional qualifications--have merged with long-exploited currents of bigotry to produce an electorate primed for a man like Donald Trump. Republicans put a Trump-like figure on the 2008 presidential ticket, backed Trump-like figures in the 2012 primaries, and even solicited Trump himself for an endorsement that same year. It was only a matter of time before Republican voters clamored for the real deal. If you trace Trump to institutional failure within the Republican Party, then it's hard to say he can scramble the general electorate like he did the primary one. For all of its problems, the two party contest isn't dysfunctional; Democrats will fight hard to stop Trump. CNN taking the bait and airing his bluster 24/7 isn't going to help him.

7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/what_aryans_see_in_donald_trump.html	"In recent years, white supremacists have tended to avoid taking part in national politics in the belief that both parties have been conquered by nonwhites who pursue their own racial interests over others. This year represents a sea change. Rarely have so many open racists flocked to a presidential candidate's banner as they have done for Donald Trump. They have shown up at rallies to do gleeful battle with Black Lives Matter protesters and jumped at the opportunity to serve as Trump delegates to the Republican National Convention. The reasons for white nationalists' renewed hope in mainstream politics are more complicated than the caricature of jackbooted youths saluting one of their own. Trump has disavowed the endorsement of overt racists such as David Duke, but somehow white nationalists have ""never been more optimistic."" Despite Trump's profession, ""I don't have a racist bone in my body,"" his brand of race-fueled populism promises to reforge broken psychological ties among large swaths of demoralized white voters, whether or not they self-identify as white nationalists or belong to extremist organizations. Trump seeks to recreate a coalition that includes dislocated rural workers and dissatisfied denizens of urban democracy, the relatively prosperous and the hardly working, weary defenders of the Old South and armed isolationists in the Pacific Northwest. Through a mix of policy and symbolism, Trump unites them all with a sneering form of nationalism that, more than ever, helps rekindle the racial consciousness of mainstream white voters. A key to Trump's appeal is that his agenda to ""Make America Great Again"" revolves around an iron-fisted leadership style for which many disaffected white voters have been searching. The fractured elements of white nationalist America, meanwhile, perceive Trump to be the embodiment of the Aryan warrior, a mythic figure who will liberate white people from their current state of malaise, infighting, and almost certain extinction. White nationalists trace their lineage through Northern Europe (some claim to descend from the Lost Tribes of Israel) and find their role models in the various soldiers and statesmen who supposedly defended the purity of the white civilization. Today, any person of Western European stock can theoretically become an Aryan warrior by swearing to preserve the white race, but some white supremacist groups believe a single figure will be called from among the people to fulfill a more unifying role. Trump, who is of German and Scottish ancestry, fits the ethnic profile of this savior to a T. But it's Trump's political self-presentation that is truly arousing. Unhappy white Americans are not monolithic, Trump's appeal goes beyond his potential Aryan saviorhood. In a Republican Party that has tilted decidedly rightward, he outflanked Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz--figures who are more faithful conservatives than Trump--by shrewdly appealing to a complex belief system shared by many disgruntled white voters. But for the most extreme of these resentment-oriented citizens, Trump's appeal is manifold. These citizens believe that the founding generation established the United States as a republic for the pursuit of liberty and happiness as white people alone define those ideals. Members of this alt-community despise pluralism, bristling at any emphasis of race, sex, or gender differences. Many distrust liberal education, which is blamed for fostering white guilt and destroying a sense of racial identity among whites. A number of them fear the global economy (this ranges from a philosophical objection to laissez-faire economics to a more conspiratorial conviction that big banks, Jews, and nonwhites are together subjugating the white race). Sensing their influence greatly diminished, such individuals have opted out of electoral politics. They have felt abandoned by the old Democratic Party after it became the party of black civil rights and betrayed by the modern Republican Party, which has cynically used dog-whistle politics to gain their votes without, in their view, doing enough to safeguard their interests. Some of the discontented have become radicalized, joining patriot groups, separatist strongholds, or white supremacist organizations. Anxiety about biological and cultural extinction is pervasive among these disaffected whites. Before his downfall and death, Richard Girnt Butler gathered self-identified Aryans to his compound in Hayden Lake, Idaho. On social media today, racially conscious whites assemble around the hashtag #WhiteGenocide or lodge their grievances at Stormfront.org. (Trump once actually retweeted a user named ""White Genocide."") The late David Lane, an influential Aryan thinker and member of a violent organization called the Order, helped popularize the view that the white race was ""now a small minority in the world,"" beset by forced integration, intermarriage, and ""inter-species compassion."" According to this worldview, only those who aspire to the ideal of the Aryan warrior can restore the civic republicanism of America's forefathers and save the white race. Enter Trump. The cultural image of the Aryan warrior combines romantic masculinity, chest-beating race pride, and a relish for legal violence. Lane's writings put the Aryan warrior in explicitly political terms. His tract 88 Precepts prophesies the coming of the ""strongman,"" who will emerge in the late stages of a dying democracy. That figure will display a keen ability to see that ""political, economic, and religious systems may be destroyed and resurrected"" in ways to prevent the eternal destruction of the white race. Some will call the strongman ""a dictator,"" but Lane insists that a ruthless leadership style ""is the only way to restore order out of the chaos caused by a democracy."" Trump's style of governance seems to fulfill this prophesy: His entire self-presentation is a rebuke to liberalism and gradual legal change. Instead, he promises political revolution through charismatic leadership. Trump's vulgar, unvarnished manner of speaking and his penchant for favoring extreme measures--the very characteristics deemed unpresidential and dangerous by his critics--are seen as not only refreshing but also as essential for the rebirth of the Aryan nation-state. When Trump calls Hispanic immigrants ""criminals, drug dealers, rapists,"" and vows to ""take our country back"" from those ""taking our jobs"" and ""taking our money,"" white nationalists hear Trump telling the same uncomfortable truths about the sorry state of white society they have voiced for decades. Every time he eggs followers on to forcefully confront detractors or swears to ""take out the families"" of terrorists, he projects a muscular approach to protecting the white republic. His calling card is a plan to build a massive wall between the United States and Mexico to stem illegal immigration and somehow force Mexico to pay for it. Policy analysts have scoffed at this proposal, but its real power lies not in policy but in metaphor, one that taps into a hardened, survivalist mindset. It is an image that resonates with a community that already believes it is losing the war against nonwhite civilizations. When Trump ritually invokes the wall or recommends the creation of a national deportation force, he signals to this constituency that he agrees the future of the white race is at stake. To Aryans, a resurgence of public masculinity is central to sovereignty. They believe that the power to command others, and then to spark a revolution, emanates from one's power to control the traditional family. This is why Trump's crude comments about female appearances and the proper role of women excite rather than repulse these core supporters. It is also why, in trading on fears of white male helplessness, his claims that ""Mexico sends its people"" to rape and pillage and that China is ""raping our country"" through unfair trade practices appeal so powerfully to the racist mind. For Trump, as for the white nationalist community, sovereignty and maleness are forever interlinked. Additionally, the scorn heaped upon Trump simply confirms for these racially motivated white voters that they have discovered the right leader, one who might defeat the forces of liberalism and multiculturalism that have corrupted American law. Lane urged white people to select a strongman ""wisely."" ""Choose one who has sacrificed all in the face of tyranny; choose one who has endured and persevered,"" he writes. ""This is the only reliable evidence of his worthiness and motives."" On this front, Trump has more than proved his mettle by drawing the arrows of his enemies in the Republican primary and emerging more powerful for it, while the battlefield is littered with opponents who underestimated him. How far can he go? Trump has actively courted fringe parts of the electorate by assenting to their racially inflected diagnosis of what ails America and has thrown his support behind whites-first prescriptions. From this point on, Trump's ceiling as a vehicle for white nationalism will depend on the willingness of mainstream voters to take responsibility for his promise to restore white self-governance and his systematic scapegoating of nonwhites. By casting himself as a virtuous guardian of white people's welfare and claiming a ""mandate"" to be provocative, Trump has gotten further than any similar politician in recent years. Win or lose, as the presumptive Republican nominee for president, he is already more successful than Pat Buchanan or David Duke, which makes him the most prominent Aryan warrior of the modern age."	What Aryans See in Donald Trump
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/how_a_2013_governor_s_race_explains_clinton_trump.html	"Two strikingly unpopular candidates. One, the embodiment of establishment politics, a career Democrat long mired in scandal, from shady deals to questionable relationships. The other, a widely disliked and controversial Republican with deep negatives among women voters. Pundits predicted a slugfest of a campaign as the two gave up on persuasion and worked to beat the other into the ground. Political operatives called it a ""race to the bottom""--a choice between ""the devil and the deep blue sea."" No one expected anything but the worst. Which is what they got: political combat as directed by Zack Snyder, a turgid slugfest between two unlikeable politicians. That was the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial election between now-Gov. Terry McAuliffe (last seen under investigation for allegedly violating election law) and then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, infamous for everything from his proposed, no-exceptions abortion ban and deep opposition to legal rights for LGBT couples to his support for a fringe constitutional theory that would dismantle the welfare state and throw the United States back into an age of gross discrimination and political inequality. McAuliffe wasn't an extremist--his views fell square in the mainstream of Virginia politics--but he had his own weaknesses in the form of suspect business deals and unscrupulous associates. Right now, we're living through a national, absurdist reboot of this election, if not a shot-for-shot remake. Hillary Clinton is playing the part of McAuliffe, with Trump in the role of Cuccinelli. The similarity between the two races is instructive, telling us something about what happens when elections turn into contests over identity. And what the Virginia election augurs for the aftermath of this fall's vote is not exactly reassuring. Early polls in Virginia were clear on each candidate's negatives. On the eve of the 2013 election, according to Public Policy Polling, McAuliffe topped out at 36 percent favorable to 52 percent unfavorable. Cuccinelli, meanwhile, was just a little more popular with 39 percent favorability to 52 percent unfavorability. McAuliffe's advantage was that, among voters who disliked both candidates--a substantial 15 percent of the electorate--the former DNC chair led Cuccinelli 61 percent to 16 percent. As expected, the result was a contest where positive vision was less important than outright attack. And while McAuliffe had an agenda--focused on improving the state's transportation infrastructure and expanding Medicaid in accordance with the Affordable Care Act--that fact was less important than the race's overall conditions. McAuliffe had a number of things working in his favor: a larger war chest (McAuliffe consistently outspent Cuccinelli), a smartly run campaign (crafted by Robby Mook, present-day architect of Hillary Clinton's campaign for president) that was aimed at rebuilding the Obama coalition in the state, and the good fortune of having a libertarian candidate in the field, one who polled just south of 10 percent before the election and drew largely from Republicans dissatisfied with Cuccinelli. All this was enough to give McAuliffe everything he needed to pull out a narrow win in a year that initially favored the GOP--even with its scandal-ridden incumbent governor. Clinton is a close ally of McAuliffe; he got his start as a fundraiser for Bill Clinton. Like him, her time in public life has been defined by scandal and innuendo (much of it debunked), and like him, she's under official investigation for supposedly taking unnecessary and potentially illegal shortcuts for the sake of expediency. The big difference is that Clinton is more than just a staunch partisan with a penchant for making unseemly decisions: She's a devoted wonk, with a record of genuine advocacy for children and families, mixed in with bad policy choices. By contrast, McAuliffe is a party operative who happened to have ambitions beyond fundraising. In important respects, Trump's not Cuccinelli. He's not just ideologically flexible; it's unclear if he has an ideology at all. Where Cuccinelli had deep-seated principle (or, alternatively, ideological rigidity), Trump has ""deals"" and ""suggestions""--nothing he says is the final word, and even the final word isn't the final word. Cuccinelli had an agenda for Virginia; Trump believes in ""strength."" But Trump inhabits the same role as Cuccinelli: an outsider, of sorts, with a rocky relationship to his party establishment but one who inspires real devotion from his most serious followers. Trump is defined by his rhetoric as much as anything else and for all it has done in helping him secure a presidential nomination, it has also made him unpopular with large swaths of the electorate, including most women and the vast majority of nonwhites. If 2016 takes the same path as 2013 did for Virginia, we should expect an election where policy and ideas take a backseat to vicious political combat between two unpopular standard-bearers. And it's one where the most mainstream candidate is likely to win, helped along by a libertarian in the third ballot slot. At the same time, this combat isn't pointless. Their problems aside, McAuliffe and Cuccinelli represented two distinct paths for Virginia: forward in the direction of its cosmopolitan future--rooted in its long-standing black community and its growing immigrant one--or backward to its white, rural, and conservative (even reactionary) past. The same is true for Clinton versus Trump. This election isn't just a fight over tax plans and health care; it's a contest--a brawl, even--over questions of national identity. Just who is the United States for? Just whom do we mean when we say ""Americans?"" On one side, we have immigrants, religious minorities, and the descendants of slaves, some disadvantaged, some on the upswing, but each committed to inclusion. On the other, we have an angry and frustrated white minority that's perhaps still potent enough to win the White House. And what happened next in Virginia? Upon taking office, McAuliffe faced a stubborn legislature, steered by Republicans in the House of Delegates, and bolstered by a narrow majority in the state Senate. Republicans blocked his plan for expanding Medicaid, attacked his proposals for transportation funding, and denied him an appointment to the state's Supreme Court. Far from making progress, the McAuliffe administration has been a rearguard action, a game of defense against highly partisan and organized Virginia Republicans. At one point, McAuliffe floated a unilateral Medicaid expansion, accomplished through executive action. But this, a legal gray area, could have sparked a state constitutional crisis. The plan was scrapped. What happened in Virginia wasn't the result of candidate unpopularity. The acrimony there had as much to do with the stakes of the election itself--a contest a lot like our current one over national identity--as it did with the people in the title roles. And if the present of American politics looks like Virginia in 2013, then the near-future might be a replay of Virginia, right now: an ugly, ferocious election leading to a stalemate, as President Hillary Clinton attempts to accomplish something against a tough and recalcitrant opposition. Hyperpartisanship and extreme obstruction grinding the gears of government to a halt. An impasse that leads, perhaps, to drastic measures. Gov. McAuliffe didn't preside over a governance crisis, though he came close. Maybe, if she wins, President Clinton will. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

Think of what few norms are still observed in national politics following the rise of Trump. There's the one about how at least one member of a presidential ticket should be a nonironic candidate. Then there's the norm that Newt Gingrich, having served as second in line of succession to the presidency, should never be allowed to rise to first. Third ... well, there is no third remaining observed political norm. Trump, having taken out all others, now has the ability to nix the two holdouts with a single decision left entirely to him. Which is why there's such a great chance of it happening! It just makes too much sense, in its blanket obliteration of what was previously considered ""sense."" Selecting a figure such as Gingrich, who beyond all the Trumpian goofiness also has the Trumpian bulldozing of a longstanding post-war political paradigm on his resume, has its own simple and perfect logic. This really may happen, and it would be amazing. God help us all. Gingrich, in his trademark way of exuding unsubtlety in the execution of what he believes to be a stealth operation, is angling for the vice presidency even more aggressively than Trump is angling for the presidency. When Gingrich responded to a question about the inexperience of Trump's foreign policy advisers by instructing Slate's Isaac Chotiner to read both The Art of the Deal and The Art of the Comeback, such a shameless non sequitur could only be read as that day's canned talking point in his campaign for the vice presidency. Gingrich was among the earliest bold-name political figures to liaise between Trump and official Republican Washington. Like Chris Christie, Gingrich may have realized that taking the plunge early with the party's incoming standard-bearer was the best way to position himself for a sweet gig down the road--and perhaps persuade Trump to help retire lingering campaign debt. Trump basks in what normals might consider uncomfortable levels of flattery, and so, by several accounts--including Trump's own mouth--Gingrich has successfully implanted himself on his new master's veep shortlist. Though Gingrich has said Trump would need ""psychiatric help"" if the presumptive nominee were to select him as his running mate, he definitely will not rule himself out. The former speaker of the House is now a ubiquitous force in the Trump effort, selling him in the media and advising him on policy and politics.

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/a_letter_to_a_bernie_or_bust_voter.html	"In the year 2000, fresh out of college, I cast my second-ever presidential election vote for Ralph Nader. Later that night, I watched in horror as the contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush ended in an unprecedented electoral college toss-up, leading to a messy recount battle and the infamous Supreme Court decision Bush v. Gore. The chosen successor of a popular incumbent administration, Gore should have sailed to victory on the strength of the economy alone, yet he conceded the election to Bush, a candidate initially considered too unserious to be a true contender. Gore lost Florida by 537 votes. Nader received almost 100,000 votes in Florida. And he actively campaigned in swing states, including Florida, in the lead-up to the election. If Nader had quit the race and thrown his support to the Democrats, we might be reminiscing about a Gore administration right now. And I share the blame. Now, before you post mean things in the comments, let me clarify: I voted in New York state, which went blue in 2000, so my individual vote did not help swing the election. But I still feel complicit. I jumped on the Nader bandwagon and bought into a set of beliefs that seemed right to me at the time but were proven very wrong over the eight years that followed. Chief among them, I thought that Gore and Bush were essentially indistinguishable. Carbon copies of each other. Both corporate insider candidates, beholden to big-money interests and out of touch with people struggling at the margins of the economy. I'm from the Rust Belt--I grew up near Cleveland--and I had seen factory closures turn a once-vibrant part of the country into a series of ghost towns. I blamed NAFTA and the Clinton administration's failure to defend unions and stem the tide of outsourcing. In this and on other issues--welfare reform, prison sentencing--I thought the Clinton administration had bent so far backward to win over the right that it had lost its progressive conscience. The economy boomed during the Clinton years, but the gulf between the rich and poor, the haves and have-nots, only widened. Nader voiced the discontent I was feeling. I was young and idealistic and wanted political revolution. It felt good to back a rabble-rouser, not the stiff, robotic Al Gore. I was annoyed with the Democrats for picking a predictable, incremental candidate who played not to the left, but to the mushy middle. I went to a Nader rally in NYC: Bill Murray, Michael Moore, and Susan Sarandon spoke. Eddie Vedder sang. I felt inspired, part of a movement to bring about real change, ready to cast my protest vote. But here's the thing: In the eight years that followed, I was reminded again and again that George Bush and Al Gore were not carbon copies of each other. Bush was a disastrous president. He got us into an expensive, unwinnable war that unleashed untold human misery both abroad and here at home. He cut taxes on the rich while failing to curtail spending, turning the $280 billion surplus he inherited from Clinton into a $6 trillion deficit. He relaxed gun control restrictions and refused to comply with international climate treaties. He passed No Child Left Behind, a law that turned schools into test-taking machines. He bungled the emergency response to Hurricane Katrina. His administration left the country mired in the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. Gore might not have been a perfect president, but it's likely he would have taken more reasonable action on the economy, climate change, and gun policy. It's hard to say how he would have handled 9/11, but he might have been more cautious and more diplomatic in the Middle East than Bush was. Now, 16 years later, I look back on my young, Nader-voting self and see plenty of parallels with the college students who are feeling the Bern. Hillary Clinton is a wonkish, often uninspiring candidate, just as Al Gore was. Like Gore, she promises to extend an incumbent's centrist legacy rather than move the country further left. Her ties to the moneyed powers-that-be sometimes seem stronger than her connection to the other 99 percent. And Bernie, as Nader did, promises to dial back the influence of big-money corporate donors and bring about real change. He even has Bill Murray, Michael Moore, Susan Sarandon, and Eddie Vedder on his side. But if Bernie splinters the left and erodes Clinton's support among voters, the consequences for our country could be even more dire than another Bush administration. If the Bush administration was catastrophic, a Trump administration could be cataclysmic. He has no compunction about stirring up violent, hateful rhetoric among his supporters. He wants to deport millions of people and ban an entire religious group from entering the country. He threatens to shut down the press. If he gets elected, we'll be counting down the days before he insults some world leader and starts World War III. Alarmingly, some Sanders supporters seem to actually welcome the chaos of a Trump presidency: Susan Sarandon has said he can ""bring the revolution,"" an argument that only highlights her privileged position as a celebrity not at risk of getting deported, deployed, or discriminated against by a Trump administration. Jill Stein, running as the Green Party's nominee, recently tweeted, ""I will be horrified if Donald Trump is elected. I will also be horrified if Hillary Clinton is elected. Both are corporate politicians."" Change up the names, and she could be quoting her party mate Nader in 2000. Both Sarandon and Stein are ignoring real differences: Hillary Clinton may not be a revolutionary, but she'll defend Roe v. Wade, preserve Obamacare, push for reasonable gun laws, protect LGBTQ rights, support parental leave, and heed climate science. Trump will do none of the above. Like Gore, Hillary Clinton isn't the left's ideal candidate. But, barring a mathematical miracle, she's our nominee. And, in what promises to be a tight general election, she's going to need every vote she can get. Now that the Republican Party is consolidating around Trump, the Democrats' failure to unify around its own presumptive nominee becomes all the more glaring. The longer Sanders stays in the race, the more Hillary's negatives grow, and the more cash and attention she peels away from her general election efforts. A recent YouGov poll reports that 61 percent of Sanders supporters have an unfavorable opinion of Clinton, a number that has grown as the primaries continue to drag on. Moreover, Sanders' critiques of Clinton have become more pointed and go beyond policy disputes; they also focus on process (allegations that the nomination process is rigged) and character (painting Clinton as corrupt and dishonest). Come November, it will be tough for the Democrats to energize voters who see their nominee as fundamentally untrustworthy and their party as unjust. Trump insulted practically every voting bloc in his party, and the GOP is still holding its nose to line up behind him. Yet the left threatens to fracture. How do we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory? Like this. To the Bernie voters who are disgusted with the process and disillusioned with the Democratic nominee, I hear you. But if you plan to stay home, defect to a third party candidate, or vote Trump in November, think back to the fall of 2000. It only took 100,000 ideological purists in one state to give our country away to a know-nothing nightmare of a president. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Dear Bernie-or-Bust Voter: I Get It. I Was Just Like You Once.
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/is_matt_bruenig_a_populist_martyr.html	"Over the weekend, much of the Sanderista internet erupted in outrage after Matt Bruenig, the incisive poverty analyst and combative Twitter personality, lost his blogging gig at Demos, a progressive policy shop. He was let go after a Twitter spat in which he called Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, ""scumbag Neera"" and referred to her and Nation writer Joan Walsh as ""geriatrics."" The story that quickly ricocheted around Twitter was that Bruenig, an expectant father, had been left jobless because he dared to stand up to members of the Democratic establishment. Tweeted Glenn Greenwald: Bruenig set up a GoFundMe page, which he called the Bruenig Bailout Fund, and soon raised nearly $25,000. ""Fuck Demos, Neera, Joan, and any establishment cowards who would sooner see an expectant father fired than face critiques they surely know are true,"" said one $18 donor. The story of Bruenig's firing made Politico (""Progressive Blogger Fired for Calling Hillary Clinton Ally a 'Scumbag' "") and Gawker (""Liberal Think Tank Fires Blogger for Rude Tweets."") The Nation has been inundated with demands that Walsh be fired in turn, and Walsh--who was, full disclosure, my boss when I worked at Salon--tells me she has received three death threats. Yet the notion that Bruenig is some sort of populist martyr is, at best, incomplete. Lost in the initial coverage was the fact that Bruenig has a full-time job as a lawyer; he blogged for Demos as a freelancer. (I won't reveal where he works, a courtesy he probably wouldn't extend to his online adversaries.) From a free speech perspective, his other employment is immaterial, but the end of his relationship with Demos is not going to plunge his young family into destitution. Further, neither Walsh nor Tanden had any communication with Demos before he was let go. ""These allegations that Neera and I got him fired are complete lies,"" says Walsh. Demos is an organization that does research and legal advocacy around poverty and voting rights. It is known for having a warm, collegial internal culture, and it values its relationships with other progressive players. In that sense, Bruenig's aggressive persona made him an odd fit well before the latest contretemps. He is widely admired for his work on poverty, particularly his refutations of the so-called success sequence, which holds that a person can avoid economic immiseration by finishing high school, getting a full-time job, and delaying child-bearing until after age 21, and then only within marriage. On Twitter, however, he has a reputation, particularly among liberal women, as a relentless bully with a nasty online entourage. As the feminist writer Sady Doyle wrote in an email to Demos, ""Bruenig is not only directly aggressive, he is a ringleader who inspires people to be aggressive and commit harassment in his name. Reports of being stormed after Bruenig points his followers at people are ubiquitous, and they most often come from women and people of color."" In the wake of fights with Bruenig, both Walsh and the feminist writer Jill Filipovic have seen photographs of the insides of their apartments, taken from real estate websites and Airbnb, circulated online. The message Walsh took from this was ""we know where you live."" Obviously, Bruenig is not responsible for the online behavior of his peers. (It is the nature of mobs, online or otherwise, to make responsibility diffuse.) He himself, however, insults people in starkly personal terms. He's been taunting Walsh for being ""old"" for months now. Recently, when she objected, he threw information about her condo, presumbably unearthed by one of her trolls, in her face: ""But hey keep on gentrifying Harlem with your million dollar apartment you woke self-proclaimed centrist."" (Bruenig declined to comment for this piece.) During a recent argument with Filipovic, he tweeted, ""it's just funny that you are such a hack that you deny actual facts when they disrupt your preferred framing."" He wrote that the writer Megan McArdle was a ""complete human failure at business,"" mocking her ""inadequacy and incompetence at the thing she spent many years trying to accomplish."" He later wrote that this sort of insult-laden prose ""stirs and inflames people, which I find funny. People call this 'trolling.' "" They do indeed. Bruenig makes no apologies for being cruel to those he considers class enemies. As he and some of his allies see it, perfidious neoliberals regularly take sadistic policy positions while using demands for civility to escape the consequences. ""To read the daily internet happenings on poverty in the US is to basically just watch a parlor game of elites opine in extremely 'uncivil' ways about the plight of people that they don't afford any dignity, humanity, or decency,"" he once wrote on his personal blog. On social media, he turns that contempt back on the people who he believes deserve it. For the circle of leftists who surround him, being horrible online has become a kind of ethos. ""Vulgarity is the language of the people ... to wield righteously against the corrupt and the powerful,"" Amber A'Lee Frost wrote recently in Current Affairs. A piece on Medium titled ""In Support of Matt Bruenig"" quoted that passage approvingly, adding,  ""Bruenig, better than almost any contemporary writer, understands this power, and wields it unflinchingly."" For women and people of color who have tangled with Bruenig, his righteously wielded personal invective comes on top of the online abuse they already suffer. He does not appear to be bothered by this. ""Identitarianism is ... heavily intertwined with certain discourse norms demanding deference to (even bourgeois) members of various demographic groups,"" he wrote in April. ""And the last thing someone interested in class politics should ever do is hesitate to harshly criticize any bourgeois discourse participant with bad arguments and opinions, especially when those arguments and opinions concern class issues."" Bruenig's ideological commitment to harsh criticism created a dilemma for Demos, which was the only institutional affiliation listed on Bruenig's Twitter account and which doesn't want to be associated with Twitter trolling. The organization urged him to scale back his personal attacks. He refused. As Demos said in a statement after he was let go: ""After multiple conversations, Matt Bruenig and Demos have agreed to disagree on the value of the attack mode on Twitter. We part ways on the effectiveness of these kinds of personalized, online fights and so we are parting ways as colleagues today."" In general, I'm not comfortable with the idea of people losing their jobs over insulting things they say on Twitter; I thought it was wrong, for example, for the journalist Nir Rosen to be fired for his tasteless jokes about Lara Logan's sexual assault in Egypt. There must be a line, however, between making allowances for things said in the heat of argument and insisting on the moral right to personally demean anyone who disagrees with you, without consequences. I'm not sure exactly where I'd draw it, but a few things are clear. Bruenig is now nearly $25,000 richer and more of a hero to his faction of the left than ever before. The idea that being an asshole on Twitter constitutes revolutionary praxis has been further embedded. And if Bruenig is a victim here, he is far from the only one.

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/why_the_democrats_platform_actually_matters_this_year.html	"In 2012, Barney Frank, then in his last year in Congress, helped write the Democratic national platform. At least he thinks he did. ""I don't remember what was in it,"" says Frank, who was a member of the platform committee at that year's Democratic National Convention, ""and it wasn't a very interesting tour of duty."" Describing the platform as the ""Miss Congeniality of the convention process,"" the former Massachusetts representative says everything besides the nomination of the president and the vice president is just this ""Model U.N. kind of stuff."" ""Maybe you are a particularly savvy person,"" he adds, ""but I can't remember much that's been in any platform."" Four years later, the Democratic primary is slogging toward a conclusion in which the platform will play a significantly larger role--Miss Swimsuit, let's say. At the moment, Hillary Clinton, a couple of weeks from officially clinching the party nomination, is struggling to unite Democrats around her candidacy. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, shows no indication that he is excited to throw his support her way once he's been defeated. He is going to want meaningful concessions about the way the Democratic Party does business, what it believes in, and for whom it acts. The Clinton campaign and other Democratic Party leaders have two ways of dealing with this. One is to reprimand Sanders for the recent unpleasantness and freeze him out by shooting down everything he asks for. Mathematically, given the numbers the Clinton camp possesses at the convention (by virtue of her winning a majority of delegates), they could go down this path. It would just be extremely stupid politics, since Sanders has millions of hardened supporters whom Clinton will need in November, and more proximately, he could trigger a convention floor fight if he felt compelled. The other path is to deal with Sanders in a way that acknowledges his contributions to the intraparty debate without undermining Clinton's earned status atop it. The composition of the Democratic Party platform is setting up to be a central vehicle for such dealing. Why the platform? It's just meaningful enough to signal the general beliefs of a party and the direction in which it's moving but not powerful enough to bind a nominee to all of its planks. Rather than look at ceding platform planks to Sanders as a burden, the Clinton campaign could see it as a positive means of bridging party divisions ahead of the autumn grind. And though Sanders wouldn't be the nominee, it would be a victory of sorts to insert planks supporting, say, single-payer health care and a $15 minimum wage into Clinton's platform. Party platforms are faintly ridiculous documents, as Frank points out. There's no doubt that their weight has diminished in recent decades as the conventions themselves have turned from negotiating sessions into preplanned coronations for the presumptive presidential nominees. ""Politics became more personality-driven than party-driven,"" explains Joe Trippi, the veteran Democratic consultant. Trippi was a Ted Kennedy staffer in 1980, and he remembers trying to get an appeal to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment in the platform as a means of coaxing Carter's female delegates into their camp. ""We can all try to go back and date when that started happening, in the '70s or the '80s,"" Trippi says, ""but by the 2000s ... it's the persona of the candidate, not the party platform, that matters."" The decline in importance of the platform, then, has ""led to more leeway on how tough the nominee is going to be about what gets in the platform."" The platform hasn't entirely lost its luster. It can consecrate important shifts within a coalition or positions around which a previously split coalition has unified. Think, most recently, of the inclusion of support for same-sex marriage in the 2012 Democratic platform. Or the Democratic platform's move toward full acceptance of abortion rights in the 1970s versus the Republican Party's first inclusion, in 1980, of a plank in ""support of a constitutional amendment to restore protection of the right to life for unborn children."" Together, the platforms effectively codified the existence of pro-life and pro-choice parties in American politics. The Republican Party seems to fully embrace the still meaningful but not binding status of the modern platform as an opportunity to take its id for a walk and appease factional neuroses. The 2012 Republican platform, for example, contained provisions warning against creeping Sharia and bravely standing against imagined United Nations encroachment on American sovereignty. Meanwhile, the 2012 Democratic platform that Frank can't remember more or less just listed President Obama's accomplishments and incremental plans for Wall Street regulation, taxes, job creation, and fighting terrorism in the gauzy language of a press release. This time around, why not follow Republicans' lead and fling all of the primary's passions onto the page? The platform is ""there for the campaigns and the real activists within the party to look to as a means of capping off a hard-fought race,"" says John Hudak, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, ""and to talk a little bit more about what the future of the party may look like."" Since Sanders wants leave his imprint on the future of the party, it's perfectly understandable that he would have his eyes on shaping the platform. He and his surrogates have recently been dropping hints that platform changes will be central to Clinton earning his full-throated support. In an April interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell, Sanders said he would consider ""to what degree [Clinton] will adopt many of the ideas that I think are extremely popular and I think very sensible."" The New York Times has reported that Sanders would be ""aiming to lock in strong planks on issues like a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, breaking up Wall Street banks and banning natural gas 'fracking.' "" The makeup of the platform committee (and rules committee) has been one of several sources of friction between the Sanders campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Each of the three standing committees--platform, rules, and credentials--comprises 187 members. Of those, 162 are determined at state conventions and reflect voters' candidate preferences--i.e., they will tilt slightly in Clinton's favor. The remaining 25 members of each committee were nominated by the Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in January and later ratified by the DNC's executive committee. Wasserman Schultz's selections to the three committees infuriated the Sanders campaign--or, at least, gave the Sanders campaign another excuse to express its fury at Wasserman Schultz, a none-too-popular figure among Sanders supporters with whom the feeling seems mutual. In a letter to the DNC earlier this month, the campaign alleged that it had recommended to Wasserman Schultz 40 potential nominees for these committees, of which she nominated only three. On top of that, she nominated Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy as co-chair of the platform committee and Frank as co-chair of the rules committee--people whom Sanders, pretty accurately, described as ""aggressive attack surrogates"" for the Clinton campaign. Sanders urged Wasserman Schultz, who also will select the 15 members of the panel that writes the platform, to choose seven members from each campaign and one chairman jointly picked by each. ""If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result,"" Sanders warned, ""we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention."" The Washington Post reported Friday that the DNC is prepared to meet Sanders halfway on committee seatings. But the composition of the platform committee or its document's 15 writers is a sideshow to where the real action will take place: between the Sanders and Clinton campaigns, in private, ahead of time. Clinton wants to avoid an off-putting floor mess, so the two campaigns will likely work out a deal on the most contentious issues ahead of time and then instruct all the relevant committees and panels to write it all down. Though the Clinton campaign has to draw the line somewhere to assert her power over the party, one recent report--backed up by my own conversations--suggests the Clinton campaign is willing to be flexible with the platform to bring Sanders on board. ""I expect that there'll be some conciliation"" on the platform, says Frank, Sanders' nemesis. ""I don't think anybody wants to give any of Sanders' people any reason to feel offended."" Platform concessions will be especially important since Frank can't think of what there is to offer on the rules committee, which he co-chairs. Aside from his platform demands, Sanders has been making noises about eliminating or trimming the number of superdelegates--the body of free-agent delegates through whom, coincidentally, Sanders' only path to the nomination runs--and reducing the number of closed primaries and caucuses. Frank doesn't have much of a problem with these suggestions, but they're ""not decided at the convention. Those issues are decided subsequently by the DNC."" History bears this out. Democratic nominating rules are hardly immutable. But typically they're changed between presidential contests via DNC-empaneled commissions, such as the McGovern-Fraser Commission after 1968 or the Hunt Commission after 1980. If the platform is the big game at the convention, then Trippi agrees that it wouldn't make much sense for the Clinton campaign to resist Sanders' demands if they're the central obstacle to Sanders' support. ""I don't mean it in a disparaging way, but the platform gets locked in a vault somewhere"" after it's passed. ""You get a day of, 'Yeah, we won that plank to get big money out of politics' or whatever--whatever it is, I'm not belittling what they're doing--I'm just saying I can't imagine [the Clinton campaign] fighting that hard."" ""Unless it's something just untenable,"" he adds. What would be untenable for Clinton? Where would she draw the line? Her campaign isn't going to say just yet. But if you look at some of the issues Sanders has put forth, we can put them into roughly two camps: items on which they occupy the same ideological space but where Sanders is to her left (more negotiable), and items on which they have conflicting views (less negotiable). Clinton already half-supports a $15 minimum wage, so that should be an easy one to grant--and it would be a meaningful recognition, too, of the Fight for 15 activists' efforts. Though she solicits and accepts large donations, she justifies that on the grounds of not unilaterally disarming, and at least on paper she supports overturning Citizens United. A strong plank against corporate money in politics should be workable, however hypocritical it might appear in the present. Though Clinton has leveled some opportunistic attacks against Sanders' Medicare-for-all health care plan, her support for a public option or a Medicare buy-in should provide her the opening to support Medicare-for-all as an end goal in the platform. On other issues it's difficult to see how they'd reconcile their differences. One expects that Sanders would push hard for a plank to break up the big banks. That's just a policy with which Clinton disagrees. Clinton technically does not support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but no one actually believes her on that, and she--and other Democratic leaders--would flinch at any platform plank explicitly opposing all trade agreements negotiated by President Obama. Clinton does not support a blanket ban on fracking; Sanders does. How does that get written up? And how willing is Clinton to change language on something as tense as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? ""There's a chance that the Clinton campaign and supporters within the DNC will fight bitterly over the platform. ... That would be a political mistake,"" Hudak, of Brookings, says. ""If she and her campaign look at it as a set of opportunities and not something worth losing their minds over, then they're going to be in a better political position."" ""At the same time,"" he continues, ""if Sanders comes to the table with outrageous suggestions or demands and effectively wants to rewrite the platform from top to bottom in the image of his ideas, he'll also be overplaying his hand, and there'll be real pushback from a party that he has had a casual relationship with over the years."" If Clinton tries to freeze Sanders out of the platform, or if Sanders tries to hijack it entirely, the platform could go from the party's best vehicle for reconciliation to the catalyst of a nasty, nationally televised floor fight that hampers the party's ability to win in November. What's a party platform worth? It's worth what the camps responsible for writing it deem it to be. And this year, for the first time in some decades, that may be a lot.

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/_10_things_every_politician_who_endorses_donald_trump_should_be_forced_to.html	"In the two weeks since the Republican National Committee declared Donald Trump the party's presumptive presidential nominee, Republican politicians have rallied around him. They're betting, in the words of RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, that ""people just don't care"" about Trump's treatment of women or his other flaws. That's a nice way of saying that the party itself doesn't care, as long as Trump does well in the polls. But Trump's flaws aren't ordinary. He's a race-baiting, authoritarian demagogue. Anyone who supports him is saying, in essence, that race baiting, authoritarianism, and war crimes are acceptable. Trump's collaborators, like the 20th-century politicians who collaborated in segregation, internment, and McCarthyism, don't want to face the full meaning of their complicity. But they must. All of them--Priebus, Newt Gingrich, Gov. Chris Christie, and the long line of cowards and sycophants behind them--must be held to account. They must explain to the public, under scrutiny from the press, why they're willing to suspend the fundamental values of the United States. To facilitate this scrutiny, I've put together an indictment. It's a summary of Trump's record as a sectarian arsonist, a threat to the Constitution, and a war criminal in waiting. The indictment has 10 counts, each one specific to a transgression or a target group. These aren't just character flaws. They're insinuations, accusations, and threats that make Trump a menace to minorities and to the country as a whole. Here's the list. 1. Banning Muslims. Last fall, Trump issued a series of escalating statements against Muslims. He spoke of tracking them through a database and closing mosques. He claimed that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey had appeared on television celebrating 9/11, and he persisted in this libel despite his failure to produce evidence. Then, on Dec. 7, he called for a ""complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" This was not an off-the-cuff remark. It was a written statement, which Trump read aloud at a rally. Critics pointed out that such a ban would be unconstitutional and un-American, but Trump hasn't withdrawn it. He views civil liberties and human rights as expendable. 2. Sowing distrust of Christian minorities. Christie, Rudy Giuliani, and other Trump supporters dismiss the Muslim ban as an aberration. But it's just one example of Trump's ruthless use of fear. Ben Carson, for instance, is a member of the Seventh-day Adventist church, a Christian denomination. Last October, after two polls showed him surging past Trump in Iowa, Trump tried to scare evangelicals away from Carson. ""Look, I don't have to say it: I'm Presbyterian,"" Trump told a crowd. ""I'm Presbyterian. Boy, that's down the middle of the road, folks, in all fairness. I mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I don't know about. I just don't know about."" Afterward, Trump's spokeswoman said ""the remark speaks for itself."" When Trump was asked why he had brought up Carson's faith, he feigned innocence: ""I just said I don't know about it. I said nothing about it. ... I'd never say bad about any religion."" But in the video of Trump's attack, you can hear his insinuating tone and his deliberate choice of words. This was a cynical appeal to prejudice. Perhaps Sen. Orrin Hatch can explain to his constituents in Utah, many of whom belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, why he ""totally endorses"" a candidate who would target a Christian minority in this way. 3. Dog-whistling against Cuban Americans. By early December, Carson had faded. The new threat to Trump was Sen. Ted Cruz, who had passed Trump in Iowa polls. So Trump did to Cruz what he had done to Carson. At a rally in Des Moines on Dec. 12, Trump tried to drive a wedge between Cruz and conservative Christians: ""I do like Ted Cruz, but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba, in all fairness. It's true. Not a lot come out. But I like him nevertheless."" Again, the video of Trump's remarks shows his cynical intent. Trump repeated the attack at a rally in Council Bluffs on Dec. 29:"	10 Things Every Politician Who Endorses Donald Trump Should Be Forced to Defend
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/ben_sasse_and_tom_cotton_have_competing_visions_for_the_future_of_the_republican.html	"One by one, the #NeverTrump dominoes are falling. Having denounced Donald Trump in the harshest possible terms on the campaign trail, Marco Rubio now tells us he will release his delegates to Trump and that he will cheer him on in his race against Hillary Clinton. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House and conservative darling, has made his distaste for Trump plain. For weeks after it became clear that Trump would be the Republican presidential nominee, Ryan maintained that he wasn't ready to pledge his support. But now, in an op-ed in his hometown paper, Ryan says he will indeed be voting for Trump this fall. Why now? Ryan explains that he's had long conversations with Trump about the policy agenda he intends to introduce in the House, and he's concluded that as president, Trump ""would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people's lives."" In other words, Ryan wants us to believe that he's not the one who has caved--that rather, it's Trump who's had to get on board with the Ryan agenda. We'll see if Trump feels the same way. It's easy to condemn erstwhile anti-Trumpers for clamoring to find a seat on the ""Trump train,"" with its buttery leather seats and gold lame interiors. But let's acknowledge that ambitious Republicans are in a tough spot. If you're older and on your way out of elected office, you can condemn Trump all you want and ride off into the sunset with your dignity intact. If you're not ready to call it quits, however, there are a ton of questions for which you have no good answers. Say you're a young-ish Reaganite, and you dream of winning the White House some day. For years, you've devoted your public life to passing the ever-more-exacting ideological purity tests that have defined the conservative movement in recent years. And now you're utterly confused. You know that Trump's rise has upended all kinds of assumptions about what Republican primary voters actually care about. But that doesn't tell you what you can safely assume going forward. Could it be that yesterday's conservative orthodoxies are now completely irrelevant? Is there no longer any need to kowtow to Wall Street megadonors? Does opposing mass immigration now count for more than opposing same-sex marriage? Would it be a shrewd move to stop calling for entitlement reform and to start calling for minimum wage hikes? And what if Trump goes down to a humiliating defeat--does that mean old-fashioned movement conservatism will come back with a vengeance? No one knows, so it's hardly surprising that a lot of right-wingers are hedging their bets. Not everyone is hedging, to be sure. Some GOP politicians are gambling on a particular vision of the conservative future. Take Ben Sasse, the junior senator from Nebraska, who has emerged as a hero to anti-Trump Republicans. What's interesting about Sasse is that the dictates of party loyalty don't seem to bind him all that much. In an open letter he shared via Facebook last month, Sasse offered a surprisingly tart condemnation of America's two-party system. Though he offered a perfunctory pledge of allegiance to the party of Lincoln, Sasse also predicted that the Democratic and Republican parties were not long for this world: ""It might not happen fully in 2016--and I'll continue fighting to revive the GOP with ideas--but when people's needs aren't being met, they ultimately find other solutions."" Let's leave aside the many obstacles standing in the way of transitioning from our two-party duopoly to a multiparty system (a transition I'd support, for the record). What might that multiparty system look like? Picture a social-democratic party that takes its cues from Bernie Sanders, a Clintonian socially liberal party, a nationalist-populist party a la Trump, and a Sasse-esque party for mainstream conservatives. In our multiparty future, the Sasseservatives would be running against the Trumpistas. Sometimes they'd join together in coalition. But sometimes the Sasseservatives would join forces with the Clintonites or maybe even the Sandersites. If you believe this sort of political landscape might exist sooner rather than later--if you think the whole rotting edifice of two-party politics is about to fall apart--you might as well start blasting away now. And if Sasse is wrong and the future of the right belongs to Trump, well, there's no shame in having fought the good fight. But what if you believe that the two-party system is here to stay and that Trump's voters aren't going anywhere? In that case, you might want to craft a new, more nationalistic message that trades Reaganite optimism for a darker, more Trumpian tone. So far, Tom Cotton, the senator from Arkansas, is the clearest example of a Republican headed in this direction. Arkansas is in the heart of what Colin Woodard calls ""greater Appalachia,"" a region that has moved sharply to the right in the Obama era and that has proven a deep well of support for Trump. While the political influence of the white working class is rapidly declining in coastal America, it remains dominant in Arkansas and neighboring states, and Cotton has clearly taken this into account. Though no one questions Cotton's bona fides as a hard-right, anti-tax, small-government conservative--I recommend Molly Ball's revealing 2014 profile in the Atlantic--he also has a populist streak. Unlike Rubio or Ryan, he rejects the pro-immigration stance of the GOP's supply-side wing. During his brief tenure in the House, Cotton emerged as one of the fiercest critics of comprehensive immigration reform, and he's gone on to sponsor tough immigration legislation in the Senate as well. Having recognized that minimum wage hikes are wildly popular among Arkansas voters, Cotton threaded the needle carefully, backing a modest statewide hike in 2014 while opposing new federal minimum wage legislation. Other Senate conservatives have gained ""strange new respect"" from liberals by opposing dragnet surveillance and embracing criminal justice reform. Cotton has done the exact opposite, championing the National Security Agency and calling for more punitive sentencing for violent offenders. If Republicans want a harder-edged standard bearer who doesn't disguise his contempt for Beltway elites, Cotton fits the bill. Where does Cotton stand on Trump? He's played both sides of the fence. Last summer, he demanded that Trump apologize for his attack on John McCain's military record, which is really the least he could do as a fellow veteran. He also opposed Trump's call for a ban on Muslim immigrants, a somewhat harder political call given widespread support for the proposal among Republicans. In March, however, Cotton joined a delegation of congressional Republicans who met with Trump in Washington, part of the presidential candidate's effort to woo the party establishment. Cotton was the only attendee who hadn't endorsed Trump's candidacy, and his presence raised eyebrows. Around the same time, well before Trump had sewn up the nomination, Cotton defended Trump's credentials as a potential commander-in-chief and echoed some of Trump's concerns about whether the U.S. was being taken for a ride by its NATO allies, a surprising stance for a defense hawk beloved among neocons. Now that Trump is the last Republican candidate standing, Cotton is being touted as a potential running mate. Given that he's been a highly effective critic of Hillary Clinton's stance on immigration--and immigration is, after all, Trump's signature issue--he wouldn't be a bad choice at all. If the 39-year-old senator decides to run for the Republican nomination in 2020 or 2024, as many believe he will, one can easily imagine him inheriting a decent-sized chunk of the Trump vote. So which Republicans are going to look like bozos a year or two from now, when Trump will either be the man who obliterated the GOP or the one who permanently redefined its identity? I have no idea. But the Trump candidacy has provided a very useful sorting mechanism. In two years, eight years, or 20 years down the line, we'll be able to look back and see where the next generation of Republican leaders stood when Trump came calling, and we'll be able to vote accordingly.

House Speaker Paul Ryan may be withholding his endorsement, Mitt Romney and the Bush family are unlikely to ever come around, and some senators in tight races are sitting out the Cleveland convention. But the Republican Party, from its representatives in Congress to its political operatives, has otherwise fallen in line at an astonishing rate. Even the politicians Trump has insulted and demeaned--from Marco Rubio to John McCain--are, to one extent or another, supporting his candidacy. They're not lining up because Trump has become ""presidential."" Trump has steadfastly refused to develop into a more mature and policy-oriented candidate. The only consistent feature of his positions is that they keep changing: His platform remains a black hole; he resists even minimal efforts at coherence. But there is one aspect of the man that never changes and thus forms the core of what we might call ""Trumpism"": He appears to actually believe in a sort of ad hoc authoritarianism. The prominent features of this ideology include a respect for thuggish foreign leaders, an appetite for violence, a hatred of the press, and a quasi-fascist disregard for anything that can be perceived as weakness. His press conference on Tuesday, in which he raged at reporters who were (at last) asking him some tough questions, was a near perfect embodiment of his nature. Together, these two realities--the Republican surrender to Trump, and Trump's authoritarianism--portend a very disturbing future. If Trump gets elected, Republicans will almost certainly control both houses of Congress. (They currently hold the power on Capitol Hill and will likely only forfeit it if Democrats sweep in November.) If you don't think the authoritarian candidate and the ideologues in the House and Senate will make peace, you haven't been paying attention for the last month. Both sides could very easily get what they most desire in a Trump presidency. The results would be terrifying. In the rare instances when Trump does talk seriously about policy--his ""energy speech"" last week, or the release of his Supreme Court ""shortlist""--there is rarely any original thought on display. Trump's positions aren't rooted in research or firmly held beliefs. Rather, his method appears to be calling right-wing think tanks or experts and merely repeating their suggestions. Watching the energy speech was disconcerting: Here was a man mouthing right-wing talking points with an obvious lack of interest in the policies he was advocating. As one expert described the speech to the Times, ""It's a fairly standard Republican anti-regulation, pro-production vision, but with no real details and some outlandish Trumpian flourishes."" If Trump doesn't care about policy per se, what does he care about? ""A statue in Washington, D.C.,"" was the answer Trump himself gave recently. It's true that our republic has managed to retain its democratic character while erecting statues to Lincoln and Roosevelt, but Trump's remark hints at the way he would approach elected office. He wants to be a great man, which to him means a strong man. From his adoration of Vladimir Putin, to his support of the Chinese Communist Party's not-so-gentle approach to protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989, Trump has always displayed a longing for what he considers toughness. Toughness is the only consistent aspect of his political commentary dating back to the 1980s. The only other contender might be his opposition to free trade--which is itself wrapped in language about America lacking sufficient strength. So: We have a man who relishes strength and cares not for the details of policy. How is that likely to play out when he's in office? Do we imagine him standing up to a Republican Congress, arguing for the specifics of his policy prescriptions? There are none. Far more likely is that Trump will simply go along with whatever Congress wants, then bask in the glory of legislative victory. Trump's appeal is frequently described in terms of his status as an outsider or in his ability to sell himself as a negotiator. But do we really expect him to push back against Republican orthodoxy on an issue like tax policy? Paul Ryan's budget guts social spending and offers huge tax cuts. Trump himself has proposed a gargantuan tax cut. There's not exactly a lot of friction here. Trump is more likely to save his political capital to achieve his authoritarian goals, whether it's stocking the federal government with cronies or cracking down on the meddlesome media. And this is where Republican politicians and their craven appeasement of Trump come in. As they have proven over this last, depressing month, they are not concerned by Trump's authoritarian style. They are not going to challenge him for attacking the media or abusing executive power. If there is one thing the last 16 years have shown, it's that Congress doesn't mind having its power usurped, so long as the president is a member of the majority's party. The GOP establishment would have you believe they've got the problem in hand, that any attempt by Trump to act outside the norms of American democracy would be reined in by Congress. ""What protects us in this country against big mistakes being made is the structure, the Constitution, the institutions, no matter how unusual a personality may be who gets elected to office,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said recently. ""There are constraints in this country. You don't get to do anything you want to, so I'm very optimistic about America. I'm not depressed about the nature of the debate."" McConnell was letting voters know that Congress would not simply roll over and play dead in a Trump presidency. Believe him at your own peril. In late February, the Times reported that McConnell had developed unprecedented plans that would ""have lawmakers break with Mr. Trump explicitly in a general election."" Three months later, you don't hear much about such plans. The Kentucky senator himself has now endorsed Trump for president. If a Trump president is letting McConnell get his way on his pet issues, do you trust the majority leader to stand up to the strong man when he asks for appropriations for his statue? Trump may very well still lose the presidency and cause lasting, harmful damage to the Republican Party. But if he gets into office, expect to see a combination of his authoritarianism and the party's partisan agenda in action. Liberals have long fretted about the Republican Party's post-Tea Party incarnation achieving massive policy victories. More recently, that fear has been replaced by a concern over what Trump's presidency would mean for democracy. The prospect of both fears being realized in a single election is the stuff of nightmares. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign. Read more Slate coverage of Trump University."	The Terrifying Prospect of a Trump Presidency and GOP Majorities in Congress
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/no_donald_trump_is_not_good_at_nicknames.html	"A couple of weeks ago, the Democratic National Committee coined a nickname for Donald Trump: dangerous Donald. This fell somewhere short of the sublime. The alliteration was pleasing enough, but the strain showed. The DNC was trying to do to Trump what he has done throughout this campaign season: coin a devastating nickname that will stick to the competition. Trump has come up with ""low-energy Jeb,"" ""little Marco,"" ""lyin' Ted,"" and ""crooked Hillary."" More recently, he's trotted out ""goofy Elizabeth Warren,"" ""crazy Bernie Sanders,"" and the Clinton alternate ""heartless Hillary."" Nearly all of the names have indeed stuck, thanks in no small part to the media, which has giddily latched on to each new one. ""Drawing on psychological warfare tactics that Mr. Trump used to defeat 'Lyin' Ted' Cruz, 'Little Marco' Rubio and 'Low-Energy' Jeb Bush in the Republican primaries, the Trump campaign is mapping out character attacks on the Clintons,"" the New York Times recently reported. It was hardly an isolated instance; the epithets are frequently used as evidence of Trump's gift for no-holds-barred politicking. When even staid outlets such as the Times are doing Trump's work for him, deploying the nicknames in straight news articles, you know the candidate's tactics are working. But are Trump's nicknames actually clever--or have they gained currency because the media has all too eagerly bought into the idea that he has a gift for devastating insults? ""Give a man a reputation as an early riser,"" Mark Twain wrote, ""And he can sleep until noon."" I would argue that we've given Trump way too much credit. There's no question that some of his nicknames have managed to distill a competitor's essence. It may not have taken much psychological insight to identify lying as Ted Cruz's signature trait or a Madison Avenue ad man to label the lugubrious Jeb Bush ""low-energy."" But the nicknames caught on because they seemed to fit--or at least to fit with the media narrative as it already existed around the respective candidates. Other Trump nicknames, however, are neither clever nor pointed; calling the slight of stature Marco Rubio ""little"" is not exactly the work of a rapier wit. Here, Trump seems very much to have benefited from Twain's observation that reputations can be self-fulfilling: The media has decided Trump is a brilliant nicknamer; thus, his nicknames are brilliant. (""Dangerous Donald"" is just as apt as ""lyin' Ted,"" but it has little hope of sticking; no one thinks of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a world-class razzer.) Trump's other advantage is that no one else on the political stage could bestow such nicknames, because coining nicknames is an inherently childish and silly thing to do--watching people who are generally not considered ridiculous insult people with nicknames makes them, the insulters, seem childish. Rubio learned this lesson the hard way when he got down in the sandbox with Trump, managing only to sully his own reputation in the process. The absurd degree to which we've bought into the idea that Trump is some kind of nicknaming savant becomes clear when you consider the category of Trump monikers that fail even to live up to the ""little Marco"" standard. Love her or hate her, is there really anything ""goofy"" about Elizabeth Warren? ""Crazy Bernie Sanders"" is neither witty nor apt; surely there is something more biting to be mined from the political life of the self-proclaimed democratic socialist than ""crazy."" (""Bolshevik Bernie"" might have eluded Trump's command of world history.) Recently, Trump trotted out ""heartless Hillary"" in front of the National Rifle Association because, he claimed, she wants to ""heartlessly"" take people's guns. The nickname made little sense, but that didn't stop the press from talking it up. When media outlets didn't write news stories focused on the nickname itself--which several did--they still used it in the headline. It's the media that has allowed Trump's nicknames to become a story, rather than the ridiculous gimmick that they are. ""Trump has a knack for coining just the right moniker, the perfectly dismissive and catchy thing,"" the Times' Mark Leibovich wrote recently in an item (""Donald Trump Shares His Opponent-Branding Secrets"") that may have set out to mock the candidate but ended up lavishing him with praise for the ""tabloid-ready directness"" of his nicknames. ""I feel it, it's an instinct,"" Trump bragged. ""Not everyone can do this,"" Leibovich observed. That much is true. Give Trump credit for taking the media's fawning coverage of his ""branding"" abilities and running with it. Reporters, whom Trump has called ""dishonest""; ""disgusting""; ""slime""; ""scum""; and, on Tuesday, ""sleaze,"" might consider covering his knack for name-calling with a touch more skepticism.

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/how_to_read_a_poll.html	"Early general-election polls have been released, and liberals are freaking out. Donald Trump is almost dead even with Hillary Clinton in the RealClearPolitics average of national surveys, upending assumptions that the race wouldn't be close. Some Democrats are denouncing the polls as skewed. Others are sinking into panic or fatalism. Relax. These surveys don't forecast who's going to win the election. They tell you how the public feels right now. They show you how different kinds of people are thinking about various questions--how conservative Democrats feel about Clinton, for example, and which qualities women ascribe to Trump. Most important, these polls illustrate how the race might shift, depending on what you and other people do. Here's a guide to reading them. 1. Don't whine about party composition. There's been a lot of bitching on the left about the high percentage of Republicans included in some polls--notably, a Fox News survey taken May 14-17, in which Trump led Clinton 45 percent to 42 percent. In the 2012 election, 38 percent of the people who voted were Democrats; only 32 percent were Republicans. But in the Fox poll, 41 percent of respondents were Republicans; 40 percent were Democrats. That's typical Fox bias, right? Wrong. Read the poll's methodology statement: ""The Fox News Poll is not weighted by political party."" That means the poll aims for a random sample, but if more Republicans than Democrats answer the survey (or vice versa), Fox doesn't tweak its numbers to even things out. (Fox says it does sometime adjust its numbers for imbalances in ""age and race,"" which can boost one party's numbers--generally, Democrats.) So if the Fox poll shows a higher percentage of Republicans in May than it did in April--which it does--there's a chance that the shift has to do with something going on in the electorate, such as rising interest among Republicans. You'd be a fool to close your eyes to that. If you don't trust the Fox poll, look at the nearly simultaneous CBS News/New York Times survey. The Times methodology statement says its ""sample was adjusted to reflect the percentage of the population residing in mostly Democratic counties [and] mostly Republican counties."" Sure enough, Clinton wins that poll, 47 percent to 41 percent. But if you dig up the detailed tables--not available at nytimes.com or cbsnews.com but posted by the CBS News political team at Scribd--you'll find something that the Times didn't report or include in its data sheet. Question 9 of the poll asked: ""Compared to past presidential elections, how would you describe your level of enthusiasm about voting in the 2016 presidential election this year--are you more enthusiastic than usual, less enthusiastic, or about the same as usual?"" Republicans were evenly split: 36 percent more enthusiastic, 36 percent less. But Democrats were more likely to say their enthusiasm was down (39 percent) than up (30 percent). That's a warning. When the Times ""adjusts"" its sample based on ""the percentage of the population residing in mostly Democratic counties,"" it's betting that a partisan enthusiasm gap, such as the one detected in its own survey, won't significantly change the balance of turnout between Republican and Democratic counties. That ""adjustment"" is prognostication disguised as polling. Unweighted surveys avoid that kind of prognostication. This makes them unreliable as election predictors, since they blow in the winds of enthusiasm, which can favor Republicans one month and Democrats the next. But for the same reason, these polls are good at capturing the mood of the moment and at showing how shifts in enthusiasm would affect the election. So instead of whining about the Fox poll, look up the poll's trend data and check out the correlation between party composition and outcome. Trump has led Clinton in this poll four times: Oct. 10-12, 2015; Nov. 16-19, 2015; Jan. 4-7, 2016; and in May. In each of these samples, Republicans outnumbered Democrats. Every time Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the poll--10 samples in all--Clinton led Trump. The lesson is clear: Solve your enthusiasm problem, get Democrats to the polls, and you win. 2. Notice who's been sampled. Don't just look at the number of people polled. Look at who they are. Are they adults, registered voters, or likely voters? A poll of likely voters tells you what might happen if the current distribution of enthusiasm and mobilization doesn't change. A poll of registered voters tells you what might happen if the current electorate turns out. A poll of adults tells you what could happen if the electorate changes, through registration, and shows up to vote. Consider the ABC News/Washington Post survey taken May 16-19. The poll shows Trump leading Clinton 46 percent to 44 percent. Those are the numbers reported on RealClearPolitics. But if you examine the data tables, you'll find that Clinton leads Trump 48 percent to 42 percent among all adults. Register the unregistered, turn them out, and you win. On the Post's website, you can see how the election changes if unregistered people register. President Obama's job approval rating goes from negative to positive. Clinton's net favorable rating, which is even with Trump's among currently registered voters, surges to a 14-point advantage. 3. Look at trends within each poll. Instead of bickering over whose methodology is better, focus on gaps within the same sample, or on changes within the same poll over time. This kind of analysis cancels out methodological differences. The pattern across the four recent media polls--ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox--is that Trump has gained ground. In the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Clinton leads Trump by 3 percentage points, but that's a 10-point drop for her since March. In the ABC/Post poll, her margin over Trump is down 12 points even in the general population. Scan the Journal's full data dump, and you'll see what has changed. Since March, the percentage of Democratic primary voters who said they'd be dissatisfied with Clinton as their nominee has risen from 22 percent to 28 percent. Meanwhile, the percentage of Republican primary voters who said they'd be dissatisfied with Trump as their nominee has fallen from 46 percent to 28 percent. A 24-point gap has vanished. 4. Study favorable ratings. Often, a candidate's net favorable rating--the percentage of people who view her positively, minus the percentage who view her negatively--is a leading indicator of how she'll do in the election. In the Clinton-Trump race, these numbers tell three different stories. The first story is that while both candidates have bad ratings, Clinton's are better than Trump's. The second story is that Trump has been gaining on Clinton. In the CBS/Times survey, Trump's net favorable rating has improved by 9 percentage points among independents and by 22 points among Republicans. Meanwhile, Clinton's net rating hasn't budged among Democrats and has fallen by 7 points among independents. But if you step back and look at long-term data, there's a third story, and it's more encouraging for Clinton. She has been a national political figure for about 25 years. In the CBS/Times poll, her unfavorable rating, which currently stands at 52 percent, has almost never been this high. It has usually been in the 20s or 30s, with a temporary surge into the low 40s during her previous presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008. Trump's unfavorable rating, by contrast, has never fallen below 46 percent in that poll. Likewise, while only 34 percent of voters rate Clinton favorably in the NBC/Journal poll, her score on that question has historically stayed above 40 percent, except for a dip in March 2008 and then again in this election. In the ABC/Post poll, Clinton's favorable rating has been this low only once before, when she was battling Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination in April 2008. By June 2008, her favorable rating had climbed 10 points. The NBC/Journal poll shows a similar bounce during that period. So there's a case to be made, based on the record, that this is Clinton's worst moment and that her numbers might recover. 5. Consider candidate attributes. In the ABC/Post poll, Trump narrowly leads Clinton on one issue (""Who do you trust more to handle taxes?"") and one attribute (""Who do you think would do more to bring needed change to Washington?""). On every other issue or attribute on which one candidate beats the other, respondents prefer Clinton. That includes trade, immigration, terrorism, an international crisis, and ethics in government. Respondents say Clinton has better experience, ""better understands the problems of people like you,"" ""better represents your own personal values,"" ""has more realistic policy proposals,"" ""would do more to make the country safer and more secure,"" and ""would do more to advance the economic interests"" of the middle class and working class. The CBS/Times poll finds similar results among registered voters. These, too, are often indicators of how people will vote. 6. Consult the national mood. Sixty-five percent of Americans say the country is on the wrong track; only 27 percent say it's going in the right direction. These numbers have been terrible for more than a decade, under presidents and Congresses of both parties. So which party gets the blame? In the NBC/Journal poll, the Democratic Party's net favorable rating is negative by 3 percentage points. The Republican Party's rating is negative by 25 points. The poll also asked: ""Putting aside for a moment the question of who each party's nominee might be, what is your preference for the outcome of this year's presidential election--that a Democrat be elected president or that a Republican be elected president?"" Voters chose a Democrat, 47 percent to 43 percent. Obama's approval rating is another index of the national mood. In the CBS/Times poll, he's at 50 percent positive and 43 percent negative. That's the first time he has reached 50 percent in that survey in more than three years. In the NBC/Journal poll, his rating stands at 51 percent approval and 46 percent disapproval, up from an 8-point deficit (43 percent approval, 51 percent disapproval) in December. It's possible that some of these numbers, which are unusually good for Democrats in the context of the past few years, will revert to a less favorable norm. But if there's a reversion to the norm in the next five months, it's just as plausible that what bounces back will be Clinton's favorable rating rather than the GOP's. 7. Find the breakdowns. Most news organizations that sponsor polls don't routinely show you how particular groups--Republicans, Latinos, seniors, or less educated people, for example--answered each question. Sometimes one sponsor doesn't show you the breakdowns, but another sponsor does. (Sometimes one doesn't even give you the data--you have to fish around for the tables behind a paywall somewhere else.) The ABC/Post poll is exemplary. ABC News gives you a detailed analysis with a full sheet of tables. If you're a reporter, the ABC News polling team offers further breakdowns on request. The Post's website also allows readers to mine the data demographically. In this case, the data show that men, by a margin of 27 percentage points, think Trump is a stronger leader than Clinton. Women, by almost the same margin, think the opposite. Men are almost evenly split on which candidate they would trust to handle an international crisis. Women trust Clinton more in that situation, by a ratio of more than 2 to 1. In the Fox poll, men say by a 19-point margin that Clinton isn't a strong leader. Women, by a 16-point margin, say she is. So buck up, you nail-biters. Change your undies, take a breath, and learn to read polls for the internal data, not the headlines. Even when the numbers are discouraging, they're often empowering. They tell you what has shifted, how that's affecting the election, and what changes would alter the outcome. Maybe you'll learn to stop arguing with Trump supporters on Twitter  and instead spend your time registering voters in Arizona. You can thank the pollsters later. Even Fox.

19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/asian_american_whitewashing_on_tv_could_be_just_the_start_will_the_u_s_soon.html	"Over at ye olde New York Times, Slate alumna Amanda Hess has a new article on the insane difficulties Asian Americans face in trying to score leading roles in film and television. Constance Wu, star of the hit ABC sitcom Fresh Off the Boat, has been particularly vocal about the lack of Asian American representation. So has Aziz Ansari, who addressed the issue in a vivid and heartfelt way in his Netflix series Master of None and in a Times op-ed that appeared last fall. There is a case to be made that Wu and Ansari's complaints are self-refuting. Both are very successful, and we're talking about the dearth of Asian Americans on TV and movie screens at least in part because Asian Americans like Wu and Ansari now have really big platforms. Given that there are far more Asian Americans in media today than in the past, it's not crazy to believe that we will see more of them in prominent roles in the years to come. The march of progress is inevitable, yada yada yada. But I have a somewhat different and darker thought: What if Asian Americans are underrepresented in media because non-Asians have yet to reconcile themselves to Asian overrepresentation in the uppermost echelons of U.S. society? Don't see that many Asian Americans as CEOs or in other leadership roles? Just give it time. Whether you look in Silicon Valley, Wall Street, elite academia, or America's burgeoning medical-industrial complex, you'll find a disproportionately large and fast-growing number of Asian Americans. Earlier generations of Asians often found themselves stymied by the so-called ""bamboo ceiling,"" which largely reflects the fact that new arrivals in America tend not to have the social connections they need to reach the highest rungs of the organizational ladder. That is not generally the case for their children, who tend to have been raised by middle- and upper-middle-income parents in above-average school districts. While the share of children living with two parents is 65 percent for the U.S. as a whole, it is 83 percent for Asian Americans. These advantages are already starting to pay off for Asian Americans in schools and in the workplace, and it would honestly be shocking if America's future elite didn't include a large number of Asian faces. Are you sure everyone's going to be excited about that? I don't think so. In the Times, Hess observes that while 5.4 percent of the U.S. population is of Asian descent, more than half of media properties have no Asians in named or speaking roles. To be fair, the size of the Asian American population is dwarfed by that of America's Hispanic population, and I dare say that Hispanic underrepresentation is just as bad, if not worse, than Asian American underrepresentation--given that there are now far more Americans of Hispanic descent than there are black Americans. So what is distinctive about Asian American underrepresentation? I'd venture that it seems galling to many Asian Americans because they tend to live in relatively prosperous communities with relatively large Asian populations. Moreover, Asian Americans are massively overrepresented on elite college campuses, which feed into sitcom writers' rooms and Hollywood production houses. But the media powers-that-be are driven by profit, and while American viewers embraced the idea of a black president long before we actually elected one, they don't appear to be clamoring for more Asian American actors in leading roles. Consider the ""whitewashing"" of Asian characters in films like The Martian, in which a Korean-American character named Mindy Park was portrayed by Mackenzie Davis, a blonde Canadian who is, um, not of Korean origin. When I saw the movie, I was a little cranky about the casting choice myself. Recently, sociologists Pyong Gap Min and Sou Hyun Jang found that 60 percent of Asian immigrant men with bachelor degrees had been STEM majors--as opposed to 28 percent of native-born white men. Among native-born Asian American men, the share fell to a still-pretty-high 40 percent. The gap between Asian immigrant women and native-born white women is even bigger: The former are three times as likely to have been STEM majors as the latter, and the pattern persists with native-born Asian American women. Even without those numbers handy, if you've spent time among science and engineering students in America over the past decade or two, you'll know that NASA wouldn't be able to get astronauts on Mars without relying on way more Asians than were depicted in The Martian. I mean, way, way more Asians. Hollywood is in the business of selling appealing fantasies. The producers of The Martian realized, consciously or otherwise, that it was far more appealing to have Chiwetel Ejiofor (an Englishman of Nigerian ancestry), Donald Glover (a black American), and Jeff Daniels (a white Midwesterner) playing space-age supergeniuses than, say, a Taiwanese-American bro, a half-Korean nerd, and a winsome Indian immigrant with a really thick accent. Would The Martian have done just as well at the box office in this parallel, more-Asian universe? Maybe, but I kind of doubt it. Asian Americans have often been characterized as ""the new Jews."" The basic idea is that just as striving Jewish immigrants gave rise to ambitious and highly successful second- and third-generation cohorts, we're seeing a similar pattern among the members of several, though certainly not all, Asian American groups. I've always found this comparison annoying as it massively oversimplifies the complexities of both the Jewish and Asian American communities. But I believe it is useful to note the rise of Jewish Americans in American public life has been accompanied by anti-Semitism. It strikes me as very plausible that the rise of Asian Americans will be accompanied by anti-Asianism. Long before Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, her best-selling paean to hardcore Asian parenting, Yale Law School professor Amy Chua wrote an equally provocative book called World on Fire. Chua's basic argument is that economic liberalization can contribute to the concentration of wealth in the hands of privileged ""market-dominant minorities,"" which in turn can inflame the members of less-affluent groups. We're all familiar with the baleful consequences of racism against poor, marginalized minorities. But racism against prosperous minorities can be pretty ugly, too. The experience of Chinese minorities in Malaysia and Indonesia is instructive. In both countries, Chinese communities have historically enjoyed higher levels of income and wealth than their indigenous neighbors, and this has periodically led to periods of extreme interethnic tension and even race riots, like the anti-Chinese pogroms that broke out in Indonesia in 1998. Both countries have put in place legislation designed to curb the advancement of people of Chinese origin, which in turn has driven large numbers of Chinese Malaysians and Indonesians to seek greener pastures in countries like Australia, Canada, and the U.S. Is America immune to these forces? Or might our future look like Malaysia or Indonesia's, with a multiracial working class that is highly suspicious of a disproportionately Asian elite? The Jewish experience gives us at least some cause for optimism. While anti-Semitism still exists in the modern U.S., it is a far weaker force than it has been in other societies throughout history. In our race-obsessed society, however, Jews are by and large identified as whites. Asian Americans are not. They constitute, in a very literal sense, a ""visible"" minority. And as such, the visibility of Asian Americans is a double-edged sword. By all means, let's have more shows like Fresh Off the Boat. I'd love to see John Cho, an excellent actor, starring in literally every movie. But let's also realize what's going on beneath the surface. Though Asian American privilege is not a lighting-rod issue today, I suspect it will become one in the very near future."	Will the United States Soon Succumb to Anti-Asian Prejudice?

But largely because, faced with the specter of a hateful orange man suffering from personality disorders that should have been disqualifying being elected president, the war between the Bernie people and Hillary people always felt like a luxury I couldn't afford. It's not that I don't care which of them is the Democratic nominee. It's just that I care far more about staving off the apocalypse. Also, my response to the very existence of Donald Trump as a serious contender for the presidency has been one of anger. I am angry almost always. Pouring more kerosene on the anger strikes me as pointless. That said, I have been taken up short by the number of comments and scoldings I have faced, from close friends and casual acquaintances alike, for voicing even a hint of support for one or the other in recent months. The tone hasn't merely been dismissive and furious; the message beneath has almost universally been that I am a moron. The 2016 campaign has been focused on rage. Donald Trump's cunning redirection of his supporters' economic and racial fury into electoral support has been well-documented. But the fury on the progressive end of the spectrum has been harder to pin down. Some of us on the left seem to be suffering from many of the same symptoms we deride in Trump supporters: outrage with the political process; over-identification with our anger and under-identification with our commonalities; and a pervasive sense that anyone who doesn't agree with us suffers from debilitating false consciousness. I'm not a psychologist and can't speak to the outrage. But I think a lot about how we speak to one another, and I worry that my progressive friends and I are falling victim to some habits and ideas that have made it virtually impossible for the left and right to even engage--much less debate--serious issues anymore in this country. I see them in myself in alarming new ways when I find myself digging in on Bernie vs. Hillary. I wonder if now is the time to talk about it out loud. Right now, some of the following hideous behaviors have become a reflexive part of my political conversations. It's a partial list, but it's a start: 1.      ""Hillary, c'est moi."" I have spent my whole career being a woman. Things that bothered me 10 years ago may still bother me, but they don't enrage me. But something about the persistent vicious sexism in the attacks on Hillary Clinton this year has reignited my umbrage in ways I'd almost forgotten. I have been the only woman on a panel full of men at most events for over a decade. Only this year, it infuriates me. Casual slurs and trivial comments mostly roll off my back. But the more I feel that Clinton's story is my story, the more I think of each of these episodes as the hill I chose to die on. There is no doubt in my mind that sexism is at work in this campaign and that Donald Trump is the most misogynistic potential leader in decades. But I am finding that wearing my gender goggles exclusively in this campaign leads me to default to behaviors that stop discourse in its tracks. I dismiss anything said by men as ""mansplaining"" and sigh, like a reality show participant, ""You couldn't understand, you're not a woman."" The fact that sexism taints this election in ways I have never encountered doesn't mean it's being directed at me--and it doesn't diminish the need for me to engage. When we over-identify with the grievances of our candidates, everything starts to sound like a personal insult. 2.      ""The system sucks!"" The election system in this country is cumbersome and confusing and unfair. This has been true for a long time. It's easy to turn substance arguments (""Bernie isn't getting a fair shake"") into process arguments. (""The whole system is rigged--against me!"") Of course the system is terrible, but that is no more about Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump than it is about cheese or the infield-fly rule. The system sucks because we don't fix it. It doesn't suck in order to persecute each of us personally. 3.     ""The media is broken!"" It really is. It's terrible, and shallow, and most days I am just embarrassed for the profession. But we also demand and devour it, and many of us on the left have fallen into the trap we decry on the right--consuming hours and hours of like-minded media, dismissing everything that doesn't correspond to our pre-existing views as propaganda or the establishment or outright lies. When a conservative legal activist once told me ""every word printed in the New York Times is a lie,"" I remember thinking that there should be medication for that kind of thinking. More and more I hear friends on the left saying the same things about publications on the left, and I find myself wondering whether we are doomed to exist in ever-shrinking media bubbles predicated on the notion that everyone who reads or produces anything else is part of the conspiracy. It certainly remains possible that people with whom we don't agree aren't stupid or brainwashed. But the fact that someone reads or consumes different media from me doesn't make them victims of some tragic conspiracy. 4.      ""My values matter more than your values."" I keep hearing people say that the most important issue in this election is women, or regulating Wall Street, or national security, or money in politics. All true, all legitimate. But more and more I find I am told to put aside the issues I think are important so that someone else's values can be realized. That is crazy. And counterproductive. We need to be able to fight for our own values, even if we have weirdly over-identified with them (see above), and we need to respect that others don't order their policy values in the same ways. Telling other folks to just put gender aside or put campaign finance reform aside and believe what you do is a bit like telling them to put their gallbladder aside: It's not an argument so much as an order not to believe what you believe. I will confess that I am not as sanguine as I once was about Democrats and Republicans healing the rifts that have emerged in this primary and rowing together to defeat Trump. Insults have been flung, wounds have been reopened, and everyone feels that his or her truth has been called into question. I know I do. But some of these tics and habits that poison and polarize ideological discourse generally are creeping into the ways we talk and think. If we are treating our friends and allies like we treat our enemies, we are not really a movement so much as a collective of grievances. This may be a good moment to try to think our way through it--not only to defeat the Lethal Orange Narcissist, but in service of the values this country was founded on: the obligation to listen, the right to disagree, and the ability to move on.

This is a thought that never occurred to them, and they appreciate everyone instructing them on this basic concept of political messaging. They get it. But that doesn't mean they've figured it out. They have to decide what role Donald Trump is going to play in the story they write about him, much as the Obama campaign in 2012 had to decide what Mitt Romney was going to be--or much as Trump has already decided what Hillary is going to be (""Crooked Hillary""). There was a debate early in the 2012 Obama campaign about whether to depict Romney as a conviction-free, flip-flopping opportunist or an evil plutocrat feasting on the bone marrow of the proletariat. They went the C. Montgomery Burns path and synced all of their tactics accordingly. It won them another four years. (And who supposedly helped them settle on rich monster over flip-flopper? Bill Clinton.) Just because the Clinton people know they have to tell a story about Donald Trump, though, doesn't mean such a story easily presents itself. There are so many options they don't know where to begin. Romney could be cut pretty easily into the two archetypes of opportunist or plutocrat. With Trump, you have: opportunist, plutocrat, racist demagogue, sexist pig, business fraud, narcissist, clown who is completely unfit for the presidency both in terms of knowledge and temperament, and asshole. Which should the Clinton campaign go with? The Washington Post on Wednesday came out with the big reveal about the Clinton campaign's plan.

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/why_won_t_obama_call_the_men_he_keeps_killing_radical_islamic_terrorists.html	"President Obama has failed America again. He has killed another radical Islamic terrorist while refusing to call him a radical Islamic terrorist. Obama doesn't understand the war we're in. As Sen. Ted Cruz, one of our nation's bravest lawyers, has repeatedly pointed out, the president refuses to ""utter the words radical Islamic terrorism."" In January, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus noted that Hillary Clinton ""has refused to call radical Islamic terror by its real name."" In a speech last month, Donald Trump--a steadfast supporter of veterans who served while he was playing squash (except those who were captured) complained: ""We're in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won't even name the enemy! Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees."" A detailed Slate investigation finds that these Republicans are correct. Obama has stubbornly distinguished refugees from enemy combatants. And in more than seven years of killing radical Islamic terrorists, he has consistently refused to call them radical Islamic terrorists. Under Obama, according to the New America Foundation, the United States government has conducted 355 drone strikes in Pakistan. That's more than seven times as many as were conducted under George W. Bush. Obama has authorized more than 140 strikes in Yemen, a country Bush hardly touched, and another 17 strikes in Somalia. We've launched more than 12,000 airstrikes against ISIS. The total number of enemy fighters killed on Obama's watch, depending on how you count them, is probably around 30,000. Some Republicans say Obama has been too quick on the trigger. Others say he's been too cautious. But they agree on one thing: When it comes to calling our enemies names before blowing them up with Hellfire missiles, he's soft. In March, the Pentagon announced that U.S. forces had killed the ISIS ministers of war and finance. Obama, in remarks on these killings, failed to denounce ISIS as Islamic. In April, speaking at the CIA, he delivered a longer progress report:"	Why Won't Obama Call the Men He Keeps Killing Radical Islamic Terrorists?
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/bernie_is_building_an_army_of_democratic_primary_challengers.html	"Tim Canova is not Dave Brat. Sure, Canova, who's waging a primary challenge against Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida's 23rd congressional district, is an underdog from the academic world taking on an entrenched opponent who raises obscene sums of cash for her party, just as Brat was in his 2014 challenge against then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. And yes, in both cases, it's that very fundraising ability that made Wasserman Schultz and Cantor powerful within their own party structures but also targets for their party bases, who have viewed them as subservient to their respective donor classes. The difference is that Canova, unlike Brat, is a fundraising powerhouse himself--and that was even true before Sen. Bernie Sanders, in an aggro move for someone trying to become leader of the Democratic Party, endorsed Canova's bid to topple the current chair of the Democratic National Committee. Whereas Brat's challenge to Cantor slipped under the radar, Canova's bid against Wasserman Schultz is now assured to be one of the most closely watched primary contests of the cycle. If there is to be a concrete Sanders legacy, it will be measured by the ability of those whom we'll uncleverly dub ""Bernie Democrats"" to mimic his campaign model against members of the Democratic establishment--but win. No pressure, Tim. And Canova is a Bernie Democrat right out of central casting. When news first broke over the weekend that Sanders was endorsing him, it may have seemed like a spite play against Wasserman Schultz, who Sanders has attacked over a litany of perceived botched calls this cycle. But Canova is more than just the random name Sanders found while Googling to see if there was a vehicle through which to troll Wasserman Schultz. The two have a professional history: Canova advised Sanders on Federal Reserve reform as part of a 2011 panel organized by the senator. Canova, a law professor at Florida's Nova Southeastern University, positions criticism of monetary policy higher than your average politician, and he lines up similarly well with Sanders on trade, campaign finance, and Wall Street regulation. And like Sanders, Canova already has collected significant sums in his bid against a cash magnet. He raised more than $550,000 during the first quarter of the year, and by early May, his campaign announced it had surpassed the $1 million mark. This is a significant amount of money for a House challenger: Brat only raised about $200,000 for his 2014 primary bid against Cantor, who infamously spent nearly that much at steakhouses alone. Since Sanders' weekend endorsement--i.e., over the course of the past day--the Canova campaign has pulled in another $290,000, with $225,000 coming directly from an endorsement email distributed by the Sanders campaign. And that's from a message that only urged a $2.70 donation split between the Sanders and Canova campaigns. There's a lot more to be collected by the August 30 primary. Florida's 23rd District contest is just one of many that Sanders, and his much-in-demand email list, will be turning their attention toward. ""In the days ahead,"" the campaign's fundraising pitch for Canova read, ""we're going to add a dozen or more additional candidates to that list."" The fundraising model of broad-based small donations Sanders has mastered, and the credibility he's built up among his supporters, can be weaponized to turn a House primary into a contest overnight. All Bernie has to do is point. Regardless of wherever else Sanders chooses to endorse this cycle, a Canova upset in Florida would be the marquee win, proving instantly that the Sanders model can do something more than sink large sums of money into ultimately doomed causes. The question will then become this: Could a congressional-level Bernie movement really change the Democratic Party in a way that the Tea Party--for better or worse--changed the Republicans, shifting the party further toward its ideological pole and creating constant fear among incumbents? Among the arguments for why Wasserman Schultz may deserve to be primaried, the claim that she is somehow responsible for costing Sanders the Democratic nomination is the least persuasive. Though it's not incorrect to say that she, like most leaders in the Democratic Party, would prefer Clinton be the nominee instead of Sanders, and that the party's original debate schedule was skewed to protect Clinton, the main reason Sanders will end up losing the nomination is that more voters prefer Hillary Clinton. This is what makes Sanders' arguments about how the process is ""rigged"" against him so dangerous if he keeps saying that, and using it as a justification to make a mess at the convention, once voting concludes in June. Instead, it's Wasserman Schultz's brand of politics that makes her so worthy of a challenge from the base. Any sitting officeholder who chairs such as vast fundraising apparatus as the Democratic National Committee is going to be the receptacle for impure donations. But dear God, if she hasn't performed some unseemly donor maintenance. She, along with much of the Florida delegation, has co-sponsored a bill to block proposed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules reining in payday lenders, an awful industry that has donated her tens of thousands of dollars. She voted last year for another measure to block CFPB enforcement of regulatory guidance that would crack down on auto dealers discriminating by race. The auto dealers' lobby is no joke. About the only issue on which she is willing to go against her donors' wishes is medical marijuana, the legalization of which she is weirdly opposed to. It's hard to determine what sort of chance Canova has, since Wasserman Schultz has never before faced a Democratic primary challenger. But it's probably not going to be easy. Wasserman Schultz's reliably blue district has a high percentage of Hispanic and older voters who don't express the sort of hostility toward the Democratic establishment you might find on a college campus. Sanders' support will bring Canova all the money he needs. Still, he's working on a terrain that went 68 to 31 percent in Clinton's favor in the March presidential primary. But if Canova, with all the exposure that Sanders provides him, can turn enough heads and pull off the upset, the panic felt among sitting Democratic lawmakers will reach Brat-defeats-Cantor levels. Though it would come after the end of the Sanders presidential campaign, it would mark the real beginning of the campaign to change the Democratic Party.

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/how_trump_could_win.html	"At this moment, polls show a strong upswing for Donald Trump's campaign. He's made real ground on Hillary Clinton, closing the gap between them by consolidating the Republican Party behind his candidacy. Clinton, meanwhile, is fighting a contentious primary, which keeps her from doing the same. There's still a strong case to make that Donald Trump is a long shot for the White House--that he's too unpopular with too many Americans outside the Republican Party and that if the Obama coalition holds, he loses. At least, that's what I think. But humility is a virtue, and life is volatile, even if elections often aren't. That Trump is a poor bet for November doesn't mean he couldn't win. He could. Which raises an obvious question: How would it happen? And finding an answer here isn't too difficult. You just need to reverse-engineer the conditions of a Trump loss. What are those conditions? At the top of the list is demographics. Trump is deeply unpopular with black and Latino voters, as well as with women and young people. But Clinton is also unpopular, albeit by a smaller magnitude. Given two unpopular candidates, it's possible that ""popularity"" just won't matter as much, that voters will take both candidates' worst qualities as a given and move on. In which case, both Clinton and Trump become generic nominees. And what are the prospects this year for a generic Republican nominee? Of five separate econometric models of the election, four predict a Republican win ranging from 50.9 percent of the vote to 55 percent of the two-party vote. The economy is middling, President Obama well-liked but not hugely popular, and Clinton would be a third term for Democrats. Given two generic candidates under those criteria, the presidency would go to the Republican. Say hello to President Trump. Let's say you don't trust the models (they couldn't predict Trump, after all). Then what? How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? The answer is easy: He wins and turns out white voters in historic numbers. Assume higher nonwhite support for the Democrat--let's say a three-point bump among blacks and a seven-point bump among Hispanics, giving Clinton 97 percent and 80 percent support, respectively--and Trump needs 66 percent of whites to win both the popular and electoral-college vote, if turnout doesn't change. (You can play with the numbers over at RealClearPolitics.) It's an extraordinary reach: an increase of nearly six points over the white share in 2012, matching Ronald Reagan's performance in 1984. It would mean Trump persuaded millions of Democrats to switch teams, despite their wide approval for President Obama. In other words, it's not happening. Partisanship has a tight hold on American voting behavior, and it's hard to imagine how Trump could break it, barring a national catastrophe. Easier to imagine is higher white turnout. If Trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to its 2008 levels--74 percent--then he could win with another couple percentage points among whites, even with the high black and Latino turnout of 2008. This would give him teetering Democratic states such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as the three largest swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. It's a heavy lift, especially for a candidate who says he will eschew data-gathering and other quantitative methods for finding and mobilizing supporters. But it's possible. OK, OK. ""Possible"" doesn't mean ""likely,"" and it's hard to imagine a disorganized campaign exceeding Team Romney's ability to pinpoint and bring Republican-leaning white voters to the polls. Still, with a smile from Fortuna (or whichever god of chance you prefer), Trump can win. If anything guarantees defeat for an incumbent party, it's a recession. At the opening of the 1960 election, in early spring of that year, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were neck and neck. This continued into the summer and the early fall. But by October, Kennedy had opened a small but persistent lead. He won. It's hard to isolate a single cause for Kennedy's victory, but he was almost certainly helped along by the modest recession that struck in the spring and lasted until the following winter. If not for that downturn, there's a fair chance Nixon would have become president. A sudden slowdown could have the same effect on our election. In fact, the very presence of Trump--his proximity to the most powerful office in the world--could destabilize markets and make a downturn more likely. And consider this: On average, the United States sees a recession every five years. We're due. One is all we need for President Trump. A terrorist attack could do it--driving voters into the arms of the authoritarian in the race--but the literature is mixed on how terrorism affects voters. It could make them more attuned to perceived outsiders--and immigrants in particular--giving Trump an advantage. It could push them toward hawkish candidates with traditional credentials, helping Clinton. Or given the candidates, it could be a wash. So let's table this one. There's one last thing that could deliver the White House to Trump: a divided Democratic Party. Party unity is a prerequisite for national competition. It's why the ""Never Trump"" movement fell apart after Ted Cruz left the race; a serious effort to derail the Republican nominee would guarantee a Democratic White House, because it's almost impossible to overcome the asymmetry. In the still unlikely event that the present acrimony between Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party becomes an outright split, Democrats risk throwing the election to Trump, through in-fighting and division. If Sanders runs as a third-party candidate, the game is over, and Democrats lose. You see this in the most recent polling. Clinton's biggest weakness in the NBC News survey of registered voters is with Sanders' backers who haven't crossed the threshold to Team Clinton. If this persists, it's dangerous. If history is any indication, however, it won't be. With all this said, even the most probable scenario here--that Trump and Clinton become generic candidates--is a distant long shot. They're just too well-known for voters to treat them as interchangeable with any Republican or any Democrat. And their personal qualities mix with the fundamentals of this election--partisanship, demographics, and economic performance--to create favorable terrain for Democrats. That's the comforting irony of this whole exercise: Even when you try to show how Trump can win, you emphasize his uphill climb to victory. Still: It could happen.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/andrew_sullivan_thinks_donald_trump_may_defeat_hillary_clinton.html	"In New York magazine's May 2 cover story, Andrew Sullivan writes that ""when a democracy has ripened"" to a maximally free state, as described by Plato, ""a would-be tyrant will often seize his moment."" That moment, Sullivan argues, may be upon America. Jacob Weisberg interviewed Andrew Sullivan about his article on an episode of the Slate Trumpcast. To listen to that podcast, click the player below: A lightly edited transcript of that conversation follows. Jacob Weisberg: This was a fantastic piece. I think it's one of the most important things written about the phenomenon of Trump. But the really striking thing about it is that you see Trump not just as a dangerous politician or as a demagogue, but a threat to the survival of American democracy. Andrew Sullivan: I do think that his general attitude, his general understanding of how to exercise power, is inimical to the American idea. The American idea is that power should be dispersed and that there should be no king. And yet he himself seems incapable of believing he could ever have any such a position except that of a monarch of some sort. He has no real understanding of a non-zero-sum engagement. And so the idea of sharing power, or being checked by other branches of government, or even checked by the press seems anathema to him. And I think when you have someone with that kind of temperament walking into our constitutional system, you are kind of setting yourself up for a constitutional crisis. If there's a founding idea of America, it's that monarchy is unacceptable. You and I hear in everything Donald Trump says that he is the would-be dictator. That those are his instincts. Why do so many of his supporters not hear that monarchical tone in his speech? Well, I think some of them do and like it. And some of them just don't take him seriously. There's something that I've noticed in people who support him is just that they will say they support him, but then they say, ""Well, I don't really think he's going to be able to do all those things he says."" And there is a sense also that he himself by completely reversing himself within minutes on what might appear to be solid platform planks also kind of adds a sort of element of unseriousness to his policy proposals. But I think both are compatible in a way. The vagueness about policy is simply because he's not interested in policy. What he's interested in is power. And I think it was [Trump campaign chairman] Paul Manafort who said, he'll deal with policy after he gets elected, but we're not going to debate that before. So he's really, really interested in the wielding of his own power. And that's not the American way. It's not a democratic way of being. It's an anti-democratic notion of being. And I think there's also an element in the culture in which Washington is viewed as entirely broken. And therefore they want to blow it up and use this guy to blow it up. And then to do whatever he wants. And so I think that at the root of this is a very un-American desire to abolish self-government. To say, OK, we live in such a divided, fractured, polarized society, we can't really solve our own problems through our traditional constitutional processes. We'll elect this tyrant and he will just do it somehow. When you use these terms like un-American, undemocratic, neo-fascist, you're really picking up on something that is new with Trump in modern American politics, which is violence and the threat of violence as part of the campaign. Talk about how Trump has brought violence into American politics in a way that isn't precedented. We've had plenty of rowdy and difficult public meetings in the history of American politics. Goodness knows, extraordinary levels. And in modern times, too. But the one thing you've also always had when a protester stands up, or a heckler tries to shut something down, the speaker, whoever he or she is, and whatever office they're running for, will generally say something like this: I respect your views. This is a free country. You can air this. But please, allow me to respond. And if they don't respond, or if they start being cantankerous, they say, Well look, we're going to ask security to come and take you away. And that is what we have as a civil democratic norm. And what he says in contrast is, Look at this person. What a disgusting person this is. I would like--and I'm directly quoting--to punch that person in the face. I want that person to be carried out on a stretcher as in the old days. I want violence inflicted upon people who are protesting or heckling me. That is an extraordinarily new thing in American politics. It's anathema to a tradition of civil discourse. But what it says in the end is that whatever differences we have, in the end they will be resolved by force. Not by persuasion. And that is a core violation of a basic democratic norm. And that's the basis of our civilization. So there's an old-fashioned kind of mob rule, which is these rallies that turn violent and where he encourages the violent. But there's a new kind of mob rule, which is this digital social media mob rule. And then the people who dare speak up or out about him are then deluged with staggering amounts of invective and vile and hatred. I think of someone like [journalist] Julia Ioffe. I must say that one of the things that's interested me both in Julia's case, and in some other conservative cases, is the rank anti-Semitism that's also out there now. Which, of course, you would understand from this kind of movement. But that is also the forefront of most of the attacks. This is mob rule of an extraordinarily esoteric variety, but it definitely chills free speech. It chills the criticism of our public officials. And thereby deeply weakens our democracy. I have to say, my jaw dropped when I saw the headline on Breitbart calling Bill Kristol a ""renegade Jew."" I mean, I don't think Trump is himself an anti-Semite, but he's sure bringing it out of the woodwork. Oh yeah. But again, we shouldn't miss that the anti-Muslim rhetoric is in a different border. Again, we talk about America, it seems to me as an immigrant to America that essential part of America, the reason it was founded in some ways was religious liberty at its very origins. That you come here, you can worship whichever god you want, or none. And that this is a country that won't judge you or have any laws or any restrictions upon that fundamental liberty. And yet his fundamental campaign promise is to deny anyone of a particular faith entrance to the United States. That's an abolition of America. Similarly with torture. For a long time, it was a complete bedrock principle of the West that we do not subject human beings to torture of any kind. Now, this has been obviously breached and was fatally breached under the Bush administration. Breached, but never acknowledged. No, never fully acknowledged. But I think, you know, the senate report is pretty damning in this respect. But the difference here is that having opened that door a crack, Trump has just broken the door open entirely by saying not as Cheney would, that we're not torturing in any way, that if we are torturing, we're doing it because we have no other way to get intelligence. Trump says, We should torture. Torture is great. And the point is torture is to terrify and intimidate our enemies. In other words, his view of torture is exactly that of ISIS. It is a demonstrative performative act of cruelty. And I think that's the element in him that's truly disturbing is that his hatred for the weak, his contempt for anybody who isn't as strong as he is, or as he imagines himself to be. I find it inimical to my entire moral worldview. It seems to me the one thing you can judge a person by is how he or she treats someone with less power than him or her. And it's quite clear that he believes in punching down in a way that really reflects his massive insecurity. He doesn't believe there is any up to punch. No, of course. No, he doesn't. But nonetheless, the people he does punch tend to be vulnerable to him. You argue that this is happening now not just because there's this vile monster, Donald Trump. You actually call him a monster. I thought it was a well-chosen term. But because American democracy has become more susceptible to it. And the reason it has become more susceptible to someone like this is because it's been getting more democratic. Can you explain what you're talking about, about America getting too democratic? I think there was always a concern among the founders that what they wanted to construct in America was not a pure, direct democracy, which they understood would be subject to the whims and passions and fads of the popular majority at any one particular moment. Now this may not be a very popular thing to say today, but it does seem to me important that there be some place for the will of the mob, for the will of the pure democratic majority to be restrained, to be channeled into more productive and less dangerous forms. And what's happened through the democratization of media, through the collapse of elites in terms of the political parties, and through the further democratization of the Senate, and now actually having Supreme Court literally put up for election, in which the Republicans are currently saying even the Supreme Court should be subject to democratic rule really by the parties. This is not what the founders intended. And so the safeguards that we used to have against an individual like this have been weakened or removed, so that if we could imagine him winning, and I think to be honest with you, I think he's more likely to win at this point than Clinton. Really? Yes. I mean, I can't prove that. That's my instinct at this point, because he owns the narrative. But were he to win, I think obviously he'd bring the House with him, probably the Senate, and then would have the Supreme Court. So there'd be nothing to stand between him and the people. And that's a very dangerous position, especially when this individual is proposing a trade war with our biggest trade partners. He is proposing a reign of terror in the Middle East, at least demonstratively to smash, or destroy, or to cut the head off, whatever metaphors he uses, ISIS. But I don't think he would sit back and pursue the current strategy. These are extraordinarily radical changes against which we would have almost no defense. There was a response to your piece from our old friend Michael Lind I saw in the New York Times. And he said, ""Well, America is not becoming more democratic. In fact, if you're an ordinary person in America, you feel our process getting less democratic, and that you have less and less power over outcomes, and less and less sense that you have any control, which is the explanation of Trump."" Well, yes, but I think that is true in one way, in the sense that the globalization that we're experiencing, which really has occurred since the end of the Cold War. The fact that we did actually go through the democratic processes and pass NAFTA, for example. That has had a huge effect on the American economy in a way that America itself as a nation can't fully control. And I think those of us who were very much for NAFTA need to be more cognizant that its political and cultural and social impact has been much graver than we thought it might have been, or would be. But that's not the same thing as having no ability to influence your political agenda, the world you live in. And as I try and point out, in general what's been powering this election, what empowered the last two elections, is small-D democracy in the sense that Obama won twice through small donations against existing elite power structures. Bernie Sanders, who rails constantly about how big money prevents democracy taking place, has had an extraordinary run in the primaries and has built a huge online and physical army of supporters, again, without big money, without a super PAC. And you see the people who represent elites as much not doing at all well, staggering under the onslaught of these popular currents. So, yes, I can understand why some feel powerless in the wake of technological and trading change, but I don't think it is proven that that can't be addressed within our current system. In fact, I think it's been addressed more potently than I remember in a very long time. You said we should stop beating up on the Republicans that were trying to stop Trump. It was maybe still possible to stop Trump when you wrote your piece. Leave us with some hope here. What's the scenario? You've left me very depressed. I've been so depressed. I've been barely able to get out of bed. Here's what I'm trying to believe. I would have hope, to be honest with you, if the alternative was not Hillary Clinton. And I'm not saying this as a Hillary hater, although I am one. But you have no qualms about supporting her under the circumstances. And the Republicans have been--one of the things that surprised me a little bit is there are a lot of prominent Republicans who agree with just about everything you've said and have said it in terms nearly as strong, and they still stop short of saying they're going to vote for Hillary Clinton. They say they're not going to vote, or they're not sure what they're going to do, or they're going to look for an alternative that doesn't exist. What's wrong with Hillary Clinton? She's not the end of the world if the alternative is Donald Trump. She's not. And that's why I have no qualms in supporting her if that's what it is. That's what it is. Well, we don't know yet if a third party, if a third option is available. I know that some people are seriously trying to figure that out. The fact that there's no space between me and Bill Kristol on this is somewhat sobering. But nonetheless, I do think that the only way she could win is by splitting the non-Democratic vote. And if they can do it, and I think it's their patriotic duty to try. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Andrew Sullivan: Trump Could Win

Which is a problem. Because he can't. Hillary Clinton holds 1,768 pledged delegates--allocated through primaries and caucuses--to Sanders' 1,494. To overcome that deficit, Sanders would have to win 67 percent of all remaining delegates, including massive wins in Clinton-friendly states such as California and New Jersey. Barring an extraordinary shift, this won't happen. It's not a live possibility. And yet Sanders is trying to get around these facts by arguing, in effect, that the will of his voters counts for more than the majority. In doing so, he isn't just fighting till the last vote for a worthy cause--he's deriding and disregarding the votes of the party's most loyal backers, voters who are key to any progressive project, now and in the future. But the Sanders campaign doesn't seem to care. ""While Mr. Sanders says he does not want Mr. Trump to win in November, his advisers and allies say he is willing to do some harm to Mrs. Clinton in the shorter term if it means he can capture a majority of the 475 pledged delegates at stake in California and arrive at the Philadelphia convention with maximum political power,"" reports the New York Times on the campaign's newest strategy--a scorched-earth run to the finish. The reaction from mainstream Democrats, and even from a few Sanders supporters, has been decidedly negative. On the other end, Sanders' defenders say this is no different from what Clinton herself did in the 2008 primary, when she continued until the summer, as anti-Barack Obama anger and vitriol simmered in her camp. It's true there are real parallels and similarities. But there are real distinctions, too, that make Sanders' actions different in kind. Let's compare Sanders' actions with Clinton's at this point in 2008. Like Clinton, Sanders has adopted an almost intransigent tone, even echoing elements of her old rhetoric. ""I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on,"" said Clinton in early May of that year, citing an Associated Press story that ""found how Senator Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me."" A few days later, she would crush Obama in the West Virginia primary. After Sanders won that same primary, he made a similar argument, saying that he is the only candidate who can win working-class voters, in contrast to a Democratic Party that has allowed a ""right-wing extremist Republican Party to capture the votes of the majority of working people in this country."" But this description of the electorate is true only if you omit blacks, Latinos, and Asians. Factor them into the population of ""working people,"" and Democrats win that group, handily. If it were just this rhetoric, Sanders staying in wouldn't be an issue. Things get heated at the end of a presidential primary, but there's no reason the losing candidate should bail before the end. That said, there are key differences between 2008 and now. Then, Clinton promised to run only to the last primary, to give every Democrat a chance to vote (and at that point, when it was clear Obama had the pledged delegates and superdelegates to win, she conceded). Now, Sanders vows to take this fight to the convention, even if--it seems--he's still behind in pledged delegates. ""There are a lot of people out there who say Bernie Sanders should drop out, the people of California should not have the right to determine who the next president will be,"" he said to supporters in California on Tuesday night, celebrating his win in the Oregon Democratic primary. He added: ""We are in this until the last ballot is counted ... and then we're going to take that fight to Philadelphia."" Sanders isn't just planning a run to the convention--he's also hoping to flip enough superdelegates from the Clinton camp to erase the difference in pledged delegates, giving him the nomination. It's a fair strategy (given the rules), but a curious one, given the extent to which Team Sanders has blasted superdelegates as unfair--another way the Democratic National Committee has rigged the primary. Democratic leaders say they're worried, and it's easy to see why. In the past month, Sanders has switched gears, from a policy critique of Clinton to a process argument against the Democratic Party. The argument? That any outcome short of full deference to his campaign is evidence of corruption and betrayal. ""The Democratic Party has a choice,"" he said in a statement, issued after a near riotous confrontation between Sanders and Clinton supporters in Nevada, where the former accused the latter of rigging the process for their candidate. ""It can open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change ... or the party can choose to maintain its status quo structure, remain dependent on big-money campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy."" Clinton took a terrible turn in the last weeks of the 2008 campaign, where she cited the possibility of Obama being assassinated as one reason to stay in the race. But this is different. Less crass and more destructive. Even at her worst, Clinton never wavered from Democratic unity. And after she conceded the race, she urged her supporters and delegates to back Obama. Sanders, on the other hand, has offered a stark analysis to his voters. If Clinton, the winner of the Democratic primary, bends the knee, Sanders says the party is salvageable. If she doesn't, it's not. In the meantime, he'll show no care or concern in his rhetoric or attacks, a fact emphasized by the degree to which a vocal minority of his backers believe the entire process has been rigged against them, with Clinton as the illegitimate winner of an unfair contest. It drove the fracas in Nevada, and if Sanders plans to strafe Clinton ahead of California, it could drive tension elsewhere, all the way to the convention. There is a case that all of this is proper, that if Sanders wants to change the Democratic Party--and bring independent voters into the tent--he has to attack the nominating process and the institutional Democratic Party. It's a bad case. To start, the risk of a destructive drive to the convention--a divided party against Donald Trump--doesn't remotely justify the gains of a more open nominating process. Even if it did, it's worth looking at the grievances on display. Sanders believes he was harmed by the debate schedule. But that's hard to gauge. Would a handful of additional debates have won him more votes in states like South Carolina and Florida, where he had core demographic weaknesses? And the fact that additional debates didn't improve his performance in demographically similar states throws water on the argument. Sanders' most expansive argument is against ""closed primaries,"" which have entered his stump speech as a fundamentally unfair part of the process. But closed primaries weren't created in response to Sanders--they are a long-standing feature. Critically, they are far from the least democratic part of the process. That goes to caucuses, which by their design preclude the vast majority of a given electorate from participating. If closed primaries are undemocratic for keeping out registered independents, then caucuses are undemocratic for keeping out everyone. Yet Sanders hasn't railed against them. And why would he? They've delivered his largest victory margins and have fueled his campaign. All of this might be different if Sanders held any democratic legitimacy--a majority of the popular vote or a pledged delegate lead. But he has neither. Thirteen million people have voted for Clinton to be the Democratic Party's nominee versus 10 million for Sanders. If he were, somehow, to persuade superdelegates--i.e., elected officials and longtime party activists--to abandon Clinton, he would have negated those voters and their choice, after six months of arguing that the party must respect his supporters. A cynical observer might say that Sanders isn't angry with the lack of democracy as much as he's angry at losing. In any case, it's more than a bad look for his effort--it's ugly. When he derides most Democratic primary voters as everything wrong with a party of ""limited participation and limited energy,"" when he looks for ways to nullify Clinton's popular vote and pledged delegate majority, when he touts his support among working-class whites and dismisses (predominantly black) Southern Democrats and their votes, Sanders is attacking the coalition that elected Barack Obama--the coalition that arguably made his progressive movement possible--whether he realizes it or not. This coalition is predominantly nonwhite, centered in black and Latino communities, and it's the reason Clinton stands as the likely nominee. These voters have enabled liberals to, for the first time, craft a national coalition that doesn't have to shy from questions of racial justice and gender equality, or--like the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton--acquiesce in the face of white backlash, subsuming nonwhite concerns to the anxieties of white voters. And critically, these voters are among those Americans with the most to lose if Sanders decides that his shot at the nomination--or at changing debate and primary rules--is more important than keeping Donald Trump from the White House. And all of this is counterproductive to his stated goal of pulling the Democratic Party to the left. If Sanders is going to have any influence--if the Sanders coalition is indeed the Democratic coalition of the future--then his supporters need to see the party as a viable vehicle for their interests, a place where they can win victories and move the needle in their direction, which isn't possible if they view the entire political system as irreversibly flawed. Sanders should fight until the last vote, and he should use his influence to put his stamp on what Democrats do in the fall. But this scorched-earth campaign is foolish. It helps neither him nor his message. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."	Bernie. Don't Do This.
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/donald_trump_leads_in_one_new_poll_panicking_yet_you_should_be.html	"On Wednesday afternoon, Fox News released a new national poll showing Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton, 45 to 42 percent, a 10-point swing since the previous Fox survey a month ago. The poll sparked a discussion on social media, which included the usual caveats: It's just one poll (true); Trump is almost certainly not leading Clinton by three points (also true: the pollster.com average has her up three points); professional Democrats enjoy freaking out (undeniably true); and we still have months of campaigning (sadly true). Trump got a bump for essentially wrapping up the Republican nomination; Clinton, meanwhile, is still battling Bernie Sanders, even if her eventual triumph--and a subsequent boost in the polls--is inevitable. And check out those crosstabs. So, then, what can a single poll tell us in a long election cycle that itself has become an unpredictable freak show? Nothing--but it can serve as a much-needed reminder that this election is closer than it has any right to be. And the proper response to that fact--to Trump's almost incomprehensible rise from birther-conspiracist celebrity half-wit to presumptive nominee sitting within striking distance of a former secretary of state--is fear. A bigoted know-nothing could truly be our next president. To argue that Americans should be anything less than terrified is itself irresponsible. The typical response to such hyperventilating is to tell the person doing so to take a deep breath. In the context of the election, this usually takes the form of one of two arguments. Trump isn't so scary, the first argument goes. Isn't he just an actor and buffoon rather than a dangerous demagogue? Put aside the issue of how we should feel about someone who doesn't believe racist and Islamophobic rhetoric but uses it for political expediency. (How confident are you that such a person would not do absolutely anything if it became politically expedient?) Everyone who has been paying more than limited attention to the presidential race is aware by now that Trump's personality is not a put-on. He is a misogynist. He has genuine affection for autocracy and brute force. He is pettily invested in going after perceived enemies, in the press or in business. It once seemed possible that Trump was a moderate businessman pretending to be a nasty right-winger. No longer. The second response is to say that Trump will probably not win, because of all the factors that my colleague Jamelle Bouie has laid out. So, fine: For the sake of conversation, let's grant Trump only a 20 percent chance of defeating Clinton in November. This is the reason we should be freaking out! Imagine if I told you that there was a 1-in-5 possibility that something awful would happen to your spouse or your child by November. Would you spend the next six months merrily repeating that there was an 80 percent chance your loved one would be fine? Of course not. Americans should consider the possibility of a Trump presidency similarly. Trump has gotten as far as he has after running a campaign most notable for its complete lack of policy substance and a media strategy that consists of pathological lying. He has exposed giant chunks of the press corps as craven and pathetic. He has shown that 45 percent of the voting public, give or take, is willing to elect someone who has spent the past year campaigning openly as a crass bigot who hates the women he's not having sex with (and he probably hates them, too). He has proved that running as a white nationalist is not an immediate disqualifier for the presidency of the United States in 20-freaking-16. Politicians have always run ""against"" institutions or people, whether they are insurance companies or government bureaucrats. But never in modern history has someone gotten this far in political life by running an entire campaign based on grievance and rage, and against society's less fortunate. The controversy that broke out over the pro-Sanders hashtag #BernieOrBust earlier this week was another manifestation of the underestimation of Trump's unique threat to democracy. Whatever you think about Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, there are quite clearly millions of people in this country (many of them very progressive) who have not wrestled with who Donald Trump is and what he represents. (Even scarier is the fact that so many Americans have wrestled with Trump to some degree, and find him palatable enough.) It's certainly possible that if the election is close in October, the country will witness a belated freak-out, followed by a huge Democratic turnout wave. But it would also be nice not to wager our future on people becoming appropriately serious only as the clock ticks down. The next six months could be a hinge time in the country's history. I say this without exaggeration. The world is already beset by the rise of a new authoritarianism everywhere from South Asia to Western Europe. To say that people should panic does not mean they should cease to be rational or thinking or active. It means they should be scared, and cognizant of the moment, because it is an absolutely frightening one. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Donald Trump Leads in One New Poll.
