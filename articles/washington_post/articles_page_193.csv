Sabrina de Sousa told The Associated Press on Friday she may file an appeal in Portugal's Constitutional Court. De Sousa said in emailed comments to the AP that an appeal is ""possible"" but she is ""not sure"" she will go ahead with it. She said she needs to undergo surgery but did not elaborate. The rendition program, under which terror suspects were kidnapped and transferred to centers where they were interrogated and tortured, was part of the anti-terrorism strategy of the U.S. administration following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. President Barack Obama ended the program years later. De Sousa was among 26 Americans convicted for the abduction of Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, in Milan in 2003. She insists she wasn't involved in the abduction. She has argued that she was never officially informed of the Italian court conviction and couldn't use confidential U.S. government information to defend herself. The Portuguese Supreme Court earlier this week rejected de Sousa's latest appeal against extradition. Its ruling, obtained by the AP, came after De Sousa's Lisbon lawyer Manuel de Magalhaes e Silva lodged an appeal based on a letter from Italian authorities saying De Sousa would not be granted a new trial nor given the right to appeal her conviction when she arrived in Italy. A lower Lisbon court had allowed her extradition to Italy on those conditions. Since her arrest in the Portuguese capital Lisbon on a European arrest warrant a year ago, De Sousa's lawyer has filed several appeals against her extradition. De Sousa, who was born in India and holds both U.S. and Portuguese passports, has said that she had been living in Portugal and intended to settle there. She was on her way to visit her elderly mother in India with a roundtrip ticket when she was detained. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Saahil Sud, a 27-year-old Boston resident, says he's concerned the newly formed company would have the clout to substantially raise fees on players. If the companies also merge their game platforms that could also limit how many contests high volume players like Sud can enter. The companies have assured players they won't be making major changes at least through the next NFL season while the deal is being finalized. They've also promised to keep fees ""competitive."" Meanwhile Dustin Hecker, a Boston lawyer who's been following the industry, suggests the merger isn't any guarantee the companies remain viable in the long run. He notes that both companies remain unprofitable, still face legal uncertainty and will largely be operating as separate entities in the short term. ___ 11:40 a.m. DraftKings and FanDuel's executives say the last year of battling with regulators across the country for their industry's survival helped bring about the merger of the once bitter daily fantasy sports rivals. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins, who will take over as chief executive of the combined company, told The Associated Press Friday following the merger announcement that the costly legal war showed how much of a ""common vision"" and ""common goal"" the two companies shared. FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles, who will serve as board chairman, also played down concerns about the merger possibly running afoul of federal antitrust laws. He says the merger will help competition in the relatively new industry, which is an offshoot of traditional, season-long fantasy sports. Eccles says a combined company will help better push for regulatory clarity around the games, which have been likened to illegal sports betting. ___ 9:33 a.m. Daily fantasy sports rivals DraftKings and FanDuel have agreed to merge after months of speculation and increasing regulatory scrutiny. The two companies made the announcement Friday but didn't release financial terms. The deal isn't expected to be finalized until later in 2017 and still requires federal approval. Industry experts say the merger will likely raise anti-trust concerns with regulators since the companies control nearly 90 percent of the market. Company officials say the merger will help cut costs as the two fight to remain legal in states across the country. Daily fantasy sports competitions are online games in which players pick teams of real life athletes and vie for prizes based on how those athletes perform in actual games. But state regulators have questioned whether the competitions amount to illegal sports betting. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Jan Versewyveld)  Of course Alex Esola had been familiar with ""A View From the Bridge"" long before he was cast in the role of Marco, an Italian immigrant who moves in with his cousin's fracturing Brooklyn family in the 1950s. The Arthur Miller classic is a mainstay of the American stage. But everything changed for Esola when, thanks to a friend scoring $20 day-of tickets, he caught the Broadway production of director Ivo van Hove's stripped-down version during its four-month run a year ago. ""It was one of the most unbelievable and incredible things I've ever seen put on a stage in front of my eyes,"" Esola says. ""At the end I just kind of sat there in my seat for a little while and was just immobile, I was so amazed at what I had seen."" After a run in Los Angeles with an entirely different cast that includes Esola as Marco, Van Hove's Tony-winning production has arrived at the Kennedy Center for a limited engagement that begins Friday. Breaking away from previous productions of the drama, this version has no set, save for a single large cube that rises at the beginning to reveal the actors. There are no costumes. The two actors playing immigrants do not use Italian accents, and the Brooklynites also speak accent-less English. Van Hove ""really took away all the excess, anything that you could possibly hide behind as an actor, or a production could mask itself with,"" Esola says. ""What's left is Arthur Miller's play and a group of people who are uninhibited by props or fancy costumes or a big, complicated set, and all they have is each other and Arthur Miller's words to tell this story. As a result, it's very effective, because it is just this very primitive version of storytelling."" Because Esola had been so moved by the show when he saw it on Broadway, he felt a special kind of pressure after winning the role for the L.A. and D.C. runs. ""I was thinking about the feeling that I got as an audience member seeing it and just thinking, 'Wait a second -- it's my job now to give other people that feeling. How am I going to do this?'"" he says. The minimalist nature of the show helped him overcome his anxiety. ""It was a lesson I learned in trusting myself and trusting everybody else"" in the cast, he says. ""You just have to be there. Just breathe, and live out these lives for the two hours."" Kennedy Center, 2700 F St. NW; through Dec. 3, $45-$149. More things to do in D.C. this weekend: The National Portrait Gallery mounts its first show dedicated to video art with 'Bill Viola: The Moving Portrait' My Morning Jacket's Jim James got political on his new album. Thanks to Trump, he's only getting started."

As the president-elect holes up in his skyscraper, Obama is giving Trump policy advice, style tips and gentle nudges to let the fervor of the campaign give way to the sobriety of the Oval Office. And as Obama completes his last world tour, he's been thrust into the unexpected role of Trump translator to anxious U.S. allies. Standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, Obama said Trump would quickly see that a president's responsibilities can't be treated casually and that diverse countries can only be governed by ""listening and reaching out.""  ""It is my hope that that is what will happen,"" Obama said. ""And I'm going to do everything I can over the next two months to help assure that that happens."" Though the outgoing president made clear his profound disdain for Trump throughout the campaign, perhaps no one is better positioned than Obama to get him up to speed in a matter of weeks. It's unclear, though, how much help Trump wants or will accept from Obama. And no one expects that the executive tutoring will substantially change Trump's vast differences with Obama, who he called the worst president in U.S. history. After meeting with Trump following the election, Obama resolved to spend more time helping prepare Trump than he might under different circumstances -- say, if Hillary Clinton had been elected, aides said. Trump, to the surprise of many, seemed game. He said he wanted Obama's ""counsel"" and looked forward to ""many, many"" more meetings. In the run-up to the election, the White House had planned only perfunctory, refresher-style briefings for Clinton, who is no stranger to the White House and whose transition team had prepared extensively for an expected takeover. Soon after Trump's victory, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough directed that his preparatory materials be thickened and his intelligence briefings expanded to include more basic information, according to U.S. officials, who weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. Obama and his closest advisers were irritated when it leaked out that Trump, during his White House visit, had displayed a lack of thorough knowledge about key issues while Trump's aides appeared unfamiliar with the process of staffing up a White House, officials said. They were concerned if Trump felt insulted or aggrieved, he might pull the plug on accepting Obama's advice and help. After all, Obama's aides had been pleasantly surprised when Trump, after their Oval Office chat, had agreed to preserve key elements of the ""Obamacare"" health law, which he'd pledged during the campaign to repeal. If Trump has felt patronized by Obama, so far he hasn't shown it. Asked why Trump's meeting this week with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was closed to the press, senior transition adviser Kellyanne Conway pointed out that Obama was traveling overseas.  ""We are very deferential and respectful of the fact that we already have a president of the United States, Barack Obama,"" Conway told reporters. ""President Obama is still in office for the next two months, and we won't be making diplomatic agreements today."" Though Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have spoken by phone to more than 30 heads of state since the election, Trump hasn't been heard from publically, save for one television interview and occasional tweets. From his suite in Trump Tower, he and top aides have been interviewing candidates for the 4,000-odd roles they must fill. Unsure how Trump as president may shake up foreign relations, world leaders have turned to Obama for information about what to expect. Traveling this week to Greece, Germany and Peru, Obama has tried to reassure U.S. partners that Trump, in their Oval Office meeting, expressed a ""full commitment"" to NATO.  ""I am encouraged by the president-elect's insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change,"" Obama said in Germany. During the campaign, Trump said the U.S. didn't ""really need NATO in its current form,"" calling it obsolete and threatening not to defend NATO allies unless they pay more into the alliance. Though Trump has since softened those comments, he hasn't offered the explicit reassurances in public that Obama said he offered in private. But Obama said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that transitioning from candidate to president-in-waiting would force Trump to focus and get serious about ""gaining the trust even of those who didn't support him.""  ""That has to reflect itself not only in the things he says, but also how he fills out his administration,"" Obama said. ""And my hope is that that's something he is thinking about."" ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Republicans manged to make that chamber an 18-18 tie, but since the president of the state Senate is a Democrat (Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman), the tie goes to Democrats.  When it comes to control of state government, Republicans dominated at record levels during the Obama years. On Tuesday, they somehow managed to become even more dominant. In part because Americans like a check and balance on their president, in part because Republicans played their cards right, Republicans grabbed more of America's statehouses and governor's mansions during the Obama administration than at any time in the modern era. And they held onto those majorities Tuesday.  Results are still trickling in, but it looks like Republicans will still control an all-time high 69 of 99 state legislative chambers. They'll hold at least 33 governorships, tying a 94-year-old record. That means that come 2017, they'll have total control of government in at least 25 states, and partial control in 20 states. According to population calculations by the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, that translates to roughly 80 percent of the population living in a state either all or partially controlled by Republicans.           Things are just as good for the GOP at the federal level, where Republicans have reached the trifecta. They just won the White House, they've kept their majorities in Congress and they have a chance to reshape the Supreme Court to a  strong conservative ideological leaning. Democrats, meanwhile, will go into 2017 without any significant gains in Congress and with total control of just five states. (Republicans managed to tie Connecticut's state Senate, but a tie breaks for Democrats thanks to the state's Democratic lieutenant governor presiding over the chamber. So technically the state stays in Democratic control.)       Election Day was largely a stalemate between the parties at the state level, but Republicans only needed to pick up one or two chambers and governors' mansions to make history. And they did, despite our predictions otherwise. Republicans flipped at least three new state legislative chambers, including taking control of the last state legislative chamber in the South, the Kentucky statehouse.   [Democrats are now basically extinct in the South]   In Wisconsin, Republicans will have their largest state legislative majority since the 1970s, and in North Carolina, Republicans held onto their super-majority in the legislature. Democrats had their own successes: They flipped the New Mexico and Alaska statehouses from red to blue and managed to retake both of Nevada's chambers. They expanded their majorities in chambers in California, Washington and New York. And they are on the verge of knocking off a Republican governor in North Carolina -- one of the hardest feats to pull off in politics. In two other states that Donald Trump won big (Montana and West Virginia), they held onto the governorship. But Democrats' success came in isolated pockets. When you look at the post-2016 map, the story is still one of absolute Republican dominance. And it means Democrats' surge to power in 2006 and 2008 has been completely decimated. My colleague Philip Bump visualized this another way --trendlines plummeting downward for Democrats at all levels of governance:     Democrats are still soul searching for what went wrong on Tuesday. But there are a few reasons that help explain Republicans' steady march to dominance over the past eight years. The simplest one is President Obama. American voters like a check and balance, says state legislative handicapper Louis Jacobson, so it's not unusual to see the party locked out of the White House pick up seats in Congress and state government. This was particularly pronounced during the Obama years -- more than 900 Democratic state legislators were defeated. One of the reasons it was so pronounced was that Republicans poured money and attention into state legislative races at the exact right time to multiply their gains. Fueled by millionaire Art Pope, they invested $30 million into winning state legislature battles, particularly states where the legislature was up for grabs and that legislature had a say in redistricting. The effort paid off. After the 2010 Census, Republicans got to draw the electoral maps for state and congressional seats in about three times as many states as Democrats did. And in 2012, Republicans took over the House of Representatives with a historic 234-201 majority -- despite the fact Democratic House candidates got 1.4 million more votes than Republican candidate. Then there's the fact that Democrats and Republicans increasingly live in separate communities. As I wrote in July, political geographic sorting is harmful for their efforts to control Congress. [The urban shift is] bad news for Democrats trying to use Donald Trump's unpopularity to chip away at or even erase Republicans' historic majority in the House of Representatives. Because Democrats are clustered in one area of the state, they have less of a say in who represents congressional (and state-level) districts in the rest of the state. The sheer fact Republicans control the White House will probably help Democrats climb out of this hole, but it could take awhile. In the 2018 midterms, they'll be defending at least five U.S. Senate seats in red states. Compound that with the fact that right now Democrats are a leaderless and directionless party, and it's safe to say Republicans could hold onto their record control of America for years. (New electoral-map drawing begins in 2020, so Democrats don't have a lot of time to catch up.) Before Tuesday, Republicans controlled so much of America's state governments that we -- and other smart people -- predicted they were going to lose least some of their grip, simply because Democrats were so far down they had nowhere to go but up. Like most of our predictions about the 2016 election, we were wrong. Republicans are still the dominant party in America and likely will be for some time.

Now, a chess board used in the ""Match of the Century"" is slated to be auctioned off in New York City on Friday, in a memorabilia sale timed to coincide with the FIDE World Chess Championship, which began in the city this past Friday. Fischer and Spassky used the board in games 7 through 21 at the world championship in Reykjavik, Iceland. It replaced a stone board -- likely substituted because of Fischer's unpredictable and demanding demeanor -- that had been used in the earlier games and now resides in the National Museum of Iceland. Heritage Auctions has set an opening bid of $75,000 for the board, now owned by an unidentified New York collector. Chris Ivy, Heritage's director of sports auctions, said the Spassky-Fischer match remains revered both for the level of play, and the geopolitical climate of the time. After World War II, the Soviets had dominated the world championships, regarding their success as evidence of the superiority of the socialist system. Fischer portrayed the match as nothing less than ""the free world against the lying, cheating, hypocritical Russians. ... They always suggest that the world's leaders should fight it out hand to hand. And that is the kind of thing we are doing ... over the board."" The match made Fischer the first American chess champion, and a national hero. His win came the same year that the Soviets beat the U.S. men's basketball team for an Olympic gold medal. Fischer died in 2008 in Iceland, where he went to live in 2005 when offered citizenship. He had been on the run from U.S. authorities since a 1992 rematch with Spassky in Yugoslavia violated economic sanctions against Slobodan Milosevic's Serbian government. When Fischer made anti-American statements after the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington, the U.S. revoked his passport and unsuccessfully sought his return. The chess board, which both players signed in black marker after the legendary match, is on view at Heritage's New York offices. It is being offered with the table and two matching chairs that the players used during the match. Also in the sale is a set of 1959-1960 Bobby Fischer handwritten U.S. Chess Championship score sheets. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Clinton was ahead with 48 percent to Trump's 42 percent in a survey by the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Clinton's margin in the state had been as high as 15 percent in previous CNU tracking polls, but her six-point margin held up in the final week.  A swing state that had gone blue in the last two presidential elections, Virginia had seemed so safely in Clinton's column that both sides pulled TV ads from the state back in the summer.   [Full details of the poll]  But Republicans have seen reason to hope in the home stretch, as polls tightened and Clinton made a six-figure ad buy in the state. Trump and his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, shoehorned Virginia rallies into last weekend, with Trump appearing after midnight in Loudoun County. Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, plans rallies Monday in Northern Virginia and Richmond, where he once presided as a popular mayor and governor. In a last-minute addition, Vice President Biden has been added to line up at the Northern Virginia rally, at George Mason University.   [Republicans dare to hope: Did Virginia get her swing back?]  The CNU poll shows a gap in party loyalty. Clinton enjoys the support of 92 percent of Democrats while Trump has the backing of 82 percent of Republicans. Third-party voters have declined steadily, with Libertarian Gary Johnson now at a low of 3 percent from a starting point of 15 percent in September.  [Trump and Pence to visit Virginia, a purple state long seen as safe for Clinton]  ""Any electoral victory has to begin with fundamentally solid party support,"" said Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center. ""Clinton has that going into Election Day, and Trump continues to struggle with it."" Clinton has strength with women and millennials. Women favor Clinton by 16 points, 53-37 percent. Millennials voters, 18 to 34 years old, prefer her 56-33 percent. Trump's strongest support comes from white men, who back him 62-29 percent. White voters overall favor Trump, 54-36 percent, while African American voters support Clinton, 89-5 percent. ""In the closing week, women and especially nonwhite women are closing ranks around Clinton,"" said Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director of the Wason Center. Clinton's strongest vote comes from populous, heavily blue Northern Virginia, where voters favor her 59-33 percent. Trump's greatest support lies in the rural South and southwestern regions of the state, where voters favor him 56-34 percent. The survey was conducted Nov. 1-6 among 1,193 likely Virginia voters. It has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percent, though the margin of error for subgroups is higher.  "

Time is running out.	"    Julius Garvey, son of black nationalist Marcus Garvey, strolls the New York City park named after his famous father. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)  Julius Garvey, the son of black nationalist Marcus Garvey, is pacing the lobby of a Washington hotel. His collar is starched. His glasses polished. He holds a stack of fliers displaying photos of his famous father under a headline that reads, ""The Exoneration of Marcus Garvey.""  Julius Garvey, an 83-year-old vascular surgeon, is on a mission to clear his father's name, tarnished by a 1923 federal mail-fraud conviction that he believes was bogus. He wants the country's first African American president to pardon the fiery founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association. Marcus Garvey, who died in 1940, led a ""back to Africa"" campaign that made him a seminal figure in the push for racial and economic justice for black people. ""My father was central to the civil rights movement in the early 20th century,"" said Julius Garvey, who lives on Long Island. ""His organization was the dominant civil rights organization. It shaped the thinking of that part of the century. It gave birth to the Harlem Renaissance. 'Black is beautiful' -- my father was the basis for that ideology."" Marcus Garvey's activism is chronicled in the Smithsonian's new National Museum of African American History and Culture. His son was among the 7,000 dignitaries, celebrities and elected officials who were invited to the museum's opening, where President Obama spoke about the nation's history of racial oppression.  [Thurgood Marshall's interracial love: 'I don't care what people think. I'm marrying you.']  The Obama administration rejected a posthumous pardon for Marcus Garvey five years ago. And Julius Garvey says he knows that time is running out, both for him and for Obama's tenure in the White House. ""It's urgent from the point of view of this president, because his term is up,"" Garvey says. ""The point is the injustice has been allowed to sit for [almost] 100 years. It is a continuing injustice that needs to be corrected."" Marcus Mosiah Garvey was an immigrant from Jamaica who had already founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association when he arrived in the United States in 1916. Eventually, the UNIA claimed millions of members around the world -- although those figures remain in dispute. In 1918, Garvey established the Negro World newspaper and a year later bought an auditorium in Harlem. He called it Liberty Hall, where thousands flocked to hear him speak. ""Black people are subjects of ostracism,"" Garvey said in 1921 to thunderous applause. ""It is sad that our humanity has shown us no more love -- no greater sympathy than we are experiencing. Wheresoever you go throughout the world, the black man is discarded as ostracized, as relegated to the lowest of things -- social, political and economical."" Garvey preached that the problem could be solved only through black pride and self-reliance. In 1920, the UNIA elected Garvey ""Provisional President of Africa."" In an iconic photo, Garvey and members of the association later marched through the streets of Harlem in military uniforms, carrying banners that read, ""We Want a Black Civilization."" To ferry black people and cargo to Africa, Garvey launched a steamship line, which he called the Black Star Line. The company sold stock for $5 a share, allowing black people to own a piece of the business. This sale, along with Garvey's rhetoric and following, attracted government attention. Soon after World War I, Garvey was targeted by future FBI director J. Edgar Hoover -- as part of a ""lifelong obsession to neutralize the rise of a black liberator,"" Julius Garvey said. In documents released later, the FBI acknowledged that it began investigating Garvey to find reasons to ""deport him as an undesirable alien.""  ['I don't scare easily': A 94-year-old judge's refusal to bow to racism, death threats]  In 1921, Garvey's steamship company announced to stockholders it would buy two more ships. But a newspaper that competed with the Negro World published an investigative article claiming the U.S. Department of Commerce had no record of those ships.     Marcus Garvey in 1924. (Library of Congress)     Garvey wore a military uniform as the ""Provisional President of Africa"" during a 1922 Harlem parade. (AP)    Garvey, his treasurer and secretary were arrested and charged with using the Postal Service to defraud stockholders. Garvey's lawyer, William C. Matthews, urged him to plead guilty. Instead, Garvey fired Matthews and defended himself. On June 21, 1923, after a month-long trial in the Southern District of New York, Garvey was convicted of mail fraud and sentenced to five years in prison. He had served nearly three years of that time when President Calvin Coolidge commuted the sentence. Garvey was deported to Jamaica, where he is regarded as a national hero. He died in London in 1940. ""We believe Marcus Garvey was the subject of racial and political animus,"" said Anthony T. Pierce, a partner at Akin Gump law firm, who filed the pardon petition with the Department of Justice and the office of the White House counsel. ""Garvey was targeted by J. Edgar Hoover. He did it in the same way he targeted Martin Luther King several decades later. The main goal was to get evidence to deport Garvey, because he was a rabble-rouser and a political threat."" The petition, filed this past June, argues that Garvey was innocent, that he did not receive a fair trial, that a witness perjured himself and that the judge sided with the prosecution. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, which analyzes pardon requests, said she could ""confirm that the department has received a petition but cannot comment beyond that.""    Julius Garvey wants his father's name cleared before he dies. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)  Julius Garvey was 7 years old when his father died. By then, an ocean separated them. His most vivid memory is throwing snowballs in his dad's backyard in Britain. Julius and his older brother, Marcus Garvey Jr., now 86 and an engineer living in Florida, grew up in Jamaica with their mother, Amy Jacques Garvey. ""My mom talked about the injustice done to my father,"" Julius Garvey said. It always has been difficult for him to reconcile his father's conviction with ""this great ideal of American justice,"" he said. ""That is still grievous.
