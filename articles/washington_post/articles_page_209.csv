The News Journal of Wilmington (http://delonline.us/2fbbUWz ) reports the Delaware-based chemicals company announced Thursday that workers will stop receiving pension contributions either in November 2018 or on the creation date of the first independent company spawned through the proposed $130 billion merger with Dow Chemical. The news affects only employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Current retirees' pensions will not be affected. DuPont expects the changes to reduce its long-term employee benefits obligation by about $550 million. DuPont closed the pension plan to new employees in 2007. ___ Information from: The News Journal of Wilmington, Del., http://www.delawareonline.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Trump in Virginia Tuesday, propelled by waves of immigrant voters in the heavily Democratic northern suburbs outside Washington.  Clinton's victory in the swing state came after an anxious and divided electorate turned out in heavy numbers across the Washington region, with a surge of Latino and Muslim voters supporting the Democratic nominee, while a determined core of Republicans remained loyal to Trump.   Amid scattered reports of technical problems, polling stations were inundated with voters who endured long lines to render their verdict in what has been the most bitterly contested presidential race in generations.  While Clinton expected resounding victories in Maryland and the District, both of which are heavily Democratic, she barely managed to hold off Trump in Virginia, a state with 13 electoral votes where she has led in polls.   No matter their choice, many voters expressed anguish over an election defined by unyielding barbs and whiplash-inducing revelations.          1 of 23       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                     Skip Ad   x           What Election Day looks like in the D.C. area      View Photos   Washington Post photographers capture the region's residents as they cast their votes.

""I am voting because it's my duty, but I don't expect any of them to do anything anymore.""  Others were more enthusiastic, whether crowing over the raw tone of Trump's campaign or the thrill of possibly electing the nation's first female president.  ""It's not because she's the lesser of two evils,"" said Monica Sukhatme, a 33-year-old resident of Chevy Chase, Md., explaining her vote for Clinton. ""It's because she deserves to win with the record she's had."" Turnout among Latino voters seemed especially robust in Northern Virginia, with immigrants such as Marie Vargas, 72, saying they had recently become citizens so they could vote for Clinton.  Vargas's granddaughter and first-time voter, Jesenia Gomez, 19, also chose Clinton after growing fed up with Trump's criticism of Latinos and promise to build a wall separating the United States from Mexico.  ""It's time for a change and I don't think separating people is what we need right now, "" Gomez said at a polling station in Woodbridge. Yet, Trump supporters were also discernable among the immigrants who voted.   Leonel Diaz, 47, says he voted for Hillary Clinton because of Donald Trump's stand on immigrants after voting at Yorkshire Elementary School in Manassas, VA, November 8, 2016. Manassas is part of Prince William County which has both, large Latino and white Trump-supporters voting groups. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)  Polash Chowdhurry, 60, a Muslim who immigrated to the United States from Bangladesh in 1985, said he was voting for Trump because he would break up what he described as Washington's ""cartel.""  Referring to Trump's promise to ban Muslims from the United States, Chowdhurry said, ""He's not against Muslim people. He's against Muslim terrorists."" Voting proceeded smoothly in most places, though there were occasional reports of problems. By midday, voters at one Prince George's County polling station were waiting nearly two hours because only one ballot scanner was available for a precinct of 2,600 registered voters.   [The latest Election Day news]  At the Clearview Elementary School polling station in Herndon, voters expressed a wide spectrum of views about Clinton and Trump, their often clashing perspectives echoing divisions that have emerged nationally.  ""I looked at Trump and said, 'Oh hell, no,'"" said Tom Robinson, a systems analyst for the Defense Department. ""He's a nasty, vindictive individual.""  Nancy Fish, 65, a retired teacher's assistant in special education, said she couldn't vote for Clinton ""because of the dishonesty factor."" ""Trump and the Republicans have the same policies that match my Christian convictions,"" she said.        In Maryland, Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D) beat Republican Kathy Szeliga, a state delegate from Baltimore County, to succeed retiring Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D).  In Virginia, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) beat back a robust challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett in the 10th Congressional District, which includes Loudoun and portions of Fairfax and Prince William counties. In Washington, voters in Ward 7 elected Vincent C. Gray to the D.C. Council, capping a political rebirth for the former mayor, who lost reelection in 2014 amid a campaign finance scandal.  [Tim Kaine casts his ballot in Virginia, ending Democratic campaign close to home]  Ballot initiatives in the region include a statehood referendum in the District that was passed by voters and must now be approved by Congress, a tall order.           In Virginia, a ""right to work"" measure, if ratified, would incorporate into the state constitution a measure that weakens labor unions.  At the county level, voters in Fairfax will decide on a proposed meals tax to fund public education. In Prince George's, an initiative to expand the county council is on the ballot, while Montgomery voters will decide whether to enact term limits.   The region's most rollicking local race was in Richmond, where scandal-tarred Joe Morrissey, a former Democratic state delegate, lost his bid for mayor. He faced five opponents, including Levar Stoney, a protege to Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), and Jack Berry, who has vast support within the city's business community but the winner was still not determined hours after the polls closed.  Morrissey spent three months in jail after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor for sleeping with a teenager. The woman is now married to Morrissey and the mother of his two children. But the day's main event was the White House race. Though Clinton led in the commonwealth for months, Trump's campaign in the final three weeks said it was spending $2 million on television advertising in the state and he made a last minute visit to Loudoun County on Sunday.  [Have you experienced problems voting? ]  Nathan Brinkman of Arlington County voted for Trump after having chosen Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during Virginia's GOP primary. ""I viewed him with no small amount of skepticism,"" Brinkman, 40, said of Trump. ""But he obviously tapped into something the more conventional candidates missed. ""  Northern Virginia's growing immigrant population, however, gave Clinton an edge. After 31 years in the United States as legal permanent residents, Marco and Susana Tanchez finally became citizens earlier this year so they could vote for the Democrat. Melissa Sargent, a 32-year-old mother in Woodbridge, said it was her son who motivated her to vote for the first time in her life Tuesday. The 10-year-old boy labeled Nov. 8 on his calendar as the ""the day I am scared."" The family is part Mexican, and he worried that Trump would deport them. ""Our children should not feel scared,"" she said. ""They should feel happy and protected and good in their own country."" James Daly, 58, a former Air Force photo intelligence officer, declared his allegiance to Trump as he voted in Prince William County. ""She's a liar. A crook!"" he said of Clinton, his voice rising in anger. ""Trump speaks to how people feel, and he's going to help people get working again."" Democrats were taking nothing for granted. On Monday night, Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, campaigned with Vice President Biden at George Mason University. The popular former governor then finished the campaign with a rally near his home in Richmond.  Early Tuesday, Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, arrived at their local polling place.  After he voted, Kaine was greeted with applause by those waiting on line behind him.   [How to vote in each state]    In Virginia's 10th Congressional District, Comstock fended off a stiff challenge from Bennett, a business executive who is the ex-wife of former congressman James P. Moran Jr.  In a district rife with moderate voters, Comstock struggled for months to distance herself from Trump, even as she was wary of alienating Republicans. Comstock only criticized Trump last month, after a 2005 videotape emerged in which he had bragged about groping women.  Nelvia Diaz, a voter in Manassas, said that was a dealbreaker. When she learned that Comstock had not immediately renounced Trump, Diaz said, ""I stopped listening to her.""    Gray's return to the District's political stage seemed more than unlikely after he lost the 2014 Democratic primary to Muriel E. Bowser, who went on to become mayor. At the time, Gray was the target of a federal investigation into his 2010 mayoral campaign.  Gray was never charged with a crime and has remained infuriated by the duration of an investigation that he has blamed for his defeat, and that continues to sour some voters. "" I don't trust him,"" said Danielle Duncan, a 33-year-old registered Republican.  Robert Contee, 61, was in a more forgiving mood, saying he welcomed Gray's return. ""I say everybody deserves a second chance -- give him a second chance,"" Contee said.
