Ifill died Monday at 61 after a yearlong battle with cancer. Mrs. Obama did not speak at the service, but several journalists and political figures offered reflections.  ""We didn't look like other anchor pairs -- and we loved that,"" said Judy Woodruff, half of the history-making team that became the first female co-anchors of a major news broadcast in 2013. The two co-hosted PBS' ""NewsHour."" Woodruff added that Ifill is needed ""more than ever.""  ""Never have we faced tougher challenges, and no one would've risen to them better,"" she added. Ifill, she added, will ""be our compass."" Former Attorney General Eric Holder read a letter from President Barack Obama, who was in Peru. In his own comments, Holder likened Ifill to ""a comet"" and challenged the colleagues she leaves behind to honor her legacy with their work by holding those in power accountable.  ""Will you cower? Will you normalize that which is anything but?"" Holder asked in a veiled reference to the incoming administration of Donald Trump. The service, held at the historic Metropolitan A.M.E. Church -- where Ifill was a longtime member -- was also a grand display of her faith and roots as the daughter of Caribbean immigrants whose father was a leader of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Her pastor of many years, Bishop William P. Deveaux, recalled Ifill as ""brilliance cloaked in humility."" A former reporter for The New York Times and The Washington Post, Ifill transitioned to television in the 1990s, covering politics and Congress for NBC News. She moved to PBS in 1999 as host of ""Washington Week"" and also worked for ""NewsHour."" She moderated vice presidential debates in 2004 and 2008. John Dickerson, host of CBS' ""Face the Nation"" who joined Ifill as a regular panelist on ""Washington Week,"" said Ifill ""wore her grace like a garment,"" but added her infectious laugh came with a withering scowl.  ""I'm not going to say it in church, but there's a very specific word for what Gwen could detect,"" Dickerson said. The pews were filled with journalists, politicians, her mentees, family and friends, including civil rights attorney Vernon Jordan, interim Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile, White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, veteran journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault, New York Times columnist David Brooks, former CNN anchor Bernard Shaw, Donald Trump surrogate Omarosa Manigault, and NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Sherrilynn Ifill, the journalist's younger cousin.  ""She was the shining star in our family,"" Sherrilynn Ifill said of Gwen. ""She was the most American of success stories. Her life and her work made this country better. She did the hard work for us for so long ... It's time to take her example and do what she did."" Ifill took a leave from ""NewsHour"" last spring for health reasons, but kept the details of her illness private. ___ Errin Haines Whack covers urban affairs for The Associated Press.

Greg Abbott had earlier dedicated a monument recognizing the contribution of African-Americans to the state. Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Victor Taylor said four of the arrests were for assault, two for evading arrest, one for disorderly conduct and one for ""interference with public duty."" Two of those arrested were on Capitol grounds and the others on adjacent streets.  ""Some protesters assaulted other protesters,"" Taylor said. ""We don't know for sure which side they were on. A lot of them were co-mingled."" Austin police and state troopers dressed in riot gear had tried to keep the two groups separated. Taylor said the confrontation did not affect the unveiling of the monument, which was in a different part of the grounds. About two dozen individuals with the White Lives Matter group demonstrated against what they called the unequal application of hate crimes laws, which they say are applied in a way that favors minorities. The group said it was a coincidence that its protest was held at about the same time as the ceremony for the monument. The White Lives Matter group was shouted down by a group of several hundred counter-protesters, who held up signs that said ""Stand Against Hate"" and ""Black Lives Matter."" During the unveiling ceremony, Abbott told a crowd in attendance that the monument honors African-Americans who helped grow Texas.  ""The fact is African Americans have shaped this land that we are on today since long before it was even named the state of Texas. They fought for their own freedom. They fought for the freedom of Texas and the freedom of the United States of America,"" Abbott said. The monument is located on the Capitol's south lawn, close to other monuments that honor Confederate soldiers for their service during the Civil War. The new monument features the African-American experience in Texas, from exploration in the 1500s to slavery and emancipation to achievement in arts and science. It will be the 21st monument on the Capitol grounds and the second memorial dedicated to a specific ethnic group. Texas installed the Tejano Monument to Mexican-American history in 2012.

With his approval rating in the state dragging bottom, Christie shook up a usually sleepy League of Municipalities conference in Atlantic City, delivering the keynote address.  ""I have no reason to believe as we stand here today that I will do anything other than serve out my full term as governor and turn the keys over to whoever you select,"" said Christie, whose term ends in 2018. The event is a huge draw for elected leaders, government workers and office-seekers and comes at a low point for the governor. At the last minute, he replaced his lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, who had been scheduled to give the address. Guadagno is weighing a run to succeed Christie and said Thursday she will make a decision after the holidays. In his address, Christie didn't shy away from taking a shot at Guadagno, who crossed him this month to lobby against a ballot question that asked voters to dedicate every penny of the state's recently increased gas tax to pay for transportation. The ballot question was narrowly approved by voters last week.  ""Everyone is gonna play politics with an issue like this but this is what second term-governors were invented for,"" said Christie, who is in his second term. He told the league that Trump's promised infrastructure investments could mean more federal money coming to New Jersey. An early and enthusiastic supporter of Trump after bowing out of the presidential primary, Christie had been positioned to steer the federal government into the Trump era after Election Day, but was replaced with Vice President-elect Mike Pence as chairman of the transition team. It's unclear what exactly Christie is doing now for the team and much of his preliminary planning has been scrapped. Since the election, it's seen new additions and several departures, mainly among those aligned with Christie. He left the event without taking questions. The governor's diminished role comes years after he prosecuted the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump. Kushner's father Charles went to prison for tax evasion, making illegal campaign contributions and witness intimidation as part of a plea deal negotiated by Christie. Christie served as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey before being elected governor. Jared Kushner is said to have tolerated Christie's role in the campaign, though he notably advocated for Trump to pick Pence as his running mate over Christie -- and succeeded in convincing his father-in-law to do so. Jared Kushner is now a member of Trump's transition team. Christie's arrival in Atlantic City also comes about a week after his administration voted to take over the city's government after the Department of Community Affairs' rejected the economically troubled city's plan for a comeback. The state said the plan did not do enough to quickly repair the city's finances. Under the takeover, the state can cancel decisions by the city council, hire or fire workers, break union contracts and sell off city assets. The city's financial strife is largely due to the decline of gambling. Christie appointed Jeffrey Chiesa, a former state attorney general and U.S. senator, to oversee the takeover this week. Christie's appearance also comes after two former aides were convicted in the George Washington Bridge political revenge plot this month. Christie denies wrongdoing and wasn't charged in the 2013 scandal. An official misconduct complaint against Christie, brought by a citizen, is pending in New Jersey court. Christie has appealed a judge's finding of probable cause. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Yang Xiuzhu is accused of siphoning off vast riches from China's massive building boom, stealing $39 million while working as deputy director of the construction bureau in the eastern city of Wenzhou before becoming the city's vice mayor. She had applied for political asylum in France, the Netherlands and, finally, the United States, but in the end, she appeared to recognize there was nowhere left to run. On Wednesday, two guards led her off an American Airlines plane and escorted her through immigration, as state-run China Central Television broadcast the scene. Bespectacled and wearing a gray puffy jacket, she was taken into a room where a prosecutor read out the charges against her and she signed a charge sheet. ""We are all Chinese. Our home is China,"" she said, urging other corruption suspects also to give themselves up. ""Please come back soon.""  [Unswayed by extraordinary public outcry, China executes nail-gun killer]  Yang ranked at the top of a list of the 100 most-wanted corruption suspects whom China had sought to apprehend with Interpol's help. Many are living in the United States, Canada and Australia. The ruling Communist Party's anti-corruption wing, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said Yang had surrendered to authorities, abandoning her ""resistance"" after she was promised ""lenient treatment in accordance with the law."" The CCDI said Yang had decided herself to withdraw her application for asylum in the United States.  In July, her attorney was quoted as saying that the 70-year-old's health had started to deteriorate and that she wanted to return to China for medical treatment.  She was the 37th fugitive to return so far under what China initially dubbed Operation Fox Hunt, which expanded into Operation Skynet. The search for corrupt officials and business people who have fled abroad is part of President Xi Jinping's signature campaign against corruption.  [China's president consolidates power at key meeting]  Yang's brother, regional official Yang Jinjun, was the first suspect on the list to be sent home from the United States, repatriated in September 2015 for U.S. immigration violations. After Chinese authorities began investigations against her, Yang fled first to Hong Kong in 2003, before heading to Singapore, France, the Netherlands and Italy, the CCDI said in a statement.   News reports say she jumped bail in the Netherlands and flew to Canada just before Dutch officials were due to repatriate her in 2014. Last year, she told Reuters that the most-wanted fugitives list was a political document targeting enemies of the Xi administration rather than a roster of true criminals. She claimed to have been arrested when she tried to enter the United States using a false passport, although China said she was placed in custody when Chinese officials gave U.S. law enforcement officials evidence of her crimes. Concern about the Chinese legal system, where torture is thought to be widespread and where trials directed by the Communist Party are lacking in due process, is partly why China does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. But U.S. officials, under considerable pressure from China, have said they would consider Chinese requests to repatriate suspects if they received credible evidence against them. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Yang's surrender had been secured under the U.S.-China Joint Liaison Group on Law Enforcement Cooperation. ""Her return is an important achievement of China-U.S. law enforcement cooperation on fighting corruption,"" he said at a regular news conference. ""China appreciates and thanks the assistance and cooperation offered by the United States and other countries."" A Chinese police official was elected president of Interpol last week, alarming rights advocates who worry that the global police organization could be used to attack Xi's political opponents.

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/house-votes-to-prohibit-sale-of-commercial-aircraft-to-iran/2016/11/17/fb31fcc6-ace8-11e6-8f19-21a1c65d2043_story.html	House votes to prohibit sale of commercial aircraft to Iran	" WASHINGTON -- The Republican-led House has acted decisively to bar the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, a move that would scuttle deals already authorized by the Obama administration and potentially worth billions of dollars. By 243-174 vote on Thursday, lawmakers passed legislation that would prohibit the Treasury Department from issuing the licenses U.S. banks would need to complete the transactions. The House bill seeks to counter the department's decision in September to grant aviation giants Boeing and Airbus permission to sell the passenger planes to Tehran. The bill must now clear the Senate, where the measure would face stiff opposition from Democrats. President Barack Obama would veto the bill if it reached his desk, according to the White House. The proposed sales may involve the purchase and leasing of more than 200 aircraft, which could generate thousands of new jobs, according to Democrats who opposed the legislation. Republicans, however, decried the sale of aircraft to a country they say is the leading state sponsor of terrorism and has flouted United Nations resolutions by testing ballistic missiles. Iran's nuclear deal with the U.S. and other world powers ended international economic sanctions against Tehran and specifically allowed for the sale of commercial aircraft and spare parts. The Treasury Department said the licenses granted to Boeing and Airbus contained ""strict conditions to ensure the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred to a designated entity."" But Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., called the aircraft sales a ""scandal."" He harshly criticized Boeing and Airbus for seeking to do business with Iran.  ""We need to make sure that the American financial system is not complicit in this deal,"" Roskam said. ""We need to make sure that American taxpayers are not subsidizing this deal."" Although Roskam is from Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, the airplanes the company proposed selling to Tehran are built in Washington state. Democrats cast the legislation as another Republican attempt to undermine last year's Iran nuclear agreement and embarrass the Obama administration. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., a member of the House Intelligence committee, said the bill plunged the House again into the ""dreary and dangerous ritual"" of considering a measure that would cause the United States to violate the nuclear accord that took years to forge with world powers, including China and Russia. Himes also argued denying the aircraft sale could cause 100,000 jobs to not be created. Ahead of the vote, the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement Monday that the legislation would ""contravene U.S. commitments"" in the nuclear deal and undercut American credibility with its allies. National carrier Iran Air signed agreements in January to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth $25 billion. Iran later reduced the number of planes to 112. Though based abroad, Airbus needed Treasury's approval because at least 10 percent of the manufacturer's components are of American origin. Under Boeing's deal, Iran Air is slated to buy 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s, raising the potential total value of the deal to $25 billion. But Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, doubted that Iran has the money for so many new planes. The country's economy, rife with corruption and patronage, is in poor shape, he said. Third party lenders also are likely to be leery of underwriting such large transactions because Tehran is not party to an international agreement called the Cape Town Convention that guarantees financiers can repossess the jets in the event of bankruptcy, he said.  ""In the here and now, Iran maybe has the ability to absorb and finance at most a quarter of the aircraft,"" said Aboulafia, adding that Tehran would likely have to settle for used and leased planes. ___ Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rplardner Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Former President Nicolas Sarkozy, running to get his job back, says that Trump's election shows that politicians must listen to ""the wrath of the people.""  ""Mr. Trump wants to defend American interests? Fine, I want to defend French interests and those of Europe. What Americans allow themselves, why should we refuse that for France?"" Sarkozy said in a rally in the southern city of Nice on Tuesday night. Sarkozy is facing tough competition in his party's two-round primary that starts Sunday. Polls have repeatedly placed him behind ex-Prime Minister Alain Juppe. Another major contender, former Prime Minister Francois Fillon, is gaining popularity as he also presents himself as an alternative to Sarkozy. Lucas Moulin, a 19-year-old supporter of Sarkozy who attended his Nice rally, told The Associated Press that Trump's victory can give his preferred candidate ""strength and credit in public opinion.  ""He presents himself as an anti-system candidate, with an anti-elite speech, like Trump, who won,"" Moulin said. Sarkozy is campaigning on some of Le Pen's favorite issues, including strong anti-immigration and security measures, in the hope to attract votes from the far-right. Le Pen, who doesn't face a primary, opened her campaign headquarters for the April-May election in an upper-class Paris neighborhood on Wednesday. She has chosen a blue rose to illustrate her campaign as ""the symbol of the people being able to make possible what the elites constantly present as impossible ... My election at the presidency has been called impossible for months now, it is up to the people to make it possible,"" she said in her speech. All recent polls suggest that she could reach the final run of the two-round presidential election next year. The same polls also indicate that in the end, she would lose to any major contender from the right or from the left. Asked about Le Pen's chance to win the election next year, French political analyst Dominique Moisi told the AP that ""I would be, and I think most people are becoming now, much, much more prudent than before. I mean: we were wrong twice,"" referring to the unexpected Brexit vote and Trump's election. ""We don't want to be wrong a third time"". Moisi said an ""anti-Trump effect"" might also have an impact on the conservative primary. If so, Juppe could benefit from votes from people who fear Le Pen and consider him as in best position to defeat her.  ""Obviously we don't know what's going to happen next Sunday"" at the conservative primary, Moisi said.  ""It's difficult for Sarkozy to claim that he is the candidate of the anti-establishment,"" Moisi said. ""For five years, he was the president of France, he was sitting at the Elysee Palace. He had all power in his hands. But that's what he's trying to achieve."" Juppe is trying to play this card, saying that he is banking on truth, gravity and a sense of responsibility rather than populism. He says he wants to bring together voters from the right and the center instead of chasing after those who have chosen the far-right.  ""I don't want to pit one part of France against another, the elites against the people ... It's a dangerous political game,"" Juppe told thousands of supporters at a Paris rally on Monday. On the left, the situation remains unclear. Unpopular President Francois Hollande hasn't said yet if he will run for re-election as his Socialist party organizes its primary in January. Other far-left, green and independent candidates are also planning to run. Hollande's ex-economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, announced his candidacy on Wednesday. Macron, a former investment banker who has never held elected office, promotes free-market views and denounces the ""vacuity"" of France's political system as preventing the country to reform itself. In other European countries, populist parties are expected to do well as votes are due in the coming year in the Netherlands and Germany. A repeat runoff election for president of Austria on Dec. 4 could bring right-wing populist Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party into office. ___ Milos Krivokapic and Margaid Quioc in Nice and Oleg Celtinic in Paris contributed to this story Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Victor Mlotshwa was just walking along, minding his own business, when the unthinkable happened. ""There was a footpath there, and I decided to use it,"" he said. ""The next thing, there was a grave and then a coffin. There was nothing I could do because the other man had a gun."" Two white men suddenly approached him and accused him of trespassing on a ranch. Before Mlotshwa could escape, he says, they forced him into a coffin nearby. Then he says they threatened to pour gasoline on him and light him on fire. One of the men captured part of the assault on video. Toward the end of the video, which was taken down from YouTube on Tuesday but is preserved on social media accounts, one of the men tries to close the coffin over Mlotshwa's head while he helplessly wails. It is unclear what happened after that. But the resurfacing of the video has given Mlotshwa a chance at justice for his tormentors, almost three months after he says the incident took place.   [Rape is black people's 'pastime,' white South African judge says in Facebook rant]   ""He didn't have evidence to prove what had happened, it's only two weeks back that he decided to open the case. He didn't think anyone would believe him,"" Mlotshwa's brother, Thobile, told local media. South African police were able to track down Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson, and the two appeared together in court Wednesday on charges of kidnapping and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. A judge decided that their trial would be postponed until January. They will remain in prison on remand. At the court in Middelburg, in the eastern province of Mpumalanga, Mlotshwa sat just one row behind Oosthuizen and Jackson.      Theo Martins and Willem Oosthuizen appear before a court in Middleburg on charges of assault and kidnapping, after a video emerged online showing them forcing a wailing black man into a coffin. (Reuters)    The court was packed to capacity. Members of South Africa's main political parties have lined up behind Mlotshwa. The Economic Freedom Fighters in particular have taken up his cause and rallied hundreds of people outside the courtroom. ""This humiliation can be based on nothing else but his blackness, which means it is in actual fact a humiliation of black people as a whole,"" the EFF said in a statement. They have called for mass protests at the ranch where the incident occurred. Whites make up less than 10 percent of South Africa's population but remain in control of much of the country's economy, which they all but dominated through decades of apartheid. In the years since that system of racial segregation ended, little has been done to address systemic inequalities. The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has repeatedly been taken to task for the corrupt practices of many of its leaders, and protests have roiled the country. The president, Jacob Zuma, is under investigation for numerous improprieties and has already been forced to pay back money that he embezzled to the government.    Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa (C) is escorted after the appearance of Theo Martins and Willem Oosthuizen in court on November 16, 2016. He is pictured wearing a shirt with the logo of the African National Congress political party. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko  The EFF and the Democratic Alliance parties have positioned themselves as alternatives, and both were able to garner significant support in recent municipal elections. In a country where political rhetoric centers on claims of standing up for the downtrodden, Mlotshwa has now emerged as a symbolic prize. The ANC appears to have won. A local ANC youth league leader stood with Mlotshwa on a stage at a protest in Middelburg on Wednesday and said the EFF was ""political prostitutes"" and that Mlotshwa belongs to the ANC.

Donald Trump sailed to victory in significant part on the back of white, rural, largely conservative voters drawn to his populist message. The upset victory has prompted soul-searching in the media, which had set the odds of a Hillary Clinton victory from 71 percent to more than than 99 percent. ""Want to know what America's thinking? Try asking,"" the New York Times' public editor Liz Spayd wrote, urging the Times to ""think hard about the half of America the paper too seldom covers."" Margaret Sullivan, media critic at The Washington Post, struck a similar note. ""Although we touched down in the big red states for a few days, or interviewed some coal miners or unemployed autoworkers in the Rust Belt,"" she wrote, ""we didn't take them seriously."" In May, I moved from deep-blue Baltimore to one of those overlooked corners of the country that swung wildly toward Trump. I have gotten to know the people who live there as friends and neighbors. Here in the town of Red Lake Falls -- the seat of Red Lake County, Minn. -- it wasn't easy to get a sense of which way the political winds were blowing. I didn't see a single yard sign for Clinton or Trump, although signs for state and local candidates were everywhere. Sometimes, it seemed, signs for competing Democratic and Republican candidates were planted in the same yard. But voters in Red Lake County voted for Trump in a landslide, 61 percent to 29 percent. More striking, Clinton's showing here was the worst of any Democratic presidential candidate since at least 1960. Given the vociferous campaign that played out on TV -- and seemingly across the country -- I wondered how such a dramatic political shift could be happening in an almost hidden way among my neighbors. It was, in some way, no surprise that busy reporters based in D.C. and traveling nonstop around the country had not grasped the entirety of this shift. I lived here every day. I missed it, too.     After the election, if there were any place in America to take the pulse of these Trump voters, I figured it would be right here in Red Lake. And I knew just the place to go, too. Every morning down at Eagle Square, one of the local gas stations, mostly retired guys get together to talk local gossip and the issues of the day. These ""coffee klatches,"" as they're known around here, are a big part of the region's civic fabric.   [How voters who heavily supported Obama switched over to Trump]   I visited Eagle Square on Friday morning expecting to hear from jubilant Trump voters. But what I found was something different, another humbling reminder of the yawning gap between what political numbers -- like in the chart above -- can tell you about a place and what life is actually like for the people who live there. The grizzled and cantankerous crew of retired teachers, farmers and laborers at Eagle Square were mostly, as it turned out, loyal Democrats who had voted for Clinton. And like so many other people in the country, they were wondering how their friends and neighbors with deep ties to Minnesota's Democratic Farmer-Labor Party -- the state arm of the national Democratic Party -- ended up pulling the lever for Trump. ""I was shocked by the election,"" said Jim Benoit, a retiree and veteran who has lived in Red Lake Falls nearly his whole life. ""I say hold on to your shorts, because we're in for a ride. And not a good ride -- I'm really scared to death."" Benoit is the kind of guy who will drop by a newcomer's house to share fried walleye recipes and apples plucked fresh off his tree. His voice carries a raspy lilt that comes from a decades-long cigarette habit cultivated in northern Minnesota. He voted for Clinton because Trump ""is a walking bomb. It's scary."" Benoit remains hopeful that Congress will hold Trump's more authoritative impulses in check. ""He thinks you can do everything, and you can't. You've got Congress.""     Ed Dahle, who retired some years ago after decades of teaching music at the Red Lake Falls High School, said he has taken to telling anyone who asks that he plans to build a wall around his house to keep Trump supporters out. ""It's hard for me to vote Republican when I was raised by a grandfather that was solid Democrat,"" he said. ""And he told me every time he had a chance, 'Don't ever vote Republican because the Democrats help the farmers.' "" Echoing remarks by some Clinton advisers in the aftermath of the surprise defeat, Dahle said that Clinton was defeated in places like Red Lake Falls because she didn't reach out to the working class the way her husband, former president Bill Clinton, had. ""When Hillary was up to speak, some of the people just did not feel that ease of conversation,"" he said. ""They felt there was like a screen or something between them and her. And that's why so many people turned."" Retired highway worker Larry Eckstein, another Clinton voter, pointed to her handling of a private email server as another factor in her defeat. ""That email thing was really a big thing. That hung with her for a long time,"" he said. ""She never came out and said, 'Let's get it all out. Get it out now, and let's see if there's any problem.' She never came out and got rid of it."" Still, he said, ""What's done is done. We've got to get behind him.""      The Post's Dan Balz explores some of the factors behind President-elect Donald Trump's victory against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Of course, just because I happened upon a group of Democratic voters doesn't diminish the fact that Trump won big here. Allen Bertilrud, the mayor-elect of Red Lake Falls, who won the position on a write-in ballot, swung by to chat. He wouldn't say who he voted for, but he seemed upbeat about the results. ""Trump didn't win because he was the most popular guy on the planet,"" Bertilrud said. ""He won because he said the right things at the right time that got Hillary going. And if Hillary would have focused on the issues instead of focusing on his womanizing when she had a husband who was a womanizer, she probably would have won."" He added his family has ""voted Democratic for years."" But this time, ""they voted for all the other Democratic candidates but Hillary."" Gun control was a huge factor. Democrats ""keep harping on this gun control,"" he said. ""I can understand gun control in the metropolitan areas, but we don't see that out here. We don't have drive-by shootings. This is one of the things that they feel is one of the last rights that they have."" A few blocks away from Eagle Square, Dick Brumwell, a veteran and retired schoolteacher, was helping his son fix a garage door. Brumwell is a lifelong Democrat and voted for Obama twice. But he said a vote for Clinton was off the table. ""Every time Hillary would get together with a group of people, they would say, 'Oh, we need more food stamps or more of this,' and she would say, 'Okay, we'll take care of that.' She was promising everything,"" he said. Brumwell vacillated on whether he could pull the lever for Trump but ultimately voted for the businessman. ""I think America is so gosh darn tired of the status quo politicians, lifetime politicians, it's time to get somebody who isn't associated with the government, who has new ideas,"" he said. The aftermath of the election is prompting a new wave of analysis of the working-class voters who pushed Trump over the finish line. There's a temptation to treat these white rural voters as a monolith. The sense often seems to be that they're fundamentally different than their urban counterparts -- on culture, on politics and across so many other social vectors -- and similar to each other. Statistically, of course, there is some truth to this. There is a commonality out here. Nearly everyone is white. Most folks own guns. Many have a tie to the agricultural economy. But it's easy to overstate these commonalities. What I'm starting to see after six months here is that folks in this community -- and probably many others like it across the U.S. -- defy easy stereotypes. Yes, Red Lake County turned out overwhelmingly for Trump. But there are plenty of Clinton voters here too. Politics is also experienced in a quieter, more personal way up here -- that may be one reason yard signs for national candidates are so hard to find. Ideological disagreements tend to be hashed out in conversations between close friends, rather than shouting matches between strangers. Decisions and judgments about politics are subtler and less polarized that the election's results might make it seem. Back at Eagle Square, Bertilrud and Dahle were arguing over the  severity of future threats the country might face. ""We're $19 trillion in the hole,"" Bertilrud said. ""If interest rates go to 5 percent, we can't even pay our interest."" ""I don't give a hang about that,"" said Dahle. ""Remember your great-grandchildren? They're going to have to pay for this."" Dahle wasn't buying it. ""They're not even going to be alive if we don't get this global warming done and get rid of the damn coal. They aren't going to be alive if they can't breathe!"" But at the end, for these voters, the political talk was just talk and little more. ""We're friends,"" Dahle said. ""Politics is one thing. You disagree, and then you go on with your life. You can't hate people forever."" Discussion soon turned to what Bertilrud intended to do, as the new mayor, about the plague of squirrels in Dahle's back yard.          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/campaigns-disdain-for-civility-could-leave-lasting-damage/2016/11/12/8792ed1e-a8df-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	Campaignâ€™s disdain for civility could leave lasting damage	" When a South Carolina congressman shouted ""You lie!"" during a speech by President Barack Obama in 2009, House members rebuked him for violating norms of civility. After this year's presidential campaign, the idea that people were once troubled by the outburst seems almost quaint. Civility in politics has been declining for years, both a cause and symptom of a changing culture where anonymous verbal assaults are fired freely across the internet, and cable TV routinely broadcasts words once banned from the airwaves. But Donald Trump's presidential run took name-calling and mockery -- things that voters long said they detested in their candidates -- and normalized them into a winning political strategy. Now Trump, the president-elect, is calling for unity in words that draw attention precisely because they sound so unlike Trump, the candidate. But many question whether it is possible to reverse the campaign's damage to political discourse and its ripples out to the way Americans speak to and about each other.  ""There's plenty of blame to go around on this subject, but I think in this particular election that an embrace of Donald Trump was an embrace of incivility and vulgarity and insults and bullying, and unfortunately we saw very little public repudiation of that from any Trump supporters,"" said Mark DeMoss, an Atlanta public relations executive and conservative Republican whose clients are mostly Christian religious organizations. DeMoss, who abandoned a campaign called the Civility Project in early 2011 after only three members of Congress would sign a pledge to act respectfully, watched the degradation of political speech for years. Then Trump's campaign, he and other longtime observers say, stomped well past what was thought to be acceptable.  ""We can all point to incidents in campaigns across history, but I think this one probably does represent a new place in terms of incivility,"" said James Mullen, president of Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, which awards a prize each year for civility in public life.  ""What worries me the most is we're becoming almost numb,"" Mullen said. When Allegheny -- which first polled Americans about political civility in 2010 -- did so again in October, researchers noted a ""disturbing"" decline in those rejecting insults in politics. The number who disapprove of political comments about someone's race or ethnicity declined from 89 percent to 69 percent. The number who said it was unacceptable to shout over a debate opponent fell from 86 percent to 65 percent. Many observers blame Trump, who called Mexican immigrants ""rapists,"" tarred his adversaries as ""Lyin' Ted"" and ""Crooked Hillary"" and complained that a TV journalist's dogged questioning was just a sign she had ""blood coming out of her wherever."" He said all of those things, not on long-forgotten tapes, but in front of millions of voters. At Trump's rallies, supporters followed suit, chanting ""Lock Her Up!"" about Clinton and wearing T-shirts with the slogan, ""Trump That Bitch!"" In some ways, Trump's rhetoric is an outgrowth of cultural and political shifts. A generation before the internet, political backers were leaving fliers attacking rivals on voters' windshields in the dark and blanketing neighborhoods with anonymous direct mailings. Social media made it possible for ordinary people to disparage political enemies widely with no risk, saying things they might previously have told only their close friends.  ""Into that world comes a candidate who uses Twitter as a primary mode of communication,"" said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies political communication. ""He lives in a world in which this stuff is being trafficked back and forth, and that normalizes this kind of discourse for you as a candidate."" But with their words, Trump, Clinton and other politicians set the tone for a much larger conversation. Nearly 2,000 teachers surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center this spring reported that the campaign's scorching words were having a ""profoundly negative impact"" on their students. More than half said they had seen an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose race, religion or nationality had been targeted by political rhetoric. The survey did not identify any candidates. But teachers singled out Trump in more than 1,000 comments, while fewer than 200 combined named Clinton, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. In recent years, teachers mindful of bullying and taunts on social media have worked to make schools places of mutual respect, said Maureen Costello, director of the SPLC's Teaching Tolerance project.  ""What made this year really different is that it broke through that protective moat,"" Costello said. The political rhetoric was ""so ubiquitous and so saturated the culture that you couldn't keep it out of schools. Kids are sponges."" When Beth Ferris, a middle school teacher in Yucca Valley, California, told students on Election Day that history would be made one way or the other, one of her students said, ""Yeah, she (Clinton) should be in jail!"" At a nearby high school, vandals painted ""Trump 2016,"" on a wall and covered the word ""Girls"" on a bathroom door with a vulgarity.  ""I think it's going to get worse before it gets better,"" Ferris said. On the day after the election, teacher Dee Burek said fifth and sixth graders in her Allentown, New Jersey, middle school asked how Trump had become the Republican nominee. She recalled his insults of opponents in debates and how they stuck.  ""The kids just kind of looked at me and said, 'But that doesn't make any sense. That's bullying,'"" she said. ""If these middle schoolers can see that, I think there's hope."" Adults, who heard the candidates out and voted, have conflicted feelings.  ""There were some things that were said about Hillary, that she should just go to jail and she should be hung, they make it sound so -- it can't be that bad,"" said Byron Dopkins, an accountant in River Falls, Wisconsin, who voted for Trump. ""What makes it worse (for) the public is that we can't have conversations with friends who are on the other side of the aisle without it getting nasty."" Still, Dopkins said one of the reasons he voted for Trump is that he is a ""straight talker."" But that talk feeds a public conversation that leaves Melinda St. Clair, an Episcopal priest in Billings, Montana, who voted for Clinton, deeply troubled.  ""I don't use the term 'civil discourse.' I don't think there is any,"" St. Clair said.  ""I don't think we're listening to God. I don't think we're listening to each other. I think we're just hearing what makes us feel good at the moment and shouting it at the top of our lungs."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
