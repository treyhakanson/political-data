But it's the electoral vote that counts, not the popular vote, so Donald Trump will be president. And no, I'm not over it. No one should be over it. No one should pretend that Trump will be a normal president. No one should forget the bigotry and racism of his campaign, the naked appeals to white grievance, the stigmatizing of Mexicans and Muslims. No one should forget the jaw-dropping ignorance he showed about government policy both foreign and domestic. No one should forget the vile misogyny. No one should forget the mendacity, the vulgarity, the ugliness, the insanity. None of this should ever be normalized in our politics. The big protests that have followed Trump's election should be no surprise. You can't spend all those months trashing our nation's values and then expect everyone to join you in a group hug. Trump made the bed in which he now must lie. How did the unthinkable happen? Is Trump, like Brexit, part of some world-sweeping populist wave? Are the Rust Belt hinterlands in open rebellion? Was Clinton just a spectacularly flawed candidate? Did FBI Director James B. Comey boost Trump over the top? Did too many anti-Trump voters stay home out of complacency? There is evidence to support all of those theories. But the urgent question isn't why? --  it's what now?      Nationwide protests have gripped many cities for days following the presidential election as thousands march against Donald Trump's victory. Trump tweeted to condemn ""professional protesters, incited by the media."" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   If a normal Republican had been elected, I could say the polite and socially acceptable thing, something like ""I didn't support So-and-So, but he will be my president, too, and I wish him success."" But I cannot wish Trump success in rounding up and deporting millions of people or banning Muslims from entering the country or reinstituting torture as an instrument of U.S. policy. In these and other divisive, cruel, unwise initiatives, I wish him failure. I do hope he succeeds in avoiding some kind of amateurish foreign policy blunder that puts American lives or vital national interests at risk. And let me be clear that I am not questioning his legitimacy as president. When the results are certified and the electoral college casts its votes, Trump will be the nation's duly chosen leader, ridiculous though that may be.  But he has not earned our trust or hope. Rather, he has earned the demonstrations that have erupted in cities across the country. He has earned relentless scrutiny by journalists, whom he shamelessly made into scapegoats during the campaign, and he has earned the constant vigilance of the public he now must serve.  There have been more than 200 reports since the election of harassment and hate crimes, mostly directed at minorities, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. During an interview broadcast Sunday on ""60 Minutes,"" Trump addressed his supporters: ""I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.""  That would have been a better start had he not also sought to minimize the incidents, saying there had been a ""very small amount"" of them; and had he not also claimed the media was somehow applying a double standard in reporting on the protests. The most troubling post-election development thus far was Trump's appointment of campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon -- a prominent figure in the racist, xenophobic alt-right movement -- as chief strategist and senior adviser. A spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said the move ""signals that white supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump's White House."" On ""60 Minutes,"" Trump hinted that he might moonwalk away from some of his most radical promises on immigration, the issue that made him stand out from the crowd of Republican contenders. He said he will still build a wall on the Mexican border, but there ""could be some fencing"" instead of an actual wall in places. And he said that ""we're going to make a determination"" about the fate of millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes -- sounding as if he knows his pledge to carry out mass deportation cannot be fulfilled.         1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flare up as opponents of President-elect Donald Trump express dismay with the election results, underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting a fractured country.

The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump ""70 News"" site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to ""70 News"" remained prominent in its results. Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that ""misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information."" The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College's decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton's lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump's election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren't passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election's aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its ""trending"" news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as ""crazy "" in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that ""more than 99 percent of what people see"" on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what's blatantly wrong isn't always an easy task.  ""Identifying the 'truth' is complicated,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted."" The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google's search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. ""In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,"" the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics.  ""What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm,"" Doctor said. ""These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings."" It's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research's survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

In a major foreign policy speech at the annual Lord Mayor's Banquet in London, May said ""change is in the air"" and ""it's the job of politicians to respond."" She said Britain would champion free trade while managing ""the forces of globalization so that they work for all."" The speech, to an audience of business leaders in London's financial district, comes as the British government tries to build bridges with a U.S. president-elect whose victory has surprised -- and even alarmed -- many European politicians. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Monday that it's ""very important not to prejudge the president-elect or his administration."" And May's spokeswoman, Helen Bower, said Downing Street wants ""an effective, strong working relationship"" with the incoming U.S. president. May and Trump spoke by phone on Thursday, the day after Trump's victory was announced. But the call has been overshadowed in Britain by Trump's meeting Saturday with U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, a key player in the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. UKIP issued a gleeful press release accompanied by a picture of the two men, beaming side-by-side in front of a golden elevator at Trump Tower in New York. May firmly rejected suggestions that she should use Farage -- a political foe of her Conservative party -- as a go-between with Trump's team. Bower said that Trump told May ""he looked forward to enjoying the same close relationship that (Ronald) Reagan and (Margaret) Thatcher did.""  ""I don't remember there being a third person in that relationship,"" Bower noted. May, who took office when David Cameron resigned after losing the June referendum on EU membership, has stressed the need to help those who feel left behind by the economic and social changes of recent decades. Years of recession and economic uncertainty since the 2008 global financial crisis have helped fuel resentments that drove the votes for Trump and Brexit. May told a black-tie dinner at London's medieval Guildhall: ""We meet in a world transformed."" She denied having an ""anti-business agenda,"" saying liberalization and globalization are forces for good, and ""free markets and tree trade"" are the best way to lift people out of poverty. But -- in a nod to the anti-establishment feeling that fueled Trump's victory and the Brexit vote -- she added that governments must help people who have seen ""their jobs being outsourced and wages undercut.""  ""To be the true global champion of free trade in this new modern world, we also need to do something to help those families and communities who can actually lose out from it,"" May said. It's unclear whether May's commitment to free trade will be shared by President-elect Trump, who campaigned on promises to bolster U.S. industry and restore U.S. jobs lost to globalization.

They walked out in California, Maryland and Oregon, many declaring concerns over the president-elect's comments about minorities and the effect he will have on their communities. Some of Trump's supporters have called for the demonstrations to stop, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who dismissed the protesters as ""spoiled crybabies."" Trump has accused some of being ""professional protesters,"" although he said in a ""60 Minutes"" interview Sunday that he also believes some are afraid for the country's future ""because they don't know me."" Here's a look at some of Monday's protests:   Students from several high schools rally after walking out of classes to protest the election of Donald Trump at City Hall in downtown Los Angeles Monday, Nov. 14, 2016. (Reed Saxon/Associated Press)  ___ LOS ANGELES More than a thousand students from several schools on Los Angeles' heavily Hispanic east side marched out of classes. The demonstrations began at Garfield High School, the subject of the 1988 film ""Stand and Deliver"" focusing on teacher Jaime Escalante's successful college-level math programs. Students with signs and slogans headed to nearby Mariachi Plaza. They were joined by hundreds of students from several schools, many shouting, ""Say it loud. Say it clear. Immigration, welcome here."" Some carried signs that read ""Deport Trump,"" while others waved the U.S., Mexican and gay pride flags. Many said they have relatives and friends in the country illegally who they fear will be deported. Brian Rodriguez, 16, was born in the U.S. to parents from Mexico and Guatemala. He said he was offended by Trump's criticism of Latinos.     Members of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team as well as Democratic officials on Nov. 13 responded to protesters marching in several cities against Trump's election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)    ""It hurt me inside knowing somebody from outside our race is talking bad about us,"" said Rodriguez, carrying a sign reading, ""Brown and Proud."" Rodriguez said his school's principal opened the gates and told students they could participate. Nancy Meza, a community organizer who announced the walkout, said she helped students organize after they reached out to her.  ""It was really out of frustration of students wanting to voice their opinions,"" Meza said. ""And wanting to feel protected."" ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA Hundreds of students from a dozen high schools in Oakland skipped classes to demonstrate. They called on California cities to remain a sanctuary for people in the country illegally, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee vowed Monday to maintain that status. Administrators wanted students back in class but did not them to stop protesting, said John Sasaki, Oakland Unified School District a spokesman.  ""We support our students' First Amendment rights,"" he said. ___ DENVER About 200 middle- and high-school students left two Denver charter schools to march to the state Capitol, where they chanted and held up signs saying, ""Millennial voice matters"" and ""Make peace not war."" Police and school officials escorted the students along city streets to ensure their safety. The protesters called out ""Si, se puede"" -- Spanish for ""Yes, we can"" -- and ""The people united will never be divided."" Noelie Quintero, 17, said they represented Latinos, Muslims, women and others marginalized by Trump.  ""We're not going anywhere -- we're going to continue to stand strong,"" she said. ""Even though we're only 16- and 17-year-olds and we can't vote, our voice matters. What we believe matters, and we're not going to stop."" ___ PORTLAND, OREGON In a city that has seen large and destructive protests, a few hundred students from several schools walked out of class to gather in the rain near City Hall. The group held signs saying ""Students for change"" and ""Love trumps hate."" They marched across a bridge, some of them climbing up it, while officers stopped traffic. It was peaceful, following smashed windows and other vandalism at recent rallies. Daily demonstrations have led to $1 million in damage and more than 100 arrests. A protest organizer says activists were contacting counterparts in New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., and other cities in an effort to stop Trump from prevailing on his issues.  ""Trump is going to be president, so we need to prepare for that,"" said Greg McKelvey of the group Portland's Resistance. McKelvey said they want to ensure local governments fight racial disparities in policing and help address global warming. ___ SEATTLE Thousands of students across Seattle chanted as they marched in the streets and waved ""Not My President"" or ""Love Wins"" signs. Luke Duecy, a spokesman with Seattle Public Schools, estimated about 2,300 students from 14 middle and high schools participated in the walkout. Some said they oppose Trump's divisive rhetoric and wanted to show support for those he targeted, such as Muslims or immigrants. Others say they came to support their friends or simply to observe. High school senior Rose Taylor, who is bisexual, says she worries about what Trump's election will mean for the LGBT community and others. ___ SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND Hundreds of high school students left campus and took to the streets to declare their opposition to Trump, while hundreds more gathered for a rally at a school football stadium. About 800 Montgomery Blair High School students attended the rally at the stadium, and most returned to class afterward, Montgomery County Public Schools spokeswoman Gboyinde Onijala said. The ones who left joined students from nearby Northwood High School, making up a gathering that Onijala estimated at 200 to 300, some of them chanting, ""Not my president."" Police Capt. Paul Starks says the protesters were peaceful except for one bottle-throwing incident. No one was hurt. ___ Associated Press writers Christine Armario in Los Angeles; Andrew Selsky in Portland, Oregon; Phuong Le in Seattle; and Sarah Brumfield in Washington contributed to this story. ___ This story has been corrected to show Jaime Escalante's name was misspelled Jamie.

He stepped to a podium to announce the launch of an immigration crackdown. Protesters howled into megaphones in hopes of drowning out his speech, and federal lawyers investigating him on discrimination allegations milled in the crowd.  ""We don't have to be controlled by Washington,"" said the self-proclaimed ""America's Toughest Sheriff,"" only months removed from an unopposed re-election victory. Arpaio's political invincibility ended Tuesday when a little-known retired Phoenix police sergeant unseated him after 24 years in office. It marked a stunning fall for a lawman whose reputation as an immigration enforcer made him wildly popular among conservatives nationwide. Arpaio attached himself to Donald Trump, but the alliance could not overshadow what became a repudiation of his mounting legal woes and costs to taxpayers stemming from his patrols targeting immigrants. The election also provided more evidence that Arizona voters care little about immigration. Exit polls showed that only about 1 in 10 voters named immigration as the most important issue, and three-quarters said they supported a path to legal status for immigrants. The 84-year-old sheriff didn't make any public appearances on Election Night, issuing a statement saying he was disappointed by the results but congratulated the winner, Paul Penzone.  ""My thanks and appreciation to the people of Maricopa County for the faith and trust they put in me over the years,"" Arpaio said. His downfall proved partly tied to a criminal contempt-of-court charge for his acknowledged defiance of a judge's order in a racial profiling case stemming from his immigration patrols. He also cost taxpayers $130 million to defend him in lawsuits over his tenure. Federal prosecutors brought the misdemeanor charge two weeks before Election Day. He is set for a Dec. 6 trial and could face up to six months in jail if convicted. The sheriff represented the last vestige of a movement started a decade ago by Arizona politicians who advocated for local police to crack down on illegal immigration. Members of the movement saw Arpaio as the stalwart who could be counted on to vigorously enforce state laws aimed at curbing immigrant smuggling and employers who hire people in the country illegally. The movement gradually lost steam after immigrant smuggling in Arizona declined and the courts threw out the state's most stringent immigration laws. Arpaio didn't start out as an immigration enforcer. Shortly after his first election, the retired federal drug agent won high marks from voters for jailing inmates in tents in Phoenix's summer heat, dressing them in pink underwear and denying them coffee and cigarettes. He served them bologna sandwiches on dry bread. The sheriff bragged over the years that his tough jail conditions were the source of his popularity.  ""I can get elected on pink underwear,"" Arpaio told The Associated Press in 2010. His tactics appealed to voters who believed, as he did, that jail should not be comfortable. But his jail management drew a steady stream of lawsuits. Arpaio initially was slow to get into the border battle he came to be known for. He said an Army reservist who detained immigrants at gunpoint in 2005 broke the law by taking it into his own hands. But months later, Arpaio wholeheartedly jumped into immigration enforcement after Arizona passed a law banning immigrant smuggling. He said his officers would target smugglers, not people who come to the country illegally merely to work. In the end, his officers went after mostly immigrants and few smugglers and employers. They arrested 700 immigrants on charges of using fraudulent IDs to get jobs. He also launched patrols known as ""sweeps,"" in which deputies flooded part of a city -- sometimes heavily Latino areas -- to seek out traffic violators and other offenders. Arpaio harnessed his reputation for fundraising before the courts and federal government forced him out of immigration enforcement two years ago. Mostly out-of-state donors gave $12.3 million to his last campaign, with many saying they liked that Arpaio arrested immigrants. Candidates nationwide, including GOP presidential hopefuls, sought his endorsement to bolster their immigration credentials. His image as a crime fighter was tarnished when his office failed to adequately investigate more than 400 sex-crimes cases, including dozens of allegations of child molestation, over a three-year period ending in 2007. Years later, Arpaio apologized for botching the cases but complained bitterly to news reporters about the lasting negative impressions. Though he managed to win re-election after the scandal, Arpaio was slowly dragged down by the racial profiling case. Taxpayers who have already paid $48 million in legal costs in the case will be feeling the financial pain for years. The costs are expected to reach $72 million, due in large part to court-ordered changes in the agency. ___ Follow Jacques Billeaud at twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud.

And now it falls to President Barack Obama to reassure America that it can survive four years of President Trump. The impulsive billionaire's improbable victory sets in motion a remarkable reversal of fortune for Obama. He had planned to coast through his final months while ushering in a simpatico Hillary Clinton, but will instead spend his time presiding over a country that is divided, anxious and has little idea what's coming next. Riding approval ratings higher than at any time since he was first elected, Obama was poised to become one of the country's most consequential leaders -- a modern-day Franklin Delano Roosevelt, with a wealth of domestic and foreign accomplishments that most presidents would envy. He still may -- but not if Trump succeeds in carrying out what he's said he plans to do. Trump rooted his campaign in a pledge to systematically roll back Obama's achievements, on health care, immigration, climate change, trade, international relations and more, and soon will have the tools to do it: the first single-party control of both Congress and the White House since Obama's first two years in office. Mindful that his legacy could be pulled out from under him, Obama said last week that a Trump victory would mean ""it all goes out the window."" It was unsurprising, then, that the mood at the White House was despondent the day after Trump's triumph. White House aides who had gathered with friends Tuesday to witness the election of the first female president instead found themselves asking the next morning whether the last eight years would end up a fool's errand. There were tears -- lots of them -- on the faces of a few hundred Obama staffers who gathered in the Rose Garden as Obama delivered his post-election statement to reporters. Looking dazed and queasy, they stood on the grass and listened as Obama assured them their efforts hadn't been for naught.  ""That remarkable work has left the next president with a stronger, better country than the one that existed eight years ago,"" Obama said, standing with Vice President Joe Biden. ""Sometimes you lose an argument. Sometimes you lose an election. The path that this country has taken has never been a straight line."" If Obama was as depressed about the election's outcome as most suspected, he didn't show it. White House officials said he felt a responsibility to calm the nation after a bruising, divisive campaign in which the victorious candidate offended wide swaths of the country. Obama's aides said the president took a measure of solace that many of Trump's policy prescriptions have been vague and open-ended, perhaps allowing him more wiggle-room to preserve some of Obama's achievements than other Republicans like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz might have had. And they held out hope that the socially moderate Trump, who once supported abortion rights and has proposed paid family leave programs, might end up having more in common with Obama than is immediately apparent. Yet by reducing Clinton's loss to a version of ""you win some, you lose some,"" Obama glossed over the dark vision of Trump's America he'd painted for voters as the campaign neared the finish. Casting Trump as an existential threat in ways other GOP nominees were not, Obama told rally-goers that the world was ""teetering"" and that ""the fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders."" Less than 12 hours after the race was called for Trump, the White House had softened its tone. The administration noted that as president-elect, Trump is entitled to the same daily intelligence briefing as Obama receives -- one that includes information on U.S. covert operations, information gleaned about world leaders and other data gathered by America's 17 intelligence agencies. Where Obama had once deemed Trump unfit to get anywhere near the nuclear codes, the White House instead referred to policy differences not wholly unlike the ones that previous consecutive presidents have had, with no disastrous consequences for the nation.  ""By relying on our institutions and democratic traditions, demonstrating a faithful commitment to the will of the American people, our democracy hasn't just survived, it has thrived,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. __ EDITOR'S NOTE -- Josh Lederman has covered the White House and national politics for The Associated Press since 2012.

That didn't happen. But the impact of third-party candidates on a race which Trump narrowly won over Clinton will likely be debated Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein pulled in about four percent of the popular vote combined, with final results still being counted. Neither won an Electoral College vote. Independent Evan McMullin lost Utah, where he had been polling neck-and-neck with Trump despite announcing his candidacy only in August. McMullin was on the ballot in 11 states. Although the animus toward Clinton and Trump seemed to make conditions ripe for a third-party candidate to do well, neither Johnson nor Stein was able to project a message above the din and capture the support of a large portion of the electorate. But the percentage of the vote that they did capture will likely be the source of much discussion in the coming days and weeks. Clinton had been expected to win Virginia by a large margin; she squeaked by Trump by about two percentage points. Johnson won 3 percent of the vote in that state, Stein 0.08 percent. ""Tonight there are millions of Americans, I am sad to say, who are in fear that perhaps their liberties will be challenged and threatened under a Trump administration,"" McMullin said to dozens of supporters holding flags with light-up handles at a music venue here. ""This is why a new conservative movement is necessary. And we will not turn our back on this challenge.""  Johnson spent election night in New Mexico, where, with 54 percent of precincts reporting, he was winning 8.6 percent of the vote. Stein live-streamed a party from New York City. Against historical norms, neither garnered as much of the vote as some thought they could in this political climate. The last third-party candidate to win a state, George Wallace, captured 13.5 percent of the vote in 1968, while Ross Perot won nearly 19 percent nationwide in 1992. Johnson ran as a fiscal conservative and social liberal. He said he would sign tax cuts but supported marijuana legalization. He took an expansive view of executive power and agreed with President Obama's executive action to allow the children of undocumented immigrants to remain in the country. He named William Weld, a former Republican governor of Massachusetts, as his running mate, angering many in the libertarian movement. In recent days, Weld all but backed Clinton, ""vouching"" for her on MSNBC and stating on CNN that she had gotten a ""pretty raw deal"" with the focus on her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Johnson also hurt his cause with well-publicized gaffes, including asking ""What is Aleppo?"" when queried about the city that epitomizes the Syrian civil war's brutality and refugee crisis. ""None of the third-party candidates this year have really captivated disaffected voters or voters on the left or the right who want another option. Part of it is candidate quality,"" said Matthew Dean Hindman, a professor of political science at the University of Tulsa. ""I think part of it is sort of the polarized nature of politics today, driving voters to strategically vote for one party over another,"" he said. Stein ran on a platform of ending corporate influence in government, including that of the pharmaceutical industry. She called for an economy that would rely on renewable energy by 2030 and said the government should provide a job to anyone who couldn't find private-sector employment. A physician, she expressed skepticism about vaccines. Even though he lost Utah, McMullin has given some residents hope that an alternative to one of the major parties can make inroads. He espoused traditionally conservative principles, including opposing abortion and same-sex marriage, and returning more power to the states. He spent a decade in the CIA, including in counterterrorism efforts, and was said to have had a talent for recruiting extremists as assets. He said he learned that power needs to be used judiciously and called for Pentagon reform. McMullin, a Mormon who was born in Utah and attended college here, particularly appealed to Mormon voters turned off by Trump, a brash, thrice-married New Yorker whose views on immigration, refugees and women many found off-putting. Crisscrossing the state in recent weeks, McMullin painted himself as a principled alternative to Trump and Clinton. ""Somebody had to stand up for equality and liberty in this election. Especially, a conservative needed to do this,"" McMullin said. Robin Ball, 36, teared up after meeting McMullin at a diner on Monday. She said she considered her vote for him one of belief rather than protest. As David Brown, 41, put it: ""My conscience is clear voting for someone like Evan McMullin."" Ralph Nader, a four-time candidate, including twice with the Green Party, said McMullin's campaign would ""set a model. It will encourage people just to run in their home state."" Nader said he thinks that the system is stacked against third-party candidates, from the way they are written about. Calling a third-party candidate a spoiler is ""bigoted,"" he said. And he objected to the fact that they must reach a certain polling threshold to appear in presidential debates. Among the biggest deficits such candidates suffer is a lack of funding. Johnson raised about $11 million, Stein about $3.5 million and McMullin about $1 million, compared with the hundreds of millions put forward for Trump and Clinton. ""In Florida, I'm not seeing the Gary Johnson ads,"" said Warren Redlich, a lawyer who ran for governor of New York as a libertarian. But Johnson and the others had additional liabilities, Redlich said, including, in Johnson's case, the lack of a coherent message. ""If you were to ask the average voter who's heard of Gary Johnson what he stands for, I don't think they know,"" he said. ""It's a blown opportunity,"" he said.  "

That didn't happen. But the impact of third-party candidates on a race which Trump narrowly won over Clinton will likely be debated Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein pulled in about four percent of the popular vote combined, with final results still being counted. Neither won an Electoral College vote. Independent Evan McMullin lost Utah, where he had been polling neck-and-neck with Trump despite announcing his candidacy only in August. McMullin was on the ballot in 11 states. Although the animus toward Clinton and Trump seemed to make conditions ripe for a third-party candidate to do well, neither Johnson nor Stein was able to project a message above the din and capture the support of a large portion of the electorate. But the percentage of the vote that they did capture will likely be the source of much discussion in the coming days and weeks. Clinton had been expected to win Virginia by a large margin; she squeaked by Trump by about two percentage points. Johnson won 3 percent of the vote in that state, Stein 0.08 percent. ""Tonight there are millions of Americans, I am sad to say, who are in fear that perhaps their liberties will be challenged and threatened under a Trump administration,"" McMullin said to dozens of supporters holding flags with light-up handles at a music venue here. ""This is why a new conservative movement is necessary. And we will not turn our back on this challenge.""

Celebrations, it seemed, were in order.  ""Historic day,"" his boss wrote back. ""There's still some good in America,"" McDonald responded. Just before midnight, he said he could barely believe it.  ""The people have spoken,"" he cheered. ""The people said, 'Enough is enough.'"" In a presidential contest that bitterly divided the nation, the election of Donald Trump to the White House left America's voters just as polarized. For those watching as the results came in, there was exuberance, despair -- and surprise on both sides of the political aisle. McDonald was overjoyed. He's vice president of collections at a bank in Tazewell, Virginia, where he spends his days working with neighbors who are losing cars, homes and businesses amid a collapsing coal economy. Trump is viewed a savior there, the man McDonald believes will deliver new prosperity to working class communities.  ""He's going to bring back jobs. He's going to bring back faith in America,"" he said. On the other side of the nation, Democrat Terry Zee Lee felt something far different.  ""I fear for our country,"" said the 68-year-old Lee, who earlier Tuesday had no doubt in her mind that Hillary Clinton would be elected president. ""I cannot imagine that as well as our country is doing right now, with all the improvements and all the gains we've had for equal opportunity and social justice -- it just makes me sick to my stomach that my fellow Americans have that much hate and misogyny."" Election night turned into a nail-biter for millions of Americans as the nation waited for the final tally of votes from a small number of states, mostly in the upper Midwest. But Trump victories in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, along with traditional Republican strongholds, gave the real estate mogul the path he needed to win. The final determination of who would become the nation's 45th president extended an already long, acrimonious race. In Hagerstown, Maryland, Sebiila Odin, an African-American who supported Clinton, wondered about the prospects of the nation coming back together after such a rancorous campaign. She joked that her son asked her, ""'You want to go to Canada for four years?'"" But Odin said that on Wednesday, ""I'm going to get up and go to work. And I'm just going to be like, he's in the White House. And hopefully, four years from now, we'll win it back. "" Even as Democrats sought to make sense of the outcome, Republicans pointed to Trump's outsider status as part of his unorthodox appeal. Josetta Smith, a 38-year-old Tazewell, Virginia, resident who'd never even registered to vote before this year, was so wowed by Trump that when she renewed her license plate, she got a personalized tag -- ""GO-TRMP"" -- as a show of support.  ""He's not a politician. But that's awesome because he always speaks whatever he thinks,"" said Smith, who's unemployed. ""He's completely determined to have his way, which is good and bad. Whatever he says he wants to make happen, he's going to make happen."" John Fusaro, a 50-year-old Dallas resident who works for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, believes Trump's success reflects the public's deep frustration with the so-called ""establishment.""  ""I think people are just tired of these people in Washington thinking we work for them, when they work for us,"" he said. Fusaro stayed up late watching the results come in -- feeling, like much of America, stunned.  ""When this first started, I didn't think Trump would get this far, and I'm kind of a little bit in shock. But I'm very relieved. He's had no support from the Republican establishment, or very little support. He had a lot of negative media. And despite all that, he's done very well. That's just a testament to the man's will and ability."" Fusaro had no illusions, however, about what it might take to begin healing the fractured electorate. Trump, he said, must appeal for unity.  ""I think he just needs to get out there and let them know that he's not the monster that he's been made out to be, and he will work for every American,"" Fusaro said. ""And hopefully they'll begin to trust him once he gets in office. That's what I'm hoping for anyway."" ___ Claire Galofaro in Tazewell, Virginia, Matt Sedensky in Atlanta, Peter Banda in Denver and Pauline Arrillaga in Phoenix contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to change Odin's first name to Sebiila, not Sebiina.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/181230e8-a5f7-11e6-ba59-a7d93165c6d4_story.html	In Louisiana, David Duke’s hopes for a Trump effect are crushed	"  MANDEVILLE, La. -- The weekend before the election, David Duke was feeling good. He was confident that Donald Trump, whom he'd endorsed despite the nominee's frequent protests, would win the presidency. He was confident that his own race for the Senate would break his way, too, despite a late start and media coverage that treated him like a curiosity. ""I've always got three or four times what I've got in any poll,"" the former Klansman said. ""It happened last time I ran for Congress, in 1999."" But Trump, who was polling strongly in states across the country Tuesday night and who easily won Louisiana, provided no lift for Duke, undermining the suggestion that Trump's candidacy, with its appeal to white voters, could be a political boon for the far right. Duke had not won office since George H.W. Bush was president. He had never risen higher than the state legislature -- his runs for U.S. Senate and governor drew national attention and ended in landslide defeats. And Duke's latest bid for the Senate was equally unpopular, according to early returns, which had him at about 3 percent. From the first day of his presidential campaign, with his warning about Mexico ""not sending their best"" immigrants across the border, Trump echoed some of the rhetoric that white nationalists had pitched for decades. He never made the strategy explicit. He rejected accusations that his was a racial appeal and denounced Duke specifically, with greater intensity every time he was brought up. In the final week of the campaign, Trump's son Eric said Duke deserved a ""bullet,"" and conservative commentator Ann Coulter, who had backed Trump from the outset, joked that Duke existed only when Democrats needed him.  [What's the alt-right? A primer.]  But the strategy Trump used to come closer to the presidency than any poll had predicted, and any Republican strategist thought possible, was still one people like Duke had dreamed of. White nationalists had argued that the Republican Party should double down on whites instead of trying to appeal to minorities -- indeed, that it had only a few years to do so before being overwhelmed by nonwhites. Jared Taylor, the editor of American Renaissance, wrote column after column, and was ostracized from conference after conference, for saying so. But voters in Louisiana drew a sharp distinction between Trump and Duke. They embraced the presidential candidate while rejecting Duke's efforts to ride his coattails. The vote could ease concerns that Trump would mainstream some of the white-supremacist movements or ideas that have long existed on the far edges of American politics. In the early 1980s, when nonwhites made up a far smaller proportion of the electorate, Duke imagined an America that could officially segregate them: Cubans around Miami, blacks in a stretch of the old South. ""The exploding numbers of nonwhites are slowly wrapping formerly white nations in a dark human cocoon,"" Duke wrote in 1983. ""Should a butterfly emerge, or a beast that has haunted the ruins of every great white civilization that submitted to invasion by immigration and racial miscegenation?"" When he entered politics, Duke's tone softened. As a vote-winning politician, he proposed drug tests for welfare recipients, inveighed against Japan taking American jobs and attacked affirmative action. When he went statewide, however, he faltered. Duke's simple solutions were punctured by journalists who wanted to see how his philosophy could apply to people's lives. And the process repeated itself Tuesday. After giving out the address of his election night party, at his home north of Lake Ponchartrain, Duke changed course. The party would be limited to family and friends, as the Senate race was falling short of expectations. But Trump was more than making up for that. ""This is a historic moment,"" Duke said. ""If he goes on to win this race, it is a vital victory for taking America back.""  Read more:        "
