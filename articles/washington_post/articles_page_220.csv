But how will you combat hate?	"    President-elect Donald Trump delivered the convocation at Liberty University last January in Lynchburg, Virginia, as a candidate for the GOP nomination. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)   To the evangelicals who voted for Donald Trump: I believe you. I believe in you. I believe you love others. I believe you are doing your best. I believe you want good for America. As a fellow evangelical, a local church pastor, and a seminary professor, I believe you want to be true to the gospel -- to the ""good news."" In supporting Trump, I believe you did what you thought to be right by trying to vote for the lesser evil. I believe you are not a racist, a misogynist, or a white nationalist because you voted for him. I believe you try to love your non-white neighbors, your Muslim coworkers, and your gay family members. I know you feel marginalized and shamed for your values.   [White evangelicals voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, exit polls show]   As evangelicals, we seek to follow Jesus, who was a blue-collar worker living far from a corrupt cultural center, and he was pushed aside by those in power. Jesus had a complaint against a government that had gotten too big and was beholden to foreign interests. Jesus challenged that and called for another way. I believe you see your vote for Trump as a call for another way, even if it was a vote for the lesser evil. I believe you. But a spike in hate crimes and harassment since the election reveals the consequences of voting for the lesser evil. The empowerment of hatred because of Trump is now being felt across America: A woman was groped in the aisle of a grocery store in Grand Rapids, Mich., Swastikas and Trump's name were spray-painted on windows in Philadelphia; a Chinese American woman said she was harassed by a white man in Minneapolis and told to ""Go Back to Asia.""   [Hate crimes against Muslims hit highest mark since 2001]   Trump was elected with the support of four out of five evangelicals -- people of the ""good news."" But countless stories since his election show that, for people of color, women, and Muslims, his election has been very bad news. I believe enabling this hatred was not your desire. You were just voting for the lesser evil. But if you do not confront racism, misogyny, and Islamophobia wherever you see it, then your vote for the lesser evil will become a vote for hate. If you do not press for justice against hate crimes in your neighborhoods, then your vote for the lesser evil will become a vote for the oppression of people of color. If you do not make your churches a place of respect for women, then your vote for the lesser evil will become a vote for sexism. If you do not live in a way that proclaims the dignity of all people made in the image of God, then your vote for the lesser evil will become a vote for bigotry and xenophobia. You voted for Trump on Nov. 8. How will you vote today and every day moving forward?   Will your vote be counted as ""good news"" before a watching world?   [Hopeful and relieved, conservative white evangelicals see Trump's win as their own]   Will you vote daily against racism at work through your hiring practices and your conversations over coffee? Will you vote daily against sexism in the respect you show to women and the messages you send your children? Will you vote daily against bullying by calling attention to cruelty when you see it and by overcoming your discomfort in the presence of a gay person? These votes are being tallied every day. What will they reveal? Will you surprise those who feel the word ""evangelical"" is synonymous only with conservative, white, middle-class Republicans? Will you show them that you embrace all of God's children? To my white evangelical voters for Trump: Will you show that you are a people of good news? I, for one, believe you. And I believe in you. I believe we can do better. I believe we will.    Geoff Holsclaw is professor at Northern Seminary and a pastor at Life on the Vine in the Chicago suburbs.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  Merrick Garland's last, long-shot chance at being confirmed as a Supreme Court justice has now vanished: A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a case that sought to force the Senate to take up his nomination. Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, has languished without Senate action since March, when President Obama nominated him to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia. A New Mexico lawyer filed suit in August, seeking to force Republican leaders in the Senate to act on the nomination, arguing that they had ""created a constitutional crisis that threatens the balance and separation of power among our three branches of government.""   [This New Mexico lawyer is suing the Senate to force action on Merrick Garland]   The plaintiff, Steve Michel, said he had the legal standing to bring the case because he is among those who have ""had the effectiveness of their vote for United States senators diminished"" because the senators who represent him have been denied their ability to vote on Garland's nomination. But U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras didn't buy it. In a five-page opinion issued Thursday, Contreras held that ""Mr. Michel has not shown that he has suffered an individualized injury such that he can maintain this action."" ""This alleged diminution of his vote for United States Senators is the type of undifferentiated harm common to all citizens that is appropriate for redress in the political sphere: his claim is not that he has been unable to cast votes for Senators, but that his home-state Senators have been frustrated by the rules and leadership of the United States Senate. This is far from the type of direct, individualized harm that warrants judicial review,"" Contreras wrote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced in the hours after Scalia's February death that he would not act on any Obama nomination, thus leaving the task to the next president. Democrats fumed for months over the unprecedented blockade, but McConnell's gamble paid off: Republicans won the White House and kept their Senate majority, paving the way for President-elect Donald Trump to name a Supreme Court nominee early next year. Even if Michel had won a favorable ruling from Contreras, there was virtually no scenario that might have resulted in Garland's confirmation. The Senate is expected to be in session for only three more weeks before the end of the current Congress, and the Senate would have appealed any adverse decision issue, cutting into that time frame. And even if the Supreme Court itself ordered the Senate to act on Garland's nomination, individual senators could not be compelled to confirm him. ""I can't say I'm surprised,"" Michel said Thursday, noting that the standing issue ""was sort of the hurdle I knew going into this."" But he said he had not ruled out further litigation: ""I'm going to look at it. This is too important of an issue to just let go. ... I've invested too much in this effort to just let it go if there's an opportunity. But I've got to be realistic here."" In another long-odds effort to force Garland onto the high court, more than 150,000 people have signed a petition hosted on the White House website urging Obama to ""exercise his independent constitutional right"" to simply appoint Garland to the court. That seizes on an argument from one lawyer who says the Senate waived its constitutional role of advise and consent, thus allowing for a direct appointment. There is no indication the Obama administration embraces that view, but there are enough signatures on the petition to warrant an official White House response."

A reality show.	"   A German soldier keeps watch during a patrol near Taloqan, the capital of Afghanistan's Takhar province, in April 2012. (Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images)  Advertising Germany's military as a success story is hardly an easy task -- even if one ignores its troubled history. Abroad, it is often perceived as a lightweight army, restricted by stringent rules and a decades-old political consensus that post-World War II Germany should exert its influence by diplomacy rather than force. Two years ago, the lack of funding for the Bundeswehr made international headlines when the army was so underequipped that soldiers had to hide the dearth of real arms by substituting broomsticks for heavy machine guns during a NATO exercise. At home, youths have been wary of joining the army of a country in which even today few people find words of praise for those who serve. That's all supposed to change now, however, with the help of a new reality show, produced by the German military and aimed at recent high school graduates. ""Die Rekruten"" (""The Recruits"") follows 12 young Bundeswehr soldiers for three months. The YouTube series has been surprisingly popular among Germans, with some episodes reaching up to 900,000 viewers. Young recruits film themselves doing push-ups. Others talk about their tattoos. Most popular so far? A video titled ""culture shock,"" in which one of the soldiers, Julia, has to take the jewelry from her piercings upon arrival at the barracks. It's an unusual PR strategy, for unusual times.    German President Joachim Gauck called for the country to focus more on its own security this week. Those were unusual words for a German president: Most of his predecessors had advocated disarmament instead of more military spending. Even before his inauguration, President-elect Donald Trump has already forced Germany, and other European nations, to rethink their security measures. So far, Europe has mainly relied on the United States to defend it as part of NATO. Trump's contradictory statements on that matter have raised worries that the United States might no longer be a reliable military ally. ""The Recruits"" was produced at a time when Germans could still laugh about the prospects of a Trump presidency, assuming it would never become reality. Despite its reality TV show origins, it would be too easy to dismiss the idea of the video series as a cheap advertising campaign. Some of the episodes allow recruits to reflect on somber issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and the risks associated with missions abroad, for instance. But in many other ways, the video series reveals more about why Germany lacks young recruits, rather than how it seeks to change that. None of the episodes focus on what would be the most central argument for joining the military in other countries: serving the nation. Since World War II, Germans have historically refrained from showing too much (or any) national pride. German flags can only rarely be seen in public -- although this has changed a bit in recent years, especially during soccer championships. Germans' unwillingness to show too much national pride has affected the Bundeswehr more than any other organization. Soldiers have long complained about a lack of respect and support from politicians, as well as from the wider public. ""The Recruits"" might be the biggest effort so far by the German military to change that. Read more:  Germany's army is so underequipped that it used broomsticks instead of machine guns"

Don’t let them do it to Muslims.	"   Children in the Manzanar internment camp in California. (AP/National Park Service)  There is dangerous talk these days by those who have the ear of some at the highest levels of government. Earlier this week, Carl Higbie, an outspoken Trump surrogate and co-chair of Great America PAC, gave an interview with Megyn Kelly of Fox News. They were discussing the notion of a national Muslim registry, a controversial part of the Trump administration's national security plans, when Higbie dropped a bombshell: ""We did it during World War II with Japanese, which, you know, call it what you will,"" he said. Was he really citing the Japanese American internment, Kelly wanted to know, as grounds for treating Muslims the same way today? Higbie responded that he wasn't saying we should return to putting people in camps. But then he added, ""There is precedent for it."" Stop and consider these words. The internment was a dark chapter of American history, in which 120,000 people, including me and my family, lost our homes, our livelihoods, and our freedoms because we happened to look like the people who bombed Pearl Harbor. Higbie speaks of the internment in the abstract, as a ""precedent"" or a policy, ignoring the true human tragedy that occurred. I was just a child of 5 when we were forced at gunpoint from our home and sent first to live in a horse stable at a local race track, a family of five crammed into a single smelly stall. It was a devastating blow to my parents, who had worked so hard to buy a house and raise a family in Los Angeles. After several weeks, they sent us much farther away, 1,000 miles to the east by rail car, the blinds of our train cars pulled for our own protection, they said. We disembarked in the fetid swamps of Arkansas at the Rohwer Relocation Center. Really, it was a prison: Armed guards looked down upon us from sentry towers; their guns pointed inward at us; searchlights lit pathways at night. We understood. We were not to leave.   [Trump is following all the rules of a reality TV villain]        Filmmaker Frank Chi captures young Muslim Americans reading letters written by Japanese Americans during their time held in internment camps in the midst of World War II. (Frank Chi/ Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center)   My parents did their best to make life seem normal. As a child, I very readily accepted our new circumstance and adjusted to it. As far as I was concerned, it was normal to line up to use the common latrine, or to eat wretched grub in a common mess hall, prisoners in our own country. It was normal for us to share a single small barrack with no privacy whatsoever. And it was normal to stand each day in our makeshift classroom, reciting the words to the Pledge of Allegiance, ""With liberty and justice for all,"" as I looked past the U.S. flag out the window, the barbed wire of the camp just visible behind it. Not until I was older did I understand the irony of those words and the injustice that had been visited on so many of us. As I studied civics and government in school, I came to see the internment as an assault not only upon an entire group of Americans, but upon the Constitution itself -- how its guarantees of due process and equal protection had been decimated by forces of fear and prejudice unleashed by unscrupulous politicians. It had been a Democratic administration at the time, under Franklin D. Roosevelt, that had ordered us to the camps, proving that demagoguery and race-baiting knows no party. It took decades for the United States to own up to what it had done and officially apologize for the internment, offering symbolic monetary reparations to the survivors. I donated my own check to the Japanese American National Museum, whose mission, like mine, has been to help ensure the mistakes of the past are never repeated. That is why these words by Higbie, which ominously are representative of much of the current thinking in the incoming administration, have reopened very old and very deep wounds. This was not the first time the Trump camp had raised the internment. When he did so before, it wasn't as the historical warning it should be, but as a precedent for what might yet come. In late 2015, during the presidential primary, Trump actually went on the record with Time magazine stating that he did not know whether he would have supported or opposed the internment. ""I would have had to be there at the time to tell you, to give you a proper answer,"" he said. He argued that FDR was ""one of the most highly respected presidents,"" and that what he was suggesting was ""no different from FDR.""  Trump hedged his response with a nod to the horror of the camps, but tellingly did not disavow them: ""I certainly hate the concept of it. But I would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer.""   [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: What it means to be black during a Trump administration]        Questions over the idea of creating a database of Muslim immigrants are coming up as President-elect Donald Trump forms his new administration. A Trump surrogate defended the idea on Fox News, saying the treatment of Japanese Americans during WWII was ""precedent."" (The Washington Post)   Higbie similarly has kept open the specter of the camps, in one breath stating that he does not favor the idea, but in the very next noting, ""We have to protect America first."" Indeed, in a follow-up interview with the New York Times, Higbie doubled down on the unthinkable: ""There is historical, factual precedent to do things [that] are not politically popular and sometimes not right, in the interest of national security."" Let us all be clear: ""National security"" must never again be permitted to justify wholesale denial of constitutional rights and protections. If it is freedom and our way of life that we fight for, our first obligation is to ensure that our own government adheres to those principles. Without that, we are no better than our enemies. Let us also agree that ethnic or religious discrimination cannot be justified by calls for greater security. During World War II, the government argued that military authorities could not distinguish between alleged enemy elements and peaceful, patriotic Japanese Americans. It concluded, therefore, that all those of Japanese descent, including American citizens, should be presumed guilty and held without charge, trial or legal recourse, in many cases for years. The very same arguments echo today, on the assumption that a handful of presumed radical elements within the Muslim community necessitates draconian measures against the whole, all in the name of national security. It begins with profiling and with registries, but as Trump and Higbie have made clear, once the safety of the country is at stake, all safeguards are off. In their world, national security justifies actions that are ""sometimes not right,"" and no one really can guarantee where it will end.   [Donald Trump's new favorite slogan was invented for Nazi sympathizers]   We cannot permit this invidious thinking, discredited by history at the cost of so much misery and suffering by innocents, to take root once again in America, let alone in the White House. The stigmatization, separation and labeling of our fellow humans based on race or religion has never led to a more secure world. But it has too often led to one where the most vulnerable pay the highest price. The Constitution and the government exist in large measure to protect against the excesses of democracies. This is particularly salient when, in an atmosphere of fear or mistrust, one group is singled out and vilified, as Japanese Americans were during World War II and as Muslim Americans are today. How terrible it is to contemplate, once again, that the government itself might once more be the very instrument of terror and division. That cannot happen again. We cannot allow it.          1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

The research, by the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit organization focusing on criminal justice issues, aims to take a comprehensive look at the fast-growing phenomenon of social media-monitoring by law enforcement. Using public records, the Brennan Center tracked spending by 151 local law enforcement agencies that have contracted with start-ups that siphon data from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other sites, largely out of the public eye. ""The numbers we have are massively understated,"" said Faiza Patel, co-director of the organization's liberty and national security program, pointing out that agencies don't always have any obligation to report their use of the software. ""But it gives an indication of a phenomenon that is growing rapidly and flying under the radar."" Top spenders were the City of Los Angeles, the Texas Department of Public Safety, the County of Sacramento, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the County of Macomb, which is a large county in Michigan. Each spent roughly $70,000 over the past three years, Brennan found. In recent years, a crop of start-ups -- with names like Geofeedia, SnapTrends and Dataminr -- has sprung up to analyze data posted publicly on popular social media sites. These start-ups buy information from the social sites and analyze the data to look for trends or monitor events taking place at a certain location. Corporations buy the analysis, along with nonprofits, financial firms and, increasingly, law enforcement. The law enforcement trend has exploded in the past two years, Patel said. Law enforcement officials say the tools can be useful because sometimes people who commit crimes brag about them on social media. Witnesses also may offer up clues, such as posting that they heard gunshots or posting video of events. But advocates worry that the tools are being increasingly used to monitor protests and other public gatherings, and to target individual activists. The Oregon Department of Justice, for example, used software called Digital Stakeout to monitor people who used more than 30 hashtags on social media including #BlackLivesMatter, according to the American Civil Liberties Union and a lawsuit filed by one of the people who claimed to have been monitored. Last month, thousands of people used a location-based tool called ""Facebook Check-In"" at a protest against an oil pipeline at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. Many who ""checked-in"" on Facebook were not physically at Standing Rock but wanted to thwart police who were reportedly monitoring people who were there. Police have denied using such tools at Standing Rock. Brennan and other advocates say they fear that tracking could increase under President-elect Donald Trump. ""Today the main way protesters organize is online,"" Patel said. ""This is a new administration that has been frankly threatening to the act of political protest."" Brennan's data, which tracked local law enforcement and did not examine the much larger spending by federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was largely obtained from public records requests. The International Association of Police Chiefs has reported that at least 550 law enforcement agencies across 44 states use such tools to gather intelligence. The rise of social media for law enforcement has become an increasingly perilous issue for technology companies. The companies do not bar law enforcement agencies from buying their data. The companies prohibit its misuse but don't aggressively track how third parties use it. Last month, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter cut ties with Geofeedia, a software company whose tools have been used by law enforcement to track racially charged protests in Baltimore and in Ferguson, Mo."

Clinton appeared to have multiple paths to triumph, while Trump needed to prevail in most of the battleground states to secure an upset. Control of the Senate was also at stake, with Democrats needing to net four seats if Clinton wins the White House. The candidates divided the night's first race calls, with Trump carrying reliably Republican Kentucky and Indiana, and Clinton winning liberal Vermont. The 45th president will inherit an anxious nation, deeply divided by economic and educational opportunities, race and culture. The economy has rebounded from the depths of recession, though many Americans have yet to benefit. New terror threats from home and abroad have raised security fears. Clinton asked voters to keep the White House in Democratic hands for a third straight term. She cast herself as heir to President Barack Obama's legacy and pledged to make good on his unfinished agenda, including passing immigration legislation, tightening restrictions on guns and tweaking his signature health care law.  ""I know how much responsibility goes with this,"" Clinton said after voting Tuesday at her local polling station in Chappaqua, New York, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at her side. ""So many people are counting on the outcome of this election, what it means for our country, and I will do the very best I can if I'm fortunate enough to win today."" Trump, the New York real estate developer who lives in a gold-plated Manhattan penthouse, forged a striking connection with white, working-class Americans who feel left behind in the changing economy and diversifying country. He cast immigration, both from Latin America and the Middle East, as the root of many problems plaguing the nation and called for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.  ""I see so many hopes and so many dreams out there that didn't happen, that could have happened, with leadership, with proper leadership,"" he said by telephone on Fox News before casting his own ballot in Manhattan. ""And people are hurt so badly."" Seven in 10 Americans who went to the polls Tuesday said immigrants now in the country illegally should be allowed to stay, while just a quarter said they should be deported. More than half oppose building a border wall, according to preliminary results from the exit poll conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. The Republican Party's tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end. Former President George W. Bush and wife Laura Bush declined to back Trump, instead selecting ""none of the above"" when they voted for president, according to spokesman Freddy Ford. Trump set both parties on edge when he refused to say in the third and final debate whether he would accept the election's results, citing with no evidence the possibility of a rigged outcome. His statement threatened to undermine a fundamental pillar of American democracy and raised the prospect that his fervent supporters would not view Clinton as a legitimate president if she won. Asked Tuesday in an interview with Fox News if he would accept the election results, Trump continued to demur, saying ""We're going to see how things play out."" According to the preliminary exit polls, most Americans who voted had at least a moderate amount of confidence that election ballots would be counted accurately. Most problems that did pop up at polling places Tuesday appeared to be routine -- the kinds of snags that come every four years, including long lines, machines not working properly and issues with ballots or voter rolls. Even before Tuesday, almost 45 million people had cast ballots for president. Many expressed relief the end was in sight after an election season in which personal attacks often drowned out the issues.  ""I'm tired of the mudslinging,"" said Laura Schmitt, a 54-year-old Republican from Woodbury, Minnesota, who was voting for Trump. Emetric Whittington, a 51-year-old Democratic mother of three on Chicago's violence-plagued South Side, agreed: ""I can't wait for this night to be over."" Clinton has denounced Trump for calling Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and promoting a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., and for his long line of remarks about women that culminated in an audio in which he bragged about grabbing their genitals. Trump called his opponent ""Crooked Hillary"" for her use of a private email server as secretary of state and her complicated ties to the family's Clinton Foundation.  ""I can't vote for somebody who's so morally reprehensible,"" said Lisa Moore, a 48-year-old Republican from Glen Rock, New Jersey, who picked Clinton. Democrat Charles Ikner of Cross Lanes, West Virginia, opted for Trump, saying it was time for ""fresh blood"" in the White House. In the final days, Clinton was buoyed by FBI Director James Comey's weekend declaration that he wouldn't recommend criminal charges against her following a new email review. Comey announced the inquiry late last month, sapping Clinton's surging momentum and threatening Democrats in down-ballot races. ___ Associated Press writers Bradley Klapper, Vivian Salama, Hope Yen, Jill Colvin and Lisa Lerer and AP Polling Director Emily Swanson contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Baltimore City Board of Elections Director Armstead Jones said that about 17 scanners across the city had jamming issues during the presidential election Tuesday, but all were quickly resolved. At one polling place, a generator went down, Jones said, but he worked with the energy company to make sure power was restored to the area quickly. In the meantime, Jones said voters were still able to cast their ballots. He said ""they had plenty of light."" At a West Baltimore polling place, Jones said a person ""from a certain campaign"" disrupted voters, but was asked to leave by an election judge and complied with the request. Jones said he visited one polling place that had had issues during the April primary election first thing in the morning and had found it ""in disarray"" and abandoned by its chief judge. But Jones said he worked with the other judges on-site and sent ""five or six substitutes"" to the location. Jones said as of about 3 p.m., roughly 96,000 city residents had turned out to vote. He said, ""It's been a great day."" 6:15 p.m. Maryland's elections administrator says overall voter turnout in the state has been ""extraordinary."" Linda Lamone said Tuesday that the board is projecting turnout to be 80 percent or higher, though it's too soon to say for sure what it will be. Polls are open until 8 p.m. Lamone says she wouldn't be surprised if voter turnout is higher than 80 percent. Lamone says voter turnout in the 1992 general election was the previous high, based on available board records. It was 81 percent that year. Long lines have been reported at polls around the state. However, Lamone says in some places voters were in and out in 15 minutes. She says waiting times varied depending on the time of day. ___ 2:45 p.m. Maryland's elections administrator says officials are receiving sporadic reports of voters around the state receiving ballots that have already been marked. Linda Lamone said by telephone Tuesday afternoon that they received similar reports during the primary and she calls it ""human error."" Lamone says voters will sometimes make a mistake on a ballot and hand a used ballot back to poll workers, who are supposed to mark it ""spoiled."" She says some workers are getting so busy they aren't marking them and somehow give a used ballot to another voter. ___ 2:30 p.m. Electronic devices are banned in Maryland polling places, but it seems that Baltimore's top prosecutor couldn't resist sharing capturing the cuteness of her daughter with her ballot and sharing it with the world. State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby tweeted a picture of a girl looking over the ballot in what appears to be a voting booth on Tuesday. She wrote ""We Voted today #DoYourPartAndDoTheSame #We'reWithHer @Hillary Clinton."" The ballot does not appear to be filled out. The tweet was deleted minutes later and replaced with a photo of the girl wearing an ""I Voted"" sticker. Mosby could not be reached for comment. James Cabezas, chief investigator at the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor, says the ban is a regulation, but it has no penalty and isn't a criminal statute. 9:10 a.m. Maryland's elections administrator says a handful of polling places in Baltimore opened late, but she is not hearing of any other problems as voting gets underway around the state. Linda Lamone said by telephone Tuesday morning that the three polling places that opened late, opened within minutes. Lamone says she is hearing of long lines at some polling places in Maryland, something she attributes to ""enthusiastic voters.""
