Greg Abbott had earlier dedicated a monument recognizing the contribution of African-Americans to the state. Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Victor Taylor said four of the arrests were for assault, two for evading arrest, one for disorderly conduct and one for ""interference with public duty."" Two of those arrested were on Capitol grounds and the others on adjacent streets.  ""Some protesters assaulted other protesters,"" Taylor said. ""We don't know for sure which side they were on. A lot of them were co-mingled."" Austin police and state troopers dressed in riot gear and some mounted on horseback had tried to keep the two groups separated. Taylor said the confrontation did not affect the unveiling of the monument, which was in a different part of the grounds. A state helicopter circled overhead. About two dozen individuals with the White Lives Matter group, some of whom were armed, demonstrated against what they called the unequal application of hate crimes laws, which they said are applied in a way that favors minorities. The group said it was a coincidence that its protest was held at about the same time as the ceremony for the monument. White Lives Matter member and protest organizer Ken Reed said into a bullhorn that his group was concerned with ""white people's preservation.""  ""You all are anti-white and anti-American,"" he told the counter-protesters, according to the Austin American-Statesman. The White Lives Matter group was shouted down by several hundred counter-protesters, who held up signs that said ""Stand Against Hate"" and ""Black Lives Matter."" One of them, Marie Catrett, said she came to stand up for the rights of minorities.  ""I think they are full of hatred,"" Catrett said about the White Lives Matter group. ""They don't represent our community or our values."" During the unveiling ceremony, Abbott told a crowd in attendance that the monument honors African-Americans who helped grow Texas.  ""The fact is African Americans have shaped this land that we are on today since long before it was even named the state of Texas. They fought for their own freedom. They fought for the freedom of Texas and the freedom of the United States of America,"" Abbott said. The monument is located on the Capitol's south lawn, close to other monuments that honor Confederate soldiers for their service during the Civil War. The new monument features the African-American experience in Texas, from exploration in the 1500s to slavery and emancipation to achievement in arts and science. It will be the 21st monument on the Capitol grounds and the second memorial dedicated to a specific ethnic group. Texas installed the Tejano Monument to Mexican-American history in 2012.

Only for a privileged few	" NEW YORK -- The American dream of a blissful retirement, free of financial worries, is dying. Most U.S. households are heading for a worse lifestyle in retirement than they had while they were working, because they simply aren't saving enough, experts say. Thirty-five percent of households in their prime earning years or later have nothing saved in a retirement account and no access to a traditional pension, according to an AP analysis of savings data from the Federal Reserve. Among households that do have some savings, the typical amount is $73,200. That's about 15 months of the median household's income. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE -- This is part of Divided America, AP's ongoing exploration of the economic, social and political divisions in American society. ___ One group doesn't have to worry as much: the richest 10 percent of households. They typically have more than $413,000 in a retirement account, according to the analysis of the Fed's latest data, which is from 2013. The rest of us look a lot more like Nancy Harvey, a 54-year-old child-care center owner in Oakland, California, who has less than $2,000 saved. Her plan, as of now, is to continue with real-estate classes in hopes that it can provide a second job.  ""I have to work and pray and hope my health continues to remain good so that I can continue to work,"" she says. ""I still have a mortgage and all the insurance that goes along with that, and I have to pay payroll for my employees, which is really important to me. I can honestly say I'm frightened about the future."" Harvey isn't alone, as the gap widens between the few households who don't have to worry about a comfortable retirement and everyone else. The anxiety even stretches across political affiliations. Nearly equivalent percentages of Democrats and Republicans say they're not managing very well in retirement planning, a recent survey from Lincoln Financial found. The looming crisis is the result of a system that's increasingly put workers in charge of saving for and managing their own retirement. Because the U.S. households at the top have reaped most of the income gains over the last decade -- and because they have disproportionately more access to retirement plans to begin with -- experts say the gap in retirement savings is only growing wider. They're expecting to see more elderly Americans working longer, moving in with their kids and tapping assistance programs.  ""Only the privileged have access to a secure retirement,"" says Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at the New School for Social Research. THE INCOME DIVIDE It's easier to save when you're making more money, and the vast majority of the income gains have gone to the top in recent years. The top 10 percent of U.S. households made more than $162,180 last year, up 6 percent from a decade earlier after adjusting for inflation. For middle-income Americans, incomes have barely stayed ahead of inflation. Lower-income households are making less than a decade ago. The benefit of making more money goes beyond having more to save. Higher-income households also get a bigger after-tax benefit from putting money into a 401(k) or another tax-advantaged account. With traditional pensions increasingly becoming extinct, it's grown even more important for Americans to save. Meanwhile, Social Security -- the last line of defense for many retirement plans -- is at risk of having enough money to pay only 79 percent of benefits, starting in 2034. ACCESS TO PLANS The death of the traditional pension means the burden is on us to save, and that's why access to 401(k) and other retirement plans is so important. Most lower-income households will save when they have access to a retirement plan. The problem is that most don't get the opportunity. Eighty percent of high-income working households have access to a 401(k) or similar defined-contribution plan, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. For low-income working households, it's just 35 percent. The low retirement balances mean the majority of households -- 52 percent -- are at risk of having to cut their spending by more than 10 percent after entering retirement, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.  ""For an upper-middle class person, not being able to maintain their standard of living means fewer trips,"" says Alicia Munnell, the center's director. ""But for lower-income people, it can really mean depriving themselves."" POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS To help close the gap, states are trying their own measures. California recently passed a law requiring employers to automatically enroll their workers in a state-run program and deduct money from each paycheck. Experts prefer a broader fix from the federal government but call the state programs an encouraging step. In the meantime, many workers are simply working longer. David Tucker is 74 and still waking at 1:15 each morning to get to his job as a skycap at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C. He says he may consider retiring next year or cutting down to a few days per week. And what would he look forward to in retirement?  ""I would like to feel what it's like to wake up and not go to work,"" he says. ""For a while, that's all I would like to do. I wouldn't worry about anything else."" ___ AP Data Journalist Angeliki Kastanis and AP Business Writers Joseph Pisani and Sarah Skidmore Sell contributed to this report.

State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials ""look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition."" Defense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process. The Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members. ___ 4:30 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information. Coordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team. But Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing. Hoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a ""wider range of agencies."" She says the White House will process those ""on a rolling basis."" ___ 4:26 p.m. Israel's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a ""friend of Israel"" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration. Ron Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies. Dermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, ""including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever."" Trump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. ___ 3:27 p.m. Mitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump. That's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a ""healing meeting."" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced. Romney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a ""phony"" and a ""fraud."" Trump repeatedly referred to Romney as a ""loser."" But the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump.  ""Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Very nice!"" --By Julie Bykowicz ___ 3:15 Vice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats. Pence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington. Pence says he's looking ""forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward."" He adds: ""I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th."" ___ 3:07 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a ""valued player"" on Capitol Hill. Pence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are ""working briskly"" on the transition. Pelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he ""knows the territory."" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care. She says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can. A spokesman says Pelosi also has ""deep concerns"" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser. __ 2:40 p.m. America's future First Lady Melania Trump ""paused her studies"" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris. That's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov. The biography states that Melania Trump ""would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris."" It's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs ""after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia."" That version was later removed from the website. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment ___ 2:15 p.m. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists. Pence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups.  ""Welcome,"" Pence told a mother and her son -- visiting from Brazil. ""So nice to have you all here. Next up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair.  ""So nice to meet you,"" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol."" Slavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name. ___ 1:50 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower. Trump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. It comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election. Kissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. ___ 1:40 p.m. New York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump. Moskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower. She says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are ""positive signs"" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned. But she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that ""they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign."" ___ 10:47 a.m. Vice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can ""rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again."" That's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders. Pence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray. ___ 10:44 a.m. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: ""Buckle up."" That's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor. Congressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs. Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach. Pence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family. ___ 10:10 a.m. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon. The president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy. Sanders says his office received ""many, many"" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon. But he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will ""improve life for working people."" Sanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises. He's speaking to reporters in Washington. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated. ___ 8:50 a.m. Sen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration. Cruz tells Fox News Channel's ""Fox and Friends"" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had ""a far-reaching conversation"" at Trump Tower. But when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that ""the heart of what we talked about"" were solutions for the problems facing the country.  ""I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,"" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as ""Lyin' Ted."" ___ 8:05 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come ""either before or after Thanksgiving"" and says ""it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions."" Conway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency.  ""I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,"" Conway told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" program Thursday.  ""He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,"" and talking to advisers, she said. ""He's ready."" Conway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(J. David Ake/AP)  The Treasury Department announced a new round of tax credits meant to encourage community development in low-income neighborhoods. The Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund said Thursday it will deliver $7 billion in tax credits to 120 organizations across the country. Those groups, spread out across 36 states, the District and Puerto Rico, will use the funds to boost investments to businesses and nonprofits in their communities. ""By attracting private business and development to distressed communities, this tax credit spurs economic growth,"" said Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a statement. In past years, the tax credits have been used to encourage investments that may help improve organizations in struggling communities, such as grocery stores, theaters and schools. For instance, Lew spoke Thursday in Anacostia at Educare DC, a preschool that received low-cost financing through the program in 2009. The school, which educates children from low-income families, used the loan to pay for construction of the building -- a 32,100-square-foot facility with a courtyard, sleek wooden panels and glass walls. On a tour of the school, Lew waved at toddlers playing with building blocks. One little girl in a Hello Kitty sweater offered him a slice of imaginary pizza. ""We created a new learning community for families that wouldn't have had it otherwise,"" said Pyper Davis, executive director of Educare DC. The treasury secretary also met with representatives from some of the organizations that will be receiving tax credits. They talked about how they plan to use the money to help support affordable housing, vocational training programs, charter schools and health centers. ""So many of the communities we work in haven't fully recovered yet from the economic downturn,"" said Annie Donovan, director of the CDFI Fund, which runs the tax credit program. One woman asked him for advice on how to maintain support for the tax credit program among a changing political climate. Lew, who was appointed by President Obama in 2013, will be replaced after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. Lew pointed out that the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund began as a joint effort from both political parties. Still, the organizers of the tax credit program won't have to worry about the political environment in Washington for a couple of years at least. As part of the latest renewal, funding for the New Markets Tax Credits was secured through 2019."

Trump tweeted to condemn ""professional protesters, incited by the media."" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   They're angry. They're afraid. They're upset that Donald Trump is going to be their next president. But many of the protesters who took to the streets in cities across the country over the past week didn't cast a ballot for the candidate who could have beaten him. Instead of voting for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, dozens of protesters in cities from Philadelphia to Portland, Ore., said in interviews this week that they had cast ballots for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, wrote in Sen. Bernie Sanders or, in some cases, failed to vote at all. The NBC affiliate in Portland found that of more than 100 protesters arrested there last week, more than half did not vote in the state. (Clinton still won Oregon, along with most of the other states where the biggest protests have erupted.) So rather than protesting Clinton's loss, people have cited more varied reasons for joining the protests. In addition to voicing opposition to Trump, they say they are expressing anger with the entire political system and their desire to force dramatic change on a host of social and economic fronts. ""The protesting Trump has to do with the emotion that we're all feeling,"" said Ashley Ember, 27, who said she wrote Sanders on her ballot in Philadelphia. If Clinton had won, Ember said, she would have protested that, too.    Protesters in Washington on Tuesday. (Pete Marovich/Bloomberg)  A roiling movement across the country Since Election Day, thousands of people have taken to the streets nationwide. Demonstrations surged in the days after Trump's election, though they seem now to be ebbing. Police say the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, though there have been outbursts of violence in Portland, Oakland and Indianapolis. The protesters have earned the ire of Trump and his surrogates, who have insulted them on television and social media, calling them paid professionals ""incited by the media,"" jobless ""crybabies,"" people with mental disorders and ""goons."" But a week after Trump's unexpected victory, protests that appeared at first as a denunciation of the president-elect have largely given way to more diffuse expressions of frustration among America's left.   ['It's now or never': How anti-Trump protests spread across the U.S.]   A new group calling itself Portland's Resistance published 22 demands ranging from ""clean air and water"" and ""safe streets"" to halting the construction of a local Nestle factory. In Philadelphia, a group called the Socialist Alternative convened more than 100 people for a Monday night meeting on the perils of capitalism and climate change. And in Atlanta and several other cities, anti-Trump marches shifted gears this week into protests focused on the Dakota Access oil pipeline. ""People are there for all different reasons --[there are] signs saying, 'Not my president,' but also 'Viva La Raza,' 'Black Lives Matter,' hella queer folks,"" said Debbie Southorn, a Chicago activist who joined an anti-Trump protest on a whim and wouldn't say who she voted for. ""It's really encouraging,"" said Southorn, 27. ""Like, Whoa, we all see each other right now. We see our different struggles are linked up and connected.""   [D.C. students walk out of class to protest Trump]   Most of the protesters interviewed were in their 20s and appeared to gravitate toward far left politics. In Portland, roughly half of those arrested were 25 or younger. Here are some of their stories: Gary Thomas, 24, Philadelphia Gary Thomas recently lost his job as a janitor in Philadelphia. On Election Day, he said he cast his vote for Stein, though the Green Party candidate was polling in the single digits and was given little chance of victory. Thomas, who is gay and African American, said he could not bring himself to vote for Clinton. ""She didn't represent me as a person,"" he said. ""She didn't connect with me. Bernie Sanders did. I felt like he was speaking from his heart, and for the first time, I felt connected to politics."" The day after Trump's victory, Thomas took to the streets with a sign reading, ""F-- Trump."" And on Monday night, he listened as Philadelphia area socialists talked about the need for a vibrant American third party, and an upcoming march to demand a higher minimum wage.      Anti-Trump demonstrations in Philadelphia mark a third night of protest across the country against the president-elect. (Reuters)   Lamon Reccord, 17, Chicago Lamon Reccord was too young to vote in this year's election, but that didn't stop him from protesting. Reccord, who is black and grew up on Chicago's South Side, has been involved in voter registration drives and political activism since he was in middle school. If he could have voted, he said he probably would have chosen Stein, who he said he's ""more sold on."" But Reccord said he would still rather see Clinton in office than Trump, a man who, Reccord said, ""promotes racism."" Last Friday, Reccord rallied his friends on Facebook, calling on them to meet outside Chicago's Trump Tower. He did the same on Monday. ""The end goal is to get Donald Trump out of office. To make sure he officially doesn't become the president of the United States of America,"" Reccord said. ""We do not need a president who promotes racism, who inappropriately touches women. And trying to send 3 million illegal immigrants back home, I also consider racist."" Reccord said he expects Trump to push forward with the radical policy shifts he promised on the campaign trail. ""Trump unleashing more racism will impact me as an activist and an organizer, but it is only going to make me more motivated to fight,"" he said.    A demonstration in Atlanta on Friday. (David Goldman/AP)  Dianne Mathowetz, 70, Atlanta Dianne Mathowetz, a retired autoworker in Atlanta, also voted for Stein. She joined an anti-Trump protest in New York last week, but felt more energized at a demonstration Monday back home in Atlanta, where about 50 people had gathered to protest the Dakota Access pipeline, a cause that Mathowetz is passionate about. ""I think the Trump election and [Native American-led protests against the pipeline at] Standing Rock has just galvanized people who are in different kinds of very important issues to come together,"" she said. The crowd beside her included organizers for higher wages, Palestine solidarity activists, immigration reform advocates, antiwar activists and protesters of the death penalty.   ['Not my president': Thousands protest Trump in rallies across the U.S.]   Mitchell Davis, 28, Dallas Mitchell Davis, a collections agent for Wells Fargo, was among the many protesters who said they did vote for Clinton. Davis said he generally identifies as a Republican but that he voted for Clinton because he strongly opposes Trump. Speaking at a protest Monday, Davis said he viewed the demonstrations as part of a larger nationwide response to a historically unpopular new leader. He could imagine a ""tipping point,"" he said, in which the protests might lead to Trump's impeachment or resignation. Davis said he is already making plans to travel to D.C. to protest on Inauguration Day.    The protests in Portland, which police say turned into a riot last week. (Cole Howard/Reuters)  Rick Hofsheier, 43, Portland Rick Hofsheier, an independent voter, also cast a ballot for Clinton, though he said he wished that Sanders had been on the ballot instead. The stay-at-home dad was among 71 people arrested during protests in Portland Saturday night; laughing, Hofsheier said he thinks he was arrested because he got too close to the riot police. Hofsheier had only been at the protest for about half an hour, he said, taking time out from his child care duties. His participation was important, he said, because he believes the nation must send a message to Trump that there's ""a good deal of America who doesn't support [his] racist, misogynist [statements]."" ""There's just a vast group of people that not only oppose it, but vehemently oppose it,"" Hofsheier said, adding that he, too plans to protest on Inauguration Day.   [Kellyanne Conway: It's up to Clinton, Obama to calm anti-Trump protesters]   James Mattox, 27, Portland James Mattox was also arrested in Portland last week. He said he cast his vote for Stein, and would have been equally angry if Clinton won.

Mattox said he did not believe the protests would somehow prevent Trump from taking office. ""But I think it's important for people to voice their opinions about him being president because he's said some really terrible things and people are afraid.""

(Center for Security Policy)  The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that amid the Trump transition team shuffle, Frank Gaffney had been brought in to help advise on security issues. (On Wednesday, the Trump team denied Gaffney was advising the transition, but would not confirm or deny whether he'd spoken with Trump this week.) Last year, we took a closer look at the former Reagan official's controversial career:  In June 2009, shortly after President Obama wrapped up his visits to Saudi Arabia and Egypt, the Washington Times ran an opinion piece suggesting that the newly inaugurated president might be the first to be a Muslim. It starts slowly, saying that Obama might be the ""first Muslim president"" in the same sense that Bill Clinton was once dubbed the ""first black president"" -- which is to say that he's not Muslim, he's just sympathetic to the community. But a few paragraphs later, that conceit evaporates. ""With Mr. Obama's unbelievably ballyhooed address in Cairo Thursday to what he calls 'the Muslim world',"" columnist Frank Gaffney wrote, ""there is mounting evidence that the president not only identifies with Muslims, but actually may still be one himself."" That evidence? Obama referred to the ""Holy Koran."" He said he knew about Islam. And he used the phrase ""peace be upon them"" when mentioning Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. Obama, Gaffney wrote, was engaged in ""the most consequential bait-and-switch since Adolf Hitler duped Neville Chamberlain over Czechoslovakia at Munich.""    This was not the beginning of Gaffney's push to raise questions about the role of Muslims in the United States, but it marked a new phase for him and his organization, the Center for Security Policy. The group hit a new high this week, when its highly questionable survey from June became the centerpiece of Donald Trump's proposal this week to ban any Muslims from entering the country. CNN's Chris Cuomo, confronting Trump about the proposal on Tuesday, told Trump that CNN ""wouldn't even put that poll on the air. It's a hack organization with a guy who was dismissed from the conservative circles for conspiracy theories. You know that."" (Trump disagreed.) Gaffney wasn't always an anti-Muslim conspiracist and gadfly. After years of service in Washington, including staffing senators from both sides of the aisle, he went to work for Ronald Reagan's Defense Department. During Reagan's second term, Gaffney was named acting assistant secretary of defense after his boss, Richard Perle, stepped down. Gaffney didn't get the job, though, and when Frank Carlucci became secretary in November 1987, Gaffney was ""forced out,"" as The Washington Post reported at the time. ""By midnight Friday,"" Sidney Blumenthal (of all people) wrote for the paper, ""Gaffney's belongings were boxed and he was gone. On the spot, Gaffney called a press conference to express his 'worries' about the Reagan administration's eagerness for an arms control agreement."" Out of government service, he founded the Center for Security Policy as a think tank on foreign policy issues. It provided Gaffney with a prominent platform to weigh in on political topics. Within the past decade, though, he has made headlines mostly for questionable and outrageous comments such as his suggestion about Obama. During the 2008 election, Gaffney wrote about the ""jihadist vote"" in another Washington Times piece, suggesting that a large number of Muslims were backing Obama's candidacy financially and with votes. Oh, and that Obama wasn't born in America. (He reiterated that argument before the 2012 election.)    Once Obama was in office, Gaffney was one of the main drivers of the idea that there was a deep-rooted Muslim infiltration of the government and that Muslims wanted to create an alternative system of law in the United States. Gaffney opposed the ""Ground Zero mosque,"" a proposed Muslim center that was to be built near Ground Zero in Manhattan. After he opposed a Muslim community center in Tennessee, the largest paper in that state included Gaffney in a report linking anti-Muslim rhetoric to big paychecks. His insistence that a group called the Muslim Brotherhood had worked its way into the American political sphere (including in the person of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin) eventually meant accusing prominent conservative Grover Norquist of ties to Islamic infiltrators. Gaffney wrote an entire book -- published by the Center for Security Policy -- accusing Norquist of links to that group and others, which in 2011 ended up getting Gaffney banned from the high-profile annual Conservative Political Action Conference. In another famous incident, Gaffney suggested in 2010 that a logo for a missile defense group incorporated the Obama campaign logo and an Islamic crescent. It didn't. The Daily Beast credited Gaffney in 2012 with driving the state and federal push for anti-sharia laws. When New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie defended his appointment of a Muslim to the state judiciary against charges that the governor was abetting the implementation of sharia, Gaffney suggested on a radio show that Christie might be turning a blind eye to treason.

On MSNBC's ""Hardball"" in March 2009, Gaffney argued that Saddam Hussein was behind the Oklahoma City bombing. Earlier this year, Gaffney hosted a white supremacist on his radio show to discuss Muslim immigration and later said he didn't know about his guest's full views. (He did, however, welcome Jared Taylor as ""the author of six books, including 'White Identity.'"") The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate speech, has labeled Gaffney an ""extremist."" On Monday, we evaluated the poll that Gaffney's Center for Security Policy had put together, assessing the attitudes of American Muslims toward sharia law and violence toward the United States. The poll itself has serious methodological problems, but the organization and the man who created and paid for that poll should inspire some skepticism of the results, as well.

Wisconsin's Scott Walker, the incoming chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said Tuesday on MSNBC that Trump elevates ""the possibilities in terms of what we can do to take power out of Washington and send it back to the states"" and more importantly ""back to the people."" Trump perhaps owes no governor more than Walker, a onetime rival of the GOP presidential nominee who ended up endorsing the billionaire. Walker's state had been thought to be a Democratic firewall, but for the first time since 1984, Wisconsin voted for a Republican president and helped Trump win the White House. Walker said the federal government's focus should be on ""fixing and maintaining our existing infrastructure"" not ""grandiose"" high speed rail lines, for example. According to the Pew Research Center poll after the election, people agree that fixing the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure should be a postelection priority. The survey of Clinton and Trump voters also believe drug addiction is another big problem. Florida Gov. Rick Scott called on his fellow Republicans to help Trump bring ""disruptive change"" to Washington. For Scott, that means a complete repeal of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, a point echoed by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who met privately with many of the GOP governors on Monday evening. Scott has been vague about what should be done about the 20 million Americans who got health insurance through the overhaul. During an interview Tuesday, he also did not offer opinions on what should happen in states that expanded Medicaid coverage as part of the overhaul, saying each state would have to make that decision on their own. Scott backed Trump after he won the Florida primary in March and eventually headed up a super PAC that ran ads praising Trump and criticizing Clinton. He said that Trump's victory will give him a ""partner"" who can help on everything from health care to paying for repairs to the aging dike that holds up Lake Okeechobee.  ""I'm very optimistic,"" Scott said. ""I think he's going to be good for Florida and for the country."" Scott said he has already talked to Trump three times since the election. While Scott was a firm backer of Trump before the election, other governors expected to attend this week's conference had differing opinions over Trump. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, the nation's only Latina governor, refused to endorse Trump but did congratulate him after he won. ___ AP writer Laurie Kellman contributed to this report.

Council debates downsizing stand along inaugural parade route	" Some members of the D.C. Council are trying to curtail the city's traditional spending on the presidential inauguration this January, when Republican Donald Trump will assume office in a city that voted overwhelmingly against him. A proposal first floated by council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) would eliminate or drastically reduce the District's funding for a stand built on the steps of the John A. Wilson Building on Pennsylvania Avenue NW to view the inaugural parade. Silverman said her suggestion to scale back the city's inauguration spending was at least partially motivated by nonpartisan concern over wasteful spending. In 2013, the glass-enclosed stand was carpeted, heated and included flat-screen televisions. About 2,000 people -- including elected officials, their staffs and constituents -- used the stand during the course of the day, and it cost about $342,000. But Silverman said she also wanted to trigger a discussion among the District's elected officials about their stance toward the upset presidential victor who will soon be their neighbor on Pennsylvania Avenue. ""President-elect Trump has stated positions that are hostile to our residents,"" Silverman said at a breakfast meeting of the D.C. Council on Tuesday, expressing specific concern about Trump's vows to shrink the federal regulatory agencies that employ many in the District. ""We are a unique jurisdiction. What he does in terms of the federal government will impact us."" The stand would be a small expense when considered against the $18.2 million the District spent for President Obama's second inaugural parade, including the cost of security and additional stands for the media and the inauguration ceremony. Roughly half of that money was ultimately reimbursed by the federal government, according to city budget officials. However, the move could stir ill will with Trump, who has at times been acutely sensitive to snubs by the political class against which he railed throughout his campaign. Silverman said she was still coming to terms with the result of the election, which many predicted would be won by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.  ""I still think this is like an episode of 'Dallas.' Bobby's going to come out of the shower,"" Silverman said. (Bobby Ewing, a character in the popular 1980s soap opera ""Dallas,"" reappeared in the shower on the series a year after the show's writers killed him off. His death was explained as a dream of his ex-wife's.) Silverman's proposal was met with mixed reaction from other council members, some of whom said it would send the wrong signal to depart from past practices. ""I think that it's very important that we as the government of the nation's capital put our best foot forward on Inauguration Day,"" council member Brandon T. Todd (D-Ward 4) said. ""Donald Trump has won. The people have spoken."" ""We would not have the conversation if the Democratic nominee won,"" said Todd, a Clinton supporter.  Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) said that he would like to reduce the costs to taxpayers of the stand outside city hall but that it was important to separate the action from politics. ""It's not in the city's interest to just kind of give the middle finger to the president-elect,"" Allen said. ""My objection is to spending almost a half-million dollars on a viewing stand that's torn down after one day."" "
