Thank You 4 Your Service"" (Epic) On Veteran's Day, A Tribe Called Quest released their first album in 18 years with all four founding members -- Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi -- taking part. Phife, who called himself the ""Funky Diabetic,"" passed away in March from the disease. Rallying around his death, ""We Got It from Here. Thank You 4 Your Service"" caps off one of hip-hop's most storied runs. The Phifer's jovial wordplay and the track dedications to his life are the heart of the record. On some ""champion pen game,"" one minute he's scorching MCs in dancehall mode, the next he's griping about ""surge pricing on these Ubers."" But the Trini gladiator stayed grounded to the end: ""I take zero for granted, I honor my gift."" Spiritual leader Q-Tip is still the Abstract Poetic. And those abstractions run deep. On ""Black Spasmodic"" he's playing bass and dusting the Dead Sea with ""cremated molecules."" Along the way, he harmonizes with Elton John, perks up about a photoshopped ""face on a box of McCormick gravy"" and harnesses the power of a dusty Nairobi Sisters sample. Once content to play the wall, Jarobi even steps to the mic, emitting a confident Native Tongue flair. Longtime cohorts Consequence (who's ""got the game on IV"") and a Rastafarian Busta Rhymes also shine. Other stars show out in force. The Andre 3000 spot is a high point: ""I ain't no almanac/so lick my dictionary."" Kendrick Lamar is hot on his coattails rhyming ""Deuteronomy"" with ""fumigate our economy."" Talib Kweli echoes Gil Scott Heron's ""Winter in America"" and Kanye West is feeling that hook on ""The Killing Season."" Musically, their theories continue to favor the low end as they burrow paths of rhythm. And they still got the jazz, embedding vibrant chord structures in the forward push. The buoyant organ loop on ""The Space Program"" and jubilant hopscotch skitter of ""Dis Generation"" will please the ATCQ purists. New aspects include more live instrumentation (Jack White plugs in), a lean toward rock (Sabbath sample, Stooges influence) and a healthy dose of dub tactics. It's a feel good record but politics and race loom large. As Phife and Q-Tip direct on the opener, ""It's time to go left and not right."" The ideal soundtrack to the Black Lives Matter movement, slide this one right next to Public Enemy's ""Fear of a Black Planet."" At one point, Jarobi dejects, ""Seems like my only crime is having melanin."" But ATCQ is not just holding it down for black people. As Tip iterates on ""We the People.,"" they've got the backs of Mexicans, Muslims, the LGBT community and the impoverished. No longer Midnight Marauders, ""We Got It from Here. "" is about a new day, unbridled expression, cutting through disillusion and healing. But most of all flexing their inimitable vibe y'all. Tribe still getting live y'all.

Judge David Bury issued the temporary order Friday requiring the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector to provide clean mats and thin blankets to migrants held for longer than 12 hours and to allow them to wash or clean themselves. Bury said plaintiffs presented persuasive evidence that basic human needs of migrants were not being met. The case was brought last year by the ACLU, the Morrison and Foerster law firm, and other immigrant rights organizations on behalf of migrants who say the Border Patrol's holding facilities in Arizona are unsanitary, extremely cold and inhumane. Migrants regularly call holding cells ""hieleras,"" the Spanish word for ""freezer.""  ""We believe that the conditions were so below par that when you have people, whether it's two nights or one night sleeping on the floor, that is just below any constitutional standards or norms of decency,"" ACLU senior counsel Dan Pochoda said. Bury issued the temporary injunction after a hearing earlier this week at which both parties made arguments. The Border Patrol has defended its practices and said it's committed to the safety, security and welfare of detainees. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order late Friday. It maintains that it provides migrants with basic human needs in accordance with its own policies, and that agents provide medical care, warmth, sanitation, food and water, and allows detainees to sleep. But photos released this year after a legal battle by the government to keep them under seal show men jammed together under a thin thermal blanket and a woman using a concrete floor strewn with trash to change a baby's diaper. Other photos show rusty toilets, dirty toilet paper on the floor and a malfunctioning water fountain in detention areas. The cells shown in the images are designed to provide short-term shelter for detainees until they can be processed, the agency said. Migrants are usually deported or transferred to the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has long-term detention centers. The order issued Friday applies to the Tucson Sector's eight facilities and is temporary while the case plays out in court, although Pochoda says it's a good indicator that plaintiffs have the upper hand. Bury also ordered the Border Patrol to provide medical screening at all times at all stations, monitor cell temperature, ensure that the stations have working sinks and toilets and other materials ""sufficient to meet the personal hygiene needs"" of migrants, and provide personal products like toilet paper and toothbrushes. Last year, Bury issued sanctions against the Border Patrol over destruction of surveillance video evidence in the case. The coalition receives continuous surveillance video from the Border Patrol as ordered by Bury, said Nora Preciado, a staff attorney for the National Immigration Law Center. The lawsuit was originally filed on behalf of three immigrants but is now a class-action suit. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan on Friday upheld a lower court's decision that said Hawaii law prohibits counties from regulating agricultural matters. The cases stemmed from a decision by Maui voters to ban the cultivation and testing of genetically modified crops in 2014 and related movements on other Hawaiian islands. Kauai County had imposed pesticide notification requirements and mandated pesticide buffer zones, and Hawaii Island had enacted an ordinance banning open air testing of genetically engineered organisms, among other things. But the court held that the county laws are pre-empted by state laws that regulate potentially harmful plants.  ""This is good news for local agriculture in Hawaii, as it clears up potential confusion over who has jurisdiction in regulating agricultural operations, leaving that responsibility with the appropriate government agencies,"" said Bennette Misalucha, executive director of the Hawaii Crop Improvement Association, in an emailed statement. The association's members include major agriculture companies Dow AgroSciences, DuPont Pioneer, Monsanto and Syngenta, which fought the regulations.  ""We will continue to stand and fight with the people of Hawaii against these chemical companies, and part of that is going to be demanding action at the state level to protect the people and the environment,"" said George Kimbrell, senior attorney for the Center For Food Safety, which pushed for the bans. ""We're considering all legal options, including appeal."" Monsanto, which farms genetically engineered seeds to be used by farmers around the world, was part of a group that fought the Maui GMO ban. Monsanto Hawaii employs approximately 1,000 people on Maui, Molokai and Oahu, Dan Clegg, Hawaii business operations lead for Monsanto, in an emailed statement.  ""We're listening and we've heard the concerns some people have about GMOs and today's farming practices,"" Clegg said. ""Our commitment to ongoing dialogue with our neighbors doesn't stop today."" Those who pushed for increased regulation of pesticides and GMOs in Hawaii vowed to introduce new legislation in the state's upcoming session.  ""What the decision makes clear is that it is the state's responsibility to meaningfully protect against undue harm from pesticides, whether it's to workers on a field or to kids in schools nearby, and we have an obligation to make sure that safety is paramount,"" said Rep. Chris Lee, chairman of the Hawaii House Committee on Energy and Environmental Protection. ""And looking forward, I do think there's a middle road that can satisfy everyone that ensures public safety and doesn't put an undue burden on anyone."" Kimbrell was pleased the judge also said according to federal law, state and local governments can regulate some commercial crops, namely those that have been deregulated by the federal government after they've gone through testing. Even so, allowing counties to do that would require a change in state law. He was disappointed the ruling stated that only the federal government could regulate experimental field trials of commercial crops. The Maui case ruling said scientific studies have not shown that food produced from genetically engineered crops pose any inherent risk to human health. But it said ""the cultivation and testing of GE plants raise several well-documented concerns,"" including harm to plants and animals caused by the increased use of pesticides sometimes associated with testing and growing genetically engineered crops, the proliferation of ""superweeds"" and pests resistant to pesticides and contamination of traditional, non-genetically modified plants during pollination.  ""As a mother and a resident of Kekaha, Kauai, I will continue to stand up and protect my family and my community,"" said Malia Kahaleina Chun, a mother, educator and Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner, in an emailed statement. ""It is our responsibility to insure that our keiki (children) have access to clean air, clean water and to aina (land) that sustains them."" ___ Follow Cathy Bussewitz on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cbussewitz .

Quinonez, 21, pulled over to the side of the road and wept. She was 11 when she and her mother moved to Maryland from Bolivia in pursuit of a better life. They had visas, but overstayed them, leaving them undocumented. Under a controversial policy designed by the Obama administration, Quinonez had become a dreamer, protected from deportation and given a work permit. She found a job and earned a scholarship to attend college. ""I felt like I was going to achieve my American Dream,"" she said during an interview at CASA, an immigration advocacy group.  ""But now that Donald Trump has been elected president, I don't feel safe,"" she said, again on the verge of tears. ""I can be deported. Even my mother can be deported.""   Claudia Quinonez, 21, left, a college student comforts Brenda Barrios, 31, during in interview at CASA, an immigration advocacy group in Hyattsville. (Michael Miller/Pool)  More than 11 million undocumented immigrants woke up to the same reality Wednesday morning: a newly elected president who has vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. A president who has described some Latinos as rapists, killers and drug dealers. A president who has vowed to begin deportations within his first hour in office. Trump's victory came a shock to many Americans. For undocumented immigrants, however, their futures have taken a startling turn, from the promise of immigration reform under Hillary Clinton to the threat of deportation under Trump.  [She fought to keep immigrants from being deported. Now she faces the same fate.]  ""We are now facing an entirely different system of reality to what we are used to,"" said Jose Antonio Vargas, a former Washington Post reporter-turned-activist who is perhaps the country's most prominent undocumented immigrant. While the Obama administration deported record numbers of immigrants, it also tried to help others remain in the United States. ""Under the Trump administration, the level of fear and anxiety among undocumented people will only get deeper and more prevalent,"" said Vargas the founder and chief executive of Define American. On Election Day, a man who recognized Vargas outside of Fox News patted him on the back. ""Get ready to be deported,"" the man told Vargas, who described himself on Facebook as ""rattled"" by the encounter. Across the country, people are asking themselves what a Trump presidency will look like. How will he handle the Islamic State, the U.S. relationship with Russia, education policy? On immigration, however, Trump has been explicit. The Republican made it one of his central issues, focusing on it in campaign speeches and connecting it to both national security and the economy. He promised not only to ""build the wall"" and deport the ""bad hombres,"" but also to triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to carry out mass roundups reminiscent of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's 1954 initiative ""Operation Wetback,"" which removed hundreds of thousands of Mexicans from the United States.     Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump mused about accepting immigrants to the United States using a ""merit system"" during a campaign rally in Pensacola, Fla. (The Washington Post)   The question is how far will President Trump go to deliver. ""Trump will keep his promises to his base,"" said Corey Stewart, chairman of Prince William's Board of County Supervisors and the former head of Trump's Virginia campaign. ""He's got to build the wall and he's got to provide for better internal immigration enforcement. That was the main promise of his campaign. He's got to keep it, and he will keep it."" David A. Martin, a former deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security under President Obama, said the president's Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program, in limbo after the Supreme Court reached a 4-4 tie on a case challenging it, ""won't see the light of day.""  Dreamers like Quinonez, who essentially outed themselves as undocumented, could see their protections stripped. ICE raids on factories and construction sites could begin anew. ""And I certainly think we're going to see some wall-building,"" Martin said.  [What it will take for President Trump to deport millions and build the wall]  But Trump's immigration policies will also face political and financial pressures, Martin said. ICE agents and giant walls are expensive. Deporting university students can be politically damaging. ""Now that it's more than just rhetoric, we'll see what he prioritizes,"" Martin said. Trump's victory has already upended conventional political wisdom, according to Mark Krikorian from the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative think tank. ""A lot of Republican brain trusts and Democrats have been saying for years that Republicans cannot win the presidency without embracing comprehensive immigration reform,"" he said. ""Well, so much for that.""       For Brenda Barrios, 31, who lives in Silver Spring, Md., Trump's election is a ""nightmare."" She allowed her 10-year-old American-born son, Frankie, to stay up an hour past his bedtime to watch election results on Univision. ""When he saw the map go red, and red, and red, and red, he asked me, 'Mommy, is Donald Trump going to win?' "" she said. ""I told him not to worry."" But the next morning, when Frankie woke up from school, the first question out of his mouth was: Who won? When Barrios told him it was Trump, Frankie burst into tears. ""He is afraid his mom is going to be sent to another country,"" she said. For Barrios, that pain is all too real. Her parents immigrated illegally to the United States when she was 5, leaving her and her sister behind in Guatemala. When she and her sister joined them in 2003, Barrios finally felt like she had a family. But it didn't last. Her father was deported in early 2005. Barrios's mom went with him. She hasn't seen them since. With Trump as president, Barrios shares her son's fear that her own family will be torn apart. She fears ICE will arrest her husband, who is a carpenter and plumber, while he is at work. Or that they will come for her. ""I'm afraid of ICE coming to my door, to the park when I am there with my kids,"" she said. ""I'm even scared to take the kids to school since you never know who is watching now.""     Not all undocumented immigrants are distraught, however. As a Mexican-born construction worker, Jose Pina said he already lives with the threat of being detained and deported every time he goes to work. ""That's our reality now,"" he said in Spanish. ""We've always had that fear. It's the risk you take crossing the border."" Pina, 38, sneaked into the United States in 1998. He and his childhood sweetheart, who also entered the country illegally, have an 8-year-old daughter, Heather. She was born on the Fourth of July.  Sitting next to her parents in a green ""Life is Good"" hoodie, Heather said she thought Donald Trump was ""mean because he said he didn't want immigrants and the kids who are immigrants."" Asked if she was scared what might happen to her family now, Heather tentatively shook her head. ""We can fight against what is happening,"" she said, her voice caught somewhere between a statement and a question. "

(Mike Segar/Reuters)  If revenge is a dish best served cold then Election Day 2016 was the day the plate hit the table. Five years after President Obama turned Donald Trump into a punchline at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner in 2011, the American people turned him into President-elect Donald Trump. ""Say what you will about Mr. Trump,"" Obama said about the Manhattan builder, ""he certainly would bring some change to the White House."" The president's litany of belittling jokes at Trump's expense were understandable considering Trump led the racist birther movement that questioned the legitimacy of Obama's presidency. But, according to a riveting New York Times story from March, that gathering of Washington's media and political elite ignited Trump's Oval Office ambitions. ""That evening of public abasement, rather than sending Mr. Trump away,"" the Times reported, ""accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world."" [Trump deserved every lump at correspondence dinner] The electorate exacted revenge on Hillary Clinton. Her stunning defeat was a longed-for rebuke by conservatives who loathed her and progressives who neither liked nor trusted her. Even though Clinton won the popular vote against Trump, she wasn't able to match Obama's performance in 2012 with women, young people, non-urban areas, Latinos and African Americans.    Hillary Clinton concedes the presidential election at the New Yorker Hotel on Wednesday in New York City. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  And, generally speaking, whites exacted revenge on the narrative that demographic changes rendered them electorally irrelevant. All the talk this political season was about the looming power of the Hispanic vote in favor of Clinton. But the Trump campaign insisted there was a ""hidden Trump vote."" And what they did to get it was the equivalent of fracking. They pumped a well of discontent with a combination of populist, xenophobic and racist messaging to motivate those voters to the polls. Watching CNN's John King show voting upticks in small, rural counties in favor of Trump on Tuesday versus what happened in 2012 proved that the hidden Trump vote was coming forward across the country. [What Omarosa gets right about Trump and why that's horrifying] After the racist, xenophobic and misogynistic campaign run by Trump, the impact of his victory and sense of betrayal were eloquently articulated by Van Jones on CNN. It's hard to be a parent tonight for a lot of us. You tell your kids don't be a bully. You tell your kids don't be a bigot. You tell your kids do your homework and be prepared. And then you have this outcome. And you have people putting children to bed tonight, and they're afraid of breakfast. They're afraid of, how do I explain this to my children? I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight, saying, ""Should I leave the country?"" I have families of immigrants that are terrified tonight. This was many things. This was a rebellion against the elites, true. ... But it was also about something else. ... This was a white lash. This was a white lash against a changing country. It was a white lash against a black president in part. And that's the part where the pain comes. The frightening thing about Trump is that he has a penchant for retribution. One campaign aide, Omarosa Manigault, told the Independent Journal Review, ""It's so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get into the White House, we know where we stand."" And she added this: ""Mr. Trump has a long memory and we're keeping a list."" Yes, revenge is a dish best served cold. And when you're president of the United States, it could come under the color of law. Follow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj  Subscribe to Cape Up, Jonathan Capehart's weekly podcast"

For better or worse. Some International Olympic Committee members -- who will choose among Los Angeles, Paris and Budapest, Hungary, in a vote next September -- cited possible pros and cons on Wednesday of Trump's role in the American bid. As a polarizing presidential candidate, Trump's words on Muslims, Mexicans and other issues could have offended some of the 98 IOC members from around the world who will select the host city.  ""It may have,"" the IOC's longest-serving member, Dick Pound of Canada, told The Associated Press. At the same time, Pound did not rule out the possibility that Trump could help win votes if he travels to Lima, Peru, in September to pitch the Los Angeles bid in person to the IOC ahead of the secret ballot.  ""If he is there, and evidently he is someone who feeds off his audience, there is no reason to think he can't work this audience as well,"" Pound said. South African IOC member Sam Ramsamy, whose country has been described by Trump as a ""very dangerous mess,"" dismissed any lingering effect with 10 months left before the 2024 Olympic vote.  ""He has been rude to everybody,"" Ramsamy told the AP. ""I don't believe it will affect bidding in any way."" In a statement Wednesday congratulating Trump, the Los Angeles 2024 bid committee said the Olympics can ""transcend politics and can help unify our diverse communities and our world."" Citing 88 percent support for its bid, the committee pointed to strong bipartisan support at all levels of government.  ""We look forward to working closely with President-elect Trump and his administration across the federal government"" to deliver a successful Olympics, the statement said. IOC President Thomas Bach offered a brief statement to the AP on Trump's election.  ""Let me congratulate President-elect Trump on his victory and wish him all the best for his term in office for all the people of the United States and of the world,"" he said. Swiss IOC member Rene Fasel suggested that if Trump spoke offensively during the presidential race, it was a tactic to woo voters that worked.  ""You saw his speech today and it's already a different man,"" Fasel said, citing Trump's first public address as president-elect which sought to be more inclusive. While Trump has little track record with the Olympic movement, his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was a supporter of New York's failed bid for the 2012 Games and has attended several Olympics. She was First Lady when the U.S. last hosted the Summer Games -- in Atlanta in 1996. President Barack Obama went to the IOC vote in Copenhagen in 2009 to support Chicago's bid for the 2016 Olympics. Chicago was still eliminated in the first round, with the games awarded to Rio de Janeiro. Clinton's presidential campaign has some close ties to Los Angeles bid leaders. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is a Democrat who spoke at the Democratic Party convention in July which formally nominated Clinton. Bid chairman Casey Wasserman was also a prominent Clinton backer. Garcetti acknowledged in an AP interview in August during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics that some IOC members could be turned off by a Trump victory.  ""I think for some of the IOC members they would say, 'Wait a second, can we go to a country like that, where we've heard things that we take offense to?"" Garcetti said then. Garcetti remains more important to the bid than Trump, according to American IOC executive board member Anita DeFrantz.  ""It's the city that hosts the games, and it's the mayor that signs the documents. It is not the president,"" DeFrantz told The AP in Lausanne on Wednesday. Pound believes Los Angeles leaders will urgently want to meet with Trump to see if he is ""an enthusiastic supporter of this venture or not.""  ""Your most important campaign is at home,"" Pound said, suggesting that IOC voters and Olympic sports leaders can be swayed closer to election day. ""The roadshow only happens in the last few months."" Before that final stretch of campaigning, the city's biggest rival -- Paris -- could have its own domestic politics to explain. In May, France elects a president in a contest many predict will include far-right candidate Marine Le Pen among the two candidates in a second round of voting. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

That dynamic was amplified by the peculiar mathematics of the Electoral College, which gave a megaphone to less-educated voters in the Midwest. A look at the building blocks of Trump's win over Hillary Clinton: WORKING-CLASS WOES These voters spoke with a shout, particularly in Rust Belt states that have mostly favored Democrats in recent elections. Noncollege-educated whites made up about a third of the electorate nationally, but they accounted for more than 4 in 10 voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio and made up fully half of all voters in Iowa. In all four states, and nationally too, the margin by which Trump won noncollege whites surpassed Mitt Romney's margins in 2012. Nationwide, some 67 percent of these working-class voters backed Trump, attracted to his insurgent's pledge to upend the status quo. Trump's strong support among those with less than a college education is at least partly a reflection of how little the economic recovery since the Great Recession has benefited them. Their job opportunities have dwindled and their incomes have fallen, even as broader measures of the nation's job market show improvement. Middle-aged white men with only high school degrees -- the core of Trump's support -- saw their inflation-adjusted incomes plummet 9 percent from 1996 through 2014, according to Sentier Research, a data analytics firm founded by former Census Bureau officials.     The Post's Marc Fisher explains how some of President-elect Donald Trump's traits could inform his leadership style when he takes office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   RURAL OOMPH Democratic candidates have long worked to stockpile votes in urban centers to offset the more conservative electorate in America's small towns and rural areas. A color-coded map of the 2016 results -- a sea of Republican red in the country's midsection with blue states largely arrayed along the two coasts -- amply illustrates the rural/urban divide. Clinton won about 6 out of 10 votes in cities with more than 50,000 residents; Trump won about 60 percent of votes in small towns and rural areas. Voters in the suburbs largely split their votes between Clinton and Trump. But Trump made some crucial inroads. He won Pennsylvania, for example, by toppling a 20-year-old Democratic maxim to build an insurmountable lead in Philadelphia and its suburbs. Clinton did build an impressive lead in Philadelphia and its suburbs, surpassing Barack Obama's showing there in 2012, but Trump swamped Clinton in the rest of the state. The last time Pennsylvania voted for a Republican for president was 1988. RACIAL POLARIZATION The white vote has shrunk in recent years -- from about 80 percent in 1996 to 70 percent of Tuesday's vote -- but that's still a powerful number. Trump dominated with whites no matter how you dice their votes -- among men and women, young and old, college-educated and noncollege-educated. That diluted the potency of Clinton's strong performance with Hispanics and blacks. In North Carolina, where Trump won by a 4-point margin, the race was decided less on Clinton's failure than on Trump's unanticipated success. Clinton's campaign had hoped African Americans would make up 20 percent of the electorate, and they did. Nine in 10 blacks supported the Democrat. But Trump's strength with white, rural and small-town voters overwhelmed her support among blacks. Likewise, in Florida, where Trump won by just over 1 percentage point, Hispanics favored Clinton by almost a 2-to-1 margin and nearly 9 in 10 blacks backed her. But their outsized support for her was swamped by Trump's 2-to-1 lead among white voters, who made up more than 60 percent of the electorate. AGE MATTERS Millennials came through for Clinton, but one lesson of the 2016 election was the older voters still pack a punch. Some 55 percent of the electorate is 45 or older. Clinton got her most intense support from voters who are 18 to 29, winning more than half of that group. Her support dropped among older voters, winning about 45 percent among voters older than 45. That percentage held for the Democratic nominee among voters who are least 65. For Trump, the trend was reversed. He won a little more than a third of the youngest voters and captured a majority of voters older than 45. ELECTORAL COLLEGE In the end, it didn't matter that Clinton was on track to win more popular votes than Trump nationally: Her voters were too geographically concentrated to save her where it mattered most, in battleground states that tipped to Trump by small margins to produce a lopsided victory in electoral votes. With three states too close to call, Trump led Clinton 279-228 in electoral votes. In the popular vote, Clinton was leading 47.7 percent to 47.5 percent, or by about 236,000 votes. Trump pulled out victories in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida by the narrowest of margins, yet collected 74 electoral votes from them, or more than a quarter of the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. ___ Associated Press writer Bill Barrow contributed to this report. ___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac , Thomas Beaumont at https://twitter.com/TomBeaumont and Bill Barrow at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP ___ This story corrects in the last paragraph the states that went for Trump to North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida, deleting Colorado, which Clinton won. It also corrects the number of electoral votes collected from those four states to 74, not 83. The lower number represents more than a quarter, not nearly a third, of the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hernandez says in remarks at his residence in Tegucigalpa that it is one of the toughest decisions he has ever made. He adds that his party asked him to run. Opposition leaders quickly rejected Hernandez's announcement Wednesday. They dispute the validity of the ruling, arguing the court did not have the authority to modify the constitution. The issue of presidential re-election is politically charged in Honduras. President Manuel Zelaya was deposed in 2009 for allegedly wanting to end the ban on second terms so he could run again.

David Ake/Associated Press)  +How can the next president improve the uncooperative atmosphere in Washington?  So far, the ""The Missing Debate"" has covered a wide range of policy imperatives, from the future of the Federal Reserve to housing policy to K-12 education. While we've discussed a wide range of potential solutions, we're under no illusion that they are likely to make headway in Washington's current political climate. When this vicious electoral season comes to a close, we're likely to be left with a further divided government and an increasingly polarized electorate. Perhaps the biggest question regarding any policy agenda is whether there is any hope for lawmakers to break through the dysfunction that has paralyzed Congress over the past few years. For that reason, the final question of the series focuses on reforms that could improve relations between the two parties and make lawmakers more willing to cooperate and pass needed legislation. What is the one most important reform the next administration and Congress should champion to improve the political atmosphere in Washington?    Steve Israel, a Democratic, represents New York's 3rd Congressional District in the House. He chairs the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee and is author of the critically acclaimed comic novel, ""The Global War on Morris."" Both sides of the aisle can agree that this election brought with it record levels of anger and frustration with the system. There is a palpable feeling among voters that you only matter if you come with a super PAC.  Ever since the Supreme Court's disastrous Citizens United decision, we've seen corporations and wealthy individuals spend without abandon to elect candidates who align with their priorities. This dark money is bad for our democracy and bad for our government institutions. Even within the halls of Congress, there is a sense of distrust and evasiveness -- members do not know where the next attack will come from or who is responsible.   ['Shutdown politics' is keeping Congress from working. Here's how to fix it.]   Now, both parties are coming off one of the most grueling campaign seasons in recent memory. To improve the political atmosphere in Washington and on our airwaves, there's a simple action Congress can take on Day One of the new session: Pass the Disclose Act to provide much-needed transparency to our campaign finance system. The Disclose Act would require corporations, unions, super PACs and other outside groups to disclose contributions of $10,000 or more within 24 hours to the Federal Election Commission, as well as disclose their source of funding in ads. It would also require them to disclose their spending to their shareholders and require lobbyists to disclose campaign-related expenditures in conjunction with their lobbying activities. In short: We'll know who is paying for the political ads that we see jamming the airwaves. I suspect candidates may think twice before going on the attack if they know they will be held responsible, and this may lead to a more transparent and civil environment. That, in turn, leads to greater potential for bipartisanship here in Washington. And the American people deserve it.  Congress tried this in 2010 and failed. Democrats were able to pass the bill in the House, but it was thwarted by Republicans in the Senate. However, maybe -- just maybe -- Republicans now realize how important this bill is after trudging through this grueling election season. When Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) took the gavel about a year ago, he said during one of his first news conferences that he feels ""we have an obligation to the hardworking citizens of this country to show them how we would do things differently, to tackle our country's problems before they tackle us, and to get things fixed, to advance our principles, to show how we can make things better for people who are struggling in America."" Why keep waiting? We've seen the unprecedented levels of voter frustration this election cycle. We've heard from so many of them that they feel disenfranchised. Our system cannot continue as is. Let's give voters back their voice. Let's bring transparency to our political system and let's end the regime of dark money that is poisoning the political atmosphere. Let's pass the Disclose Act.
