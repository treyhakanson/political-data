(Reuters)   CLAY, W.Va. -- Officials in this tiny West Virginia town are fighting for their community's reputation following a nationwide uproar over racist comments about Michelle Obama that prompted the mayor to resign. Mayor Beverly Whaling, who had commented approvingly on a Facebook post comparing the first lady to an ape, turned in her letter of resignation Tuesday. Joe Coleman, the town recorder, said the resignation was effective immediately; officials here are now scrambling to replace the mayor, who had three years left on her term. Whaling resigned a day after the director of a government-funded nonprofit was removed from her position amid the backlash over her Facebook post. After Donald Trump's election as president, Pamela Ramsey Taylor, who was director of the Clay County Development Corp., took to social media to comment on the upcoming shift from Obama to Melania Trump, writing: ""It will be so refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady back in the White House."" She added: ""I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels."" NBC affiliate WSAZ reported that Whaling, the mayor, then replied, ""Just made my day Pam.""   [A man in KKK robes waved a Trump flag at a bonfire in Connecticut, police say]   The comments were later deleted -- as were both women's Facebook pages, according to reports -- but images of Taylor's post and the mayor's response had already gone viral.      A non-profit director in Clay, W.Va., is facing backlash after reportedly posting a Facebook message about first lady Michelle Obama. ""It will be so refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady back in the White House. I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels,"" the post reportedly said. (WSAZ NewsChannel 3)   Taylor was placed on leave from her position at the government nonprofit, which uses state and federal funds to provide services to elderly and low-income residents, according to the Associated Press. But a representative at the organization told The Washingon Post that the board ""removed"" Taylor from her position. The social media comments drew ire across the country and on the Internet pulling this quiet central West Virginia town and its residents into the center of a nationwide firestorm. Joshua Shamblin, a former council member, said Tuesday that ""the county is sorry that this has been placed upon everyone instead of just the few who made hurtful remarks."" He said local officials were ""shocked"" by the incident but were preparing to push past it. At a previously scheduled meeting Tuesday night, council members condemned the comments and accepted Whaling's resignation. But they also urged outsiders to understand that the incident was not reflective of the community. ""Come see us,"" council member Joyce Gibson said, according to the Associated Press. ""Spend a day with us. If I knew you would come, I would bake a cake. We're very decent people.""    Jason Hubbard of Clay, W.Va., (seated) issues a public apology on behalf of the town council following the resignation of Beverly Whaling as mayor. (Lexi Browning/For The Washington Post)  Another council member, Jason Hubbard, publicly apologized to the first lady on behalf of Clay, according to the AP. But, Hubbard said, ""please don't judge the entire community for one or two individual acts."" Whaling did not attend the Tuesday meeting. But in a statement sent to The Post, she apologized: ""My comment was not intended to be racist at all. I was referring to my day being made for change in the White House! I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused! Those who know me know that I'm not of any way racist! Again, I would like to apologize for this getting out of hand!"" By Wednesday morning, more than 175,000 people had signed an online petition that, for days, has been calling for the two women to be fired. The council now has the immediate task to name a new mayor to complete three years left on Whaling's term. ""She was a good mayor, I thought, and she knew how to get things done,"" Gibson said, according to the AP. ""It's just a shame that this has happened. But, you know, there could be good things come out of it.""   [Police officer who drove with Confederate flag at 'Love Trumps Hate' rally resigns]   Taylor could not be reached for comment, but WSAZ reported that she had also issued an apology. The station reported that Taylor said she understood why her post may have been interpreted as racist, but that was not her intention. She said she was referring to her own opinion about the first lady's attractiveness, not about the color of her skin, according to the news station. Taylor also reportedly told WSAZ that the heated public response to her Facebook post had become a ""hate crime against me,"" saying that she and her children had received death threats. Taylor said she was planning to file a lawsuit against people who had slandered or libeled her amid the uproar, according to the news station. There is a long and ugly history of comparing black people to apes. ""In the 19th century and well into the 20th, popular media from movies to fiction to political cartoons frequently portrayed blacks as more simian than human,"" social psychologists Phillip Atiba Goff and Jennifer L. Eberhardt wrote in the Los Angeles Times. ""It was an association that provided cover for slavery itself, as well as anti-black violence. Lynchings in the United States were often justified by relying on this dehumanizing association, and it surfaced in the Rodney King controversy in Los Angeles: LAPD Officer Laurence Powell had referred to a black couple as 'something right out of 'Gorillas in the Mist' moments before he was involved in the King beating,"" they wrote. ""Like nooses, the 'N-word' and white sheets, referring to blacks as apelike is among the most violent and hurtful legacies of our nation's difficult racial past."" Racist ape memes have surfaced repeatedly around the Obamas. Several years ago, the Awl catalogued them in a piece called ""Primate in Chief: A Guide to Racist Obama Monkey Photoshops."" The town of Clay has approximately 467 residents, according to a 2015 census estimate. The estimated population of Clay County is 8,910. Two-tenths of 1 percent of Clay County's residents are African American, according to census data. More than three-quarters of the presidential votes cast in the county went to Trump. Officials and local residents have tried to make sense of the Facebook comments and the intense backlash. At the council meeting, Clay Sheriff Garrett Samples said he did not think the post was meant to be racist. ""It wasn't necessarily a joke, but it was stupid,"" he said. ""I've never heard either of them say anything racial before."" Tina Goode, a town clerk, said: ""It wasn't right, what was posted. We're not like that. They are good women, and I don't think they meant anything by it. We're not a racist town."" Goode said she believed that Hillary Clinton's supporters were responsible for making the post go viral. Katie Payne, 16, who is black, said she was surprised by the reaction because ""normally when people say things like that around here, it's swept under the rug."" The teen's grandmother, Doris Neal, said the post was ""disgusting,"" but was not the first time something like this has happened. ""Katie's come home several times with complaints of [peers'] racist remarks,"" she said. ""One time, when she ran for student body president they teased her about buying watermelons."" Lish Greiner, a native of Parkersburg, W.Va., who lives in Belpre, Ohio, drove two hours to go to the meeting. ""I came tonight to say that I refuse to tolerate any hate and hateful rhetoric,"" she said. ""Any person in a position of power should not be able to spread this hateful rhetoric.""

(Photo by Stan Godlewski for the Washington Post.)  Democrats are rending their garments, bemoaning their failure to connect with rural and small-town America. They are supposed to feel guilty about insufficient empathy for the industrial heartland. Perhaps, but before they don sackcloth and ashes they might want to consider that this election as much as anything else was a candidate failure. We will say it once more: VP Joe Biden would have won this going away. Hillary Clinton did offer a jobs program, a debt free college tuition plan, a middle-class tax cut, etc. All of these would have helped the Trump voters far more than the urban poor or coastal elites. These voters either didn't believe her or didn't like her. The blow-back to dynastic policies that Jeb Bush got in the GOP primary, Clinton got in the general election. (In that sense, the primary was ""rigged"" to favor a weak but ""inevitable"" candidate.) Democrats don't need to beat themselves up; they picked a losing candidate just as the GOP did in 2008 and 2012. GOP ""elites"" meanwhile are being harangued for cultural insensitivity and economic callousness. On the latter count, let's get real: It's a lie that immigrants and trade caused their problems. No one should apologize for refusing to sell snake oil. (Trump ironically was the one to offer pro-business, supply-side tax cuts, so maybe this is not about economics?) What about the cultural insensitivity claim? Excuse me, but that's bonkers on multiple counts.      Members of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team as well as Democratic officials on Nov. 13 responded to protesters marching in several cities against Trump's election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   First, the GOP is the older, white male party. It does dominate in the South. When Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) get reelected, it's hard to argue that the GOP's educated leadership has lost touch with its grassroots. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was the quintessential blue-collar Midwesterner. He got knocked out of the primaries early on. The GOP has bent over backward to the point of lunacy (e.g., arguing that states should not implement gay marriage) to cater to the electorate that eventually went with Trump. Second, George W. Bush didn't like East Coast elites either, but he was no racist, no misogynist and did not pit one group against another. He won rural whites and got an estimated 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. He did not demean or paw women. No presidential candidate has ever behaved and spoken the way Trump did. The rest of the country was entitled to assume his vulgarity, lies, bias and cruelty would be disqualifying. That they were not, but instead were rationalized, minimized or even lauded does not mean the anti-Trump side of America was dense. It means they thought better of their fellow Americans. In short, Republican ""elites"" and Democrats would have disagreed with Trump's policy prescriptions (which they took seriously -- silly them!) but not been shocked or horrified by his win had this been a battle of policy plans. They were shocked and horrified because Trump won these people over by playing to their worst instincts. He dealt out xenophobia, racism, misogyny and contempt for science -- and the Trumpkins ate it up. Trump defenders, and defenders of Trump supporters, argue this wasn't about white nationalism or male resentment. If so, why were these the main tools Trump used to amp up his support? Trump did what Republicans have long bemoaned. He played on class resentment. He told his voters America's economy is a fixed pie; if ""elites"" get more, then they get less. He cultivated excuses for white, rural social decay and economic stagnation on behalf of voters who would surely reject such rationalizations for African American poverty. Remember, a good deal of the opposition to Trump on the right went to his character and the noxious hatreds he was stirring up in the populace. Objecting to his appeals does not make one culturally insensitive; it makes one a decent person. The way Trump won the race -- with zero respect for the truth, with contempt for nonwhite voters, with assaults on our democracy -- the #NeverTrump forces fear will now be the rule, not the exception, in presidential politics. That he won (it worked!) is no cause for recriminations against the #NeverTrump forces. It actually proves their point: Public figures who behave this way tear the fabric of our country and undermine democratic values. And Trump has done just that -- because it was the only way he knew to get the approval of the Trumpkins. He was certain they were not above vile tactics; he was right. Congratulations, Trumpkins: You never go wrong underestimating the American people. Just as his critics predicted, however, Trump's vague and fantastical promises are already colliding with reality. Obamacare isn't going to get repealed -- at least not all of it, he says. Rounding up 11-12M people does not seem to be on his list of top priorities. His team is coming to the realization the Iran deal will not be ripped up on his first day in office. If Trumpkins discover Trump is just another pol who sold them a bill of goods, how will they react? We will find out in the months ahead. Some thoughts about ideology are in order. Just as Democrats need a sane Republican Party, Republicans need a responsible Democratic Party. Should the Democratic Party decide Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who marketed many of the same economic fallacies as Trump, was ""right,"" Democrats may well go off the ideological deep end, giving Americans the choice between right-wing populism and democratic socialism. No thanks. We in the center-right sincerely hope that doesn't happen. The best way to constrain Trump would be a viable, appealing center-left alternative with whom he must compete for votes. If, however, the Democratic Party re-visits its pre-Bill Clinton errors, there nevertheless is a backup. If one party goes far, far left and the other goes nativist-populist, the center-left and center-right would need to join forces and put forth an alternative that fills in a huge ideological gap. They would:  Refuse to favor one-half of America over the other; Advance responsible internationalism; Understand the benefits and the downsides of centralized power, Take the Constitution seriously; Support civil rights and practice civility; Defend free markets but also programs that combat poverty and promote upward mobility; and Urge we invest in human capital so we can thrive in a globalized economy, not inveigh against modernity.  If neither party is going to support that kind of approach, there likely will be a crisis in governance and a felt need for an alternative. Those who voted for Hillary Clinton and those who voted for Mitt Romney -- but saw through the flights of political fancy Sanders and Trump indulged in -- will need to find each other, champion these common-sense polices and practice public civility. They might even need to form a new political party. We need determined champions of moderation, fervent defenders of centrism and an unwavering commitment to decency, kindness and empathy. That's ultimately the only place from which to govern a complicated, diverse country and to cool tempers and dampen resentments. Eventually, we hope, that's where this will all wind up."

The support for Reedie to continue in his role came after he assured the International Olympic Committee that he would ""respect the rules and responsibilities of WADA and its stakeholders,"" suggesting the agency will refrain in the future from publicly calling for a nation to be barred from the Olympics, as it did with Russia before the games in Rio de Janeiro. Reedie, a Briton who has been WADA president since 2013, is up for re-election at agency meetings in Glasgow, Scotland, next weekend. No other candidates have been put forward. The backing for Reedie was contained in a letter from the IOC to all of its 98 members. A copy of the letter was obtained Sunday by The Associated Press. The letter was sent following a private meeting of the IOC executive board on Thursday in Lausanne, Switzerland. Reedie briefed the board at that meeting.  ""Sir Craig Reedie committed to respect the Olympic Charter and respect the rules and responsibilities of WADA and its stakeholders, including the catalogue of points put forward by the Olympic Movement three years ago,"" the letter said.  ""On this basis, the IOC will encourage the Olympic Movement representatives on the WADA foundation board to approve the re-election of Sir Craig Reedie as WADA President, as well as inviting them to speak to their government counterparts concerning a reform of the system for electing the WADA President."" Under current rules, a WADA president is elected for three years, with the option of a second three-year term. The presidency rotates between representatives of governments and sporting bodies. WADA and the IOC came into sharp conflict before and during the Rio Games following a report by WADA investigator Richard McLaren that detailed state-sponsored doping in Russia, including manipulation of samples at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games and cover-ups of positive tests across dozens of summer and winter Olympic sports. WADA recommended that the entire Russian team be excluded from Rio. The IOC rejected the proposal and instead let international sports federations decide which athletes should be eligible to compete. During meetings in Rio, IOC members accused WADA of failing to act sooner on Russian doping and criticized the agency for releasing the McLaren report so close to the games. The sides appeared to bury the hatchet last month at an Olympic summit in Lausanne, where IOC leaders backed WADA to continue to oversee worldwide anti-doping efforts and gave the agency increased powers to lead the fight. All parties agreed that an independent body under WADA's umbrella should be set up to carry out global drug-testing. Critics have accused Reedie of having a conflict of interest in his IOC and WADA roles. In addition to WADA president, he was an IOC vice president and member of the rule-making executive board until the Rio Games. However, Reedie's term as vice president and board member has expired, and he is now a regular IOC member without a policy-making role. The IOC letter also said the board agreed to a request from Reedie to match government contributions and provide $500,000 to the agency's special investigations fund. It said this was on condition that WADA provides a ""detailed breakdown of costs"" of McLaren's upcoming final report and that McLaren ""actively cooperates"" with two separate IOC investigations into Russian doping. McLaren's latest report, which is expected to focus on doping at the Sochi Games, has been delayed until next month, which the IOC said ""makes cooperation more difficult"" with its own probes. Reedie and IOC leaders are scheduled to travel to Doha this week for the general assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with The Associated Press that this ""would lead to a kind of detente in Europe."" But unfortunately, he said, Russia now sees ""NATO's muscles ... getting bigger and bigger and closer and closer to Russian borders."" At a NATO summit in July, the Western alliance said it is building up positions in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in response to what it sees as escalating tensions with Russia. The United States is sending 1,000 troops to Poland next year. Trump has praised Putin as a strong leader and suggested that the U.S. could abandon its NATO commitments, which include mutual defense in case of attack. The president-elect says NATO was created to confront a threat -- the Soviet Union -- that no longer exists and has called the alliance ""obsolete"" and a bad deal for America. He argues that the U.S. gets too little out of decades-old security partnerships like NATO, which is anchored in Europe but traditionally led by the United States. Peskov, who is considered one of Putin's closest aides, called NATO ""an instrument of confrontation."" When its forces are being enlarged and deploying closer and closer to Russia's borders, he said, ""we do not feel ourselves safe.""  ""Of course, we have to take measures to counter,"" Peskov said. As ""confidence-building measures"" to reduce U.S.-Russia tensions in a Trump presidency ""let's say slow down or withdrawal of NATO's military potential from our borders potentially would ease this situation,"" he said. It's highly unusual for Peskov to travel abroad separately from Putin, but he is chairman of the board of the Russian Chess Federation and came to New York to attend Friday's opening of the world championship match between Russia's Sergei Karyakin and Norway's Magnus Carlsen. The organizers invited Trump to attend but he did not show up. On other global issues, Peskov said in an interview Thursday at the venue for the championship that there is no possibility of ""a breakthrough"" to end the more than five-year Syria conflict unless the so-called moderate opposition is separated from ""terrorist groups"" including the Nusra Front and Islamic State extremists. The U.S. was supposed to do this under a Russia-U.S.-brokered cease-fire, but Peskov said Washington, unfortunately, was unable to do so. The cease-fire collapsed in September as the Syrian army launched an offensive on rebel-held eastern Aleppo under the cover of Russian warplanes. Peskov said if the cease-fire agreement is implemented, ""there will be another chance for a breakthrough.""  ""We are still convinced that without real interaction, real cooperation between Moscow and Washington, it will be very hard to make further steps in a political settlement in Syria,"" Peskov said. ""Unfortunately, we don't have cooperation there."" Peskov said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are in constant contact, ""but unfortunately, sometimes it seems that not everyone in Washington wants a real breakthrough on the road ... to political settlement."" He refused to say which U.S. officials Moscow believes are blocking progress to ending the conflict. Russia, meanwhile, is continuing to support the Syrian government and army ""because we have only two alternatives ... either we have President (Bashar) Assad in Damascus or we have Nusra and Islamic State,"" Peskov said. Putin's spokesman addressed another issue which sparked a serious downturn in U.S.-Russian relations and U.S. sanctions -- Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, which led to a conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 9,600 people. A 2015 agreement has helped reduce the scale of fighting, but clashes have continued and efforts to negotiate a political settlement have stalled. Peskov disputed calling Russia's action in Crimea ""annexation,"" insisting it is a region of the Russian Federation and stressing that ""no one in Russia -- never -- will be ready to start any kind of discussion about Crimea."" Asked how the issue could be addressed differently in a Trump administration, Peskov said, ""we understand that it will take time for our partners in Europe, for our partners here in the United States to understand that. We are patient enough to wait until this understanding occurs here in Washington, in the States, in Europe."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

His resignation Friday afternoon was effective immediately, said CNN spokeswoman Barbara Levin. Lewandowski's stay at CNN, which began only days after leaving the Trump campaign in June, stirred continued debate over whether political insiders hired as network on-air contributors are more loyal to the politicians they once worked for than the network that employs them and the audience it serves. Media observers and even some CNN insiders were troubled by Lewandowski's combative style on-air, by the fact that he was bound by a non-disclosure agreement limiting his ability to criticize Trump publicly, and all the more so when it was learned that he was continuing to receive severance payments from the campaign. The payments ended after the widespread criticism. CNN President Jeff Zucker at the time said ideological diversity was essential to the network and that it was important to have people on air at CNN who supported the Republican nominee. But if Lewandowski's hiring cast a shadow on CNN's credibility, it didn't seem to harm its ratings. Buoyed by the presidential campaign, the network has enjoyed its biggest viewership in years.     During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   During his CNN tenure, Lewandowski stayed in close touch with Trump, leading to speculation after this week's stunning victory that he might take a role in the Trump administration. On Friday, he was seen arriving at Trump Tower, where the president-elect was holding transition meetings. Considered as brash and unconventional as Trump, Lewandowski had been at Trump's side since the campaign's start. But he clashed with longtime political operatives who were subsequently brought in to make the campaign more professional. Lewandowski had made headlines in March, when a video recording showed him grabbing a reporter's arm as she tried to ask Trump a question at a Florida rally. He was charged with simple battery, although the charges were later dropped. The incident drew condemnation from Trump's Republican and Democratic rivals alike. But Trump stood by Lewandowski, who said he was innocent. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Donald Trump's stunning electoral win came despite prognosticators' overwhelming insistence he would lose. And it has forced many to question not just political polling, but other facets of life that are being informed and directed by data.  ""If 'big data' is not that useful for predicting an election then how much should we be relying on it for predicting civil uprisings in countries where we have an interest or predicting future terror attacks?"" asked Patrick Tucker, the author of ""The Naked Future: What Happens in a World That Anticipates Your Every Move?"" His book examines predictive analytics that aim to pinpoint answers to questions as varied as when a person will get married to how many kindergartners in a given class will end up with a cold. Technology has filled people's lives with crowdsourced, data-driven or otherwise instructive metrics and left many convinced of their validity. We look to Yelp rankings to find a good meal and TripAdvisor to gauge a city's finest hotel. Netflix tells us which shows are best to watch and Zillow tells us the worth of the home we might buy. Amazon, Google, Facebook -- all are ubiquitous presences in everyday life with data at their core. So many took the predictions of polling aggregators as gospel -- and their forecasts of Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the presidency went as high as 99 percent. Tammy Palazzo, a 49-year-old corporate trainer in Maplewood, New Jersey, was among them. She's a political junkie who all day long refreshed FiveThirtyEight, the site from the heralded election-predictor Nate Silver. She purposely sought to look beyond her biases, living in a neighborhood dotted with signs for Clinton, a candidate she admired, and took in a variety of news sources. Then came Tuesday night.  ""This is not going the way it's supposed to go,"" she thought, watching returns come in but not in Clinton's favor. ""There was just so much reinforcement from the media that this was pretty locked down."" Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University, was among the few who defied the confluence of polls and projected Trump's win. His model, developed in 1981, uses history as a guide to who will win the presidency through 13 true-or-false questions looking at economic indicators, military failure and success, social unrest and third-party candidacies. He's been consistently right.  ""Polls are not predictions. They are snapshots and they are abused and misused as though they are predictions,"" he said. Claudia Deane, a vice president at Pew Research Center, said many traditional methodologies in opinion polling are under attack as survey experts try to adapt to changing technology and communication methods. She says researchers are trying to find ways to accurately tap into social media or other indicators of public opinion that could enhance phone and internet surveys, but scientific methods are still being developed.  ""The surveys are trying to predict the popular vote, and we're doing that in a country where we have a 50-50 electorate,"" she said. ""Polling is not built for that kind of precision. It's not an excuse, it's just a mathematical fact.""  ""Big data"" has been a buzzword for the last decade in Silicon Valley. Investors and tech companies, from little-known startups to corporate giants, have poured billions of dollars into software and computer systems that promise to pore through mountains of information and glean useful insights into business trends or consumer behavior. David Dill, a computer science professor at Stanford University, said it has opened the door to do things that weren't possible before. It enabled the collection of vast stockpiles of information all while advances in computing hardware and online networking have made it possible to run more sophisticated analytical programs and crunch bigger sets of data more quickly. Even so, there's plenty of hype and unreasonable expectations for what analytics can do.  ""Even if you have a lot of data and you go after it with the most sophisticated, amazing techniques, it may not tell you anything or it may mislead, because the data doesn't have the information you need,"" Dill said. Khalid Khan, who heads analytics at the management consulting firm A.T. Kearney, said people are being influenced by data points without fully understanding what those numbers represent. He encourages companies weighing the direction of data to also consider -- and discuss -- ""the softer side of things."" Speaking of data alone, he said: ""If you take it at face value, you're going to get burnt. Without those conversations, you're only doing half of what you need to do when it comes to decision making."" Technology expert Sarah Granger has also seen that overreliance on data and technology, such as people who use mapping software only to end up on a dead-end street. Snafus like that, or presidential polling errors, she said, offer a reminder: ""Big data's a great thing. There's so much we gain from it. But it's still in its infancy."" ___ Associated Press writer Brandon Bailey in San Francisco contributed to this report. ___ Sedensky can be reached at msedensky@ap.org or https://twitter.com/sedensky Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

It has nothing to do with being a woman.	"   Hillary Clinton was formerly the Secretary of State, a one-time launching pad for the top job in early America that hasn't been on presidential resumes in more than 150 years. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Thomas Jefferson was one before becoming president. So was James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams and Martin Van Buren. In 1857, James Buchanan became the last president to hold the distinction. And if Hillary Clinton wins the election, she will join them. So what would the first female president, if elected in this brutally divided and digitally driven modern-day election, have in common with these founding fathers and pre-Civil War presidents? It's a job title: They are the only ones to have served as Secretary of State before reaching the Oval Office, a one-time launching pad for the top job in early America that hasn't been on presidential resumes in more than 150 years. While it might seem like a natural stepping stone to the presidency -- a job that requires diplomatic and negotiating skills, getting photographed with world leaders, understanding global conflicts and acclimating to a grueling travel schedule that would prepare anyone for a presidential campaign -- it's been a long time since it's been seen as one. The reasons range from a shift in American politics to an evolution in how foreign affairs are handled to the natural complexity of the job and the personal relationship between the president and his top deputies. ""It's not a great billet if you want to become president,"" says Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. ""When anything goes wrong in the world, you're being held responsible for it."" [Remembering a speech from 'the most beautiful loser' after Trump won't commit to accepting results] First, a little history. In the early days of the nation, the Secretary of State's job was vastly different. There was a relatively small federal government. The people who held the Cabinet position were seen to speak for the national interest. ""These were figures who could claim to speak for the country and be recognized as national figures"" by European leaders, says Jeremi Suri, a professor of history, leadership and global affairs at the University of Texas, Austin. Five of the first eight presidents had been Secretary of State first. At a time without political primaries, ""the founding fathers presumed that the Secretary of State would be, in a sense, a nurturing position [for] those who ascend to presidency."" But after the famously contentious 1824 election, when Secretary of State John Quincy Adams became president after a decision by the House of Representatives, a shift occurred. The political party system took hold, putting more weight on candidates who could win votes and elections than those with a history of political appointments. Moreover, a Western expansion cut the influence of a figure who was America's face in Europe, Brinkley says. ""You kind of wanted to define yourself as an American and not someone who had spent a lot of time abroad,"" he says. ""We shed the notion of the European influence on American politics."" And while there were exceptions -- former Secretary of States Martin Van Buren, who became president in 1837, and James Buchanan, who is widely regarded as one of the worst presidents for his failure to avert Civil War -- the role has not again been a stop on the road to the Oval Office. In modern times, historians say, that's largely because the power of the position has faded while the complexities of it have only grown. While the late 1940s and 1950s were seen, historians say, as the apex of the State Department's power with the tenures of George Marshall, Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles, they were not seen as presidential figures. Marshall was ""utterly and completely apolitical, a self-effacing, efficient public servant,"" said Anders Stephanson, a professor of history at Columbia University, in an email. Acheson was attacked for his role in shaping foreign policy during the Cold War, while being criticized for his accent. He was ""denounced as a Anglophile cookie pusher in striped pants,"" Stephanson said, while Dulles, despite an illustrious pedigree, was ""never what you might call a person of any domestic political stature."" [The very different ways Clinton and Trump defined leadership in the commander-in-chief town hall] Since the late 1950s, Suri says, as American foreign policy became more about war-making than peace-making, the Secretary of State has not been as powerful as the Secretary of Defense. Perhaps most critical, the creation of the National Security Council in the late 1940s shifted foreign policy into the White House. As that happened, he says, ""it takes the glory away from the Secretary of State, who loses day-to-day war making to the Secretary of Defense and day-to-day foreign policy to the National Security Adviser."" Instead, the glory more often goes to the president. As Stephanson said in an email, ""the Secretary of State can clock a million miles, 112 countries, talk to endless numbers of people endlessly about endlessly difficult problems, but when push comes to shove -- a crisis -- or a major initiative, the president and the White House take center stage at once and power is revealed to be far from Foggy Bottom."" This is partly due to the structure of presidential power, he notes: Presidents can assert their will more on the world stage than they can on domestic issues, so they lean on it when they can. Meanwhile, presidents are often looking for loyalists rather than those with larger ambitions of their own. After the tumultuous tenure of Alexander Haig, who once called himself the ""vicar"" of foreign policy and did later mount a presidential run himself, George Shultz's appeal to Reagan, notes Brinkley, was that ""he had zero political ambition for himself."" Other loyal Secretaries of State -- Condoleezza Rice to George W. Bush, Dean Acheson to Harry Truman -- have not aimed for higher office. In today's world, says Brinkley, ""you inherent the mistakes of your president and can't fully differentiate yourself without being too disloyal. You don't get wings. You get tied to the hips of the president you serve, but the accomplishments belong to the president."" If elected, Clinton could break the mold. She has, of course, been dogged by the controversies of her time at State -- the attacks on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, as well as her private e-mail server -- that have helped to keep what she achieved in the job from breaking through during this campaign. The Secretary of State, says Suri, must ""take ownership of almost inherently controversial issues. You acquire so many negatives and the negative voices are loud, and it makes it impossible to discuss the policy accomplishments that a Secretary of State would want to discuss. That doesn't happen for a governor of a state."" Of course, for some -- William Jennings Bryan, Charles Evans Hughes, John Kerry and Clinton herself -- the role has not been a stepping stone, but something of a consolation prize, given after running for the highest office in the land (sometimes several times). Which makes for yet another notable distinction for Clinton to add to her political resume if she wins. In addition to being the first woman, first First Lady, first Secretary of State in more than 150 years, and even first Cabinet member of any kind to hold the job since 1928, if elected, she would be also be the first in modern history to run for president both before and after serving as the nation's chief diplomat.      For almost twenty years, Hillary Rodham Clinton put her political aspirations on hold when she moved to Arkansas to marry Bill Clinton, who would become the country's 42nd president. The former New York senator, secretary of state and Democratic nominee for president would be the first woman to hold the office if she is elected.

(Reuters)  There has been a lot of ink spilled in recent weeks on Donald Trump's claims that today's vote is likely to be rigged. Putting aside the fact that there is very little evidence -- if any -- of vote rigging in U.S. elections, the fact that one of the two major party presidential candidates is even raising this issue suggests it is important to consider the potential consequences of such claims. As it turns out, there have actually been many elections outsides the United States marred by significant accusation of voter fraud, a non-trivial number of which have been followed by major protests. Political scientists, in turn, have theorized about the determinants of protest, and, in particular, about the relationship between electoral fraud and protest. Based on my own research on this topic, here are what I think are three key factors of which Americans ought to be cognizant in the coming days: Electoral fraud is a powerful tool to overcome barriers to protest One way political scientists think about protest is as a cost-benefit calculation: If I decide to participate in a protest, what are the likely benefits that could come about from that protest? What are the likely costs I could bear from participating in that protest? From this perspective, the likelihood of participating in a protest increases as the costs of protesting go down and the potential benefits from the protest go up.   [A comprehensive average of election forecasts points to a decisive Clinton victory]   Allegations of electoral fraud can affect this calculus in two ways. First, the likely ""benefits"" from a successful protest of a fraudulent election is almost undoubtedly going to be higher than just about anything one might protest in the cost of one's daily life, precisely because a ""success"" in a protest against a fraudulent election is to actually change the result of an election. Short of revolutionary uprisings, there are very few things one could protest against (e.g., a law, a fine, a policy) that holds open the possibility of such a large ""benefit"" as overturning an election. In countries where protest has the potential to be met by repression (i.e., threats to one's physical security, including violence and/or arrest), protesting against electoral fraud has the added benefit of decreasing the likelihood of being personally punished because everyone (or at least everyone on one side of the political divide) is ""suffering"" from the same grievance simultaneously. This, in turn, makes the possibility the large numbers of people will participate in a protest more likely than if, for instance, you are protesting about being unjustly detained by the police (in which case you personally are almost certain to bear any costs of the protest).   [Hillary Clinton will gain votes after election night. Here's why.]   Taken together, the added benefits and reduced costs of protesting electoral fraud makes protests following allegations of electoral fraud more likely than many other political or nonpolitical events. How might this play out in an established democratic state? There are reasons to think that the logic of this argument suggests it could still be at play in a democracy, although potentially with less powerful reasoning. First, the likelihood that an election result would be annulled in a long standing established democracy with institutional safeguards to guard against fraud -- including a free press -- would certainly be less than in a less well established democracy or competitive authoritarian (i.e., a regime with elections that are neither free nor fair) state. That being said, even a smaller chance of changing the outcome of an election might still be a big enough potential ""benefit"" to draw people out onto the streets, especially following an election campaign like the one we've just witnessed in the United States. Second, the ""costs"" in terms of expected physical repression from security forces would very likely be lower in the United States than in, for example, a country like Egypt or Uzbekistan. That being said, it is still possible that more people to share potential costs of protesting might decrease the cost to any one individual. Moreover, conversely, there might be what we call ""experiential"" benefits to protesting in a relatively safe environment, which is a technical way of saying people might enjoy taking part in these kind of activities, especially if they thought there was no real physical risk to doing so. Credible allegations of fraud ought to make protest more likely than simply innuendo A crucial part of the logic of the previous argument is that protest following allegations of electoral fraud is more likely if there is perceived to be a chance of getting a big benefit from changing the outcome of the election. The reason that electoral fraud holds open this promise is a belief that if allegations of fraud are substantiated, then there could be a new election, as was the case in Ukraine during the Orange Revolution. Actual evidence of electoral fraud, therefore, should make the possibility that an election result could be overturned appear more realistic than simply rumors of fraud. Thus while Trump simply repeating that the system is rigged might have an effect on whether his supporters participate in the election, it is less clear whether these claims absent any evidence would encourage them to take to the street in protest. Allegations of electoral fraud in close elections ought to spur more people to protest than in elections that are not close Again, this follows from the same logic that the likelihood of protest is greater when the potential ""benefit"" from protesting is larger. Thus, if an election is close, the likelihood that correcting fraud could overturn the result is higher than if an election is not close. This in turn means that more potential protesters should decide the expected benefits from participating in a protest against electoral fraud following a close election will exceed the costs of doing so than following an election that is not close. Implications for the coming weeks in the United States For the first time in the modern era, a United States presidential candidate from a major party has suggested that the elections may be rigged. Political science theory suggests that if enough of his supporters believe that the results of the election are fraudulent, protests aimed at trying to overturn the results of the election are not out of the question. However, it is important to note that most recent examples of such protests do not come from established democratic systems with as long a history of democratic rule as is found in the United States. At the same time, theory also suggests that in the absence of credible evidence of electoral fraud, such protests are considerably less likely. That being said, this in turn raises the question of whether we have entered a ""post-truth"" era, in which social media and the Internet have rendered actual evidence of the truth of political claims less important than they may previously have been. (As an aside, it is also clearly the case that organizing protest is easier in a social media world than it was in a the pre-social media world). Finally, we should expect a close election -- combined with allegations of electoral fraud -- to be more likely to generate protest than an election that is not close. And on that score at least -- the closeness of the election -- we should be able to have some more information in hand shortly."

So it's notable that a large group of political scientists has now signed an open letter warning that their academic experience persuades them that Donald Trump poses a unique menace to American democracy. The letter, which was signed by hundreds of political science professors at U.S. colleges and universities, defends the decision to weigh in on this particular election by noting that ""our profession has always had strong normative commitments"" to the convictions that ""peace is preferable to war, freedom to tyranny, justice to injustice, equality to inequality, democracy to authoritarianism,"" as well as to John Adams' notion that our government must be one ""of laws, and not of men."" It then says: It is in this spirit that we are voicing our collective concern about Donald Trump. Throughout the course of the U.S. presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly questioned and attacked the core institutions and norms that make democracy work. Such attacks by a major presidential candidate are unprecedented in American history but they are entirely familiar to those of us who study other parts of the world. Specifically, we are deeply concerned about the prospect of a Trump presidency for the following reasons: 1. He has cast doubt on the validity of the election process, without any supporting evidence. 2. He has stated that he may reject the outcome of a free election if he does not win. 3. He has encouraged supporters to engage in voter suppression and intimidation. 4. He has threatened to jail the leader of the opposition party. 5. He has questioned the independence of the judiciary and the impartiality of judges based on their race, ethnicity, religion, and parentage. 6. He has impugned the loyalty of citizens and other persons in the United States on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, and country of birth. 7. He has endangered freedom of the press by intimidating individual journalists, banning major news organizations from his rallies, and promising to change libel laws. 8. He has called for the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 9. He has threatened to destroy the strategic basis of NATO, the most important security alliance of the last seventy years, by questioning the commitment of the United States to regard an attack on any member state as an attack on all. For all these reasons and despite our own indifference on matters of politics and partisanship, we stand united in the conviction that a Trump presidency would pose a grave threat to American democracy and to other democratic governments around the world. Gretchen Helmke, a professor of political science at the University of Rochester, tells me that over 350 political scientists representing around 185 U.S. colleges and universities signed the letter. ""I was astounded by how many responses we got in such a short period of time,"" she says. I asked one of the letter's signatories -- Susan Stokes, a political science professor at Yale University who specializes in Latin American studies -- to elaborate a bit on the letter's argument. Specifically, in what sense does what we're seeing now from Trump resemble similar attacks on democracies in other parts of the world? And if Trump should lose tomorrow, what does his rise tell us about our own democracy's weaknesses going forward? Stokes emailed me: The alarm among many political scientists is acute. We have seen other countries where democratic institutions have come under assault. Venezuela had a stable two-party system for decades but was thrown off-kilter by a leader who weakened the courts and placed controls on the press. Russia had an emerging, competitive multi-party system and at least the promise of a balanced system of government. This emergence of democracy was stopped cold by an authoritarian leader and his inner circle, who has made steady incursions on the opposition, the press, and leaders in civil society. Of course American democracy is more than two centuries old and has survived civil war, depression, and many other threats. And countries in the developing world face challenges that are much more acute than the ones faced by wealthy and established democracies like the United States. But there's still cause for worry. Even if Trump loses tomorrow, he has cultivated a large following of citizens who are convinced that our elections are rigged, that the mainstream press can never be trusted, and that federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, produce intentionally misleading information. A culture of such deep distrust does not augur well for American democracy. Just in case you needed a reminder of just how much is at stake in this election -- and that, no matter what happens, this story will not end tomorrow.  "

But he'll be following in the footsteps of other moguls who have jumped into the political fray elsewhere in the world. The track record for these businessmen-turned-political leaders is decidedly mixed. Some have translated their private sector acumen into success in government. Others had tenures marked by scandal, and even a military coup. Americans have elected presidents with business experience before -- among them, George W. Bush, who ran an oil company, and Herbert Hoover, a mining executive. But all moved into politics before running for the nation's highest office. Trump would be the first American president to never have held elected office, or other high-level government or military post. The real estate magnate has long promoted his business background as a selling point for voters frustrated with career politicians.  ""We need people in Washington that know how to make a deal,"" Trump says. A look at some of the billionaires who blazed a trail from business to politics: ___ SILVIO BERLUSCONI, ITALY Trump has drawn more comparisons to the brash Berlusconi, a three-term Italian prime minister, than perhaps any other foreign leader. Both are irreverent and controversial, and they like to flaunt their lavish lifestyles. Each started his careers in real estate, but made his name in the media world: Berlusconi built a fortune buying up television stations and Trump became a fixture in the New York tabloids and reality TV. For Trump, that's probably about where he'd like the comparisons to end. Berlusconi was a fixture in Italian politics for two decades, but his time in office was frequently marred by scandal. He was convicted of multiple crimes, including tax fraud and paying for sex with an underage prostitute, though the latter charge was overturned by an appeals court. ___ PETRO POROSHENKO, UKRAINE Known as Ukraine's ""Chocolate King,"" Poroshenko made his fortune in the confectionary industry. Now he's a key Western partner in trying to resolve the heated dispute between Ukraine and Russia. Poroshenko was elected president in 2014 following the public uprising that led to the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russian leader. The billionaire businessman positioned himself as a friend of Europe and the United States, and indeed speaks and meets regularly with both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. But Poroshenko's tenure has coincided with more Russian meddling in Ukraine, particularly along the country's shared border. The U.S. has sent Ukraine tens of millions of dollars in nonlethal aid; Obama has resisted calls to send lethal assistance. It's unclear what type of support Poroshenko would have from the U.S. under a potential Trump administration. Trump has spoken favorably about Russian President Vladimir Putin an Trump has said he would be ""looking at"" whether to recognize Crimea -- a Ukrainian area annexed by Moscow -- as Russian territory. Poroshenko's transition from businessman to political leader also holds warning signs for Trump's financial future. The Ukrainian leader saw his net worth decline significantly after taking office. ___ THAKSIN SHINAWATRA, THAILAND A telecommunications billionaire, Thaksin was Thailand's prime minister until he was ousted in a military coup in 2006. During his tenure, Thaksin drew support from poorer voters who backed his reduction in hospital feeds and other populist programs. But Thaksin's wealth would contribute to his political downfall. He faced corruption allegations after his family sold a company for $1.9 billion in a way that enabled them to avoid paying taxes on the sale, sparking a year of political tumult in Thailand that ended in the coup. Though he's been in exile for several years, Thaksin remains involved in Thai politics from affair. Earlier this year, he weighed in on American elections, saying there was ""some similarity"" between himself and Trump.  ""The cultures are very similar, the culture of being a businessman,"" Thaksin told the Financial Times. ""And then when successful businessmen come to politics, they give fresh air to political campaigns."" ___ SEBASTIAN PINERA, CHILE Pinera's financial empire touched numerous parts of Chilean society. He held stakes in the country's largest airline, a television station and the popular soccer team Colo-Colo. Turning to politics, Pinera campaigned on his private sector experience and became the first conservative to lead Chile since military rule ended in 1990. But his presidency launched to an inauspicious start -- a major earthquake disrupted his 2010 inauguration. Chile experienced solid economic growth during Pinera's four-year term, but the president himself was deeply unpopular. Chile's constitution prohibits presidents from serving two consecutive terms. Pinera is eligible to run again in 2018. Pinera hasn't been shy about weighing in on the U.S. election, levying sharp criticism on Trump. During an appearance in New York last fall, Pinera said the Republican would be a divisive leader and said his election would be a ""tragedy."" ___ Follow Julie Pace on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
