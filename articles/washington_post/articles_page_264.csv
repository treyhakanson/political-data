(Jeff Erickson)  The sight of hulking moose isn't uncommon in the region around Unalakleet, an Alaska town on the coast of the Bering Sea. But Brad Webster had never seen moose like this before. Webster, a social studies and science teacher, was showing a friend around the grounds of the Bible camp that he helps maintain. It was early November -- before the first snow, but cold enough that the slough at the site was covered in a sheet of ice thick enough to walk on and clear enough to see through. Webster's friend was new to Alaska, and it was his first time walking on ice. So they decided to go for a walk on the waterway.   [Thirty years after Chernobyl disaster, camera study captures a wildlife wonderland]   The two men rounded a bend, and there, Webster said, they saw it: a large set of antlers and a hairy brown hump protruding from the ice. They got closer, and they saw another hump -- and another set of antlers, entangled with the first set. The two bull moose were lying on their sides, apparently locked in a fight to the death, and now perfectly preserved in eight inches of ice. ""We were both kind of in awe,"" Webster, 33, said in an interview on Wednesday. ""I've heard of other animals this had happened to, but I've never seen anything like this.""    (Jeff Erickson)  Neither have most people. Another friend of Webster's, Jeff Erickson, posted photos of the moose on Facebook this week, and the remarkable sight promptly shot around the globe (sparking, predictably, some metaphorical jokes about politics). Erickson said even ""elders"" in the town had never seen such a thing. Kris Hundertmark, chair of the biology and wildlife department at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said in an email that male moose compete for females by clashing antlers and pushing against each other during the fall breeding season. Adult male moose are extremely strong, he said, but their large antlers often have ""complex"" shapes that can become so entangled that the animals cannot dislodge themselves from their opponents, he said. Hundertmark said the only ones he's seen are skulls of conjoined moose found in the wild -- but not in ice.   [These undercover robot animals are helping in the hunt for poachers]   ""These two fellows were unfortunate in that they probably fell into the water while locked together and drowned,"" Hundertmark said. ""Then again, that is a much quicker way to go than by getting locked together in some forest and slowly starving to death.""    Nearly two weeks later, Webster and friends went to recover the two moose heads. (Jeff Erickson)  This past weekend, Webster, Erickson, and a few other friends -- including a taxidermist -- went back to the site to retrieve the two moose heads, which Webster said he wanted to mount and use as wall hangings with a heck of a backstory at the Bible camp. It took a few hours, a chainsaw and an ice pick to get through the ice, under which were about two feet of water, he said. They left the carcasses, which he said some people in town are talking about using to feed dog sled teams. When they examined the heads, it looked as though one moose might have pierced the other's skull, Webster said, leading him to believe that one might have died mid-battle, then pulled the other down into the water with him. ""After that one's dead, it's kind of like you won the battle but you lose the war, because you've got a whole other moose attached to your head right now,"" he said. Erickson, 57, said in an email that the sight of the downed moose, which were by Saturday covered in a dusting of white, will stay with him. ""Life in northwest Alaska can have a stark reality and brutal consequences,"" he wrote. But, he added: ""I was just happy to be part of the recovery. ... The view of the antlers protruding from the ice with the soft layer of snow on the carcasses not encased in the ice was such a stark and eerily beautiful scene."" Read more: You go, girl!

But he says he's proud of the thousands who took to streets peacefully. The mayor, a Democrat and son of immigrants, said Thursday that had he been younger, he might have hit the bricks as well and called Wednesday's peaceful demonstrations ""a beautiful expression of democracy."" On Thursday, a few dozen people again blocked a local freeway in the Boyle Heights area. California Highway Patrol officers were talking to them. Garcetti said he believed the election of a Republican won't affect federal funding for Los Angeles and said he hoped President-elect Donald Trump will set an example and repair damage from his campaign rhetoric, which was seen as virulently anti-immigrant. ___ 2:40 p.m. Police at a Central Texas university want to know who is behind fliers posted on campus that urge formation of ""tar and feather vigilante squads"" to ""arrest and torture"" campus diversity advocates. The fliers posted around the Texas State University campus Thursday morning featured a picture of armed white men labeled ""Texas State Vigilantes"" beneath a U.S. flag. It professes support for President-elect Donald Trump and Republican majorities in Congress. Aside from the acts against diversity advocates, the flier also urges augmenting a border wall by irradiation with nuclear waste and stocking the Rio Grande with alligators and piranhas. It also urges the sabotage of campus toilets. Campus police Sgt. Rolando Belmares (beh-MAH'-rehs) says at least five fliers were posted around the San Marcos campus before a campus anti-Trump demonstration. ___ 2:20 p.m. High school students in San Francisco chanted ""not my president"" and waved rainbow and Mexican flags as they marched through the city's downtown in protest of Republican Donald Trump's presidential win. The San Francisco Unified School District said Wednesday that more than 1,000 students staged a citywide walkout on Thursday. Bystanders in the heavily Democratic city high-fived them from the sidelines. Thousands have taken to the streets around the country since Tuesday's election. Demonstrators have disrupted traffic, burned a giant papier-mache Trump head and declared that they refused to accept Trump's victory. Demonstrations have been held in New England, the Midwest and the West Coast. Trump supporters have taken to social media to express their scorn of the protests, saying demonstrators are hypocrites for not accepting the democratic process because they don't like the results. ___ 3 a.m. Several hundred people flooded onto one of the busiest freeways in Los Angeles, causing a miles-long traffic backup in protest of the presidential election of Donald Trump. The protesters, who had remained peaceful and not overly disruptive for most of the night, poured on to U.S. 101, which links downtown LA to Hollywood, and stayed there for most of an hour. Drivers sat and waited. Many got out of their cars. The crowd was slowly starting to disperse as many of the demonstrators left the freeway and others were taken into police custody. There was no violence between officers and protesters. The demonstrators were among thousands who took to streets in protest of Trump across the country, from New York to Texas to much of the West Coast. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

After starting his day at the White House, Obama will fly early Monday to Michigan to rally for Clinton in Ann Arbor. From there, he'll get to Durham, New Hampshire, for another Clinton rally. Obama then heads to Philadelphia to end the campaign with a bang. He and Michelle Obama will appear together, alongside Hillary, Bill and Chelsea Clinton. The final-day focus on states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire that Clinton has been expecting to win shows how Democrats are playing defense in the final days. The race has tightened and some Republican-leaning states that Democrats were hoping to flip now seem likely to stay Republican. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I was a part of a presidential campaign that had challenged the stereotype of Republicanism with a series of policy proposals on education, addiction treatment and other elements of social welfare. Suspend, for a moment, your views on the efficacy of No Child Left Behind and the faith-based initiative. Accept that we viewed the coming election -- if we won -- as the mandate for a certain model of governance.  I was deeply and personally invested in the outcome of the 2000 election. I believed that the reform of Republican ideology would serve the whole country, the common good. When I walked into the West Wing for the first time, and entered the Roosevelt Room just as the picture above the fireplace was being switched from Franklin to Teddy, I felt the continuity and burden of a noble experiment in self-government.  In his first inaugural address (a document I helped produce), President George W. Bush expressed the goal of his administration this way: ""Sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent but not a country. We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.""   We were not, of course, unique in this idealism. This was the commitment of Barack Obama's administration when it entered the White House. And Bill Clinton's administration. And nearly all that preceded them.      Donald Trump addressed the GOP convention in Cleveland, Ohio, July 21. The Republican presidential candidate spoke for more than one hour, we broke it down to less than five minutes. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)    [Fellow millennials: I know you're frustrated. Vote anyway.]  I own up to being even more emotionally entangled in the result of the 2016 election -- not because of any change in policy or ideology, but because of Donald Trump's proposed shift in the very purpose of the presidency. His political theory, such as it is, is ""us"" vs. ""them."" The ""them"" may be Republican elites, or liberal elites, or migrants or Mexicans or Muslims. Trump would be elected on the promise of fighting, rounding up, jailing or humbling any number of personal and political opponents. Take away this appeal, and there is nothing left but grasping, pathetic vanity. The undercurrents of economic anxiety and cultural disorientation that Trump exploits are real, deserving both attention and sympathy. But Trump has organized these resentments with an unprecedented message: The United States is weak and broken, a hell of crime, terrorism and expanding misery, beset from within and without, and now in need of a strong hand -- his strong hand -- to turn things around.  The single most frightening, anti-democratic phrase of modern presidential history came in Trump's convention speech: ""I alone can fix it."" A Trump victory would be a mandate for authoritarian politics. Trump's ambitions would be bounded by strong legislative and legal institutions and by his own risible ignorance of real leadership. But a Trump administration would be a concession to the idea that America needs a little more China, a little more Russia, a little more ""so let it be written, so let it be done"" in its executive branch.  I never imagined that Republican leaders -- many of whom I know and have respected -- would fall in line with such dangerous delusions, on the theory that anything is better than Hillary Clinton. Most options are better than Clinton. But not all. And not this. The GOP has largely accommodated itself to a candidate with no respect for, or knowledge of, the constitutional order. Every constitutional conservative should be revolted. Those who are complicit have adopted a particularly dangerous form of power-loving hypocrisy.   [Final days, awful choice]  But now, with polls tightening, it may not only be Republicans who abandon central tenets of their democratic faith. It is almost beyond belief that Americans should bless and normalize Trump's appeal. Normalize vindictiveness and prejudice. Normalize bragging about sexual assault and the objectification of women. Normalize conspiracy theories and the abandonment of reason. Normalize contempt for the vulnerable, including disabled people and refugees fleeing oppression. Normalize a political tone that dehumanizes opponents and excuses violence. Normalize an appeal to white identity in a nation where racial discord and conflict are always close to the surface. Normalize every shouted epithet, every cruel ethnic and religious stereotype, every act of bullying in the cause of American ""greatness."" In the end, a Trump victory would normalize the belief that the structures of self-government are unequal to the crisis of our time. And this would not merely replace the presidential portrait above the fireplace. It would deface it.
