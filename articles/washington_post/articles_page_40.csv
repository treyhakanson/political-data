Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, turning to a pair of staunch conservatives as he begins to fill out his Cabinet. Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism and has cast Islam as a ""political ideology"" and driver of extremism. Sessions and Flynn were ardent Trump supporters during the campaign, and their promotions were seen in part as a reward for their loyalty. The selections form the first outlines of Trump's Cabinet and national security teams. Given his lack of governing experience and vague policy proposals during the campaign, his selection of advisers is being scrutinized both in the U.S. and abroad. Trump's initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam's role in stoking extremism. Sessions, who is best known for his hard-line immigration views, has questioned whether terror suspects should benefit from the rights available in U.S. courts. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders are ""potentially complicit"" in attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam. Pompeo's nomination to lead the CIA also opens the prospect of the U.S. resuming torture of detainees. Trump has backed harsh interrogation techniques that President Barack Obama and Congress have banned, saying the U.S. ""should go tougher than waterboarding,"" which simulates drowning. In 2014, Pompeo criticized Obama for ""ending our interrogation program"" and said intelligence officials ""are not torturers, they are patriots."" In a separate matter Friday, it was announced that Trump had agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve three lawsuits over Trump University, his former school for real estate investors. The lawsuits alleged the school misled students and failed to deliver on its promises in programs that cost up to $35,000. Trump has denied the allegations and has said repeatedly he would not settle. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who announced the settlement, called it ""a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university."" Messages seeking comment from Trump attorneys and a spokeswoman were not immediately returned. Trump did not announce his Cabinet choices in person, instead releasing a statement. He has made no public appearances this week, holing up in his New York skyscraper for meetings. He is spending the weekend at his New Jersey golf club. Sessions and Pompeo would both require Senate confirmation before assuming their designated roles; Flynn would not. Members of minority groups have voiced alarm at Trump's staff appointments so far, saying his choices threaten national unity and promise to turn back the clock on progress for racial, religious and sexual minorities. They say comments attributed to Trump's picks could embolden some Americans to lash out at members of minority groups Most of Trump's nominees are expected to be confirmed relatively easily given the GOP majority in the Senate. However, potential roadblocks exist, particularly for Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump and one of the chamber's most conservative members. His last Senate confirmation hearing, in 1986 for a federal judgeship, was derailed over allegations that he made racist comments, including calling a black assistant U.S. attorney ""boy"" in conversation. Sessions denied the accusation, but withdrew from consideration. Republicans were supportive on Friday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called his Senate colleague ""principled, forthright, and hardworking."" Sessions would bring to the Justice Department a consistently conservative voice. He has objected to the planned closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and has given prominence to the specter of voting fraud, a problem that current Justice Department leaders believe is negligible. Pompeo, who graduated first in his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, is a conservative Republican and a strong critic of Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. He has said former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden should enjoy due process and then be sentenced to death for taking and releasing secret documents about surveillance programs in which the U.S. government collected the phone records of millions of Americans. Anthony Romero, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said Pompeo's views raise concerns about ""privacy and due process."" Of Trump's new personnel picks, Flynn will have the most direct access to the president. The national security adviser works from the West Wing and is often one of the last people to meet with the president before major foreign policy decisions are made. Flynn built a reputation in the military intelligence community as an astute professional and unconventional thinker. He asserted that he was forced out of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 because he disagreed with Obama's approach to combating extremism, though his critics claimed he mismanaged the agency. He shares Trump's belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow, and his warmth toward Russia worries some national security experts. Flynn traveled last year to Moscow, where he joined Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials in a celebration of the RT network, a Russian government-controlled television channel. Flynn said he was paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort. The president-elect is still weighing a range of candidates for other leading national security posts. Possibilities for secretary of state are said to include former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who met with Trump Thursday. On Saturday, Trump is to meet with retired Gen. James Mattis, a contender to lead the Pentagon. He was also meeting with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who lambasted Trump as a ""con man"" and a ""fraud"" in a stinging speech in March. Trump responded by repeatedly referring to Romney as a ""loser."" ___ Pace reported from Washington.

Trump's tweet on Thursday asserting that he had dissuaded Ford from moving a Kentucky factory to Mexico was a stretch, at the very least. The company has no intention of moving the plant, and it had already agreed to keep production of one specific model there. Throughout the campaign, Trump accused Ford of exporting U.S. jobs south of the border and, in alarming terms, contended that auto jobs are leaving the country in mass. He also misstated the impact of trade agreements on U.S. auto jobs and has threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods imported from Mexico. While it's true that Ford and others have spent billions of dollars on assembly and parts plants in Mexico, the industry also has added thousands of U.S. jobs since auto sales recovered from the Great Recession. There aren't as many jobs at U.S. auto plants as there were a decade ago, but that's due more to automation than to the free-trade agreements that Trump has criticized. Here are how Trump's statements about Ford and the industry stack up with the facts: TRUMP: ""Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico."" THE FACTS: Ford never had any intention of moving a factory from Kentucky to Mexico. But it did propose shifting production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV from Louisville to Cuautitlan, Mexico. The idea was to free assembly-line space to make more Ford Escapes, which are made on the same line as the MKC. In a deal with the United Auto Workers union, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the plant and not cut any jobs, since workers would still make Escapes. So, while Trump may have been responsible for keeping production of the MKC in Louisville -- Ford wouldn't say if he directly played a role -- there should be little if any impact on the Louisville plant's 4,700 workers. Ford has sold only 21,000 MKCs so far this year, compared with 258,000 Escapes. Also, Escape sales have been falling since July, so the need for added factory capacity to build more of them isn't needed. ___ TRUMP: ""Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. ... Ford is leaving ... thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio."" THE FACTS: Trump was referring to Ford's plans to shift all small-car production to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages. The company announced this year that it would move the Ford Focus and C-Max from suburban Detroit to a new plant south of the border. But the move wouldn't cost any U.S. jobs. The 3,700 workers at the plant in Wayne, Michigan, that now makes the small cars will stay employed building a new SUV and small pickup truck. Trump and his supporters contend the Mexican jobs could have been added in the U.S. if Ford built a new factory here instead of in Mexico. But Ford says it's nearly impossible to make money building small cars in the U.S., while Mexico's lower costs of production, including wages, allow the automaker to turn a profit on the vehicles. As for jobs fleeing the U.S., the U.S. auto industry has actually added 300,000 jobs since June 2009, when the recession ended. ___ TRUMP: When he becomes president ""The auto industry will come roaring back."" THE FACTS: The industry has already roared back from the financial crisis. Total U.S. auto sales reached a record level of 17.5 million last year. They may tail off slightly this year, but sales are expected to stay near the record or even grow during the next several years. The resurgence has benefited both U.S.-based and foreign automakers, many of which have U.S. factories. ___ TRUMP: ""According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000."" THE FACTS: Michigan actually added jobs after the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994, when auto-manufacturing and auto-parts plants employed roughly 280,000 workers. Over the next six years, their ranks increased to 320,000. But the jobs started falling in Michigan as U.S. automakers lost market share, automation increased and the Great Recession hit. Auto employment bottomed out at 95,000 in 2009 and recovered to about 165,000 as of September.

The Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Maryland Court of Appeals voted 18 to 5 to recommend an overhaul of the state's money-based bail system, which critics say is unfair to poor and minority defendants. The public will have 30 days to review the rule change -- which is opposed by bail bondsmen, most state prosecutors and some state lawmakers -- before it is considered by the Court of Appeals. ""We saw a problem that needed to be fixed,"" said retired judge Alan M.Wilner, the chair of the rules committee, after the nearly five-hour hearing. ""The impact of setting bail that a person cannot make is irrational. It is not really setting bail -- it is putting them in jail, and it has a disparate impact first on poor people, for sure, and on people of color."" Advocates in Maryland and across the country have been fighting for years to change the bail system, which can leave poor people in jail for months awaiting trial while those charged with similar crimes but who can pay go free.    (ENRIQUE CASTRO-MENDIVIL/REUTERS)  Among those testifying in favor of a change was Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D), who asked the rules committee to consider a change after his office issued an opinion that the state's system probably was unconstitutional, and Prince George's County State's Attorney Angela Alsobrooks (D), who broke from most of her colleagues. ""I'm almost ashamed to admit that we have a two-tiered system,"" Alsobrooks said. ""I have become devastated about the way we have operated our criminal justice system."" Opponents of limiting cash bail said the state is not equipped to handle such a change and would struggle, for example, to find a way to deal with defendants who do not show up for trial. As part of an effort to lobby against a change, bail bondsmen have begun disseminating data about the growing number of defendants released on recognizance since last month, when District Court Chief Judge John P. Morrissey advised judges and commissioners to impose the ""least onerous"" conditions on those awaiting trial.  [Md. attorney general's office raises questions about cash bail system]  Frosh said eliminating cash bail for poor defendants would have a major impact. ""People will no longer be sitting in jail waiting for trial because they can't afford to pay for bail,"" he said. ""If they are a danger, they should be locked up; if they are not going to show up for trial, they should be locked up. But if they are not a threat to anybody . . . they should not be sitting in jail for weeks or months awaiting trial."" Del. Joseph F. Vallario Jr. (D-Prince George's), a member of the rules committee and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was one of five people who voted Friday against recommending the change to the Court of Appeals. Vallario argued that the issue should be handled by the legislature, not the courts, and accused the committee of a ""rush to judgment."" Previous attempts to pass laws reforming the bail system have stalled in the General Assembly, including bills sponsored by Frosh when he was a state senator. In a letter to the rules committee this week, state Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) and Sen. Robert A. Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), the chairman of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, also tried to discourage the committee from taking action on the rule change. Zirkin said in an interview that the court system usually makes rule changes after legislation has been enacted, and he noted that the General Assembly could pass legislation that negates any changes the Court of Appeals makes. Gerard Evans, a lobbyist for the bail bondsmen, accused Frosh of trying to dodge the legislative process. But Frosh said the action was ""completely within the purview of the courts."" The five Democratic lawmakers who initially sought the attorney general's opinion -- Dels. Kathleen M. Dumais (Montgomery), Erek L. Barron (Prince George's), Shelly L. Hettleman (Baltimore County), Marc A. Korman (Montgomery) and Brooke E. Lierman (Baltimore City) -- say they support a rules change and plan to introduce additional legislation addressing bail and other pretrial issues in the upcoming legislative session. ""This has been legislatively debated, and nothing has happened,"" Robert Zarbin, an attorney and a member of the rules committee, said during the hearing. ""If we pass this rule, something will happen in Annapolis. This is the best catalyst to get people talking."" "

In strident speeches and public comments, including a fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has aggressively argued that Islamic State militants pose a threat on a global scale and demanded a far more aggressive U.S. military campaign against the group. In a June interview with CNN, Flynn complained the U.S. needs to ""discredit"" radical Islam, but that ""we're not allowed to do that right now."" But his comments about Islam, a religion practiced by more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, have at times gone beyond condemning radicals inside the faith. In Flynn's book, ""The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and its Allies,"" he condemned U.S. leaders who have called Islam a religion of peace. ""This insistence on denying the existence of jihad led President Obama to the absurd claim that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam,"" Flynn wrote. In August, he spoke at an event in Dallas hosted by the anti-Islamist group Act for America, calling Islam a ""cancer"" and a ""political ideology"" that ""definitely hides behind being a religion."" Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group based in California, said in a statement that Flynn's appointment ""signals support for anti-Muslim policies and sentiment that will undermine our nation's security and exacerbate an already unsafe climate for Muslims and all Americans."" The role of national security adviser has varied by administration, but usually centers on coordinating the policy positions of the secretaries of state, defense, justice and other members of a president's national security team. It is an especially powerful position because of the national security adviser's access to the president in the West Wing of the White House. The adviser acts as a gatekeeper on a wide range of issues, including matters of war and peace as well as diplomacy and intelligence. Flynn, who turns 58 in December, served for more than three decades in the Army following his commissioning in 1981 as a second lieutenant in military intelligence. His career included a stint as director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and intelligence chief for the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. It ended, however, when he was forced to resign from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 after two turbulent years leading the Pentagon's top spy agency. After leaving the agency, Flynn became a harsh critic of the Obama administration's prosecution of the fight against the Islamic State group and emerged as one of Trump's most vocal backers. Throughout the campaign, Flynn championed many of Trump's foreign policy provisions, including renegotiating a seven-country agreement with Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions. Yet while Flynn has publicly issued dark warnings about the risks of Islamic violence, his private consulting firm has lobbied for a company headed by a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey's authoritarian, Islamist-leaning government, which cracked down on dissent and jailed thousands of opponents after a failed coup in July against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press on Friday that he had no relationship with Erdogan's government, even though he is member of a Turkish foreign economic relations board managed by the country's Economic Ministry. In an op-ed for the Washington newspaper The Hill just before the election, Flynn wrote that Turkey needs support and echoed Erdogan's warnings that a ""shady"" Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. Erdogan has accused the cleric, Fethullah Gullen, of orchestrating the July coup attempt and called for his extradition. The Obama administration has not complied. Alptekin said Friday that Flynn's editorial supporting Erdogan was not connected to his company's lobbying or the Turkish government. ""The Turkish government did not order that,"" he said. The Flynn Intel Group also lobbied Congress even as Flynn joined Trump in a presidential intelligence briefing in August -- a possible security misstep, according to several ethics law experts.  ""If the general was receiving classified information that could affect his business interests, that would be an obvious concern,"" said Joe Sandler, a campaign ethics lawyer and expert on the law that requires lobbyists for foreign governments to register their activities. Sandler and others also questioned why Flynn's firm registered as lobbyists with Congress instead of the Justice Department's stricter Foreign Agent unit, which requires more detailed reporting of activities under the federal Foreign Agent Registration Act.  ""If a foreign entity is lobbying Congress with the aim of influencing U.S policy, they're required to file under the foreign agent act,"" said Lydia Bennett, an expert in foreign agent work with the non-partisan Project on Government Oversight in Washington. Flynn's consulting group registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September for Inovo BV, a company Alptekin set up in the Netherlands in 2005. Alptekin said the lobbying project was designed to support an energy firm that he declined to identify. Alptekin said a lobbyist for Flynn's firm, Robert Kelley, had suggested it aim to improve U.S.-Turkish relations as part of its work for the energy firm. Kelley and Flynn Intel Group did not respond to calls and emails from the AP, and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Flynn said in a statement Kelley provided to Yahoo News that ""if I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Rep. Bill Shuster, head of the House transportation committee, told The Associated Press that he spoke to Trump about the idea several times both before and during the presidential election. He said he believes the president-elect would be supportive, although details would have to be worked out.  ""I have spoken to him on a number of occasions and he generally likes the idea,"" Shuster said. ""We do need to sit down and put meat on the bones ... I think in general he sees it as something that's positive and we need to work on it."" The Republican lawmaker endorsed Trump early on and campaigned twice with him in his Pennsylvania congressional district. He also campaigned twice with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Since the election, Shuster has met with Shirley Ybarra, a former Virginia transportation secretary who is working with the Trump transition team on transportation matters. Ybarra and the Trump transition team didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Shuster and most of the airline industry have been pressing for air traffic control privatization. They say the Federal Aviation Administration is moving too slowly to adopt new technology and that airlines haven't seen the benefits they expected from the agency's air traffic control modernization program, which has been in the works for more than a decade. Earlier this year, Shuster included a plan to privatize air traffic control in a bill to extend the FAA's operating authority. The bill was approved by the transportation committee, but Shuster was unable to get it to the House floor after several influential lawmakers, including the Ways and Means Committee chairman and the House and Senate Appropriations Committee chairmen, raised objections. Democrats, some segments of the aviation industry and some FAA unions also oppose the plan, although the National Air Traffic Controllers Association endorsed the bill. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee chairman and Shuster's Senate counterpart, hasn't taken a position on the issue. He said Friday that the FAA hasn't been successful in bringing fundamental change to how air traffic is managed despite spending billions of dollars.  ""Congress has different options, and we will continue to explore them, but the case for changing the FAA's approach to air traffic control modernization has become stronger,"" Thune told the AP. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., the senior Democrat on the House transportation committee, cautioned earlier this week that any proposal to overhaul the existing air traffic system ""must be thoroughly vetted, not rushed through Congress just because the political landscape makes it easier."" Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., raised objections Friday to what he described as an attempt by House proponents of air traffic control privatization to include language in a defense policy bill that would effectively squelch military objections to the plan. Nelson described his concerns in a letter Friday to Senate Armed Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the committee's senior Democrat. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

Although the presidential vote isn't directly linked to the executive, Boiko Borisov announced that he was stepping down because there wasn't enough popular support for his GERB party. Parliament on Wednesday voted 218-0 to approve the resignation of Borisov's government. Borisov, whose party had triumphed in all national elections over the last decade, told legislators that ""the vote gave a clear signal that society wants a change."" He said that he would ensure a smooth transition and stay in office until a new government has been formed. Halfway into its four-year term, Borisov's coalition government has managed to restore political stability after months of anti-corruption protests. But its popularity has faded because of the slow pace of reforms to eliminate graft and poverty, and overhaul the judicial system. The government's resignation triggers a constitutional procedure, by which the president must offer a mandate to seek to form a government three times. If these attempts fail, the president appoints a caretaker government. President Rosen Plevneliev, whose term expires on Jan. 22, is barred by the constitution from dissolving parliament because he is in his final three months in office. It will be up to his successor, Rumen Radev, to dissolve the assembly and declare parliamentary elections within 60 days. Preliminary estimates indicate that an election could be held in in April.

President-elect Donald Trump made clear that school choice would be an education priority. When Trump spoke at a Cleveland charter school in September, he pledged to funnel $20 billion in existing federal dollars into scholarships for low-income students. That idea would require approval from Congress, which last year passed a bipartisan overhaul of No Child Left Behind and is unlikely to alter it in the near future. Still, there are smaller-scale ways Trump could reshape public education. A first step might be asking Congress to restore funding to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, the country's first federally funded, private school voucher program. The House voted to extend funding earlier this year, but a companion bill has stalled in the Senate. Gerard Robinson, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who advised the Trump campaign on education policy, called the D.C. program ""a good place to start."" Created in 2004, the program last year gave vouchers to about 1,200 low-income students. The vouchers are capped at $8,452 for kindergarten through 8th grade and $12,679 for high school. Among the 40-plus schools participating are elite private schools like Sidwell Friends, which has counted among its students Chelsea Clinton and Malia and Sasha Obama. The idea of allowing public funds to follow individual students to a charter, magnet or private school isn't new. Programs are already in place in states like Indiana, where Pence, as governor, oversaw a dramatic expansion of vouchers in the state. Nearly 33,000 students participated last school year, up from nearly 4,000 in 2011-12. The vouchers are awarded on a sliding scale based on income and family size. For 2015-2016, the top voucher averaged nearly $5,500 for a high school student. The Indiana Supreme Court upheld the program in 2013, ruling that it didn't violate a state constitutional provision against public funding for religious programs. At the federal level, Congress considered allowing Title I funds targeted for low-income students to follow them to the school where they enroll, but that idea was ultimately scrapped in the final version of NCLB's successor, the Every Students Succeeds Act. Vic Klatt, a principal of Penn Hill Group who has worked on federal education policy for more than two decades, says school choice has a better chance now, but it won't be easy.  ""There will be tons of support for charters. Full-scale private choice will be a battle,"" Klatt said at an Education Writers Association panel discussion this week. ""It's going to depend on how much emphasis this president and his people put on private school choice as an issue."" Education observers said there are other ways to push that agenda, including tax incentives to move children from public to private schools or a Race to the Top-style grant program in which states are encouraged to adopt choice-friendly policies in exchange for funds. The Obama administration's Race to the Top competition gave $4 billion to states that vowed to adopt more rigorous standards and turn around failing schools. States that adopted the Common Core standards in math and reading were more likely to win a slice of the pie. Trump repeatedly promised to ""put an end to Common Core,"" but the standards were adopted by individual states and the new education law explicitly prohibits the federal government from telling states which standards to adopt, Common Core or otherwise. Trump's campaign plan for school choice was scant on details: He did not say where the $20 billion in federal funding would come from or how it would be doled out.  ""I think what you're going to hear from him is a shift from the term school choice to parental choice,"" Robinson said in an interview with The Associated Press, adding that he was speaking for himself, not the Trump transition team. Robinson has been mentioned as a possible education secretary in a Trump administration. Research on school choice programs like the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship suggests mixed results. One evaluation of the D.C. voucher program found students had slightly higher reading scores but no significant improvements in math. A subsequent review of that study, however, found it downplayed results showing higher scores were concentrated among certain groups of students.  ""I would have hoped for and expected better results than we saw,"" said Kevin Welner, director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. Some education leaders expressed doubt that Trump's proposal would be roundly welcomed at a time when there has been increasing skepticism of large-scale expansions of alternatives like charters. Voters in Massachusetts and Georgia rejected ballot measures that would have paved the way for the creation of more charter schools.  ""I think you would get a limited number of states that would take advantage of it,"" said Kristen Amundson, executive director of the National Association of State Boards of Education. ""It's not something that is being universally asked for."" ___ Armario reported from Los Angeles.

Activists posted photos online that appeared to have been taken inside both facilities, and witnesses confirmed Wednesday's advance. Medical officials say dozens of fighters have been killed on both sides. The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns and the medics because they were not authorized to release the information. Yemen's conflict pits pro-government forces and a Saudi-led coalition against the rebels and allied security forces loyal to a former president. The rebels captured the capital, Sanaa, in 2014.

As Trump met with senior advisers to discuss potential Cabinet candidates, there were further signs that power in his transition effort was consolidating within an ever-smaller group of loyalists generally not aligned with Republican members of the Washington establishment.  [The latest news on the Trump presidential transition]  Among them is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a top Trump adviser known for his hard-line views on immigration. His former staff director at the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brian Benczkowski, is now helping to manage the Justice Department transition for Trump's team, according to two prominent Republican lawyers with knowledge of the matter. Benczkowski replaced Kevin O'Connor, a former U.S. attorney and associate attorney general who had been managing the Justice Department transition, the lawyers said. A white-collar defense attorney at Kirkland & Ellis, Benczkowski previously worked in a number of senior Justice Department jobs and is a respected lawyer.         1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Chris Christie (R), who was recently replaced as head of the transition team by Vice President-elect Mike Pence and who had been considered an emissary to more mainstream Republicans. Benczkowski declined to comment. Pence is scheduled to meet with Congressional leaders in Washington on Thursday, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The new developments came as Sessions himself emerged as a top candidate for defense secretary, along with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). Both would bring hawkish views and military experience, but neither has executive experience running a massive bureaucracy such as the Pentagon. Trump was also visited Wednesday by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who emerged from a meeting with the president-elect saying that he told Trump that ""so many New Yorkers are fearful"" of what he plans to do as president. De Blasio, a liberal Democrat, has clashed with Trump in the past. And like mayors in many of the nation's major cities with diverse cultures, he has said New York City authorities would not assist federal immigration officials with the deportations of immigrants who are here illegally, providing them sanctuary. Despite such differences, De Blasio said the hour-long session was ""respectful"" and added that Trump ""loves this city.''     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet  From the lobby of Trump tower, reporters spotted a coterie of guests entering the building, including New York Jets owner and Republican megadonor Woody Johnson, Trump's children, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and his wife Lara Trump and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is considered a potential Cabinet nominee. Transition turmoil On his Twitter account, Trump took particular aim at a favorite target, the New York Times, which reported Wednesday that the transition has been marked by firings and infighting, and that U.S. allies were having trouble reaching Trump at New York's Trump Tower as he plans his government. ""The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. . . . I have received and taken calls from many foreign leaders,'' Trump wrote in a series of posts on the microblogging site. He also denied reports that his transition team has sought security clearances for his children. In his tweets, Trump falsely implies the Times reported that he had not spoken with foreign leaders and never points out exactly what the Times had in error. The Times did report that American allies were ""blindly dialing in to Trump Tower"" in an attempt to reach the president-elect and that key members of the transition team had been fired. The paper reported that even key U.S. allies such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and British Prime Minister Theresa May had been patched through to Trump ""with little warning,"" citing a Western diplomat. Later in the day, the transition team released a list of foreign leaders that Trump and Pence have spoked with.   [Trump's gripes about the Times are usually about stories that prove accurate]  The Washington Post has also reported about turbulence in Trump's transition. But Peter Hoekstra, a Republican former congressman from Michigan, defended Trump in an interview Wednesday, saying the president-elect's team has ""a monumental job to do and a short time to do it."" ""I'm just watching all the sniping coming in. They're not doing this right. They're not doing that right,'' said Hoekstra, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman who is reportedly under consideration for CIA director. ""This is what any transition team would do. You start with the people who brought you. I think the Trump team is going to expand its outreach, absolutely. But they're going to do it in a methodical way.'' The reported bloodletting in Trump's transition team that began with last week's ouster of Christie had escalated Tuesday with new departures, particularly in the area of national security.  Former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) announced that he had left his position as the transition's senior national security adviser. Rogers, a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the leading candidate for CIA director, was among at least four transition officials purged this week, apparently because of perceived connections to Christie. As turbulence within the team grew, some key members of Trump's party began to question his views and the remaining candidates for top positions. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Trump's efforts to work more closely with Russian President Vladimir Putin amounted to ""complicity in [the] butchery of the Syrian people"" and ""an unacceptable price for a great nation."" Trump met Tuesday with Pence, who replaced Christie at the head of the transition Friday, to discuss Cabinet and White House personnel choices. Little to no information was released by the transition office, leaving a clutch of reporters gathered in the lobby of Trump Tower to hustle after team members passing between the front doors and the elevators.   Trump posted a message Tuesday night on Twitter saying that a ""very organized process [is] taking place"" as he decides on Cabinet and other positions. ""I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!""  As he had during the campaign, Trump appeared to be increasingly uncomfortable with outsiders and suspicious of those considered part of what one insider called the ""bicoastal elite,"" who are perceived as trying to ""insinuate"" themselves into positions of power. Those in the inner circle reportedly were winnowed to loyalists who had stuck with Trump throughout the campaign and helped devise his winning strategy. They include Sessions, former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and members of Trump's family, including son-in-law Jared Kushner. ""This is a very insular, pretty closely held circle of people,"" said Philip D. Zelikow, a former director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia and a senior figure in the George W. Bush transition. ""Confusion is the norm"" for transitions, he said, ""but there are some unusual features here, because they're trying to make some statements."" ""They feel like their election was a lot of the American people wanting to throw a brick through a window,"" Zelikow said. ""They want to make appointments that make it sound like glass is being broken.""  [President Obama warns against 'a crude sort of nationalism' in the U.S.]  Increasingly, among the shards are more mainline Republicans in the national security field. In an angry Twitter post Tuesday, Eliot A. Cohen, a leading voice of opposition to Trump during the campaign who had advised those interested in administration jobs to take them, abruptly changed his mind, saying the transition ""will be ugly."" After responding to a transition insider seeking names of possible appointees, Cohen said, he received what he described as an ""unhinged"" email from the same person saying ""YOU LOST"" and accusing Trump critics of trying to infiltrate the administration's ranks. ""It became clear to me that they view jobs as lollipops, things you give out to good boys and girls, instead of the sense that actually what you're trying to do is recruit the best possible talent to fill the most important, demanding, lowest-paying executive jobs in the world,"" Cohen said. Rogers's departure coincided with word from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose possible selection as secretary of state comforted more mainline Republicans, that he was unlikely to be chosen. ""Has my name been in the mix? I'm pretty sure, yeah. Have I been having intimate conversations? No,"" Corker said in an interview. ""Do I understand that it's likely that people who've been involved in the center of this for some time, and have been surrogating on television, are likely front-runners? I would say that's likely, yes."" The two people whose names are mentioned most often for the diplomatic job -- Giuliani and John R. Bolton, an undersecretary of state and one-year ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration -- are Trump loyalists. But both could be problematic, even among Republicans who would have to confirm them. Giuliani, thought to be an early choice for attorney general, was said by a person close to the transition team to have personally appealed to Trump for the diplomatic job. He has virtually no diplomatic experience or knowledge of the State Department bureaucracy. Bolton, a national security hawk who got his U.N. job through a recess appointment after the Senate refused to confirm him, was a leading advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, contradicting Trump's campaign position opposing it. Congress voices concern Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that Bolton would be a ""disaster"" and that he would actively oppose his nomination. Others were more supportive. ""If he picks John Bolton, then I'll support John Bolton. If he picks Rudy, I'll support Rudy,"" said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). The shortlist for defense secretary is said to include Sessions, Flynn and Cotton. Although Sessions serves on the Armed Services Committee, his main issue there has been immigration. Cotton is a Harvard Law School graduate who just seven years ago was a first lieutenant in the Army. Senate confirmation of Flynn, who also has voiced interest in serving as director of national intelligence, could be difficult, said the person close to the transition team. He was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency after two years over concerns about his leadership, and he has potentially problematic connections to foreign governments.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/16/post-truth-named-2016-word-of-the-year-by-oxford-dictionaries/	‘Post-truth’ named 2016 word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries	"   (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)  It's official: Truth is dead. Facts are passe. And this sentiment --  -- is so last year. Oxford Dictionaries has selected ""post-truth"" as 2016's international word of the year, after the contentious ""Brexit"" referendum and an equally divisive U.S. presidential election caused usage of the adjective to skyrocket, according to the Oxford University Press. The dictionary defines ""post-truth"" as ""relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief."" In this case, the ""post-"" prefix doesn't mean ""after"" so much as it implies an atmosphere in which a notion is irrelevant -- but then again, who says you have to take our word for it anymore? Throughout a grueling presidential campaign in which accusations of lies and alternate realities flowed freely, in every direction, hundreds of fact checks were published about statements from both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Dozens of media outlets found that Trump's relationship with the truth was, well, complicated. ""We concede all politicians lie,"" conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin wrote in September. ""Nevertheless, Donald Trump is in a class by himself.""   [How the heck can voters think Donald Trump is more honest than Hillary Clinton?]   She cited The Atlantic's David Frum, who described Trump's dishonesty in May as ""qualitatively different than anything before seen from a major-party nominee."" None of this seemed to matter significantly to those who supported him. ""There is no doubt that even in the quadrennial truth-stretching that happens in presidential campaigns, Trump has set records for fabrication,"" Chris Cillizza wrote days before the election. And yet, Cillizza noted, Trump was seen as more honest than Clinton by an eight-point margin, according to a Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll released on Nov. 2. ""Post-truth"" was selected after Oxford's dictionary editors noted a roughly 2,000 percent increase in its usage over 2015 -- it was appearing with far more frequency in news articles and on social media in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The first spike came in June, driven by the rhetoric leading up to Britain's European Union referendum, Oxford Dictionaries President Casper Grathwohl said in a statement. ""Post-truth"" usage spiked again in July after Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination. ""It's not surprising that our choice reflects a year dominated by highly-charged political and social discourse,"" Grathwohl said. ""Fueled by the rise of social media as a news source and a growing distrust of facts offered up by the establishment, post-truth as a concept has been finding its linguistic footing for some time.""   [This is a real news story about fake news stories]   ""Post-truth"" was selected as the 2016 word of the year even before results of the election were known, said Katherine Martin, the head of U.S. dictionaries for Oxford University Press. ""We choose words that are going to highlight the interplay between our words and our culture,"" Martin said. The final word of the year is meant to be one that captures the ""ethos, mood or preoccupations of that particular year and to have lasting potential as a word of cultural significance."" The Washington Post's own Fact Checker blog, which published 314 fact checks of the candidates who ran for president during the 2016 election cycle, has noted that ""in many ways, it was an unbalanced race"" -- but didn't go so far as to endorse the term ""post-truth."" ""I have never been a fan of the word 'post-truth,' since it's a facile way to describe basic human behavior since the first words were spoken,"" The Fact Checker's Glenn Kessler said in an email. ""People have always been swayed by emotions and personal beliefs. As fact checkers, we give people the factual information and context for statements made by politicians. What people do with those facts is up to them.""   [The Washington Post's 2016 Election Fact Checker]   The Fact Checker's Michelle Ye Hee Lee noted that of the blog's 314 fact checks for this election, 168 were about claims made by Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. And of those, Trump received 59 ""Four-Pinocchio"" ratings, while Clinton got seven. Trump's average Pinocchio rating was 3.4, breaking Rep. Michele Bachmann's previous worst Pinocchio average of 3.08 in 2012. Clinton, on the other hand, ended up with an average Pinocchio rating of 2.2, putting her in the same range as President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, she said. And what did people do with these facts? They elected Trump the 45th president of the United States. For what it's worth, ""post-truth"" is not to be confused with ""truthiness,"" a subtly different term popularized by Stephen Colbert more than a decade ago that described the phenomenon of ""believing something that feels true, even if it isn't supported by fact."" ""Now I'm sure some of the word police, the 'wordinistas' over at Webster's, are gonna to say, hey, that's not a word,"" said Colbert in the 2005 segment that introduced the word. ""Well, anybody who knows me know that I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist! Constantly telling us what is or isn't true. or what did or didn't happen."" At the time, Colbert was still playing an exaggerated caricature of a conservative political-show host. ""Who's Britannica to tell me the Panama Canal was finished in 1914?!"" he continued in the segment. ""If I want to say it happened in 1941, that's my right. I don't trust books. They're all fact, no heart."" Merriam-Webster made ""truthiness"" its 2006 word of the year. And if anything, the rise of truthiness cleared the path for ""post-truth,"" as in: ""In a post-truth world, truthiness is all that matters."" ""Given that usage of the term hasn't shown any signs of slowing down, I wouldn't be surprised if post-truth becomes one of the defining words of our time,"" said Grathwohl, the Oxford Dictionaries president. Each year, the Oxford staff selects hundreds of words, then narrows that list down through discussions about ""what words are going to best highlight the ways in which the English lexicon is changing in response to current events,"" said Martin, Oxford's head of U.S. dictionaries. This year, the shortlist included ""adulting"" (often packaged into the phrase ""adulting so hard,"" as in, ""I'm adulting so hard that I bought a leaf blower and increased my contribution to my 401(k) retirement savings plan"") and hygge, which refers to a ""comfortable conviviality and feeling of contentment"" central to Danish culture. ""Post-truth"" also beat out finalist ""alt-right,"" a shortening of ""alternative right"" defined by Oxford as ""an ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative or reactionary viewpoints, characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics and by the use of online media to disseminate deliberately controversial content."" Use of ""alt-right"" in 2016 has increased dramatically as well, in large part because of Trump's ties to prominent alt-right figures such as Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News who was just named Trump's chief White House strategist. This year's discussion ""was a bit more serious and somber ... than it has been in some other years,"" Martin said. For those who have forgotten, the Oxford Dictionaries' 2015 word of the year was, for the first time ever, an emoji -- specifically, this one:  The Oxford Dictionaries usually announces the word of the year in mid-November. But Martin noted there was still time for the mood to shift during the end of the year. ""Who knows what will happen in the last [weeks] of 2016?"" she said. ""Hopefully something really wonderful that gives us another idea.""
