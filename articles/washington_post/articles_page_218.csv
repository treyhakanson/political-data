The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said Friday that more funding is needed to help an estimated 850,000 people facing hunger in southern Madagascar. U.N. officials say they will start distributing plant cuttings and seeds to farmers in December, as well as provide food and cash to help sustain people until the next harvest around March and April. Southern Africa has been experiencing its most severe drought in more than three decades, leaving millions of people in several countries in need of food aid. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Carrying Croatian flags and patriotic banners, the crowds on Friday were forming a kilometers-long column through the streets of the baroque town on the Danube which was all but demolished during the three-month siege in 1991. Citizens were also lighting candles throughout Croatia. Vukovar has become a symbol of Croatia's war for independence and of the senseless destruction during the wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia. More than 10,000 people were killed in the Croatian war that started when the country declared independence from Yugoslavia, triggering a rebellion by minority Serbs. Croatia retook Serb-held lands in 1995. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Van Hollen spoke Wednesday with Maryland Sens. Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin in Baltimore. Van Hollen won the seat that is opening with Mikulski's retirement after 30 years in the office. Van Hollen says he doesn't know much about Trump's agenda, except that he wants to build a wall on the Mexican border and deport people who are in the country illegally. He says he's willing to work constructively, but after the billionaire's divisive campaign Trump will need to make a major step toward cooperation. ___ 11 a.m. Gov. Larry Hogan is congratulating President-elect Donald Trump on his victory and saying he'll work with the new administration on behalf of all Marylanders. The Republican governor of Maryland said in a statement Wednesday that it's time to ""to come together to find real solutions to the problems we face as a country."" He is encouraging both parties to ""leave behind the divisive politics that have marred this election season"" and ""focus on doing what is best for America."" Hogan said for months that he was disappointed in the candidates for both major parties and wouldn't support Trump. On Tuesday, Hogan's spokesman Doug Mayer announced that the governor wrote in the name of his father, former Rep. Lawrence Hogan, the person who taught him what it meant to hold public office with integrity. ___ 2 a.m. For the first time in decades, Maryland will be without a woman in the state's congressional delegation. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, won the seat that will be open when Sen. Barbara Mikulski retires next year after 30 years in office. In April's Democratic primary, Van Hollen defeated Rep. Donna Edwards, who was the only female to hold one of the state's eight U.S. House seats. Maryland has had at least one woman in the state's congressional delegation since 1971. Although Hillary Clinton won Maryland's 10 electoral votes, voters Tuesday said gender was not a top concern. Van Hollen defeated Del. Kathy Szeliga for Mikulski's seat. Szeliga is the minority whip in the Maryland House of Delegates. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/4ef9b334-a614-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	Count begins: Trump takes Indiana, Kentucky; Clinton Vermont	" WASHINGTON -- Emboldened Republicans claimed a mandate Wednesday for President-elect Donald Trump after his astonishing election triumph, and an emotional Hillary Clinton told crestfallen supporters the GOP victor deserved a ""chance to lead."" President Barack Obama pledged a smooth transition of power.  ""We are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country,"" the president said of the president-elect, the man who spent years questioning Obama's birthplace and challenging the legitimacy of his presidency. Obama, who had declared Trump unfit for the presidency, invited him to the White House Thursday. Trump was uncharacteristically quiet in the aftermath of his triumph and made no public appearances Wednesday. He huddled with jubilant, sleep-deprived advisers at his eponymous skyscraper in Manhattan, beginning the daunting task of setting up an administration that will take power in just over two months. He also met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and took calls from supporters, family and friends, according to spokeswoman Hope Hicks. In Washington, Trump's scant transition team sprang into action, culling through personnel lists for top jobs and working through handover plans for government agencies. A person familiar with the transition operations said the personnel process was still in its early stages, but Trump's team was putting a premium on quickly filling key national security posts. According to an organizational chart for the transition obtained by The Associated Press, Trump was relying on experienced hands to help form his administration. National security planning was being led by former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who previously worked for the FBI. Domestic issues were being handled by Ken Blackwell, a former Cincinnati mayor and Ohio secretary of state. Trump was expected to consider several loyal supporters for top jobs, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani for attorney general or national security adviser and campaign finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker were also expected to be under consideration for foreign policy posts. After struggling for months with Trump's takeover of their party, Republican leaders embraced the businessman in victory. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was lukewarm in his support throughout the campaign, praised him for pulling off ""the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime.""  ""He just earned a mandate,"" Ryan declared. Indeed, Trump will take office in January with Congress fully in his party's control, giving him strength to try to pass his agenda and turn the Supreme Court in a conservative direction. Even Republicans were stunned by the scope of their electoral success, including many who had been privately predicting Trump's defeat. Clinton's emotions were raw as she addressed a crowd of supporters, eyes wet with tears, who gathered in a New York ballroom. She said the crushing loss was ""painful and it will be for a long time"" and acknowledged that the nation was ""more divided than we thought."" Still, Clinton was gracious in defeat, declaring that ""Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" With several million votes still to be counted, Clinton held a narrow lead in the nationwide popular vote. Most of the outstanding votes appeared to be in Democratic-leaning states, with the biggest chunk in California, a state Clinton overwhelmingly won. With almost 125 million votes counted, The Associated Press tally had Clinton with 47.7 percent and Trump with 47.5 percent. Trump's sweep of the battleground states that decided the election was commanding. He carried Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, three of the election's biggest prizes, and snatched reliably Democratic Pennsylvania and Wisconsin away from Clinton. Trump's support skewed older, male and overwhelmingly white. His supporters said they were deeply dissatisfied with the federal government and eager for change, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks. If Trump makes good on his campaign promises, the nation stands on the brink of sweeping change in domestic and foreign policy. He's pledged to repeal Obama's signature health care law and pull out of the landmark nuclear accord with Iran. He's vowed to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and temporarily ban immigration from nations with terror ties. It's unclear whether Trump, a highly unusual candidate, will embrace many of the traditions of the presidency. He'll enter the White House owning his own private jet as well as a hotel just blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue. He never allowed journalists to fly on his plane during the campaign, as is customary for White House nominees. Issues of transparency bubbled up right from the start. On Wednesday evening, Trump aides said they would not bring the press corps to Washington with the president-elect for his meeting with Obama, breaking long-standing protocol. Global stock markets and U.S. stock futures plunged early Wednesday on word of Trump's election, but later recovered. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.4 percent for the day in trading in New York. World leaders congratulated Trump on his victory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had a contentious relationship with Obama, called the Republican a ""true friend of Israel."" British Prime Minister Theresa May said the U.S. and United Kingdom would remain ""strong and close partners on trade, security and defense."" Russian President Vladimir Putin was among the first to reach out to the incoming American leader. Trump praised Putin throughout the campaign and advocated a closer relationship with Russia, despite Moscow's provocations in Ukraine and elsewhere. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of hacking Democratic organizations during the campaign, actions Clinton's team saw as an indication that Putin was trying to meddle in the election. Trump notably did not accept the conclusions of intelligence officials. ___ Associated Press writers Bradley Klapper, Catherine Lucey, Jonathan Lemire, Lisa Lerer and Jill Colvin contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/04/how-bugs-in-facebook-and-twitter-have-crippled-american-politics/	How bugs in Facebook and Twitter have crippled American politics	"   (Dado Ruvic/Reuters)  Theoretically, the ability to peruse and share huge amounts of information around the world instantly is a good thing. All that knowledge, at your fingertips. It's the sort of thing that could -- theoretically -- bolster the democratic process, improving awareness of issues and allowing questions about the positions of the candidates to be answered at a moment's notice. As it turns out, once you overlay two flawed social networks onto that system, the result is largely the opposite. In April, I stumbled across a site called Prntly. Prntly was the source of a then-popular rumor about Ted Cruz's campaign manager pushing an unflattering attack on Melania Trump, a rumor that was false. Donald Trump himself had tweeted a link to another incorrect story from Prntly; a quick glance at the site revealed that it was nothing but hyperpartisan nonsense, anchored squarely in the center of a bunch of low-rent ads. The game Prntly was playing turns out to be a popular one. On Thursday, BuzzFeed reported on a cluster of pro-Trump sites based in Macedonia, all doing the same thing: taking rumors from conservative media, inflating them 200 percent, slapping an enticing headline on top and -- crucially -- posting them to Facebook. Four of the five most-shared stories from these sites were totally false, according to BuzzFeed's reporters, but each had been shared millions of times. It's not a coincidence that these sites are supportive of Trump. The candidate himself is a whirlwind of inaccuracy and falsehoods, reinforcing in his supporters a dual sense that the media pointing out his lies is an example of bias and a broad acceptance of pro-Trump, anti-Hillary Clinton gibberish. Those sentiments predate Trump as a candidate -- they're underlying principles for other more established conservative media outlets -- but Trump's candidacy and his embrace of total inaccuracies has created a hyperactive economy of nonsense. It's also not a coincidence that they thrive on Facebook. Facebook has proved to be a very effective tool for sharing authoritative-looking but incorrect articles from the Web. The Wall Street Journal created an interactive to show how partisanship shifts the lens of what news people see. A lot of that is self-selecting, allowing people to form small, mutually reinforcing communities passing around articles that reinforce their beliefs. Facebook has tried, at times, to tweak its algorithm to hide news from less-reputable sources, but they always seem to leak back in. Facebook's audience is giant, a big slice of the population of the world, and there's a lot of money to be made leveraging that giant, connected audience to drive people back to garbage sites to see junky ads. Especially in a place like Macedonia, where the U.S. dollar goes a lot further. But it's not only the hustlers who are the problem. Facebook has also stumbled in trying to fix its own bug. When news reports broke about Facebook's human curators burying news articles from conservative outlets, the social networking company switched to a purely automatic algorithm to isolate what was trending. The problem is that it quickly became obvious that what trended was fake political news. The Post's Abby Ohlheiser noted that what was trending post-human intervention was a lot of nonsense. For example: A story about how ""traitor"" Megyn Kelly was fired from Fox News for supporting Hillary Clinton. Nothing about that is true, but it spread quickly through the well-greased conduits of political Facebook. Over subsequent days, other stories ran the same course. It's hard to separate out how much of this bad-information sharing is Facebook's fault. Its audience makes it a key mechanism for sharing misinformation on the Web, but that can also be seen as arguing that superhighways are bad because they allow criminals to move between states easily. In this example, though, it's a bit like having criminals driving around in cars painted with ""I AM A CRIMINAL"" in big, block letters, and the Facebook Patrol having little luck blocking their progress. As an information-sharing service, Facebook is flawed. As a social network, Twitter may be worse. For a few months, rumors have spread that Twitter is up for sale. A number of different companies were said to have expressed interest, including Salesforce and Disney. That purported interest eventually faded, and Twitter remains unsold. Why? One theory: Twitter's culture of abuse. Over the course of the hyperactive, aggressive 2016 election cycle, Twitter's inability to eliminate racist and anti-Semitic trolls has been a recurring problem. A subculture of Trump supporters, often referred to as ""alt-right"" in shorthand, has evolved the Gamergate behavioral and political ideologies into a weapon in support of their candidate. Women and minority users of the service have long complained about the way in which new accounts could be quickly created and issue a stream of abusive comments before Twitter can do anything about it. The campaign has simply broadened the targets of that abuse. Jewish Twitter users, including Jewish journalists, have anecdotally reported seeing increased abuse and harassment. Members of the press more broadly have similarly seen an increase in abusive behavior, certainly thanks in part to Trump's willingness to depict members of the media as his enemies. The damage from these flaws in Facebook and Twitter is hard to calculate. Twitter's problems are more isolated and, admittedly, disproportionately affect members of the media like myself. Facebook's bad information problem is more pervasive and more serious, fostering at least a culture of uncertainty about the truth of basic facts and, possibly, creating an entire world of belief founded on falsehood. Maybe we're at a moment in which an unusual candidacy is overlapping in a negative way with flaws in still-young Internet services. Or maybe the idea that the Internet would foster comity and broader knowledge on important issues was itself always flawed. Maybe these problems aren't fixable."
