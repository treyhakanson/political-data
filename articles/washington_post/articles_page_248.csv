Christopher Diiorio, 53, pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday to a count of fraudulently using an official seal. He acknowledged the other behavior alleged by federal prosecutors, including flashing an ID card during a traffic stop and trying to use a Secret Service badge to get a government rate for a hotel room. Diiorio, of Greensburg, remains free on bond and will be sentenced March 9. He and his attorney, William Difenderfer, wouldn't answer questions about the charges or the motivation for buying the bogus credentials. Diiorio told the judge he's undergoing counseling for ""marital"" issues ""and over this situation"" but was of sound mind and understood the charges and consequences of his plea. The investigation began when Reserve Township police said Diiorio flashed the Secret Service ID card after an officer pulled him over for a faulty brake light July 22. The hotel incident occurred a month earlier. Diiorio told the officer ""he was a U.S. Secret Service agent who had just returned from the Republican National Convention in Cleveland,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Hull said in court Thursday. The credential said Diiorio was a ""senior special agent in the protective services division,"" Hull said. Further investigation revealed that ""Diiorio's first and last name match that of a real Secret Service agent"" but nothing else, Hull said. Diiorio later confessed that he bought the IDs and badges for $100 online in March 2014 when he also ""began to identify himself as a federal agent on online dating sites,"" Hull told the judge. In reality, Diiorio owned and operated Doodle Scoopers, based in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park. Diiorio had also begun buying handguns and rifles, including an AR-15, like those used to equip Secret Service agents, though he's not accused of doing anything illegal with the weapons. Because Diiorio's crime is a felony, he'll have to surrender the weapons, Hull said. Authorities haven't named the company that created and sold the credentials. The fraudulent seal charge carries up to five years in prison, but under sentencing guidelines that take into account Diiorio's lack of a recent criminal history, he'll likely face probation.

In a statement before flying to Peru to attend the annual summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, Duterte also said the United Nations has been unsuccessful in stopping wars. He said if China and Russia decide to create a new world order, he would be the first to join them and leave the U.N., which he said is dominated by the U.S.  ""You know, if China and Russia would decide to create a new order, I would be the first to join,"" he said, adding that he would quit the U.N. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said the U.N. is aware of reports that Duterte is considering withdrawing his country from the ICC but that the world body has not yet received any formal communication from the Philippines. He urged them and other nations to reconsider. Duterte also criticized the global agreement to fight climate change, saying there are no penalties for violators and it is not clear which industrialized countries will contribute money to support developing countries' efforts against global warming. He said that was the reason why President-elect Donald Trump does not want the U.S. to spend on fighting climate change. During his campaign, Trump said he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris pact on climate change. The foul-mouthed Duterte said that like Russia, he might withdraw from the ICC ""because we the small ones are the only ones being beaten up,"" but nothing has been done for the thousands of children and women dying in bombings in Syria and Iraq. Duterte is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the sidelines of the summit in Lima. He requested for the bilateral meeting because he wants to meet and be friends with Putin, whom he said was his idol. Human rights advocates have criticized Duterte's anti-drug campaign that has left more than 4,000 suspected addicts and pushers dead since July. They said the killings can be a basis to charge him for crimes against humanity before the Netherlands-based court. Duterte said he has intentionally used foul language -- including calling Obama a ""son of a bitch"" -- because Obama has trivialized the Philippines' drug problem when there are already around 4 million Filipinos addicted to drugs. The country has a population of more than 103 million. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

At a national meeting of the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish civil rights group, about 1,000 people listened to talks expressing shock at the hatred expressed during the presidential campaign and questioned what they thought was a high-level of acceptance by other Americans.  ""I'm struggling right now in this American moment,"" said Yehuda Kurtzer, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America, an education and research organization, in his talk at the event. ""I wonder whether I have been -- and I think the answer is probably yes -- a little bit naive."" During this past year, anti-Semitic imagery proliferated on social media, Jewish journalists were targeted and longstanding anti-Jewish conspiracy theories got a fresh airing. Much of the bias originated with the alt-right, or alternative right, a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It's often associated with far right efforts to preserve ""white identity,"" oppose multiculturalism and defend ""Western values."" In addition to the online intimidation, reports of anti-Semitic vandalism and other attacks have risen. Last week, the day after the election, a Philadelphia storefront was sprayed with a swastika and the words ""Seig Heil 2106,"" which means ""Hail Victory,"" a common Nazi chant, and the word ""Trump,"" with a swastika replacing the ""T."" These developments have stunned U.S. Jewish leaders, who in recent years had been more focused on anti-Semitism in Europe and on addressing complaints of anti-Jewish bias on college campuses amid the debate over the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. In a sign of the depth of American Jewish anxiety about anti-Semitism, ADL officials said donations to their organization increased 50-fold in the days immediately after the election and a large majority of the money came from first-time donors. Every one of their regional offices reported an uptick in calls from people wanting to donate or volunteer, the ADL said.  ""We must not be silent, we must raise our voices, we must act, and to act we must understand what we are up against,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of ADL, opening the meeting in Manhattan. As the presidential race intensified, Jews started seeing their names bracketed with a series of parentheses in harassing tweets, signaling that the person had been identified as a Jew. The image became known as the Jewish cowbell and its source was traced to neo-Nazis and white nationalists. The ADL investigated the harassment and found more than 800 journalists had suffered anti-Semitic attacks on Twitter during the election, mostly from anonymous Twitter accounts, although some belonged to white supremacists. In a common example of the reporters' experiences, Jane Eisner, editor-in-chief of the Forward, an influential Jewish newspaper that extensively covered the election, said she received an email the morning after the second presidential debate with an image of a Nazi solder pointing a gun at her head, which was Photoshopped onto a concentration camp uniform. Donald Trump's campaign came under scrutiny since much of the harassment came from accounts tied to his supporters. Trump drew direct criticism last July when he tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton's face with a six-pointed star, a pile of hundred dollar bills and the words ""most corrupt candidate ever."" The star was in the shape of the Jewish Star of David and was widely condemned as anti-Semitic. Trump's campaign said it was a sheriff's badge. Last month, Trump gave a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, in which he accused Clinton of holding secret meetings with bankers in a conspiracy to undermine U.S. sovereignty. The ADL said that whether intentional or not, Trump had reflected a classic anti-Semitic theme of Jewish control of banks. The president-elect's daughter Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who is now one of his top advisers, are Orthodox Jews. Kushner has defended Trump against allegations of bias. The issue erupted anew when Trump announced far-right publishing executive Stephen Bannon as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway called the accusations against Bannon ""very unfair."" Some Jewish groups have defended Bannon, including the hawkish Zionist Organization of America. Bernie Marcus, a founder of The Home Depot Inc. and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, said in a statement that Bannon was ""a passionate Zionist and supporter of Israel."" Marcus called the condemnations of Bannon an attempt to undermine the incoming administration. Seventy-one percent of Jews voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. Greenblatt worked in the Obama administration. Still, Jonathan Sarna, a Brandeis University professor and historian of American Judaism, said it would be wrong to attribute the criticisms of Trump appointments or his supporters to partisanship. ""I don't know anybody who is looking at this in a serious way who says nothing has changed,"" in regard to the level of anti-Semitism, Sarna said.  ""American Jews assumed that anti-Semitism had largely been overcome,"" he said. ""And then all of a sudden, unexpectedly, anti-Semitism of a virulent kind came roaring back.""

(Erin Patrick O'Connor,Manuel Roig-Franzia/The Washington Post)   Last December, amid the jumbled Republican presidential nomination scrum, Donald Trump carved out a half an hour for a live video interview with a volcanic Austin radio and web-streaming host who broadcasts from a semi-secret location dubbed ""The Central Texas Command Center and the Heart of the Resistance."" Alex Jones, America's foremost purveyor of outlandish conspiracy theories, was in a buoyant mood that day. He'd had Matt Drudge, the influential conservative news aggregator, on recently. But this was much bigger. Trump wasted no time signaling that his mind-set aligned with the host's. Trump said he wouldn't apologize for asserting that large numbers of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the collapse of the twin towers in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a claim that fact-checkers have repeatedly refuted.  ""People like you and I can't do that so easily,"" the New York developer, speaking from his office in Trump Tower, said. He would later call Jones ""a nice guy."" The December interview would reverberate into the general election as Hillary Clinton tried to use it to paint Trump as an irresponsible crackpot associating with an irresponsible crackpot. It also pushed Jones, who operates the websites Infowars.com and Prisonplanet.com, from the realm of niche showman into the mainstream national dialogue. The man who said that the Newtown, Conn., school shooting was a ""hoax"" involving child actors and claimed that elements of the U.S. government were responsible for bombing the Oklahoma City federal building and for the 9/11 attacks had been granted an enormous new audience.  ""I think Alex Jones may be the single most important voice in the alternative conservative media,"" says Roger Stone, the Nixon-era political trickster who orchestrated Trump's appearance on the show. On Monday, Trump seemed to confirm Jones's status. Jones says Trump called to promise he would return to the program to thank the Infowars audience, an extraordinary gesture for an incoming president whose schedule is packed with calls from world leaders and the enormous task of overseeing the transition. The president-elect's team hasn't confirmed that the conversation took place.  Stone, who takes credit for persuading Jones to support Trump, envisions the Web impresario as a potent force during the new administration, a bridge between the presidency and a restless, skeptical slice of the population. ""He's a valuable asset -- somebody has to rally the people around President Trump's legislative program,"" Stone says.  [Alex Jones celebrates Trump's takeover of the GOP]  Jones, who did not respond to interview requests, got his start hosting a public-access television program in Austin, where he grew up, the son of a dentist. He speaks cryptically about his family, fostering an aura of mystique when he says that his father's patients included CIA officials who were so important that they had to be guarded while under anesthesia.  ""I had some family that did some things for the CIA,"" he once said. In Austin, a city with a distinct embrace of quirky characters, Jones's histrionics could sometimes be a source of college-keg-party amusement. He became pals with the Austin-based filmmaker Richard Linklater, who cast him in small roles in the 2001 film ""Waking Life"" and in ""A Scanner Darkly"" in 2006. ""He's really smart. . . . I like the way he thinks,"" Linklater said with a smile during a Huffington Post Live interview to promote his 2013 film, ""Before Midnight.""  But Linklater added that he didn't share some of his friend's more controversial views: ""I don't agree 9/11 was an inside job."" On the couch next to Linklater, a shocked look crossed the face of the film's co-star, Julie Delpy. (Linklater declined to be interviewed for this article.) Jones is a thickly constructed 42-year-old with bright piercing eyes and a retreating hairline. His Facebook bio describes him as ""ruggedly handsome."" His rhetorical style resembles an avalanche . He makes assertions with the scantiest of proof, but delivered with utter certainty. His monologues explode with emotion. Some days he appears to be sobbing, holding his face in his hands. Then he's making deep, guttural growling noises. Then he's howling.  The Internet is thick with video clips labeled ""Alex Jones Epic RANT!!"" or ""Alex Jones unleashed!"" or ""Epic meltdown."" The more he screams, the more they listen.  It's as if he's one-upping himself in real time. During one show he went off on Clinton, calling her ""a witch."" But he didn't stop there. She is ""evil,"" he said, ""a whore of Babylon drunk on the blood of the saints.""  He stuck out his tongue and unloosed a menacing yowl. ""So demonic,"" he said.       Alex Jones speaks during a rally in support near the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. (Lucas Jackson/REUTERS)   Jones is also a filmmaker, having produced a stream of long, densely scripted, often thinly supported documentaries with titles such as ""Terrorstorm: A History of Government-Sponsored Terrorism,"" ""9/11: The Road to Tyranny,"" and ""Fall of the Republic: The Presidency of Barack H. Obama."" In his films, as well as his hours-long radio and Web broadcasts, Jones frequently returns to his core theme of the threat posed by shadowy, malevolent, elite ""globalists"" bent on worldwide domination.  The United Nations, he claims, intends to release plagues that will kill off 80 percent of the people in the world. The remaining population, he says, will be herded into crowded cities where they will be enslaved by the elite, turning the Earth into a ""prison planet."" A smaller population would mean the elite would have less competition for mysterious ""life extension technologies.""   The recurrent message is that these powerful interests foment insecurity to then foist policy changes on an addled public. Hence, the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, in Jones's telling, was confected to thrust gun control on America. ""Sandy Hook is a completely fake, with actors, in my view, manufactured. I couldn't believe it at first,"" Jones said on one program. ""I know they had actors there clearly. But I thought they killed some real kids."" Other tragedies, such as the Boston Marathon bombing, he says, were ""false flags"" employing CIA-manipulated dupes who take the blame. The raid on Osama bin Laden's compound was faked because the terrorist leader was a CIA asset. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was behind the Oklahoma City federal building bombing. It goes on. And on. And on.  In the mid-1990s, at the outset of Jones's career, he was befriended by Ted Anderson, the owner of Midas Resources, a Minnesota gold coins and precious metals firm that sponsored his show. In an interview, Anderson recalls the young Jones as having ""a lot of drive. Not a terribly big audience. At that time it was just raw energy. He's more refined now.""  Anderson was the founder of ""The Ron Paul Air Corps,"" a group of pilots who flew planes pulling banners promoting the ""Ron Paul Revolution"" during the former congressman's 2008 presidential run. Paul, who has appeared frequently on Jones's program, did not respond to an interview request. Now, another Anderson company, Genesis Communications Network, syndicates the Alex Jones program to 129 radio stations, many of them in small markets. It's difficult to confirm Jones's audience size, but the host has said he has 5 million daily radio listeners and recently topped 80 million video views in a single month. He claims to have a bigger audience than Rush Limbaugh. Jones is able to multiply his audience by simulcasting his radio programming via his website and further spreading its reach on his YouTube channel. The costs are minuscule in comparison to running, say, a cable television network, and it's conceivable he could be generating millions in profits.    One of the engines for his media fiefdom is the sale of Infowars-branded products, including T-shirts and Infowars-branded dietary supplements and cleansers. He touts the company's detoxifiers, including one made from the green hulls of black walnuts, the bark of a South American tree (the quassia) and the buds of organic cloves. For the survivalists in his audience, he offers a $1,797 ""Infowars Life Select"" one-year food supply. Jones has always had flair for the dramatic, as he displayed during this year's Republican National Convention when he stormed onto the set of the liberal program ""The Young Turks,"" and got into shoving match with the hosts that looked like it could have come straight out of ""The Jerry Springer Show.""     Alex Jones in Cleveland. (Brian Blanco/European Pressphoto Agency)   Jones was largely ignored by the mainstream media. But in 2006, he drew substantial attention from cable news programs when the actor Charlie Sheen, then the star of the popular TV show ""Two and a Half Men,"" appeared on his show and agreed with Jones that the government might be covering up the true story of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  Suddenly, Jones had a perch as a guest on CNN. On the network, he boasted that he had ""intel"" two months before Sept. 11 that ""elements of the military-industrial complex were going to carry out the attacks. I said they'll use bin Laden. . . . That is their patsy to take blame for attacking the towers."" The excitement about the Sheen comments would die down, but Jones never relented, returning to the allegations over and over. His claims about ""globalists"" were interpreted by some critics as a veiled anti-Semitic code. Jones appeared eager to address the suggestion during a program in which he turned his attention to the Emanuel brothers: Rahm, Zeke and Ari. ""They're always trying to claim that if I talk about world government and corruption, I'm anti-Semitic,"" Jones told his audience. ""The Emanuels are Jewish mafia. It's not that Jews are bad. It's just that they are the head of the Jewish mafia in the United States.""    Jones's remarks have put him in the crosshairs of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has labeled him an ""extremist."" In an interview, the center's Heidi Beirich called Jones a ""gateway drug for people who end up in harder aspects of the movement,"" such as neo-Nazi groups.  She pointed to the case of Jerad and Amanda Miller, a couple who died in a shootout after the ambush killing of two police officers and the murder of one civilian in Las Vegas. Citing the pair's Internet postings, Beirich described the couple as ""Alex Jones superfans,"" who moved on to other groups and eventually violence.  After the shooting, Jones said on his program that ""my gut tells me that the coldblooded, degenerate, evil killing . . . is absolutely staged, ladies and gentlemen. . . . There is so much proof that this was staged that my mind exploded with hundreds of data points, and quite frankly it's conclusive.""  Anderson, Jones's radio syndicator, doesn't mind the criticisms of his star host: ""As long as they spell Alex Jones correctly, they can think of him any way they want,"" he says. Jones gained an important ally in 2013 when he met Roger Stone in Dallas. Stone was there to promote a book he'd written suggesting that Lyndon Johnson was behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy. A couple of years later, Stone says, a Jones employee reconnected them.  ""We really kind of hit it off,"" Stone says. ""He's fearless. A showman. He likes a drink. A cigar. Bawdy stories. Hunting and fishing. He's a man's man.""  Stone says he had spent nearly three decades trying to figure out how to make Donald Trump president. He thought his new friend, Jones, could help.  He particularly liked the idea of Trump appearing on the Jones shows, because ""they are reaching the Trump constituencies,"" Stone says. ""They are reaching the people who knock on the doors."" Trump, according to Stone, wasn't difficult to persuade. The president-elect is ""an inveterate watcher of television. He has watched Infowars, Stone says. ""They hit it off.""   During his wide-ranging interview with Trump in December, Jones hit on themes at the center of the mogul's candidacy, such as radical Islamists allegedly flooding into the country and a reevaluation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Why are we starting a fight with Russia when they're not doing anything to us?"" Jones asked. Trump responded that Putin is ""tough and he's smart. He's a difficult cookie. I will probably get along well with him."" As the campaign progressed, Jones became more and more of a presence. He marketed ""Hillary for Prison"" T-shirts, and they became wildly popular. Stone recalls Trump remarking to him that he liked seeing so many of the shirts in the audience at his rallies. Clinton took notice. In late August, during a stump speech in Reno, Nev., Clinton called out Trump's attacks on her health as ""fever dreams."" ""It's what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs,"" Clinton told her audience. She noted that Trump had told the radio host: ""Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.""  Jones was now, officially, a campaign issue. Jones, in response, does what Jones does: He went ballistic, blasting Clinton for months. In October, he wondered aloud to his audience, ""I'm told there's a rotten smell around Hillary. . . . Folks, I've been told this by high-up folks. Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur."" The president took the bait. During a campaign appearance for Clinton, less than a month before the election, Obama said that ""a guy on the radio"" had been calling him and Clinton ""demons"" who ""smelled like sulfur."" To illustrate his point, the president sniffed his hand. ""I mean, c'mon,"" Obama said with a big smile.  It all seemed meant to make Jones and Trump look like jokes. But Stone was loving it. ""They're merely making him bigger,"" Stone says, looking back. ""They're only making him more important. I think it had the reverse effect."" On election night, Stone joined Jones at his friend's Austin studio. They popped open champagne. Jones had much to celebrate. But he was worried, he told his audience. He's been warning about it for a long time: Elites will try to assassinate Trump. Jones can feel it in his gut. "

Brendan Dassey's release from prison appeared imminent right up until the three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago issued its decision. Television crews and reporters were staking out the prison in Portage where Dassey is being held, waiting for him to walk out at any minute, when the ruling came down around midday.  ""We are disappointed more than words can say,"" Dassey's attorneys, Steve Drizin and Laura Nirider, said in a statement posted online shortly after the ruling was released. ""The fight goes on."" Dassey, now 27, was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 in the death of photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier. He confessed to detectives that he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape and kill Halbach in the Avery family's salvage yard in Manitowoc County. Avery was sentenced to life in prison in a separate proceeding. Avery and Dassey contend they were framed by police angry with Avery for filing a lawsuit against the county over his wrongful imprisonment for a sexual assault he didn't commit. He's pursuing his own appeal in state court. Their cases gained national attention last year after Netflix aired ""Making a Murderer,"" a multi-part documentary examining Halbach's death. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the documentary was biased but the series generated calls from the public to free both men. U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin ruled in August that investigators coerced Dassey, who was 16 years old at the time and suffered from cognitive problems, into confessing and overturned his conviction. Duffin said in the decision that if state attorneys appealed the ruling Dassey would remain in prison pending a resolution. The state Justice Department filed an appeal that is still working its way through the 7th Circuit. But this week Duffin ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday. The DOJ filed an emergency motion with the 7th Circuit on Wednesday seeking to block the release, arguing Duffin's release order contradicts his original ruling in which he said Dassey would remain in prison pending the appeal's resolution, Dassey's interrogators used techniques that courts around the country have repeatedly approved and Dassey presents a danger to society. Drizin and Nirider countered with a filing that argued Dassey has behaved in prison and the state hasn't identified any harm that might come from his release. The 7th Circuit judges -- Frank Easterbrook, Kenneth Ripple and David Hamilton -- issued a two-page ruling Thursday saying only that the state's emergency motion was granted and Dassey will remain behind bars pending the outcome of the appeal. It's unclear when that might come. Briefs in the case aren't due to the 7th Circuit until late December. A decision likely won't come down for weeks or even months later. ___ Follow Todd Richmond on Twitter at https://twitter.com/trichmond1 Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He urged them and other nations to reconsider.  ""It's clear from what the leaders have said that there are many, many governments who believe that there's a problem.

South Africa, Burundi and Gambia have announced plans to withdraw saying the court unfairly singles out African nations. So far all of the court's trials have focused on crimes in Africa, though the majority of the cases were referred to the court by the African countries.

That has led to confusion and claims that certain groups, mostly minorities who tend to vote with Democrats, are being disenfranchised. Adding to the uncertainty is a call by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for his supporters to monitor the polls on Tuesday for voter fraud and concerns by the federal government that hackers could try to disrupt the voting or vote-counting process. A breakdown of some of the top voting concerns in key states: ALABAMA     Early voters have taken to Twitter and Instagram to share their experiences with long lines as they arrive at the polls to cast their votes. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   This is the first presidential election in Alabama in which voters will be asked for photo identification. A lawsuit challenging the voter ID law is pending, with trial set for next year. The plaintiffs have argued the law disenfranchises voters who are unable to obtain a state-issued ID. Last year, 31 state driver's license offices -- many in poor, minority communities -- were closed because of budget concerns. Most were open one day a week and now they are open one to two days a month, with critics complaining the reduced hours remain a barrier. ___ ARIZONA Long lines led to frustration during Arizona's March primary, when some voters in the Phoenix area waited hours to cast ballots after county election officials opened 60 polling stations -- fewer than half what is typical. On Tuesday, Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, plans on having more than 700 sites. Meanwhile, state Democrats filed a lawsuit alleging some Republicans are planning to intimidate voters at the polls. Arizona also was one of two states in which hackers over the summer attempted to breach voter registration systems. ___ FLORIDA During the 2012 presidential election, Florida had the longest average wait time among all states -- 45 minutes, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. Some of the most populous counties have since expanded early voting hours in the hopes of reducing long lines on Election Day. Meanwhile, legal battles continue over voter registration. After Hurricane Matthew raked Florida's eastern coastline, Democrats sued to extend the deadline for voters to register. After a court order, about 107,000 people registered during the extension, but there was a concern that not all those applications would be processed before early voting began. A federal judge declined a request by Democrats to force election officials to allow those affected to vote even if their registration had yet to be verified, saying those affected could cast a provisional ballot that may be counted once their eligibility is confirmed. ___ GEORGIA The state's process for handling voter registrations and maintaining its voter lists has been the subject of lawsuits this year. One pending lawsuit was filed against Secretary of State Brian Kemp over a policy allowing for people to be removed from state voter rolls for failing to vote in recent elections. Lawyers in the Georgia case said roughly 372,000 voters were purged between 2012 and 2014. Civil rights groups also sued Kemp's office over a policy they said had prevented tens of thousands of residents from registering to vote and violated the federal Voting Rights Act. The policy rejected applicants whose identifying information did not exactly match state or federal databases. Kemp's office informed the court in September that it had changed the policy. Meanwhile, long lines have been reported in some places since early voting began Oct. 17, including a four-hour wait in one metro Atlanta county on the first day. ___ INDIANA Indiana State Police have said they are investigating some voter registration applications submitted by Patriot Majority USA, a Washington, D.C.-based voter mobilization group with ties to the Democratic Party. The probe is examining whether some applications contained forged signatures or other possible elements of fraud. Attorneys for Patriot Majority have asked the Justice Department's Civil Rights division to look into whether the investigation is an attempt to suppress the votes of black residents. The group has run voter registration drives in 11 states in previous years. Separately, Secretary of State Connie Lawson, a Republican, warned recently of widespread voter registration fraud after her office found a heavier than usual number of changes to voter registration records. She later tempered those remarks to say that many of the thousands of changes simply could be residents rushing to correct their names or birth dates online ahead of the election. ___ KANSAS A Kansas court fight focused on whether a group of as many as 50,000 residents could vote even though they did not submit citizenship documents, as required under state law, when registering at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form. Federal courts had previously ordered the state to count their votes in federal elections. The secretary of state's office had sought to toss out their votes in state and local races, something a state judge has since blocked. ___ NEW YORK The state's 2016 primary was marred by widespread reports of people in Brooklyn saying they were unable to vote. This happened after about 126,000 Brooklyn voters were removed from voter registration lists or deemed inactive between November 2015 and April of this year. Just days before the presidential election, a lawsuit was filed claiming the New York City Board of Elections had improperly removed voters from the rolls. ___ NORTH CAROLINA In 2013, Republican lawmakers in North Carolina passed a package of measures that required voters to show photo ID, reduced early voting and eliminated same-day registration during the early voting period. In July, a federal appeals court struck down several parts of the law, saying they ""target African Americans with almost surgical precision."" Republican officials have said discrimination was not their intent. A divided U.S. Supreme Court declined in August to take up the case. After the ruling, Democrats raised alarm when the executive director of the state Republican Party emailed GOP activists suggesting each county election board's Republicans work to limit early voting hours, curtail Sunday voting and avoid placing voting sites on college campuses. This set up a battle over early voting plans in a third of the state's counties. The dispute ultimately was resolved by the state Board of Elections, which restored Sunday voting in a few counties where local officials had sought to eliminate it and expanded hours in counties where the proposals seemed too limiting. But civil rights groups remained concerned that reductions in some places along with confusion over the photo ID law could affect turnout among black voters. A week before Tuesday's election, the state chapter of the NAACP filed a lawsuit alleging thousands of people, many of them black, had been removed improperly from voter rolls after being challenged by private citizens. A judge ordered those registrations restored, citing a federal law that prohibits such removals too close to an election. Separately, a federal judge declined a request by state Democrats for an order aimed at preventing Republicans from intimidating voters at the polls, saying there was insufficient evidence of any such plans. ___ OHIO A federal judge ruled in October that voters who were wrongfully removed from Ohio's registration lists can cast ballots in Tuesday's election. The number of voters covered by the ruling is not known, although some have estimated it to be in the tens of thousands. That decision follows an earlier ruling that found Ohio's process for maintaining its voter rolls wrongfully removed eligible people based on their failure to vote in recent elections. In a separate case, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down a request by the state Democratic Party to intervene in a lawsuit alleging plans by Republicans to intimidate voters at the polls. A federal judge had initially granted a restraining order against Republicans that was then blocked by a federal appeals court. In the Supreme Court's decision, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted Ohio law already forbids voter intimidation. Previously, Democrats' attempts to restore ""golden week,"" when people could register and cast ballots at the same time, failed after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene. Democrats had claimed the reduction, along with other voting changes, disproportionately burdened black voters and those who lean Democratic. But the state's attorneys argued the reduction alleviates administrative burdens for local election officials while reducing costs and the potential for fraud. ___ PENNSYLVANIA Trump has warned for weeks of a ""rigged"" election, asking supporters to head to the polls to watch for voter fraud, and mentions Philadelphia as a place that could have problems on Election Day. A judge rejected a lawsuit by Republicans challenging a state law that requires poll watchers to be registered in the county where they want to monitor the vote. Another judge rejected a late effort by state Democrats to obtain a court order to prevent Republicans from intimidating voters at the polls, saying they had not produced evidence of an effort to suppress voters. ___ TEXAS A federal appeals court ruled this summer that the state's 2011 voter ID law discriminated against minorities and the poor, ordering officials to relax the ID requirements for the November election. Experts had said the law was among the toughest in the nation, requiring voters to show one of seven acceptable forms of photo identification that included a concealed handgun license but not a college student ID. It was estimated that more than 600,000 registered voters in Texas lacked an acceptable ID under the law. And there were early signs that confusion surrounding the law has persisted, with reports during early voting of at least seven counties with outdated posters and poll workers saying photo IDs were required to vote. A federal judge in September had said Texas officials must change the voter outreach efforts after the Justice Department accused the state of still giving the impression that some voters cannot cast a ballot. ___ WISCONSIN This is the first presidential election in Wisconsin in which voters will be asked for photo identification. The voter ID law was initially blocked by the courts, and then went into effect for the presidential primary in April. In July, a federal judge left the voter ID requirement in place but struck down more than a dozen other election changes, including limits on early voting hours and locations. As many as 300,000 Wisconsin voters may not have the required photo ID. In recent weeks, recordings by voter advocacy groups have shown state DMV workers giving people inaccurate information about what they can do to obtain alternative voting credentials if they lack a photo ID. A federal judge in October ordered the state to clarify the process and produce a simple, one-page handout that can be distributed in person and online. ___ OTHER STATES Civil rights groups are also monitoring a group of other states with new voting restrictions or requirements in place for the first time. Those states are Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. ___ Associated Press writers Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; Bob Christie in Phoenix; Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Florida; Brian Slodysko in Indianapolis; Roxana Hegeman in Wichita, Kansas; Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin; Gary D.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/07/happy-hour-roundup-984/	Happy Hour Roundup	* Juliet Eilperin and Greg Jaffe report on one guy who's looking awfully good to the electorate right now: At a moment defined by anger at Washington, voter cynicism and two historically unpopular presidential candidates, Obama's approval ratings are the highest they have been since his first days in office. It now stands at 56 percent, according to a Gallup tracking poll released Sunday. For the first time in decades -- dating back to Ronald Reagan -- a lame-duck incumbent is in high demand on the campaign trail. The good feelings, meanwhile, extend beyond the president himself. First lady Michelle Obama has been perhaps Clinton's most effective surrogate, campaigning alongside her in North Carolina last month. In crucial swing states such as Florida and Pennsylvania, Vice President Biden's popularity surpasses even that of the president at his eight-year peak. Nearly two-thirds of voters in Pennsylvania, for example, have a favorable view of the vice president and first lady, according to a recent Bloomberg Politics poll. It's almost as if they did a pretty good job for eight years, and people don't think America has been turned into a nightmarish hellscape by their socialist schemes. Weird! * Marc Caputo reports that Democrats seem to have done their job on the ground in Florida: In a final surge, Florida Democrats stormed early voting polling stations in the Sunday before Election Day and widened their lead over Republicans to 88,000 ballots cast thanks to the strong support of African-Americans and Latinos in the nation's biggest battleground state. The Democrats nearly tripled their Saturday lead thanks to historic voting numbers in just two counties: Miami-Dade and Broward. About 100,000 voters showed up to those two counties Sunday, casting almost 39 percent of the ballots in the 16 counties that held a final day of in-person early voting before Election Day. If Hillary Clinton wins Florida -- and therefore the presidential race -- it will be on the strength of these two urban counties, which form the Miami TV media market along with much-smaller Monroe County in the Florida Keys. In this Hispanic- and black-heavy media market, Democrats have rolled up a nearly 318,000-vote margin over Republicans in total in-person early votes and mail-in absentee ballots. Don't forget that if Clinton wins Florida, the whole thing is over. There'd be almost no way for Trump to prevail in the electoral college. * Nate Cohn says that the Hispanic voter surge Democrats were hoping for nationwide looks like it's panning out. * Brian Beutler makes one final plea to conservatives not to support someone who is fraying our bonds of community. * Ezra Klein explains how the fact that Trump has come so close to the presidency reveals some disturbing weaknesses in our political system that will long outlast this election. * James Downie explains how the 2016 campaign could wind up shifting the climate change debate for the better, which is, you know, kind of important for our long term prospects. * The final Monmouth University poll shows Clinton leading by 6 nationally. * The final ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll shows Clinton ahead by 4. * The last Quinnipiac polls in Florida and North Carolina show the presidential, Senate, and governor's races as snug as a bug in a rug. * The last New York Times poll of North Carolina shows the race between Clinton and Trump tied. * Margaret Sullivan gives 13 different ways that members of the media did a terrific job covering this campaign. * Jeffrey Goldberg narrows down tomorrow's choice in an interesting way, by asking which candidate can be trusted to avert a nuclear war with North Korea, a question that makes this decision both urgent and a no-brainer. * Todd Gitlin gives a comprehensive analysis of how the media created Donald Trump. * Jamelle Bouie says that Trump is ending his campaign exactly how he began it: by demonizing immigrants and blaming them for all America's problems. * Ben Howe makes a final plea for a vote against Trump from a conservative perspective, and calls for a major effort on Republicans' part to learn from this utter debacle. * Harold Pollack says that by endorsing Donald Trump, police unions made the vital work of building trust in communities of color much harder. * Jim Tankersley explains how California, Oregon, and Washington are creating a coastal bastion of progressive (big) government.  * At The Week, I argued that you don't have to like Clinton, but you can't say she wasn't a good candidate. * At the American Prospect, I noted that Barack Obama's plan to destroy America has failed miserably. * And Paul Krugman aptly reminds us which party and candidate are the ones who are truly enjoying the advantages of a rigged election this cycle.  
8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/04/democrats-dreams-of-winning-the-house-appear-dashed-but-they-could-still-have-a-good-night/	Democrats’ dreams of winning the House appear dashed. But they could still have a good night.	" It's pretty safe to say Democrats are not going to retake the majority in the House of Representatives by turning 30 GOP seats blue on Tuesday. But they will almost definitely take a real bite out of the GOP's majority. The question now is: How big? Democrats could pick up anywhere from five to 20 (or more) seats. According to the just-updated Fix House race ratings, just 49 out of 435 congressional districts are competitive. Democrats haven't been able to stretch the map to give themselves many additional opportunities -- with a few notable exceptions -- and races that are on the board haven't really moved in Democrats' direction much in recent weeks. That's a testament to Republicans hanging tough in a tricky political environment for them. They are defending 26 districts that President Obama won not just once but twice. And Democrats got plenty excited when it looked like the Trump implosion was arriving in mid-October. And yet it doesn't seem like Democrats' attempts to cast down-ballot Republicans as mini-Trumps is resonating with as many voters as they would have hoped. In order to win the majority right now, Democrats would have to take 36 of the 49 competitive districts. That would translate to winning every ""lean Democratic"" district and every ""toss-up"" district, as well as 9 out of 22 districts we currently rate as ""lean Republican."" That said, even if Democrats take half of the ""toss-ups,"" they'll have gained 13 seats and cut the GOP majority almost in half. In other words: Democrats are still set to have a good night Tuesday. As it stands, nine of the 10 districts most likely to flip are Republican-held. We shuffled around the seats from last time, adding four new Republican ones -- although more than a dozen House races could probably argue their way on here. (P.S.: We also eliminated the three open seats pretty much guaranteed to flip thanks to redistricting that totally changed their partisan makeup: Florida's 2nd, which will go for Republicans, and Florida's 10th and Virginia's 4th, which will go for Democrats.)    Enough chatter -- to the final Friday Line of 2016! (Phew.) 10. New York's 19th, OPEN (R): Welcome New York's 19th to the Friday Line, everyone! This Hudson Valley seat is the epitome of a swing district. Progressive star and law professor Zephyr Teachout (D) is running a strong campaign (getting glowing profiles in New York Magazine, for example), while former GOP Assembly Minority Leader John Faso (R) has struggled to make a clear-cut case of why he should be elected. But polls are close, and Teachout needs younger, lower-income voters to come out for her, which is never a safe bet. (Previous ranking: N/A)    Zephyr Teachout, the Democratic candidate in New York's 19th. (AP Photo/Mike Groll)  9. Maine's 2nd, Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R): Welcome Maine's 2nd to the Line, everyone! Former state senator Emily Cain (D) is seeking a rematch with Poliquin, who pulled off the upset in 2014. She's giving him a run for his money; as Poliquin literally ducks reporters about whether he'll support Trump, Cain looks to have erased Poliquin's once double-digit lead: A late October Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram poll had Cain up 2, within the margin of error. Trivia fact: This is the most expensive U.S. House race in history, with more than $12 million spent so far on it. As a result, a Wesleyan Media Project study found that between Sept. 16 and Oct. 13, area voters were subjected to an average 333 ads A DAY related to this race. (Previous ranking: N/A)  8. Florida's 7th, Rep. John Mica (R): Welcome Florida's 7th! Thanks to redistricting, Mica -- first elected in 1993 -- is faced with his first competitive reelection in decades, and his rustiness may be costing him. ""Top GOP congressman laughs his way to possible defeat,"" was the headline in a recent Politico story about Mica's overly chill attitude about what is shaping up to be one of the most competitive races in the country. His challenger is Stephanie Murphy, a 38-year-old college instructor, former national security specialist and daughter of Vietnamese immigrants. House Republicans' campaign arm jumped in two weeks ago to help get Mica over the line in this Orlando-area district, but it's going to be close. (Previous ranking: N/A)     Rep. John Mica (R-Fla.) speaks during a TV interview in 2014. (AP)  7. New Jersey's 5th, Rep. Scott Garrett (R): Welcome New Jersey's 5th! Garrett is another veteran Republican suddenly in trouble. But as Cook Political Report astutely pointed out, he has no one to blame but himself. If he loses to Microsoft ad exec Josh Gottheimer, prognosticators like us will immediately bring up his comment this summer that he wouldn't contribute to House GOP's campaign arm because he worries the committee backs gay candidates. Democrats are blaring that closed-door comment with all the subtlety of a bullhorn -- they hired an airplane banner calling him a ""bigot"" -- while House Republicans' campaign committee hasn't spent a dime to help him. (Previous ranking: N/A)    Josh Gottheimer, the Democratic candidate in New Jersey's 5th District. (Danielle Parhizkaran /The Record via AP)  6. Florida's 18th, OPEN (D): This might be the most competitive Democratic-held seat on the map (though it's hardly the only potential GOP pick up). Republicans are bullish on taking the seat Rep. Patrick Murphy (D) vacated to run for Senate. It's a slightly Republican-leaning district, and they've got a dynamic candidate in Afghan War veteran Brian Mast. Businessman Randy Perkins (D) is self-funding his entire campaign (he asked Washington Democrats to stay out of it), but some of his attacks on Mast have come across as awkward, at best, and offensive, at worst. He recently told Mast, who is a war double amputee, to ""be a man and stand behind your own ads."" (Previous ranking: 9)   To the person who spent Halloween as Brian Mast, my son and I think you nailed it! pic.twitter.com/74NOWtPAuZ -- Brian Mast (@BrianMastFL) November 2, 2016   5. Minnesota's 2nd, OPEN (R): Rep. John Kline (R) is retiring after more than a decade representing this Twin Cities suburban seat. And Kline is ostensibly not happy with his potential successor, outspoken conservative talk radio host Jason Lewis, who won his primary after calling young, single women ""not-thinking,"" questioning the need to have fought the Civil War and saying the ""white population"" has been ""committing political suicide"" and ""cultural suicide."" Democrats say hospital executive Angela Craig (D) is raising the money she needs to take this slightly Republican-leaning district. But as Roll Call's Simone Pathe reports in more detail, Lewis is keeping things closer than expected. (Previous ranking: 4)   4. New Hampshire's 1st, Rep. Frank Guinta (R): Guinta is badly weakened by admitting last year he took illegal campaign contributions from his parents. He somehow made it through the primary for his fourth-straight matchup against former congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter (D), who isn't necessarily loved by voters, either. But the Washington tea leaves appear to show Shea-Porter with the edge: Democrats cancelled their planned ad spending here after touting a poll showing her up 10 points. A few weeks later, Republicans cancelled their planned ads -- suggesting they think this seat isn't worth trying to save. (Previous ranking: 8)  3. Nevada's 4th, Rep. Cresent Hardy (R): The moment Hardy won a surprise victory in 2014, Democrats started counting down to November 2016 for the chance to kick him out. They nominated one of the most polished candidates this cycle, state Sen. Ruben Kihuen (D), to do the job. But Republicans say not so fast: A Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Trump is slightly up in this purple, libertarian-leaning state. At the same time, early-voting in the state looks good for Democrats and if Trump struggles here, Hardy is probably out. (Previous ranking: 3)    Mitt Romney, Rep. Cresent Hardy, Rep. Joe Heck, Sen. Dean Heller and Nevada Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison pose for photos with campaign volunteers at a campaign rally in Las Vegas on Saturday, Oct. 8. (AP Photo/Michelle Rindels)  2. Illinois's 10th, Rep. Bob Dold (R): We've said it before, we'll say it again: Dold is in the category of Republicans who could do everything right but still lose. His seat in the northern Chicago suburbs is one of the most Democratic districts Republicans hold this cycle. (Dold has said he'd never support Trump.) Former congressman Brad Schneider (D), whom Dold knocked off in 2014, wants his seat back. Given the district's dynamics combined with the state's heavy lean for Clinton, Schneider has a decent shot. (Previous ranking: 5)  1. Florida's 13th, Rep. David Jolly (R): This is one of the few races on our list that hasn't moved in recent months. Jolly is facing one of the most recognizable faces in Florida politics, former governor Charlie Crist, a Republican-turned-independent-turned Democrat who has run two failed statewide races in the past four years and is now running in his hometown congressional district, which happens to be newly redrawn to favor Democrats. Recent polls show Crist with a 3-point lead, but Trump and Clinton are tied in the state, so it could be a nail-biter.

(Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post; iStockphoto)  America's garish presidential election has been a late-night host's dream come true. The jobs are plentiful, and the jokes write themselves -- so much so that everything started to look and sound the same.  Even the audiences sound the same, their laughter and applause forming prolonged Beatlemania-like squeals of agreement, a noise usually heard at actual political rallies. It's not news to anyone that late-night, over the past four presidential elections, became a way to excite the left and encourage the youth vote through sarcasm and satire. Late-night audiences have been whooping and barking since the Arsenio Hall days, but this is noise is different, louder, approving of the rant, the tirade, the cutting quip. While watching a recent taping of ""Late Night With Seth Meyers"" in Washington's Warner Theatre, I was struck by how willing the audience was to over-effuse, whether producers gestured for them to do so or not, ensuring that every single punchline in Meyers's (certainly sharp) ""Weekend Update""-style opening monologue sounded as if Hillary Clinton had secured another electoral-college vote. Laughter has been replaced by shrieking assent. The jokes also meet one another coming around the corner, unable to avoid duplication. Take Trump's resentment over an Emmy snub, which came up during his last debate with Clinton on Oct. 19. CBS's ""Late Show"" host, Stephen Colbert, made a taunting joke that night with two of his own Emmy statuettes (""You know Donald, you really should get one -- they're fantastic"") and then, four nights later on HBO, ""Last Week Tonight"" host John Oliver went for what is essentially the same laugh, offering to hand his own recently won Emmy statuette over to Trump in exchange for the candidate's acceptance of the election's results. (""That way if you lose, you still win."")      Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton met on the debate stage for one final showdown, and late-night comedians were tuned in for a laugh. (The Washington Post)   Oliver isn't ripping off Colbert, per se. It's just that there are so many flies buzzing around the same piles of elephant dung, on multiple platforms, all across the overpopulated late-night comedy landscape. What a great ride it's been for wiseasses everywhere, giving new spark to the predictable shows (HBO's ""Real Time With Bill Maher,"" for example) and an easy boost to stragglers (such as Chelsea Handler's halfhearted attempt to bring the after-hours talk format to Netflix). And what a godsend for the geeks in charge of tallying unique visitors and digital hits, as well as network executives still obsessed with claiming victory in late-night. But the fun's all going to end -- or at least shift considerably -- in a few days, and then what? Perhaps no group becomes more vulnerable Nov. 9 than the crowd of men (Colbert and Oliver, plus Trevor Noah, Meyers, Maher, Chris Hardwick, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O'Brien and -- sigh -- James Corden, if I absolutely must type his name) and two women (Samantha Bee and Handler) known as late-night hosts, some of them still vying to replace the void left by Jon Stewart, who retired from Comedy Central's ""Daily Show"" last year. Nowhere is that burden more acutely felt than on the ""Daily Show"" itself, where Noah does capable work but has nevertheless drifted off the radar. Each of these shows and their hosts are utterly dependent on viral online sharing of their political bits, sketches and diatribes to draw that still-profitable demographic known as TV viewers. For months now they have luxuriated in political humor, 90 percent of it courtesy of Trump's campaign. Not so long ago, a late-night host's job was to merely lubricate the release valves on the news-cycle machine. Today's late-night hosts pursue a more hybrid role -- part investigative reporter and part op-ed firebrand. They also played an intimate role in viewers' lives, as the people we chose to fall asleep with each night. Then the anxiety of politics stepped in with an onslaught of newly appointed hosts and new shows.      Late-night TV hosts roasted Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's defense of the leaked video that recorded him making lewd comments about women in 2005. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   Enough time has passed to ask: Which one of them is doing the best job? In some ways that can't be answered, because we're still trying to answer a different question: What do we want them to be? Hosts? Pundits? Should they be exclusively male and dress only in a suit and tie? Given the tenor of the times, would it be better if a black host rose to the top? Should they be true-blue American? (Noah is South African; Oliver is British, married to an American; Bee has dual Canadian-American citizenship.)  Do we want someone who is exactly like Stewart, whose die-hard fans still bemoan his departure just as Trump's campaign took off? Or more like David Letterman, who, if he could have summoned the energy to do so, would certainly have given both candidates a sardonic vetting?  The truth is they are all talented, yet they each fall short in a different way. It's not that we need Stewart or Letterman to come back; it's just that we're still mentally assembling a super-host from the options we now have. Isn't that what the social networks do to them each morning -- slice them into choice cuts?       Seth Meyers. (Lloyd Bishop/NBC)     Stephen Colbert. (Scott Kowalchyk/CBS)      Thirteen months into his ""Late Show"" run (and after a change in showrunners this past spring), Colbert has made a clear case for his seasoned wit, but forget everything else -- the gorgeous Ed Sullivan Theater makeover, the blue suits that match the set, the band (it's probably great fun to catch Jon Batiste and friends in a French Quarter jazz club, but the groove never quite materializes on TV). All that effort simply dragged the show down. Although still short of Fallon's ""Tonight Show"" ratings, Colbert's ""Late Show"" numbers have improved, thanks to a doubling down on all things Trump. During the Republicans' convention, Colbert revived the right-wing character that made him famous, delighting fans. Presumably they'll be even more thrilled when he takes his act to Showtime for a live Election Night special that will take advantage of premium cable's uncensored playground. But if we keep encouraging Colbert to deviate from his job description, then at some point CBS will have to revisit the task of replacing Letterman.  Colbert, who isn't afraid of the prurient, routinely delivers some halfway funny skits and sight gags -- one recent vintage example had him dragging a chalkboard out for the purposes of making ""One Diagram [That] Explains Every Conspiracy Against Trump."" The diagram took on a tumescent shape that became so graphic the network blotted it out. Another typical sketch had him yukking it up one last time with President Obama, who seems intent on making the rounds to each show before the election and who sat for an ""exit interview"" sketch and touted his job skills. As the bit sort of flailed, Obama could have likely turned the tables: Where will Colbert be come January, if Trump doesn't win?  That question is far less dire for established veterans such as O'Brien and Kimmel, who make just enough hay with politics and are then happy to get on with the business of hosting a talk show. (Kimmel's ""Drunk Trump"" is an inspired bit -- as simple as taking the candidate's most recent speech and slowing it down to half speed). Meyers reinvigorated ""Late Night"" by replacing a traditional opening monologue with anchored news parody delivered from a desk -- the very thing that made him famous on ""Saturday Night Live,"" giving viewers the kind of straightforward, Stewartesque satire they craved. Noah, meanwhile, has followed Stewart's ""Daily Show"" template to a T for more than a year now, without finding his own spin on it. Handler's Netflix show, which streams three days a week, is easily dismissed, mainly because she seems miserable doing it. The sketches are weak and her pro-Hillary declarations are predictable and not all that funny. Yet watching it, I was reminded that I miss the unhinged and undeterred mouthiness of her ""E!"" talk show, which ended in 2014. Some of our hosts now are too busy being clever that they forget to be bawdy -- or even just weird.       John Oliver. (Eric Liebowitz/HBO)     Samantha Bee. (Ali Goldstein/TBS)      If Twitterati consensus is a reliable applause-o-meter, then the two people doing the best political satire are the two who are beloved ""Daily Show"" alumni and can therefore lay the most claim to Stewart's crown. Oliver's ""Last Week Tonight"" and Bee's ""Full Frontal,"" the latter on TBS, are both blessed and beset by their shows' weekly format.  Oliver's full-throttle, commercial-free half-hour show hardly stops for a breath, allowing his humor to tackle topics that transcend politics and travel into complicated matters of sloppy policy and unfair lawmaking.  By tossing out the idea that he needs to have guests or even concoct prerecorded newsmagazine-style segments, Oliver has found success with a genre that was more familiar to right-wing radio: the unrelenting, multi-bulleted, hyper-topical tirade. By polka-dotting his rants with jokes (every salient point and crucial news clip is enhanced with a bizarre but affable riff as a punchline), Oliver sends the medicine down with sugar, but it's a rant all the same, and it's not always the gentlest way to tuck viewers in on a Sunday night. Whatever he said Sunday almost uniformly begins making the rounds Monday morning. Bee steps in Monday night with a similar approach. Limited to about 22 minutes (with commercial breaks), she zips through her sermonettes and demonstrates how vital a woman's perspective on politics can be -- and how different it is from all those men making jokes about the same debates, rallies and scandals. ""Only kindergartners get credit for using their inside voices,"" Bee said when others observed that Trump had opened the final debate with noticeably less bombast.  More wisely, Bee has kept the field-reporting segments that she excels at, with less of ""The Daily Show's"" wink-wink spoofery and something that's increasingly rare in late-night: You occasionally catch her in the act of listening, rather than just snarking or spouting. Both are excellent, but it's hard to escape the feeling of being in an echo chamber. Take the Waffle House measure, for instance: Bee and Oliver each made Waffle House jokes in different episodes recently (his came during a rant about the opioid crisis; hers was in a piece about Catholic hospitals that let dogma guide policies). When flying off the handle about one domestic dumpster fire after another, it seems all roads lead to a Waffle House joke.  That's because there's a shorthand language that all the writers for these shows share -- one that's not just about politics but also about class. In criticizing America, they wind up reaching for the same metaphors, and this causes them to make fun of the same things in the same ways. You can agree with all of it (or just some of it) and still find yourself getting bored.  That's why, when the electoral mania subsides, late-night must go on searching for its strongest, newest voice. Someone who does it all, from opening monologue to topical comedy bits to trenchant interviews to warm goodnights. Someone who can tuck America in without giving it too many more nightmares. "
