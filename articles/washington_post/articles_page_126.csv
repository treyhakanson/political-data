Riding voter registration numbers that heavily favor Democrats, Rochester defeated Republican Hans Reigle in Tuesday's election. Rochester, a political newcomer, loaned her campaign more than $400,000 and spent almost $1 million in topping a crowded field of Democratic primary candidates before defeating Reigle, a retired military pilot and former mayor of the Kent County town of Wyoming. Rochester, who has said her focus in Congress would be jobs, the economy and equal pay for equal work, will succeed fellow Democrat John Carney, who vacated Delaware's lone seat in the House to run for governor. ___ 8:10 p.m. Democratic Congressman John Carney has won the Delaware governor's race, eight years after losing his first bid to become the state's chief executive. Taking advantage of voter registration numbers that heavily favor Democrats, Carney defeated Republican state Sen. Colin Bonini of Dover in Tuesday's gubernatorial contest. Carney has said job creation and economic development will be among his top priorities, along with improving Delaware's public education system. At the same time, he has acknowledged that the next governor faces significant challenges, given troubling revenue expectations and escalating costs for Medicaid and state employee health care. Carney will succeed Jack Markell, who defeated Carney in the 2008 Democratic gubernatorial primary. Carney, who served as lieutenant governor under Markell's predecessor, Ruth Ann Minner, was then elected to Congress in 2010. ___ 8 p.m. Hillary Clinton has defeated Donald Trump in Delaware's presidential vote. Clinton enjoyed a victory Tuesday in a traditionally blue state where Democrats have controlled the executive and legislative branches for years and have built a strong advantage in voter registration numbers. By winning Delaware, Clinton added three electoral votes to her nationwide total. Clinton and Trump each made brief visits to Delaware during their respective primary campaigns. Clinton was joined by Gov. Jack Markell and all three members of Delaware's congressional delegation at an April rally in Wilmington. Trump drew thousands of supporters to a rally at the state fairgrounds in Harrington that same month. ___ 4:45 p.m. Delaware state troopers were called to a voting location in Elsmere in response to a complaint of disorderly conduct involving a couple of supporters of Donald Trump, but no arrests were made. State police spokesman Cpl. Jeffrey Hale says troopers spoke to the men, advised them that they shouldn't talk to voters as they were coming in to Baltz Elementary School to vote, and that they needed to stay at least 50 feet away from the polling location, as required by state law. State elections commissioner Elaine Manlove said a woman called her about the ""scary white men."" Manlove says she didn't know about the nature of the complaint, but that the men did not appear to be doing anything wrong. Manlove said her office did not notify police. ___ 3:30 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden has voted at a Wilmington high school, also hugging poll workers, posing for photos and chatting with neighbors. After casting his ballot shortly after 7:30 a.m. Tuesday at Alexis I. du Pont High School, Biden declared, ""it's a beautiful day to vote."" Working the crowd, Biden said, ""What's your name?"" ''How are you?"" and ""I haven't seen you in Mass lately."" He thanked voters for performing their civic duty and saluted volunteers for helping the process run smoothly. Biden also joked that, ""The bad news is, I'm not going away."" He says he'll continue to fight against income inequality after he leaves office. Biden also visited a Newark coffee shop Tuesday and talked with a large crowd of University of Delaware students that gathered. ___ 2:30 p.m. Delaware's elections commissioner says early turnout appears to be high as voters cast their ballots for president and a host of statewide and local offices. Elections Commissioner Elaine Manlove says roughly 160,000 people had cast ballots at voting precincts across the state as of about noon Tuesday. That's in addition to about 24,000 Delawareans who voted by absentee ballot. Those combined totals represent more than a fourth of the state's roughly 675,600 registered voters. Manlove says there have been no reports of voting machine problems. Weather proved to be no deterrent to voters, with sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-60s. ___ 4:10 a.m. Regardless of the winners, Tuesday's election promises to significantly alter Delaware's political landscape. Voters will elect a new congressional representative, a new governor, and new leaders of the state's two largest local governments. Balloting in House and Senate races also will define the balance of power in the General Assembly, where Republicans are hoping to end years of Democratic rule and regain control of the Senate. The top of the ticket features a congressional race between Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester and Republican Hans Reigle, and a gubernatorial contest pitting Democratic congressman John Carney Jr. against Republican state Sen. Colin Bonini. Voters also will choose a new lieutenant governor and state insurance commissioner, a new Wilmington mayor, and new chief executive of New Castle County.
