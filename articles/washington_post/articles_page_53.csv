Trump’s had practice	" WASHINGTON -- For nearly the entire week since he became president-elect, Donald Trump has been holed up in his gilded New York skyscraper. A steady stream of visitors has come to him, flooding through metal detectors and getting whisked up to Trump's offices and penthouse residence. It's good preparation for the insular, security-shrouded bubble that awaits Trump at the White House. Unlike President Barack Obama, who flew commercial and lived in a dingy Washington apartment within about a year of taking office, Trump has already spent decades living an unusually cloistered life. While Obama often bemoans his inability to take a walk or enjoy a meal at a sidewalk cafe, Trump doesn't appear to have much of an affinity for either.  ""The reason my hair looks so neat all the time is because I don't have to deal with the elements very often,"" Trump wrote in his 2004 book, ""How To Get Rich. ""I live in the building where I work. I take an elevator from my bedroom to my office. The rest of the time, I'm either in my stretch limousine, my private jet, my helicopter, or my private club in Palm Beach, Florida."" Indeed, Trump hasn't been seen outdoors since Thursday, when he traveled to Washington to meet with Obama and Republican congressional leaders. Trump Tower has balcony space, but it's unclear whether the president-elect has felt a bit a fresh air as he takes calls from foreign leaders and weighs nominations for top Cabinet posts. There's been no celebratory dinner at a favorite restaurant with his wife, Melania, no sentimental visit to his childhood home in Queens.  ""President-elect Trump is there receiving calls from different people. He has different meetings, interviews,"" Trump's adviser Kellyanne Conway said earlier this week. ""We've really just been ensconced in Trump Tower trying to form a government."" Trump was a fixture on the New York social scene when he was younger, but those close to him say he'd become more of a homebody even before he began running, preferring to camp out in front of the television at night watching cable news. He spends nearly all of his time at his properties, including Trump Tower in New York, his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, or at Mar-a-Lago, his exclusive South Florida club. If he travels outside of those locales, it's often to a place with a Trump property nearby. As president, Trump will be constantly surrounded by a pack of Secret Service agents, replacing the team of private security guards who protected him before he ran. He'll fly on Air Force One, giving his Trump-branded jet a break. And he'll be restricted from driving anything other than a golf cart, though he's said to rarely drive himself anyway.  ""To me, a great luxury is for me just to get into a car by myself and drive,"" Trump said last year. The insular world of the White House is often even more of an adjustment for the president's family. First lady Michelle Obama has notoriously chafed at the restrictions on her movement, speaking longingly about wanting to simply be able to get into a car and roll down the windows. But Melania Trump sounded sanguine about what's ahead, noting that she'd had time to get used to the bubble during her husband's presidential campaign.  ""It will just continue,"" Mrs. Trump said in an interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes. ""It's another level, but it will continue."" Trump aides say the businessman does plan to move to the White House -- ""The president is going to live in Washington,"" top adviser Rudy Giuliani said Monday -- but Trump is expected to continue spending time at his exclusive Mar-a-Lago, which the property's original owner, Marjorie Merriweather Post, willed to the U.S. government when she died in 1973 to serve as a retreat for presidents and visiting dignitaries. It has sometimes been dubbed the ""winter White House."" Members of the club, where he often spends winter weekends, describe Trump as a man of routine, who spends most of his time at the club or at his nearby golf courses, eating, mingling with guests, working -- and keeping an eye on his employees' work. While Trump was once known as a New York playboy who stuffed his calendar with galas and events, Lee Lipton, a Mar-a-Lago member for years, said that it's rare to see Trump venture to an event off-site these days.  ""He said, 'Why should I go anywhere else?'"" Lipton recalled Trump once explaining. ""'I have the best food in Palm Beach.'"" __ Associated Press writer Ken Thomas in New York contributed to this report. __ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Jill Colvin at http://twitter.com/colvinj Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Opening his final overseas trip as president, Obama acknowledged he was surprised by Trump's victory -- and said it stemmed from deep-seated anxieties among working-class Americans that government must do better to address. But, he added paradoxically: ""That's been my agenda for the last eight years.""  ""People seem to think I did a pretty good job,"" Obama told reporters, citing his strong approval numbers. ""So there is this mismatch, I think, between frustration and anger."" Obama's diagnosis of what went wrong for Hillary Clinton and Democrats offered little in the way of a road map for Democrats to avoid a similar fate in future elections. Democrats reeling from their resounding defeat last week are divided about what went wrong and even more divided about how to fix it. In a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, Obama said his proposals on jobs, education and infrastructure would have helped the same voters whose frustration drove Trump's success at the polls -- if only they'd been implemented.  ""The problem was I couldn't convince the Republican Congress to pass a lot of them,"" Obama said. It was also the clearest sign yet that the president did not accept Trump's election as a repudiation of his policies, despite Trump's ardent rejection of nearly every piece of Obama's legacy. Obama's words are being watched closely by world leaders who see parallels between Trump's election and the rise of far-right movements in their own countries amid continued economic anxiety. After Athens, Obama planned visits to Germany and Peru. Obama's visit sparked large protests in central Athens, prompting riot police to use tear gas and stun grenades to disperse about 3,000 left-wing marchers after they tried to enter an area declared off-limits to demonstrators. No injuries or arrests were reported. Obama seemed skeptical that ""the new prescriptions being offered"" would satisfy voters' restlessness. At home, Obama's party is split as it tries to come to terms with Trump's win. Some Democrats are pushing for an immediate and concerted effort to block Trump at all costs, while others want an internal shake-up and new direction aimed at winning back support among working-class voters.  ""There needs to be significant change in our party,"" said DNC National Finance Chairman Henry Munoz III, who's considering a bid for chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Nearly a dozen Democrats are mulling bids, including Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim-American elected to Congress, and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison. Obama has not weighed in directly on the leadership fight. But on Tuesday, he suggested the problem wasn't the course he set for the party, but some of the shortcomings of Hillary Clinton and her campaign.  ""Presidential elections always turn on personalities, they turn on how campaigns are run, they turn on natural desires for change,"" he said, not mentioning Clinton by name. Clinton's supporters say she faced a difficult balancing act: She embraced Obama, hoping to avoid alienating his supporters, while simultaneously trying to acknowledge the persistent economic challenges and the uneven economic recovery.  ""There is a tension between the real life, which is very tough for working-class voters, and the president's overall narrative,"" Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg said. At each stop on his trip, Obama expects to confront apprehension from world leaders who fear Trump could bring about seismic changes in U.S. foreign policy and withdraw the U.S. from its traditional leadership role. Paying the first presidential visit to Greece since Bill Clinton in 1999, Obama sought to reassure NATO allies that Trump, despite belittling the alliance during the campaign, wouldn't abandon it. Obama said Democratic and Republican administrations had respected NATO and predicted ""significant continuity even as we see a transition in government."" Tsipras, held his tongue for the most part, noting that Trump was now the president-elect and would be a major player on the world stage. He said he knew little of Trump but had become acquainted with his ""aggressive manner"" during the campaign.  ""I did not wish to repeat the criticisms that many of have made during the election period,"" Tsipras said. ____ Associated Press writer Lisa Lerer in Washington contributed to this report. ____ Follow Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP and Elena Becatoros on https://twitter.com/ElenaBec Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

"   Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality.   It was gratifying that after Wisconsin voted him into the presidency, the gentleman did not talk about putting Hillary Clinton in prison. That was a nice surprise. And when he met with Obama of Kenya, the white sahib was well-behaved, listened to what the African had to say, did not interrupt or call him stupid, and in fact thanked the alien for meeting with him. He did a good impersonation of modesty.  Say what you will, the man is flexible. The wall on the border, his reliable applause line this past year, has been downgraded to a fence in some places and may eventually turn into a line of orange highway cones. The 11 million deportees are down to 2 or 3 million. Clinton may be let off with an ankle bracelet.  While he's making alterations, he should consider getting a presidential hairdo rather than the hair of a hotel lounge pianist in 1959. It's distracting to watch a man talk about national security looking like he might suddenly burst into ""Volare."" A makeover would take about 15 minutes max. And might a speech therapist try to smooth out the Tony Soprano accent and give him a presidential voice like Nixon's or Reagan's and cut out those irritating repetitions for emphasis -- do you know what I mean? Am I right? Am I right? You know I'm right. You better believe I'm right.  He will never be my president because he doesn't read books, can't write more than a sentence or two at a time, has no strong loyalties beyond himself, is more insular than any New Yorker I ever knew, and because I don't see anything admirable or honorable about him. This sets him apart from other politicians. The disaffected white, blue-collar workers elected a Fifth Avenue tycoon to rescue them from the elitists -- fine, I get that -- but they could've chosen a better tycoon. One who served in the military or attends church or reads history, loves opera, sails a boat -- something -- anything -- raises llamas, plays the oboe, runs a 5K race now and then, has close friends from childhood. I look at him and there's nothing there.      President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it's ""healthy"" for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. ""When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,"" Obama said. (The Washington Post)   But politics is not everything. Life goes on. A person has to keep that in mind. The day after the election, my wife and I set out to replace some burned-out light bulbs in some interesting fixtures chosen by an elderly interior decorator years ago. We are from Minnesota and we hesitate to impose our taste on others, even when we're paying the bill. So we have several truly ugly and impractical light fixtures that use odd rare bulbs not sold at Walmart, Walgreens, Ace Hardware or even at boutiques with names like Let There Be Light Bulbs. Long, cylindrical bulbs. Perhaps handmade by Cistercian monks on a mountaintop in Montana.  I voted for Clinton, so I'm an elitist, but still. We use regular old G.E. light bulbs.  My wife is a violinist, so she has excellent fine motor skills, plus a better sense of logic and smaller hands, so she's the foreman, and my job is to stand by the stepladder, hold her by the hips, hand her the Allen wrench -- yes, these fixtures, unique in the Western hemisphere, require hexagonal wrenches -- receive loose screws and the burned-out bulb, hand her the fresh bulb while bracing the loose fixture and not letting it fall, and maintaining an upbeat attitude.  It's interesting to hold a kind, gentle Episcopalian lady by the hips and hear how well she can swear while trying to replace a light bulb in a fixture that -- how many liberals does it take? Three. One to turn the bulb, one to hold the ladder and one to make sure the manufacturer offers good health care and pension plans to its employees. This is what pulls a couple together. Every marriage has its bumps, but when she stands on a stepladder and I brace my shoulder against her rear end to leave my hands free to hold the big glass shade as she screws the bulb into the socket and takes the Allen wrench from me and the screws and drops one and I bend down, my hand still on her haunch, and reach for the fallen screw, and we both start laughing, this is a sweet moment that momentarily transcends politics. I hope that Donald Trump does not make Wisconsin regret having elected him president, but it's still the same old story about love and glory and a case of do or die and lovers must replace their light bulbs as time goes by.

3	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/11/15/so-trump-won-and-youre-out-of-a-job/	So, Trump won and you’re out of a job	"   President Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House on Nov. 10 in Washington. (Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  I have never witnessed an election quite like 2016, where no one in the incumbent regime or in the favored campaign planned for the contingency that their team might lose. Ordinarily, participants in the game would hedge a little and contemplate the consequences of a loss. But with Donald Trump's upset victory, the career plans for many of those serving in the Obama administration and the job market for Clinton loyalists hoping to serve in a Clinton administration have radically changed. Last week, I gave free advice to those who want to work in the Trump administration. So if you will soon be out of a job now that the unexpected has happened, here are my thoughts for the Democrats who want to stay in Washington. If you happen to be a cabinet secretary or are in a senior position at the White House, you'll be fine. And a select few will be approached by head-hunting firms, but those calls will be rare. Almost everyone else has to hustle. But don't despair: If you are diligent and persistent and you have a little time, you will find your place in Washington. For the purposes of this conversation, there are five main job markets outside of the government in Washington:  Established law firms, lobbying firms and PR firms. Trade associations and nonprofits. Corporate offices. Businesses that aren't directly connected to the government, but happen to be located in D.C., such as Marriott, private banks, etc. Hanging out your own shingle.  For sectors 1-4, there will be more applicants than there are spaces, at least in the near term, which means determination and persistence are at a premium. Immediately start meeting with people who you think work in an interesting place or at least a place that intersects with your interests. Go see a few people who have held your government job and ask what they are doing now and what has worked -- or hasn't worked -- for them. Exchange notes and contact details with everyone you can. As soon as possible, be able to answer this question: What would a wise client or business hire you to do and how much they should they pay you? You would be surprised at all the people I meet with who can't answer that question. Note that those who may find the job search the hardest are those who entered government in their 20s and have ridden up the government pay scale to the point where their salaries surpass those of their private-sector counterparts, sometimes by tens of thousands of dollars. Downer. Be sure you have realistic salary expectations. Know that at many firms in town, you will largely be judged on whether you are viewed as a promising business developer -- specifically, whether you can bring clients to the firm. Most firms have a bias toward new hires who can bring in business. After 25 years of being a lobbyist in Washington, I'm no better than 50-50 on being able to identify business developers. Some people have a natural knack for attracting clients, while others have business repellent in their aura. Unfortunately, business repellent is odorless, colorless, invisible in the infrared and cannot be detected with any existing technology. If you don't think you are a business developer, say so. Say you want to service clients and that sales is not your thing. Experienced firms will get that and make better, more honest calculations. If you do decide to hang out your own shingle, business development becomes even more crucial. People ask me all the time, ""So Ed, how do you get business?"" Answer: I have no idea. I've had an anxious knot in the back of my throat every single day for the past 25 years from worrying about where business is going to come from. It is the most terrifying thing about starting your own service business. While I've never figured out a precise marketing plan or formula that gets business, I have three observations to share after all these years. First, you get business by asking for business. That sounds trite, but it's true. And if you go a whole week without asking for business, you should rethink how you are spending your time. Second, work begets work. Get one piece of business, and if you do a good job, sometimes someone will notice and bring you more work to do. Third and finally, when you get out, things happen. Book breakfasts and lunches, attend conferences and if you have the budget for it, don't be afraid to travel to ask for business. You will be surprised who you will bump into. There is a lot of serendipity involved in getting business. When President George H.W. Bush lost his reelection in 1992, I had been out of the government for a little while, but it was still a shock -- and it was bad for business. In 1993, I developed a useful line when meeting with many of my former colleagues: ""What are you doing, and how can it be good for me?"" I recommend making this line part of your standard greeting. In this new era, the good news for those who want to stay in Washington is that the lawyer/lobbyist/PR consultant business is a growth business. As the government becomes more complex, more companies and institutions than ever are coming to Washington to determine how they should engage or avoid the government. Also, partisanship plays less of a role than it used to. If you are a serious person who wants to talk about a serious issue, the offices that matter more likely than not will be willing to see you. In furtherance of doing a good job, principals and staffers will meet with the affected parties. The vast majority of bureaucrats and political appointees want to be smarter and to do a good job. They want to hear from people who have something relevant to offer. Just as I advised people wanting to go into the new administration, work hard, work hard, work hard and get lucky. Don't be shy about asking for help, and be confident in the certainty that if I can do it, you can do it."

Until now.	"   President Obama (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)  Barack Obama made one thing very clear in his first post-election news conference Monday: He thinks that the infrastructure of the Democratic Party is badly in need of an overhaul. ""Democrats have to be clear on the given population distribution across the country,"" Obama said. ""We have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grass-roots level, something that's been a running thread in my career."" He added: The challenge for a national party is how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for. And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press. And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about, how do you build more grass-roots organizing, how do you build state parties and local parties and school board elections you're paying attention to, state rep races and city council races; that all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future. And I'm optimistic that will happen. That's a smart diagnosis -- even if it ignores the ""why"" behind the downballot collapse of the party. (More on that below.) What's even more interesting is that Obama has previously signaled that once he leaves office, he plans to be involved in the nittiest-grittiest politics there is: redistricting. ""Hoping to regain lost ground in the states before elected officials there redraw congressional maps for the next decade, Democrats have launched a new group that will enlist the aid of President Obama as well as a slew of the party's liberal allies,"" wrote The Washington Post's Juliet Eilperin in October. ""The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which will be chaired by former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., will focus on key legislative and gubernatorial races, voter initiatives and legal fights."" Interesting, right? And it's made all the more intriguing by the fact that a) Obama has never really been willing to put his political brand on the line to aid his party and b) he is blamed by many downballot Democrats for the deep losses the party has suffered over the duration of his presidency.      President Obama said that his administration ""stands ready"" to assist President-elect Donald Trump and his staff as they transition to the White House in January. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)   Let's take the second point first. It's beyond dispute that the Obama years have been very, very bad for his party at every level but the presidential one.     Whether or not Obama is to blame for those losses is more murky territory. There's no question that Republicans ran against Obama in both the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections. But it's also true that the president's party almost always loses seats in midterms -- likely a function of the public's long-running desire for divided government.     Regardless of the specific reason (in truth, it's almost certainly not just one reason), Democrats find themselves at a remarkably low ebb -- particularly at the state and local level. Republicans now hold 33 governorships and have total control of all levers of state government -- governor as well as both houses of state legislatures -- in 25 states.     Now, to the first point I made above -- that Obama seems committed to helping reverse these losses. The simple fact is -- and any Democrat who didn't work in the Obama White House (and a few who did) will tell you this -- that Obama and his inner circle were never terribly concerned about the broader Democratic Party during his first six or so years in the White House. Remember that Obama wasn't the choice of the party establishment for president in 2008. In fact, he ran against the party insiders and Washington veterans who had rallied to Hillary Clinton. And once in office, Obama did little to curry favor with congressional Democrats. While there's always some level of he's-not-paying-enough-attention-to-us-ism that happens between a president and his party in Congress, this was more than that. Officials at the House and Senate Democratic campaign committee regularly complained about the Obama team's unwillingness to risk sullying his brand by endorsing or campaigning for downballot candidates. The first priority -- also the second and third and fourth priorities -- for the Obama team was protecting his brand and ensuring first his reelection, and then his legacy. Only in the 2016 election did Obama suddenly emerge as the campaigner in chief (for candidates other than himself). ""On the airwaves, Obama is stepping up for down-ballot Democrats like never before,"" read the headline of a recent piece by The Washington Post's Ed O'Keefe and Paul Kane. It read, in part: Democrats have griped about the president's passive approach to campaigning for them, particularly House Democrats, who have more often been given the services of Vice President Biden for campaign appearances and ads. During the 2008 campaign, Obama did just one advertisement for congressional Democrats. In 2012, Democrats felt neglected down the ballot even on small matters such as getting the presidential team's field staff to hand out literature for their campaigns as they canvassed for votes. Yup. And an argument can be made that much of Obama's involvement in the 2016 campaign was aimed at protecting/promoting his own legacy. With Clinton's loss, however, the Democratic Party is remarkably bereft of national figures other than Obama. Given the Senate map in 2018 (25 Democratic seats up compared to just eight for Republicans) and the House map still heavily gerrymandered after the 2010 Census, the rebuilding of the Democratic Party won't be a two-year project. It won't be until at least 2022, the election after the decennial redistricting process, that Democrats have a realistic hope of controlling both chambers of Congress -- barring a political cataclysm. What that timetable requires is both patience and an extended commitment to remaking a party whose weaknesses had been papered over by its success at the top of the ticket. The extent of Obama's commitment to this rebuilding effort will be the key factor in whether it can succeed."

Freedom Caucus member Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina nominated Ryan on Tuesday. Mulvaney said that in a phone conversation earlier in the day with Pence, the Indiana governor told him to explicitly state that Donald Trump and Pence wanted Ryan to be speaker -- which Mulvaney said he did during his speech. That made Mulvaney's remarks an important show of support from two factions of Republicans who've been critical of Ryan -- hard-right conservatives and strong Trump supporters. ___ 1:51 p.m. Republicans have re-nominated Paul Ryan to be House speaker when next year's GOP-led Congress starts working on President-elect Donald Trump's agenda. House Republicans picked the Wisconsin Republican at a closed-door meeting Tuesday. Some hard-right GOP lawmakers say Ryan has not been a sufficiently aggressive champion of conservative causes. And some ardent backers of Trump's candidacy were unhappy that the speaker refused to campaign for Trump and clashed repeatedly with him. But a week after Trump's startling election, elated Republicans rallied behind Ryan. Ryan still must win formal election when the full House picks its speaker as the new Congress convenes Jan. 3. All Democrats are expected to oppose him that day. Ryan will need support of all but around two dozen Republicans to prevail. ___ 12:45 p.m. House Democratic leaders say a delay in leadership elections is not a repudiation after last week's Democratic rout.  ""It's a desire to talk about what happened, and I think that's healthy,"" said Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House. Democrats decided Tuesday morning to delay a vote for Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's re-election bid after several members said they needed more time. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., said the delay is an effort to ensure new members are included, not to allow time for members to rethink who's in charge. No one has yet come forward to challenge Pelosi, D-Calif. But Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan has said he is considering a run. Ryan said the party needs a message that ""resonates in the flyover states."" ___ 11:05 a.m. Speaker Paul Ryan promises that President-elect Donald Trump and a unified Republican Congress will mean that ""a better way, better days lie ahead for our country."" He's promising to work ""hand in glove"" with the incoming administration. Ryan said he's talking frequently with Trump and top officials and is still formulating strategies to get the Trump administration off to a quick start on Capitol Hill. Ryan declined to reveal what the agenda of the ongoing lame-duck session will be. But Ryan did promise ""we're going to fix these problems,"" ranging from the deficit to defense. __ 10:50 a.m. House Democrats have decided to delay their leadership elections and the decision on whether to keep Nancy Pelosi as their leader. Elections had been scheduled for Thursday, but now will occur on Nov. 30. At issue is whether to reinstall Pelosi or opt for a new leader. Democrats gained seats in last Tuesday's election but not as many as initially expected, and Republicans will hold the Senate and the presidency. More than two dozen House Democrats wrote Pelosi this week asking her to delay the elections, saying it is ""vital that our caucus take the time to listen to the American people and learn the lessons of this difficult election.""

State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said Tuesday that a U.S. delegation holding previously scheduled talks in Myanmar urged the government to ""improve transparency."" The U.S. also repeated its call for an independent investigation and humanitarian access. Tensions have been high in Rakhine since fighting in 2012 between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims. Last month, nine police were killed in attacks on guard posts blamed on Muslim insurgents, prompting a government crackdown. Human rights groups have accused government forces of burning down Rohingya villages. The violence and persecution of Rohingya threatens to overshadow Myanmar's historic transition to civilian rule.

The Department of Correctional Services said Monday that the former Paralympic champion was transferred from Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria to the nearby Atteridgeville Correctional Centre, which recently installed bath tubs during upgrades for disabled criminals. It says the Atteridgeville prison houses offenders serving up to six years in prison, and has rehabilitation and development programs for inmates. Officials say double-amputee Pistorius's disability previously required that he be held in a Kgosi Mampuru remand center lacking such programs.

CEO Matt Maloney's email Wednesday said he rejects Trump's ""nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics"" and that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign ""because you have no place here."" In a tweet Thursday that was later deleted, Maloney said: ""Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees -- even those who voted for Trump."" Maloney later issued a statement saying his email advocated for inclusion and tolerance and that Grubhub doesn't discriminate based on political beliefs.

(WeatherBell.com)  People often joke that weather forecasts are terrible -- that meteorology is the only profession where you can be wrong half the time and keep your job. In light of their epic failure in predicting the outcome of Tuesday's presidential election, do political pundits now deserve the ridicule so often reserved for meteorologists?   Predictions. Political science is now as humiliated as macro-economics. @nytimes chart pic.twitter.com/bWFdEMFJZq -- Paul Kirby (@paul1kirby) November 9, 2016   It's tempting for meteorologists to gloat about how superior weather forecasts are in light of Tuesday's outcome. And they are. Meteorologists can tell what the next day's forecast will be with about 85 to 90 percent accuracy. A short-term weather forecast bust of the magnitude of Tuesday's election is extraordinarily rare.   [Five myths about weather forecasting]   But while weather and political forecasting share some similarities, comparing them directly isn't appropriate. Political forecasts are much more difficult to make because they involve people. Whereas the weather is governed by physical laws, human behavior follows no such hard and fast rules.   With all due respect, huge difference between predicting the wx and predicting behavior. The age of false equivalence needs to end. -- Ian Livingston (@islivingston) November 9, 2016   When we make a weather forecast, we have thousands of observations of temperature, wind and moisture at different levels of the atmosphere that feed into our models. These are objective data points. Unlike political data, they're not subject to distortion from current events. ""You know almost exactly what the state of the atmosphere is at time zero,"" explained Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics. ""Pollsters are starting with initial conditions, which already have a lot of error, and extrapolating that out."" Consider the behavior of the atmosphere simulated by models is more or less fixed, while ever-shifting demographic and socioeconomic trends increase the potential for the output of political models to be skewed. ""If the physics of the atmosphere changed every few years, what would that do to our [weather] models?"" said Matt Lanza, an operational forecast meteorologist for the energy industry and occasional contributor at Nate Silver's fivethirtyeight.com. ""I don't envy political pollsters for the job that they have. We deal with very different realms of prediction."" Weather models have benefited from decades of forecast analysis which have made them better, said Roger Pielke Jr., a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado who has published scholarly articles on prediction in science and policy. ""There are hundreds of millions of unique forecasts that have been made for weather that gives an enormous body of statistics that we can evaluate,"" Pielke Jr. said. ""These forecasts you can explore, quantify, and examine and get robust scientific knowledge on the predictions themselves."" The same cannot be said for political predictions, because human voter dynamics are always changing. Political predictions can even alter the outcome of an election they are attempting to forecast, something that can't happen with weather predictions, Pielke Jr. noted. This adds another layer of complexity to such prognostications. ""Your prediction of the weather isn't going to change the weather,"" he said. ""A fair question to ask is: Did all of the predictions of a landslide Clinton victory lead to the depressed Democratic turnout compared to 2012?"" What weather and political forecasts share in common are enormous challenges in characterizing and communicating uncertainty. Forecasters in both disciplines use ensemble prediction methods to evaluate uncertainty. That is, they analyze a range of models with different inputs and assumptions to see how well they agree or disagree. If the group of model simulations are all very similar, that suggests confidence in their output. But if they differ, that suggests large uncertainties. A dangerous trap forecasters relying on ensemble prediction can fall into is accepting a result when all models agree but are catastrophically wrong. In both weather forecasting and political forecasting, a tiny error in modeling -- largely opaque to forecasters -- can prove hugely consequential. This is essentially what happened in Tuesday's election.   [How did polls miss the presidential election result so badly?]     Every one of these guys was wrong. Disastrously, unforgivably, wrong. https://t.co/y2WsAtx7Vi -- Roger Pielke Jr. (@RogerPielkeJr) November 9, 2016   ""Many folks have been calling these scenarios black swans,"" said WeatherBell Anayltics' Maue. ""You have a false sense of confidence that you're on the right track."" Short-term weather forecasting has reached the point where such ""black swan"" scenarios are mostly a thing of the past. (Note, however, meteorologists still have difficulty forecasting and communicating the range of effects along the edge of storms and there have been notable misses recently. And, at longer range, we see cases where model ensembles are wrong.) But political forecasting, which is not as mature and ever more complex, has proved such a horribly bad prediction is possible within hours of the outcome. Political scientists will surely study Tuesday's election for years to learn from avoiding a repeat in the future."
