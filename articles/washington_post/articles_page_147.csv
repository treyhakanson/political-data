Troops moved into the Muharabeen and Ulama neighborhoods after gaining control of the adjacent Tahrir neighborhood on Friday, said Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces. Aridi said Islamic State fighters were using snipers, rocket-propelled grenades and mortar rounds.   Late Friday, a group of Islamic State militants attacked the village of Imam Gharbi south of Mosul, controlling most of it for hours before airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition were called in, an officer said. The officer spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters. -- Associated Press AFGHANISTAN ISIS commander dies in alleged drone attack A top Islamic State commander was killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan's eastern Nangahar province, Afghan officials said Saturday. Mullah Bozorg died with seven fighters in the attack late Friday, said Attaullah Khugyani, the spokesman for the Nangahar provincial governor. Bozorg's death was confirmed by the Afghan Defense Ministry. The United States has not said that it launched a drone attack or confirmed Bozorg's death.     -- Deutsche Presse-Agentur Morocco Pledge to fight climate change without U.S. Negotiators from nearly 200 countries ended two weeks of talks Saturday pledging to press on with the fight against climate change -- with or without the help of the next U.S. president. The election of Donald Trump, who has called global warming a ""hoax"" and has threatened to cancel U.S. participation in an international climate deal, cast a pall over the conference in Marrakesh, Morocco. Few at the meeting wanted to consider what the agreement might look like without U.S. involvement. But Thursday, participants issued a call to action, saying, ""Our climate is warming at an alarming and unprecedented rate and we have an urgent duty to respond."" Without mentioning Trump by name, the declaration reaffirmed the need to reduce emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases and called for ""the highest political commitment to combat climate change."" -- Los Angeles Times  Thousands march in Malaysia against prime minister: Thousands of pro-democracy supporters marched in a rally in the Malaysian capital, calling for fair elections and the resignation of Prime Minister Najib Razak. Najib has been at the center of a corruption scandal since July 2015, when a Wall Street Journal report suggested that $673 million in his personal bank accounts had been siphoned from a state fund.  Turkish officials defend underage-marriage proposal: Government officials in Turkey stepped up their defense of legislation that would allow men to evade punishment for sexual assault by marrying underage girls they abuse. Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag insisted that the bill was aimed at regulating the problem of child marriage and that it is not intended to grant amnesty to rapists. The proposed law would not apply to cases in which force is used.  Pope warns against growing polarization: Pope Francis warned against what he called a ""virus of polarization"" and hostility in the world targeting people of different nationalities, races or beliefs, as he led a ceremony giving the Roman Catholic Church 17 new cardinals from six continents. Francis used his homily to also caution the new ""princes of the church,"" as cardinals are sometimes called, to guard against animosity creeping into the church as well, saying ""We are not immune from this."" The pope spoke of ""our pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose and condemn"" and cautioned against those who ""raise walls, build barriers and label people."" -- From news services "

State House Del. Eileen Filler-Corn announced Saturday she was not going to seek the statewide office, which is largely ceremonial but is often a springboard for a gubernatorial run. Filler-Corn, a Northern Virginia lobbyist, said she'd been exploring a possible run for lieutenant governor for the past several months. Virginia will hold elections for statewide offices in 2017. Several Republicans are vying for their party's nomination to run for lieutenant governor. For Democrats, Justin Fairfax and Gene Rossi, both attorneys from Northern Virginia, have publicly declared they are running. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The new rule announced Friday bars liquor-license holders from apolplying for a permit to allow the consumption of pot. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said using alcohol and marijuana together increases impairment. Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the national Marijuana Policy Project, said the measure approved by voters this month would allow servers to keep track of customers who drink and consume pot products instead of forcing them to go outside or hide behind closed doors.  ""Under the new law, people would be wearing a green wristband that would identify them. Our alcohol policies already rely on the judgment of the server,"" Tvert said. Daniel Landes, owner of the City O' City restaurant and bar in Denver, which has a fully stocked bar that includes chai infused rye whiskey and a vegetarian menu, said he wants the option of holding special events where marijuana is allowed, including cannabis conventions in Denver.  ""I'm in the hospitality business, and there is no place like this to use marijuana. That is inhospitable,"" he said. On Nov. 8, Denver voters approved a first-in-the-nation law allowing willing bars and restaurants to give people the option to use marijuana alongside a cocktail or meal. Smoking pot would not be allowed inside, and the locations would have to first get the approval of neighbors or business districts. Bars and restaurants would not be allowed to sell marijuana products, and people would have to bring their own. The ruling by the by the Liquor Enforcement Division of the Colorado Department of Revenue would not apply to pot clubs or coffee shops. Tvert said the ruling was pushed by the liquor industry trying to protect its turf because they wanted people drinking alcohol and not using other products. The liquor industry and other groups, including Mothers Against Drunk Driving, expressed concerns over safety and liability. The Colorado Department of Revenue issued a statement saying it was primarily a safety issue.  ""After carefully considering all impacts to Coloradans and industry, this rule is in the best interests of public health and safety resulting from public and dual consumption,"" said Barbara Brohl, executive director of the Department of Revenue and State Licensing Authority for both the Liquor Enforcement Division and the Marijuana Enforcement Division. Dr. Larry Wolk, executive director and chief medical officer at the Colorado Department of Public of Public Health and Environment, supported the ruling.  ""There is substantial evidence that combined use of marijuana and alcohol increases impairment more than use of either substance alone. If marijuana use is allowed in establishments that hold a liquor license, dual use certainly would occur regularly and present a danger to public health and safety,"" Wolk said in a statement.

Xi is meeting with President Barack Obama during an Asia-Pacific economic summit. The two leaders spoke to reporters briefly before their meeting. Xi says the two are meeting at a ""hinge moment"" in the U.S.-China relationship. He says he hopes the two nations will focus on cooperation and managing their differences. Obama says the two nations have played a pivotal role in addressing climate change. He also says the two leaders are united in their opposition to North Korea's provocations, and they will intensify efforts to de-nuclearize the Korean Peninsula. Obama says he also expects a candid conversation on areas where the two leaders differ. ___ 4:45 p.m. President Barack Obama is praising Peru for its success in dramatically reducing poverty in recent years. So says the White House in a statement. The White House says Obama acknowledged the progress in a meeting with President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru. Peru is the host of an Asia-Pacific summit that Obama is attending. The White House says Obama and Kuczynski also affirmed commitments made by the two nations under a 2009 trade pact. In particular, they discussed steps Peru is taking to combat illegal logging. Peru is home to the second largest chunk of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil and a major focus of the fight against illegal logging. Under the terms of the U.S.-Peru free trade agreement, regulators have more tools to bring accountability to a timber industry whose exports are overwhelmingly illegal. ___ 4:20 p.m. The White House says President Barack Obama is urging world leaders to continue their work to advance a 12-nation trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Obama has failed in his efforts to get Congress to approve the agreement before he leaves office. President-elect Donald Trump made opposition to the pact a centerpiece of his campaign. As part of his final foreign trip, the president met with leaders of the 11 other nations participating in the TPP effort. The White House says Obama urged his counterparts to ensure that trade agreements work to reduce inequality. Obama is holding out hope that Trump will warm to trade deals once he's in office. Obama says TPP will level the playing field for American workers and advance America's interests in an economically dynamic and growing region. ___ 3 p.m. President Barack Obama is citing Chile, Peru and Columbia as examples of nations that are growing faster and doing better economically because of a new level of freedom and openness. Obama is speaking to about 1,000 young adults at a town hall-style gathering in Peru during the final foreign trip of his presidency. Obama was asked by one man from Venezuela about how to create a world that doesn't have to choose between peace and democracy. Obama says the evidence of recent decades suggests that countries that silence their critics go backward economically because they hide mistakes rather than solve them. He says countries with repressive governments ""rot from within."" Meanwhile, he says, freedom allows people to start businesses and organizations designed to improve society. ___ 2:50 p.m. President Barack Obama is trying to ease concerns in Latin America that his successor will stomp on trade deals. As he's done at many turns in his final trip abroad as president, Obama is asking foreigners to give Donald Trump a chance and not to assume he will upend U.S. policy. He told people at a town hall-style meeting in Peru on Saturday that there are likely to be new tensions over trade, given Trump's stance against the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other deals liberalizing commerce across borders. But he predicts that once Trump looks closely at trade in office, he'll see the benefits more than he does now. Obama says there could well be some modifications to trade deals. But he says he does not anticipate major change on U.S. policy on Latin America. ___ 1 p.m. President Barack Obama is emphasizing opportunities to create jobs as he meets with leaders of countries involved in a sweeping trade deal that is now in jeopardy. Obama is meeting in Peru with leaders from 11 countries that joined the U.S. to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The agreement appears unlikely to be ratified due to opposition by President-elect Donald Trump. Obama says the meeting is a good chance to talk about expanding prosperity. He didn't elaborate or discuss prospects for ratifying the deal as reporters were allowed in briefly for part of the meeting. Obama supports trade deals as a way to boost U.S. exports and create American jobs. But Trump criticized the Pacific agreement during the presidential campaign, saying such agreements hurt American workers. Democratic rival Hilary Clinton said she was against it, too. ___ 11:30 a.m. The White House is demanding an immediate halt to Syrian strikes on eastern Aleppo after the opposition's Aleppo Health Directorate said the bombings have put all hospitals there out of service. White House national security adviser Susan Rice says the U.S. is tracking those reports about health conditions. She says the U.S. condemns ""horrific attacks"" against hospitals and aid workers ""in the strongest possible terms. Rice says there's ""no excuse"" for the attacks. The White House is putting the onus on Russia to lower the violence and help humanitarian aid get to besieged Syrians. The White House says President Barack Obama joins other leaders in Europe and those gathering for an Asia economic summit in Peru over the weekend in demanding a halt to bombings. ___ 11:15 a.m. President Barack Obama is meeting with Peru's president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. The two leaders are sitting down on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific economic summit in Lima. They exchanged pleasantries but made no substantive remarks as reporters were allowed in briefly to witness the start of their meeting. Their meeting comes as leaders in Latin America are anxious about the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. He's vowed to take a hard line on immigration and his early selections for top advisers and Cabinet officials have reflected that expected approach. Obama plans to take questions from young leaders later Saturday in Lima. ___ 11 a.m. President Barack Obama will close a three-nation, post-U.S. election tour the same way he opened it. He wants to reassure world leaders that U.S. democracy isn't broken and everything will be fine when Donald Trump succeeds him next year. Obama is in Lima, Peru, at an annual Asia-Pacific summit. Global concerns about Trump's pending ascension to the world's most powerful office after a surprise win will be a key topic of discussion. The Trump issue overshadowed the president's interactions with world leaders earlier this week in Athens, Greece, and Berlin. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Rewrite the compact, says influential D.C. business group	" Almost everybody agrees Metro's governance structure and finances are broken. But almost nobody agrees about the best way to fix them. Metro Chairman Jack Evans favors a federal board to take over Metro. Other top officials said that would be hoisting a white flag of surrender. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) wants a regionwide sales tax to pay the bills. Maryland and Virginia say ""wait"" or ""no way."" Now the Federal City Council, an influential business and civic group led by former D.C. mayor Anthony A. Williams, has joined the debate with a plan to rally the region around a proposal to start all over again. The best way to fix the troubled transit agency is to blow it up, the council says. In an opinion article for Sunday's Washington Post, the council urges a rewriting of the Metro compact, or founding document. The amendments would shrink and professionalize Metro's board of directors, weaken union protections and require area governments to provide a reliable stream of funds. ""Without making extreme changes, we will perpetuate the degradation of the system, its safety and its benefit to the region,"" the article says. It was signed by two top area business executives, Robert J. Flanagan and W. Edward Walter. Flanagan is chairman of the Federal City Council, and Walter is its vice chairman.  [Federal takeover of Metro? Board chairman's proposal triggers debate but has some support.]   The proposal, issued after more than a year of study, serves as a guide to the structural problems that have contributed to Metro's troubles with safety, reliability, lack of maintenance and underinvestment. Previous studies also have identified these shortcomings, such as a lack of a dedicated tax or other funding source, and a board of directors struggling with split loyalties to Metro and to the jurisdictions that appointed them to the board. This reform effort may succeed where others have failed, because the council and Williams, its executive director, enjoy high regard throughout the region. Williams said in an interview that the council plans to solicit support from the region's employers, nonprofit organizations, transit advocates and others. ""We're out to build a coalition of the willing,"" Williams said. ""We hope and believe that by the time we finish, we'll represent a consensus of the broad leadership across the DMV,"" he said, using the initials for the District, Maryland and Virginia. But the initiative risks running aground on the same political shoals that sank earlier reform efforts. In particular, union-friendly politicians in the District and Maryland are likely to resist the council's proposal to drop the requirement that disputes over labor contracts be settled through binding arbitration. Such arbitration was put in the compact originally in exchange for unions' promise not to stage strikes. Critics say it has effectively guaranteed that labor costs rise with each round of negotiations. Separately, Republican state legislators in Virginia have vowed to oppose tax increases that might be needed to give Metro a dedicated source of revenue. Even Fairfax County's top Democrat, Board of Supervisors Chairman Sharon Bulova, said the failure of this month's referendum on levying a meals tax in Fairfax was a strong sign that county voters also would reject higher taxes to fund Metro.  [Region's leaders split over a 1-cent regional sales tax to pay for Metro.]  Finally, there's the perennial challenge of getting all four jurisdictions responsible for Metro -- the District, Maryland, Virginia and the federal government -- to agree on anything big. Divisions among their representatives on the Metro board have repeatedly stymied progress there. The Federal City Council has an unusual idea for breaking that impasse. It says the federal government ought to threaten to take over Metro temporarily by some specified date, perhaps in 12 months, if the city and the two states do not make the necessary reforms on their own. The prospect of a takeover serves as ""a sword or a heavy hand to come in and take the corrective action that you otherwise can't,"" Williams said.  ""If you can't come to a desired result, then you've got this kind of undesired alternative.""  But it isn't clear that Congress or the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump would go along. Area officials said they have no idea what attitude Trump would have toward Metro, or whether Congress would be willing to get involved. Trump has proposed a massive increase in spending on infrastructure, but much of the rest of the GOP would prefer to invest in roads rather than transit. Spokesmen for Bowser, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said they had not seen the full proposal from the Federal City Council and could not comment. But Bowser's office said the mayor would support revising the compact under certain conditions. ""Opening the compact is worth it as long as negotiations are focused on safety, reliability, adding the federal government as a financial partner, and securing a regional, dedicated funding source,"" said Bowser's chief of staff, John Falcicchio.  [Metro sank into crisis despite decades of warnings.]  Evans, the Metro chairman, was enthusiastic that Williams, who usually prefers to work behind the scenes, was becoming publicly involved. He cited Williams's experience in helping to rescue the District from its budget crisis in the 1990s. ""Tony is very well respected,"" said Evans, who also is a Democratic member of the D.C. Council, representing Ward 2. ""He was an architect of restructuring of the District's finances and governance. He would be a good ally in redoing the governance structure and financial structure of Metro."" The council echoed Evans's desire, expressed earlier, to reduce the number of Metro directors from 16 to make it easier to reach consensus. It also endorsed his proposal to fill the board with individuals who have professional experience in transportation or management, and who do not have divided responsibilities. ""There is a clear conflict between the roles of representing the jurisdiction and representing the [transit] authority -- it's real,"" said Emeka Moneme, the council's deputy executive director. Moneme, a former District transportation director and Metro board member, oversees the council's work on transit and infrastructure. Another Metro board member, Jim Corcoran, who also heads the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce, predicted that the proposal would get support from the region's business leaders. ""With a clear-cut and balanced presentation, I think the business community could certainly support changing the compact,"" Corcoran said. A wary note was struck by Roger Berliner, chairman of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. He has been helping to lead an effort to obtain regionwide agreement on a plan for dedicated funding to be submitted to the Maryland and Virginia legislatures in early 2018.  [In safety and reliability, Metro ranks in middle of pack of nation's big systems.]  Berliner, who also is a Democratic member of the Montgomery County Council, representing Potomac-Bethesda, was concerned that a debate over the compact would distract attention from the push for reliable revenue. ""To the extent that other issues are put on the table, it makes obtaining dedicated funding dicier,"" Berliner said.  Williams said it was necessary to correct Metro's unwieldy governance structure to assure area jurisdictions that taxpayer funds would be well spent. Once the region agreed to commit more money, he said, the Republican-controlled Congress might be persuaded to contribute funds as well.   He said that the proposal to weaken labor protections would not lead to massive job reductions but that unions needed to make concessions. ""We're not talking about firing a lot of people, but we do think that everybody's got to contribute,"" he said. Asked why he thought the Federal City Council's initiative could succeed where previous reform efforts have failed, Williams shrugged and said: ""It's a big, heavy lift, but we do heavy lift here. That's what we do."" "

The third-year pro said his protest before the game against the Chicago Bears was because he feels electing a reality television star to the highest office in the nation is ""not a good look for America.""  ""I don't want to disrespect the veterans or anything. The men and women that serve this country, I'm forever indebted to them. But the things that have been going on in America lately, I'm not going to stand for that,"" Evans said.  ""I told myself, 'If this character' -- I'm not big on politics or things like that -- but I told myself, 'If this happens, then America is not right right now,'"" Tampa Bay's leading receiver added. ""I said it a long time ago. When he ran I thought it was a joke. The joke continues."" COLLEGE FOOTBALL WACO, Texas -- Baylor quarterback Seth Russell will have surgery on his fractured left ankle. The school announced the decision but didn't say when the senior quarterback would have the surgery that will force him to miss the regular season. It is also expected to end his Baylor career, even though the Bears (6-3) are already bowl eligible. Russell suffered the gruesome injury in the third quarter of Baylor's 45-24 loss at Big 12-leading Oklahoma on Saturday. Russell has thrown for 2,126 yards and 20 touchdowns this season with eight interceptions, and also has 506 yards rushing with eight more scores. His 5,461 career yards passing is seventh in Baylor history, and his 60 TD passes rank third behind Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III (78) and Bryce Petty (62). Before the Bears lost their last three games, Russell had won his first 14 games as their starter. TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Alabama coach Nick Saban says he forgot about Election Day, not about voting. The top-ranked Crimson Tide's coach said he had an absentee ballot. The comment came in response to an unrelated question. On Wednesday, Saban responded to a question about the presidential election by saying that he ""didn't even know yesterday was Election Day."" He also added that, ""It was so important to me that I didn't even know it was happening. We're focused on other things here."" Saban says he never said he didn't vote but that his remarks got blown up into a big story. He says Tuesdays are the busiest day of the week for the coaches. Saban and Auburn's Gus Malzahn had filmed ads during the campaign season urging Alabama residents to vote. OLYMPICS DOHA, Qatar -- The IOC is backing Craig Reedie's bid for a new three-year term as president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, despite the tensions that broke out between the two sides over the Russian doping scandal. The support for Reedie to continue in his role came after he assured the International Olympic Committee that he would ""respect the rules and responsibilities of WADA and its stakeholders,"" suggesting the agency will refrain in the future from publicly calling for a nation to be barred from the Olympics, as it did with Russia before the games in Rio de Janeiro. Reedie, a Briton who has been WADA president since 2013, is up for re-election at agency meetings in Glasgow, Scotland, next weekend. No other candidates have been put forward. The backing for Reedie was contained in a letter from the IOC to all of its 98 members. A copy of the letter was obtained by The Associated Press. SOCCER JUBA, South Sudan -- Gunmen attacked a bus carrying players and officials of one of South Sudan's top-flight soccer clubs, killing the driver and injuring six others. The Confederation of African Football says the Young Stars team was traveling from the capital Juba back to their hometown of Torit when the attack happened. CAF says the club chairman was among the injured. It says the gunmen were unidentified. The Young Stars were going home after losing in the South Sudan Cup final. CAF says the bus attack followed an attack on a bar in Juba, where gunmen opened fire on people watching a soccer game on TV, killing 11. South Sudan has been in a near-constant state of civil war since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011. MOSCOW -- Russia's national soccer team is often attacked for poor performances, but players will be paying special attention to their latest critic. With the 2018 World Cup hosts struggling on the field, Vladimir Putin isn't amused. The Russian president said ""to be honest, we haven't seen beautiful play from the national team for a long time."" Speaking two days after Russia lost 2-1 to Qatar in a friendly, Putin's remarks were reported by state news agencies on Saturday. Russia has won just one of its last 10 games and crashed out of this summer's European Championship without winning a game. Despite all this, the team has been set a target of reaching the semifinals in 2018. Russia's next game is a friendly against Romania on Tuesday in Grozny, the capital of the Russian region of Chechnya. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Besides vowing to rip up the international nuclear deal with Iran, Trump says he will ramp up the war on Islamic State militants; he could make the Palestinians more desperate by siding with Israel's hard-line right wing. He also seems set to end the Obama administration's cold shoulder toward authoritarians like Egypt's Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. Trump has most often been vague and sometimes outright contradictory about plans in the Mideast. And his stances could change. His call for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. worried many in the region, but he has since watered down that stance, and many opinion-makers in the Gulf at least call it simply campaign rhetoric. Overall, Trump has shown a focus on fighting Islamic militants and favoring strongmen who do so. He's shown less concern with human rights or the complicated minutiae of the Mideast's many factions and interests. That is a simpler, black-and-white stance in the eyes of some, but it can also bring a backlash. ISLAMIC STATE, IRAQ AND SYRIA Trump pledged repeatedly to intensify the war against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, saying crushing the group is his main priority. What is less clear is how -- and what impact it would have on the conflicts in both countries and the complex alliances that the Obama administration has tried to balance. Trump has given little policy or vision on the wars beyond the vows to defeat IS. In Syria, the rebels may be the biggest losers. In contrast to the Obama administration's support for the opposition -- equivocal as it may have been -- Trump said the rebels may be ""worse"" than President Bashar Assad and that defeating the Islamic State group is more important than removing the Syrian leader. That suggests he could drop any backing. Moreover, he says he wants more and better cooperation against IS with Russia, Assad's main ally. Trump says he will step up airstrikes, vowing to ""bomb the hell"" out of the militants. He has criticized the slow pace of the fight and at one point called for up to 30,000 U.S. troops to be deployed in Iraq -- six times the current level. He later seemed to back down, saying ""few troops"" would be needed. More intensified bombing, however, risks a backlash if it brings more civilian casualties. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has already come under fire from political rivals over the presence of a few thousand U.S. troops in Iraq. IS may already be broken in Iraq and cornered in Syria before Trump takes office in January. Over the past year, the Obama administration's campaign of airstrikes, along with training on the ground, has succeeded in helping Iraqi and Kurdish forces take back most territory IS captured in 2014. They are currently assaulting the group's last main Iraqi stronghold, Mosul. In Syria, if Trump allies with Russia against IS, it could also bring a major shift away from U.S. support of the rebels. The Obama administration's attempts to work closer with Russia fell apart because of Moscow's bombardment of rebels; Trump appears likely to drop any U.S. complaints over the Russian campaign. Like Obama, Trump views the Syria war mainly through the lens of fighting IS. But the conflicts are intertwined. Turning away from the opposition could anger Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have vowed to oust Assad and back the rebels -- and are potential spoilers in any conflict. Trump will also face the same struggle Obama has: Balancing between Turkey and its bitter rival, the Syrian Kurds, who have been the main U.S.-backed ground force fighting IS. Turkish and Kurdish forces battled earlier this year in northern Syria -- a flare-up that was put down by U.S. mediation. ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS Trump appears much more sympathetic to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than to the Palestinians. That bodes poorly for the Palestinian dream of gaining independence after 50 years of Israeli occupation, and has led to some warnings that they might grow so desperate as to turn to a full-fledged violent uprising. While Netanyahu spent the past eight years clashing with Obama over Israeli settlement construction and the deadlock in peace efforts, Trump has expressed great affinity for Netanyahu and called Obama a ""disaster"" for the Jewish state. He has vowed not to impose any solutions on Israel and promised to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, a step that would undercut the Palestinian claims to the eastern part of the city. His opposition to the nuclear deal with Iran and promises to veto anti-Israel resolutions at the U.N. also resonate in Jerusalem. In addition, he has surrounded himself with advisers close to Israel's hard-line right wing. Among them are Newt Gingrich; former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani; the former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., John Bolton; and conservative billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a close friend of Netanyahu's. Gingrich has called the Palestinians an ""invented"" people. Giuliani recently recommended that Trump abandon the U.S. goal of establishing a Palestinian state as part of a peace accord. The Republican platform makes no mention of Palestinian statehood, an idea even Netanyahu has endorsed. The pro-settler politicians who dominate Netanyahu's Cabinet have warmly welcomed Trump's win. Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett called it an opportunity to drop the idea of Palestinian statehood. Still, the unpredictable Trump also raised some concerns in Israel during the campaign by suggesting he would stay ""neutral"" on the conflict and that Israel should repay the billions of dollars of military aid it receives from the U.S. The Palestinians are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Officials had been hoping that if Clinton had won, Obama would have used his final months in office to deliver a policy statement or promote a U.N. resolution setting the stage for his successor to press ahead with peace efforts. With Trump's victory, the chances seem remote. Foreign Minister Riad Malki said the Palestinians ""still don't know the policies of President-elect Trump"" but hoped ""he will push to realize the two-state solution."" EGYPT Trump and Egypt's el-Sissi have already shown a bond. Trump said there was ""good chemistry"" when they met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September. El-Sissi said Trump ""without a doubt"" would make a strong leader. It's clear where the common ground is. El-Sissi has painted himself as a leader in the fight against Islamic militancy, a stance that echoes Trump's priorities. The result could be closer ties after the chill between el-Sissi and Obama. As commander of the military, el-Sissi led the 2013 ouster of Egypt's first freely elected president, Islamist Mohammed Morsi, amid widespread protests against him and his Muslim Brotherhood. The Obama administration voiced some criticism of the ouster and briefly suspended some aid. It has kept its distance ever since, especially as el-Sissi's government has cracked down heavily on its opponents. Trump is less likely to take Egypt to task over human rights. Instead, he could throw el-Sissi political support as the Egyptian leader battles IS-linked militants in Sinai and Libya. Egypt's pro-government media have often railed against Obama, accusing the U.S. of supporting the Brotherhood and activist groups. They now were cheering Trump's victory.  ""There will be a big shift in the Egyptian-American relations under this man's era. You will see,"" said one pro-el-Sissi TV host, Ahmed Moussa. ___ Associated Press writers Sarah El Deeb in Beirut; Susannah George in Irbil, Iraq; George Jahn in Vienna; Josef Federman in Jerusalem; and Hamza Hendawi and Maggie Michael in Cairo contributed to this report.

The government did not link the exercises to Donald Trump's U.S. presidential victory but the announcement of maneuvers and tactical exercises across the country came nearly simultaneously with Trump's surprise win. It is the seventh time Cuba has held what it calls the Bastion Strategic Exercise, often in response to points of high tension with the United States. The first exercise was launched in 1980 after the election of Ronald Reagan as U.S. president, according to an official history. Trump has promised to reverse President Barack Obama's reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba and the ongoing normalization of the relationship between the two countries.     Around the globe, right-wing leaders reacted to the victory of Republican President-elect Donald Trump with joy, while some expats and politicians expressed dismay and anxiety for international relations. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)    [World gasps in collective disbelief following Trump's election]  An announcement by Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces in red ink across the top of the front page of the country's main newspaper said the army, Interior Ministry and other forces would be conducting maneuvers and different types of tactical exercises from the 16th to the 20th of November. It warned citizens that the exercises would include ""movements of troops and war materiel, overflights and explosions in the cases where they're required."" News of Trump's victory hit hard among ordinary people and experts in U.S. relations with Cuba, which has spent the last two years negotiating normalization after more than 50 years of Cold War hostility. Normalization has set off a tourism boom and visits by hundreds of executives from the U.S. and dozens of other nations newly interested in doing business on the island. Trump has promised to reverse Obama's opening unless President Raul Castro agrees to more political freedom on the island, a concession considered a virtual impossibility.  [27 years after the Berlin Wall fell, Europe wakes up to a U.S. president-elect promising one of his own]  Speaking of Cuba's leaders, Communist Party member and noted economist and political scientist Esteban Morales told the Telesur network: ""They must be worried because I think this represents a new chapter."" Carlos Alzugaray, a political scientist and retired Cuban diplomat, said a Trump victory could please some hard-liners in the Cuban leadership who worried that Cuba was moving too close to the United States too quickly.  ""There's been a lot of rejection of what's been done with Obama,"" Alzugaray said. ""Many Cubans think that a situation of confrontation is better for the revolution."" Many Cubans said they feared that a Trump victory would mean losing the few improvements they had seen in their lives thanks to the post-detente tourism boom.  ""The little we've advanced, if he reverses it, it hurts us,"" taxi driver Oriel Iglesias Garcia said. ""You know tourism will go down. If Donald Trump wins and turns everything back it's really bad for us."" "

Spanish officials say the games originally scheduled for next year in the northeastern region of Tarragona will now be held in 2018 from June 22-July 1. The decision was made to give organizers and officials more time to get the event properly funded. Spain endured 10 months of political impasse following two inconclusive elections, hurting the government's ability to approve budgets. The political deadlock ended last month but Tarragona Mayor Josep Felix Ballesteros said this week the lack of a stable government ""hindered the financing that had been originally planned"" for the event. It will be the 18th edition of the Mediterranean Games, with about 4,000 competitors from 26 countries. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: RALEIGH, N.C.--Ayana McAllister went to Hillary Clinton's rally two weekends ago at St. Augustine's University, the historically-black school where she's a freshman. She watched the Democratic nominee speak alongside the mothers of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland. But on the eve of the election, the 18-year-old is still not 100 percent sold. ""I don't know,"" said McAllister, a native of Largo, Md. ""I feel like I've got to settle for Hillary. I feel like I'm going to vote because I know I need to, not because I want to. I feel like neither of them should be president, but I feel like Hillary will be better. Really, it's like two children arguing back and forth."" This was a common refrain during interviews at yesterday's football game here between St. Augustine and crosstown rival Shaw University, another historically-black institution.  -- Early voting numbers and polling suggest that African American turnout is down nationally this year compared to 2012 and 2008. Though there are some signs that the gap has been closing in recent days, alarm bells have clearly gone off inside the Clinton high command. -- Many students at the schools here in Raleigh regret that they never got to vote for Barack Obama. They are collectively disappointed that their first time forces them to choose between Clinton and Donald Trump, but they plan to vote nonetheless. In fact, teachers have told them that in lieu of class they will march to the polls on Tuesday. ""I am not a fan of either one, but of the two I will probably be voting for Hillary,"" said Anoviua Rush, a freshman from Durham. ""She's just a liar. And Hillary is not even good at backing up her lies. Everyone makes mistakes, but when you try to cover them up it's a problem."" As a marching band performed behind her, under a cloudless sky on a perfect fall day, Rush explained that the prospect of electing the first woman president does not motivate her, but Clinton's support for equal pay legislation does. ""She's more understanding of minorities and what we go through,"" said Rush. ""I'm not going to say he's 'racist,' but he's said some messed up stuff about minorities. ... Donald's main focus seems to be helping the wealthy and, I'll say it, possibly Caucasians."" -- ""A lot of people are very discouraged. Very, very discouraged,"" said Felishia McPherson, 47, who was wearing a ""Black Lives Matter"" t-shirt. ""Really, it's like you're choosing between a liar and a clown. But who doesn't lie? We all lie. ... I'm a mental health counselor. I know that, psychologically, in order to want to be president, you've got to be a little narcissistic to start with. ... Trump was never an option for me. I don't love Hillary, but I don't have to. She's not coming to my house. She's going to the White House."" McPherson already voted early for Clinton. She brought her seven-year-old niece Malia, named after the president's daughter, to Obama's rally in Fayetteville on Friday. ""I don't know if I actually believe in the political system, as far as does my one vote count? But I'm not going to take a chance of it not counting,"" she explained afterward. ""If the system really does work, then I'm going to participate. If it doesn't, then I still did the best I could by my ancestors. ... I do believe, with Obama's encouragement, even though we may not believe in the system, we know we need to do it."" -- Several elderly African Americans expressed deep concern that millennials, including their grandchildren, do not sufficiently appreciate the importance of voting. Irene Hill-Thomas, 79, is a retired special education teacher who now spends most of her time volunteering at church and a food pantry in Sampson County. ""If you've been around long enough, your eyes are open,"" she said. ""You appreciate it because you fought for it. The younger generation hasn't been there. They don't know. The younger generation doesn't understand there was a time when we had to sit at the back of the bus and had no say so. ... I remember the white and the colored fountains. They don't.""    North Carolina Central University student Naje Gibson votes early at the Durham County Board of Elections. (D.L. Anderson/For The Post)   -- North Carolina was the closest state Obama won in 2008 and the closest state he lost in 2012. African Americans accounted for 23 percent of the electorate both times, and Obama won almost all of them. Reflecting the importance of the 15 electoral votes up for grabs in North Carolina, and the strategic significance of the Research Triangle specifically, both candidates will return to Raleigh on Monday. Trump will give an afternoon speech at the state fairgrounds, and Clinton will hold the final rally of her campaign here -- at midnight. -- Another very important explanation for why African American turnout is down in North Carolina: Republicans have worked to limit early voting locations and hours. The executive director of the state Republican Party persuaded GOP county officials to limit early voting in troubling emails that have been unearthed by public records requests. He pushed to limit the number of hours sites were open, especially evenings and Sundays, when many African Americans typically cast ballots (after church services). In the Democratic-leaning county that includes Greensboro - the state's third largest - there were 16 early voting sites in 2012 during the first week that polls were open. This year there was just one. So while 61,000 people voted during the first week four years ago, only 8,000 did this year. (After that first week, 25 voting sites were opened and turnout records were broken.)    Andrea Vogler, a canvasser for Working America, knocks doors in Raleigh on Saturday. (James Hohmann)   -- I shadowed a field staffer from the AFL-CIO affiliate group Working America as she canvassed in a predominantly black section of Raleigh yesterday afternoon. Walking across lawns in a hilly neighborhood just off Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Andrea Vogler urged folks to go vote. During a period of just one hour, though, half a dozen African Americans separately complained that they tried to vote early but the lines were too long. So they came home. They all said they hope to still go on Tuesday, but what if the lines are long then too? Will they stick around? A woman in a nurse's uniform said she went by the early voting site three times over the past week, but the lines were too long each time. A younger man named Victor came to his door in red-checkered pajamas. He had gone earlier in the day too but said he was too tired to stand around. He works a night shift, so he said he's going to try voting on his drive home from work at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday - which he hopes will be before a crowd forms. ""I've heard that on a couple of different days now,"" Vogler, 32, lamented as she walked to the next house. ""On the one hand, it is good people are trying to vote. On the other, I hope it doesn't deter anyone from actually voting."" A woman named Barbara, pulling out of her driveway in a Chevy Trailblazer with her infant son in the backseat, is one of the people who gave up when she saw the lines. Damien, her husband, was who Vogler had come to talk with. Barbara warned her that he was sleeping. But every vote counts, so the canvasser went to knock on the door anyway. He was nonplussed. ""I worked all damn night, 12 hours,"" he said, his eyes bloodshot. ""I just want to go back to my bed."" She tried to hand him a piece of paper with bullet points on why he should vote for Clinton. He grimaced and refused to take it. Working America has about 700 field staffers farmed out across nine states. They have had 573,400 conversations with voters since launching this summer, including 45,500 in North Carolina. In the Raleigh area alone, the labor group had seven vans with five to seven people in each hitting doors on Saturday. The group largely targets African American and Latino voters, though some swing white Republicans are in their universe. An older man sitting in his green Chevy Lumina, picking his teeth with a toothpick outside a row of ground-level studio apartments, told Vogler that he planned to vote later in the afternoon. She informed him that early voting had ended for the day, and that Saturday was the final opportunity until Tuesday. ""Damn,"" he replied. ""North Carolina is the most important state,"" Vogler stressed over and over again. ""You've got to get out to vote!""    Deborah Ross speaks to volunteers at a field office in Greenville on Friday. (Jonathan Drake/Reuters)   -- In an interview late last night, I asked Democratic Senate candidate Deborah Ross - who is in a neck-and-neck race with Sen. Richard Burr that may decide which party controls the majority - about all these people who said they did not vote early because of the lines. ""It's by design,"" she complained. But she argued that this will also galvanize many African Americans on Tuesday. ""I don't think anything is going to keep people from voting this year,"" she said. Ross, a former state representative who sponsored 2007 legislation allowing for same-day voter registration (which was pivotal to Obama carrying the state a year later), noted that, for every person who returned home when they saw the crowded early voting sites, many more waited around. ""There were people who stood for hours in line,"" she said. The weather forecast for Tuesday looks good, and she believes this might make the difference in her ""razor thin"" race. ""I think we're going to see long lines on Election Day,"" Ross predicted, with a southern twang. ""We're going to turn people out."" A Clinton campaign official, speaking anonymously, said they were worried during the first week of early voting, but the fact that hundreds of additional sites wound up opening for the second week made the situation much better and led to a huge increase in turnout. But allies say Clinton may need to perform especially well on Election Day to offset votes that were lost over the past two weeks. Surrogates have also streamed into the state to drive African Americans to the polls. Civil rights icon John Lewis headlined a march in Charlotte on Thursday. Cory Booker came Friday night. Other efforts are underway too. The national president of the Sierra Club was outside the St. Augustine's football game handing out biscuits from Bojangles' and urging young people to support Clinton in order to advance environmental issues.    Barack Obama at Fayetteville State University on Friday. (Gerry Broome/AP)   -- The president himself has now spoken at five rallies for Clinton in North Carolina. Addressing a crowd of 2,500 that was probably 95 percent black in Fayetteville on Friday, he made a very explicit pitch. ""Right now, Donald Trump is calling on his supporters to monitor 'certain areas' on Election Day,"" Obama said. ""I don't know what 'certain areas' he's talking about, but you do."" He finished his speech with the story of a 100-year-old woman who was purged from the North Carolina voter rolls after a Republican challenged her registration status on flimsy grounds. Grace Bell Hardison was mentioned in an NAACP lawsuit that prompted a federal judge to issue an injunction on Friday. North Carolina election officials are now scrambling to restore the rights of thousands of voters - most black and Democratic -- who had been cut from the rolls under a so-called ""individual challenge law."" ""So, young people, I want you to understand this,"" Obama said. ""It wasn't that long ago when folks had to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar (or) the number of bubbles on a bar of soap. It wasn't that long ago folks were beaten trying to register voters in Mississippi. ... If you've been marching for criminal justice reform, that's great. But you still need to vote! ... If you vote, we'll win North Carolina. And if we win North Carolina, Hillary Clinton will be president.""    Welcome to a special Sunday edition of The Daily 202.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Trump was rushed offstage during a campaign rally in Reno last night after a man reportedly yelled ""gun,"" but the GOP nominee emerged back onstage after a brief period to finish his speech. Secret Service officials said agents apprehended the man but found no weapon. The man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites, 33, was reportedly released after the event, telling reporters that he was attacked for holding a ""Republicans against Trump"" sign. ""When I pulled out the sign, people around me were trying to grab the sign,"" Crites said. ""And so all that was occurring was booing, of course. That's what you would expect."" He said that the crowd tackled him, and began ""kicking me and grabbing me in the crotch and just, just beating the crap out of me."" (Jose A. DelReal, Anne Gearan and Ed O'Keefe have more.) -- Donald Trump Jr. and top campaign social media aide Dan Scavino immediately retweeted unsubstantiated claims that Trump had just survived an attack on his life: ""Hillary ran away from the rain today. Trump is back onstage minutes after assassination attempt,"" the tweet read. -- Meanwhile, a man wearing a mask and carrying a gun was arrested near the White House following a struggle with authorities. Immediate details surrounding the incident are unclear, but the Secret Service says he's being charged with carrying a firearm without a license, carrying unregistered ammunition, resisting arrest and committing a crime while wearing a mask. (Martin Weil) -- A press bus following Tim Kaine in Tampa was hit ""at high speed"" on Sunday evening, according to several people onboard. One reporter said the bus was hit by what appeared to be a police car. But there were no reports of injuries and the bus continued. Kaine was several cars ahead of the press bus, according to reporters in his motorcade.    Hillary Clinton visits an early voting location in West Miami on Saturday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   POLLING ROUNDUP: -- Our WaPo/ABC News tracking poll finds Clinton leading Trump nationally by five points -- 48 percent to 43 percent -- widening last week's tight race as she shows clear advantages on several personal attributes:  On questions of character, Clinton leads Trump in four out of five categories. Voters prefer her personality and temperament (58-32) and her qualifications (55-36). She also leads on questions of which candidate has a better understanding of the ""problems of people like you"" and is seen as having stronger morals. Enthusiasm for each candidate remains about equal, though many Trump voters continue to see their vote as a referendum on Clinton. 55 percent of Clinton backers say they're voting for the Democratic nominee to support her candidacy, while more Trump voters say they're supporting him mainly because they oppose Clinton.  -- The Wall Street Journal/NBC poll finds Clinton up a similar four points (44-40). Clinton's lead is less than half of the 11-point advantage she held in their mid-October survey, taken before the FBI email announcement. A wide swath of Trump's support also comes from within his own party, as Republican voters rally around the nominee in the final stretch of the campaign. -- A Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll shows Trump with a seven point lead in IOWA, up three points from last month. -- A Columbus Dispatch poll shows Clinton eking out a single point lead over Trump in OHIO (48-47).

Clinton tomorrow: Pittsburgh; Grand Rapids, Philadelphia, Raleigh.  -- What's with the 11th-hour fluidity? Karen Tumulty and Dan Balz note that four states have dominated the Clinton campaign's calculation throughout the fall: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. ""Obama won those four in 2008 and all of them but North Carolina in 2012. Until recently, it appeared that Trump needed to sweep all four to overcome Clinton's electoral-map advantage. But as the race has tightened, Ohio seems to have moved into the Republican column, and other states outside those four have potentially come into play. The GOP nominee is looking to states including Michigan (and) New Hampshire ... to make up a potential deficit, should he not win Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. ... In Trump's case, it is an effort to grab what he considers emerging opportunities in the sprint for the finish line; in Clinton's, as insurance against surprises Tuesday in territory she has considered hers."" (The Post's politics team lists the 15 states that will decide the election on Tuesday, breaking down the state of the race in each one.)  -- Why is Michigan getting so much late attention? Hillary campaigned in Detroit on Friday, and she's coming back to Grand Rapids tomorrow while Barack Obama flies to Ann Arbor. Bill is stumping in Lansing at 1 p.m. today.

Stephen Neuman, a senior adviser to the Democratic coordinated campaign in Michigan, noted that the campaign already has 35 offices.

Ron Johnson gaggle yesterday in Mosinee, Wis. (Scott Bauer/AP)   -- Trump seems to have given up on Wisconsin.

The Republican nominee earlier this week scheduled a Sunday afternoon rally in West Allis, just outside Milwaukee. It was to be Trump's sixth Wisconsin event since he lost the state's primary election. 'We don't know if it's scheduled firm or not yet, but I intend to do it if he's here,' Ryan told reporters Saturday when asked if he would attend the Trump rally. ...

""Much of his last-minute appeals have been in tiny burgs like Selma, N.C., population 6,000. His foray into Northern Virginia appears to be a bid to hold down Clinton's margins in a region that, excluding the exurbs, leans heavily Democratic."" -- Bigger picture: Trump's schedule belies the biggest challenge facing him right now. It's not clear where and how he would win. ""Of all of [Trump's must-win] states, the only one where Mr. Trump has really been close in the polls is Nevada,"" writes The Upshot's Nate Cohn. ""But Nevada is also the state where we know the most about the results because of early voting, and it hasn't brought good news for Mr. Trump. ... Perhaps Mr. Trump will mount a huge comeback in Nevada on Election Day. Or maybe Democrats are much weaker among registered Democrats or unaffiliated voters than most analysts believe. But if Mrs. Clinton does indeed have a big advantage in Nevada, then his chances start looking very bleak: He's at a disadvantage in the polls of all of the other states that could put him over the top. What's more, it's not really clear where he has his best chance -- something reflected in Mr. Trump's unfocused pre-election push.""

And if she wins on Tuesday, the most telling test of Mrs. Clinton's transition back to power will arrive quickly: After a campaign season often defined by voters' weariness with and distrust of her, which old hands will -- or should -- follow her into the Oval Office? Almost no top adviser has been left untouched by the two central firestorms of Mrs. Clinton's candidacy: the inquiry into her use of a private email server ... and the WikiLeaks hack of [campaign chairman John Podesta]. The unvarnished view of infighting in the stolen documents is unlikely to bother Mrs. Clinton much, friends say. The political wisdom of importing excess baggage to the executive branch is another matter.""    First Lady Michelle Obama addresses the Democratic National Convention on July 25. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)   -- Boston Globe A1, ""9 moments that molded the campaign,"" by Matt Viser and Annie Linskey: ""When planning the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, Clinton campaign officials didn't initially include Michelle Obama as a featured speaker, according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans. ... For Clinton's campaign, it made sense to put her on the rostrum on the tumultuous opening day -- when Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were both to speak. 'We thought it would be hard for Sanders' people to boo Michelle Obama,' said the person, who isn't authorized to talk about the first lady's deliberations."" Another revelation: The Trump campaign was warned months in advance to be ready for Clinton's attack over Alicia Machado but did nothing. -- New Yorker, ""Meet Maya Harris, Hillary Clinton's Progressive Link,"" by Emily Greenhouse: ""To speak with those who have worked with Harris is to be bulldozed with superlatives. Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, who worked with Harris recently on the Democratic Party platform, told me that 'she lives her life on a moral crusade on all of those justice issues ... She carries her peeps, our peeps, with her in everything she does.' Beyond policy, Harris seems to offer, in her very person, solutions to some of Clinton's image problems.""    Trump and his wife Melania Trump speak during a campaign event in Wilmington. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   THE DAILY DONALD: -- The owners of the National Enquirer reportedly paid to shield Trump from allegations of a former Playboy model who claims they had an affair, paying $150,000 for rights to her story before declining to publish it. From the Wall Street Journal's Joe Palazzolo, Michael Rothfeld and Lukas I. Alpert: ""The tabloid-newspaper publisher reached an agreement in early August with Karen McDougal, the 1998 Playmate of the Year. American Media Inc., which owns the Enquirer, hasn't published anything about what she has told friends was a consensual romantic relationship she had with Mr. Trump in 2006. At the time, Mr. Trump was married to his current wife, Melania. Quashing stories that way is known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.' In a written statement, the company said it wasn't buying Ms. McDougal's story for $150,000, but rather two years' worth of her fitness columns and magazine covers as well as exclusive life rights to any relationship she has had with a then-married man."" Trump and American Media Owner CEO David Pecker are longtime friends. -- Melania stumped alongside her husband in North Carolina, calling him a ""compassionate, giving ... loving"" man, she said, who ""cares so deeply about this country.""

To persecuted journalists in Burundi, it amounts to 'a total loss of dignity.' The government-scripted press of Beijing diagnoses 'an empire moving downhill.' And the spin doctors of the Kremlin see cause for pure and unambiguous delight. The U.S. presidential election -- America's quadrennial chance to showcase for the world how democracy works in the most powerful nation on Earth -- has become instead an object lesson in everything that ails a country long seen as a beacon of freedom and hope. People in small and distant countries who count on the U.S. to stand up for democratic values have been astonished to see essential components ... trammeled. Long-standing allies have been left to wonder ... whether the U.S. can be relied on when it counts. And even though the campaign still has days to go -- with the outcome very much in doubt -- the damage to American moral standing may already be done."" Quote du jour: ""America always spoke to Arab countries as if they had so much to learn,"" said a 27-year-old Beirut cafe worker, who says he has been closely watching the election ever since he read about Trump's sexual assault boasts. ""And now we see their own democracy involves choosing between a woman from a dynasty and a man who says the system is manipulated. If that's democracy, then we don't want it."" -- The New York Times' Farah Stockman and Nick Corasaniti explore how this loss of luster could affect the American brand: ""In interviews, Americans who travel overseas and foreign observers say that tourists who once felt themselves the envy of the world now feel the sting of embarrassment. Businesses that once marketed their jeans and fleece jackets internationally as tiny pieces of the American dream are being advised to revamp their ad campaigns."" An Australian public relations consultant noted that state lawmakers in Sydney recently adopted a resolution - by unanimous consent - describing Trump as ""a revolting slug"" unfit for office.  THE PUNDITS WEIGH IN: -- The idea that Tuesday will end our partisan rancor is a ""naive fantasy,"" writes Frank Bruni:""There's no end here, just a punctuation mark, a measly comma between the rancor that has built until this point and the fury to come. And there's no way to un-see what all of us have seen over these last 18 months, to bottle up what has been un-bottled. Election Day will redeem and settle nothing, not this time around. Whether balloons fall on [Clinton] or [Trump], there will be bolder divisions in America than there were at the start of it all and even less faith in the country's most important institutions ... Even putting Trump's angry troops aside, it feels as if we're coming out of this election with four parties: the Paul Ryan Republicans, the Freedom Caucus, the establishment Democrats and the Elizabeth Warren/Bernie Sanders brigade ... Meet the new paralysis, same as the old paralysis. Potentially, worse. From elections past, I don't recognize this terrain. How can I assume that it's navigable?"" -- ""If [Trump] loses, the party faces a daunting reconstruction challenge,"" says conservative columnist Peter Wehner, who served in the Bush and Reagan administrations: ""Policies that promote economic growth, social mobility and greater opportunity are important. But in some respects the party's stance [here] is a secondary priority. Republicans need to wrestle with more fundamental questions first: Will their party choose as its leaders people who respect democratic institutions and traditions, or not; who conceive of America as a welcoming society or as one that is racially and religiously closed ... who abhor ignorance or embrace it? In a post-Trump world, Republicans need to ask themselves if their party will be characterized by its aspirations or its resentments. Can it make its own inner peace with living in an increasingly diverse and nonwhite America? Does it conceive of its role as tamping down or inflaming ugly passions? Does it believe in a just social order or not? The next few months will tell us a lot about whether Mr. Trump and Trumpism were an anomaly or are now the new norm of the party that Lincoln helped create."" -- ""When historians write about this bizarre, ugly and dispiriting campaign ... the epic dark saga will unfold this way: A man, filled with fear and insecurity, created a hatemongering character and followed it out the window. And a woman, filled with fear and insecurity, hunkered down and repeated bad patterns rather than reimagining herself in an open, bold way,"" Maureen Dowd writes. ""Before he jumped into the presidential race, Trump was seen as bombastic, vulgar, a bit of a buffoon and a cave man, but [also] 'a cheeky brio.' He was not regarded as a bigot or demagogue. He was seen as a playboy, not a predator ... But he created another character for the Republican primaries, playing to the feral instincts of angry voters, encouraging violence at his rallies, hatred toward journalists and disrespect for democracy itself. 'He's so used to playing a role in different areas of his life,' said [TV personality] Donny Deutsch ... 'He saw the crowd's adulation and it drove him. He started to get the biggest cheers for saying the most offensive things.'"" -- The New Yorker's Jeffrey Toobin dubbed this election ""Clinton investigation mania, part two"": ""Bill Clinton's Presidency was defined, for the most part, by criminal and congressional investigations,"" he writes. ""The subjects of those probes sound like entries in a nineteen-nineties time capsule: Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate ... It may be that Republicans spent so much time in pursuit of Bill Clinton's scalp because things were mostly going well otherwise. The economy boomed, and the nation was at peace. So Congress took a vacation from its responsibilities to investigate a decade-old Arkansas land deal in which the Clintons lost money. But real dangers abound in the unstable world of today. The economy is only tenuously prosperous. And a warming planet, notwithstanding the lack of interest among debate moderators, threatens apocalyptic change. A politics based on pursuit and accusation, rather than on reason and compromise, will address none of these problems. And the prospect of four years of governance that resemble the last days of this campaign is one that would drive anyone to drink."" FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARDS: -- ""Averting the worst starts with electing Hillary Clinton,"" says the New York Times' Editorial Board. ""For many voters that will mean defying Republican efforts to jam the electoral machinery through lies, legal obstructions and the threat of violence. We hope the voters hold out, however intimidating the process and long the lines. For Americans who may feel unmoved or unwilling to vote for Mrs. Clinton, here is a question from the future: In 2016 we were closer than ever to electing an ignorant and reckless tyrant -- what did you do to stop him? There's no sense complaining anymore. The hurricane is three days from landfall. The urgent thing now is to avert the worst, minimize the damage, save the foundations, clear the mess."" -- ""The Wall Street Journal hasn't endorsed a presidential candidate since 1928, and if we didn't endorse Ronald Reagan we aren't about to revive the practice for Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump,"" the Journal's board declares. ""A broken Washington needs to be shaken up and refocused on the public good, and who better to do it than an outsider beholden to neither political party? If only that reform possibility didn't arrive as a flawed personality who has few convictions and knows little about the world.""

The new West Coast Model is higher taxes on the rich, higher spending by the state and wide-scale efforts to lift the working poor. ...

Villages recaptured from ISIS over the past three weeks ... have been honeycombed with tunnels, many of them booby-trapped. In the past three days, commanders say Iraqi forces have faced the hardest fighting of the offensive as they entered Mosul, made worse by extensive tunnels that are allowing ISIS fighters to appear seemingly out of nowhere, attack, then retreat to the hidden bunkers. An Iraqi armored commander who drove his Abrams tank into eastern Mosul recalled seeing dozens of fighters scrambling on the street in front of his guns. 'Then they disappeared,' he said. Into the ground. 'It's like we are fighting two wars in two cities,' said Col. Falah Al-Obaidi of the Iraqi counterterror forces.

Heck and former state attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto have slugged it out in the most expensive Senate race in this state's history, locked in a tight contest that gives Republicans a chance to steal a Democratic crown jewel: the seat of Senate Minority Leader [Harry Reid].
