Not so near the District.	 WHILE WASHINGTON-AREA leaders duck, dodge and squabble about how to fix and fund Metro, localities elsewhere that rely on transit have taken matters into their own hands. In cities and regions across the country, voters last week approved about three dozen ballot measures to increase their own taxes to raise a staggering $170 billion for an array of train, subway, light-rail and bus projects.  Alone among major American transit systems, Metro lacks just such an earmarked funding source, depending instead on the kindness of its governing jurisdictions, the District, Maryland and Virginia. Leaders in those places may be fickle, or politically evasive, or, in the case of the two states, less beholden to Metro's ridership than they are to exurban and rural residents far from the Washington suburbs. Forward-thinking officials have pressed for an earmarked, ongoing funding source to undergird Metro for decades, to no avail. Every year, Metro must go to its funders, hat in hand, and hope for the best. Unshockingly, the result has not been the best; Metro is in bad shape. The region, having failed even to provide effective safety oversight, has ceded that role for the time being to the feds. It would be nice to think that Washington-area leaders might learn from voters and responsible local officials nationally. From liberal states such as California, New Jersey and Oregon to conservative ones such as Indiana, South Carolina and Georgia, they proposed and passed higher sales taxes, income taxes and property taxes, in addition to the usual bond issues earmarked for transit projects. Many of the taxes-for-transit ballot measures passed by overwhelming margins, often in the range of 2-to-1. In the case of California, which requires a two-thirds majority to approve such proposals, even the proposals that failed still gained clear majorities. But while Metro badly needs long-term, reliable funding, the political obstacles are overwhelming. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's (D) proposal this fall for a sales tax surcharge, dedicated to funding Metro in the District and surrounding localities, fell on deaf ears. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) gave the idea the brushoff before softening slightly. In Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) let it be known that the timing was not right, especially given what would probably be blanket opposition from Republicans who control the legislature in Richmond. Even projections that Metro's continued deterioration will cost area governments as much as $2 billion annually in lost revenue have failed to focus leaders on the magnitude of the threat. Metro plans to improve safety and reliability first, then ask for more funding. That strategy may also be doomed in the absence of more sweeping structural reforms within Metro -- specifically, a better governing structure than the existing, highly political board, and more flexibility to implement reforms than current labor contracts allow. In the end, it may take the credible threat of a federal takeover to shake regional leaders from their lethargy and get this region's passengers the transit service they need and deserve.

Russia urged the General Assembly's human rights committee to vote against the resolution, but it was approved by a vote of 73-23 with 76 abstentions. The resolution is virtually certain to be adopted by a similar vote when it comes before the 193-member assembly next month. The draft resolution condemns abuses and discrimination ""against the residents of the temporarily occupied Crimea, including the Crimean Tatars."" The Crimean Tatars are a Turkic ethnic group that formed in the Crimean Peninsula in the 13th-17th centuries. Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014 following the ouster of Ukraine's former Moscow-friendly president after months of protests -- a move that led to crippling Western sanctions. A pro-Russia insurgency erupted in eastern Ukraine the following month. A February 2015 agreement has helped reduce fighting between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces, but frequent clashes have erupted and efforts to reach a political settlement have stalled. The draft resolution urges Russia to immediately end all abuses against Crimea residents including ""arbitrary detentions, torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, and to revoke all discriminatory legislation."" It calls on Russia to release Ukrainians who were illegally detained, and to allow cultural and religious institutions to reopen. And it urges Russia to immediately revoke the Supreme Court's Sept. 29 decision declaring the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, the self-governing body of the Crimean Tatars, an extremist organization and banning it. Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya told the committee before the vote that the resolution's main goal ""is to ensure that Russia fully complies with its obligations as an occupying power.""  ""After Russia occupied Crimea, the human rights situation has deteriorated sharply with extra judicial killings, intimidation, arbitrary detentions, torture and abuses to the freedom of expression,"" Kyslytsya said. Anatoly Viktorov, who heads the Russian Foreign Ministry department dealing with human rights, called the resolution ""politically motivated,"" saying the people of Crimea ""chose to vote in a historic referendum to reunite with Russia.""  ""The draft is one-sided,"" he said. ""It completely ignores the negative impact that the actions of Ukrainian authorities have had on the residents of Crimea."" Viktorov said ""Crimean residents have all the means of judicial protection that are accorded to Russian citizens"" and the same human rights. But rights groups have raised concerns over freedom of speech and association in Crimea. Local authorities have banned at least two Crimean Tatar leaders from entering the peninsula, shut down Crimean Tatar media outlets, and prohibited peaceful gatherings. U.S. deputy ambassador Sarah Mendelson said ""Russia wants to make sure only one voice is heard in Crimea -- Russia's.""  ""States should not have to fear that a neighbor, however powerful, will seize their territory,"" she said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Rep. Andy Harris says he can fix that.	" Maryland's sole GOP member of Congress says he is determined to make sure that House Republicans stay faithful to conservative policies, even as they welcome the populist presidency of Donald Trump. Rep. Andy Harris is running for chairman of the House Republicans' think tank, a caucus known as the Republican Study Committee, which considers itself the last line of defense for those who worry that Trump could compromise conservative values. The election on Thursday comes as Republicans strategize about how to leverage their White House victory as well as majorities in the House and Senate, and Trump supporters such as Harris, 59, jockey for a seat at the table. Harris, a member of both the RSC and the more hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus, said the relationships he has formed over three terms representing the rural Eastern Shore in Congress make him the right person to unite House Republicans. ""The fact of the matter is for years the RSC was the conservative voice on the Hill,"" he said in an interview. ""Under the best circumstances, two years from now, no one perceives the need for the Freedom Caucus."" Six past chairmen of the RSC and the current chairman, Rep. Bill Flores (Tex.), are backing Harris for the two-year post over freshman Rep. Mark Walker (N.C.) -- a show of support that might be more reassuring had the nation not just elected a president backed by virtually none of the political establishment. Harris, an anesthesiologist who specializes in obstetrics, was the first member of Congress to endorse retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson during the Republican primaries. Both men are social conservatives who spent part of their careers at Johns Hopkins University. Both eventually embraced Trump. A military veteran, father of five and grandfather of four, Harris spent 12 years as a conservative contrarian in the Democratic-controlled Maryland legislature before he was elected to represent the state's rural, conservative Eastern Shore in Congress. He planned to run for RSC chair two years ago but withdrew from consideration when his wife died suddenly. Harris was one of the last holdouts during the 2013 government shutdown, continuing to vote against a proposed spending plan even as federal workers -- in Maryland and elsewhere -- endured a 16-day furlough. He had a high-profile spat with the District over marijuana in 2014, when he led the opposition to legal pot shops in the nation's capital. He has likened the proliferation of medical pot to telling patients to chew on mold instead of taking penicillin.  ""I'm sorry that in contradiction to the best new medical evidence that states decide to go ahead and approve recreational marijuana which has proven to be incredibly detrimental to developing brains,"" he said of votes in California, Massachusetts, Nevada and Maine last week to approve recreational marijuana. ""I think we should very, very carefully consider the expansion of what has to be considered a dangerous drug."" The congressman is also determined to fight D.C. efforts to achieve statehood -- even though voters in the city overwhelmingly approved a statehood referendum last week. ""I still think founders got it right in making a federal enclave that is not a state,"" Harris said. ""Go back and read the Federalist Papers that deal with it. . . . People have a choice. They can move to any of the other 50 states."" During the interview, Harris displayed the type of loyalty that he would bring to the RSC when asked to weigh in on criticism that Trump's new chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is a racist, an anti-Semite and a white nationalist. In his answer, Harris invoked the debate over mandated insurance coverage of birth control, which he has compared with the government burning churches in his mother's native Ukraine.  ""The postelection rhetoric has been pretty hot,"" he said. ""It's very interesting that the same people who would be very willing to deny religious freedom to people who hold deeply held religious beliefs on certain issues all the sudden want to criticize others with very little evidence. That's pretty hypocritical, if you ask me."" Turning to the economy, Harris said his top priority is reducing the deficit, which debt hawks say could be a challenge if Trump pushes a big infrastructure bill at the same time he tries to cut taxes. Harris said that he sees no conflict and that he expects Trump's plan to rely on private funding and tax credits, unlike what he describes as the Democrats' deficit-busting stimulus bill. He noted that the president-elect is emphasizing expanding military installations and creating jobs, focuses that are popular on the Eastern Shore. ""Large parts of my district really do look like the parts of America that supported Donald Trump and gave him his electoral college victory,"" Harris said. ""His message of 'Make America Great Again' resonated with large portions of this country."" "

Bruce Rauner's administration and the state's largest public-employees union are hopelessly deadlocked, a state board ruled Tuesday in a decision that could allow the Republican to impose his terms and the union to go on strike. The Illinois Labor Relations Board declared Rauner's negotiations with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees' state council at impasse. Once made official in writing, it allows Rauner to unilaterally execute his terms on the 38,000-member union, including a four-year wage freeze, according to the union. Rauner's office says his plan saves $3 billion. AFSCME plans to appeal the decision in court. The board overturned an administrative law judge's ruling last month that indicated there were some areas where the two sides could continue negotiating.  ""The governor is trying to force state workers to accept his unfair terms or go out on strike,"" AFSCME executive director Roberta Lynch said in a prepared statement. ""Rauner's path of conflict and confrontation is unfair to workers and wrong for the people of Illinois."" The union, which has never walked a picket line in its 45-year history, has disputed Rauner's claim of impasse since administration representatives left the bargaining table in January. The last contract expired in June 2015, about six months after Rauner, a private equity investor whose campaign featured anti-union remarks, took office. The union says Rauner wants to impose a four-year wage freeze and require employees to pay 100 percent more for health insurance. Highly sensitive to privatization of government work, AFSCME also maintains that Rauner wants to eliminate ""standards that prevent unaccountable outsourcing of public service."" Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly called the decision ""fair for taxpayers and state employees.""  ""The state can now implement its contract, saving the taxpayers more than $3 billion over four years,"" Kelly said, noting it's the same deal the administration has OK'd with 18 smaller state-worker unions. It ""includes merit pay for the vast majority of AFSCME employees and the same 40-hour work week requirement that applies to most employees outside state government."" The state panel of the Labor Relations Board is appointed by the governor, but only two members have taken their posts under Rauner. The other three were appointed by Democratic predecessors. ___ Contact Political Writer John O'Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor .

Swift passage underscored broad support on Capitol Hill for punishing financial backers of the Syrian government and maintaining economic pressure on Tehran. Both bills had the firm backing of Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the panel's top Democrat. The Senate must now act on the legislation before the bills can be sent to the president. Lawmakers have accused the Assad government of war crimes as the number of people killed during the violence in Syria continues to mount. The war, now in its sixth year, has killed as many as half a million people, contributed to Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II and given the Islamic State group room to grow into a global terror threat.  ""What we have now is a grim lesson in human suffering,"" Royce said. ""We can see the ethnic cleansing going on. Even the United Nations calls this 'crimes of historic proportions.' Enough's enough."" The Syria legislation targets key backers of Assad such as Russia and Iran, according to Royce, by requiring the president to sanction countries or companies that do business with or provide financing to the Syrian government or the Central Bank of Syria. Anyone that provides aircraft to Syria's commercial airlines, does business with the transportation and telecom sectors controlled by the Syrian government, or supports the country's energy industry also would be subject to sanctions, according to the legislation.  ""If you're acting as a lifeline to the Assad regime, you risk getting caught up in the net of our sanctions,"" Engel said. Sanctions could be suspended if internationally recognized negotiations to resolve the war in Syria are making progress and the violence against civilians has ended, according the legislation. The White House and State Department had previously argued to Congress that new sanctions legislation could undermine efforts with Russia to forge a cease-fire between Assad and rebel groups. While the Russia talks have collapsed, the administration maintained concerns that the sanctions might hurt Iran, another Assad supporter, giving Tehran an excuse to renege on the U.S.-brokered nuclear deal. The House bill would authorize the State Department to assist in the collection and preservation of evidence for war crimes trials. Secretary of State John Kerry last month called for a war crimes investigation of Russia and Syria, a move that escalated already heated rhetoric against Moscow for its part in a deadly military offensive in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, and its longstanding support of Assad. The Syria legislation, formally titled the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, is named after a crime scene photographer for the Syrian military who was reassigned to photograph the bodies of imprisoned Syrian rebels and dissidents after the conflict began. He later defected, and his archive of images of more than 10,000 bodies was smuggled out of the country. He went by the pseudonym Caesar, and he testified in disguise in July 2014 year before Foreign Affairs Committee, saying he had witnessed a ""genocidal massacre."" The Iran Sanctions Extensions Act cleared the House by a 419-1 vote. The lone ""no"" vote came from Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who is often an unconventional vote. The bill's backers say extending the law allows the U.S. to punish Tehran should the country fail to live up the terms of the landmark nuclear deal reached last year. In exchange for Tehran rolling back its nuclear program, the U.S. and other world powers agreed to suspend wide-ranging oil, trade and financial sanctions that had choked the Iranian economy.  ""Now is not the time to ease up on the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism,"" said Rep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J. ""Sanctions work."" The act, first passed by Congress in 1996 and renewed several times since then, expires at the end of the year. The bill approved by the House extends the law by 10 years, to 2026. There is widespread support in the Senate for passing the extension. Kerry signaled earlier this year President Barack Obama would sign the renewal bill. ___ Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rplardner Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway insists that Bannon isn't as scary as people say. But Bannon isn't likely to put those fears to rest anytime soon. As a conservative media brawler, Bannon has discarded norms for discussing race, gender and religion, often framing even abstract political fights in deliberately inflammatory terms. Bannon was born into a Norfolk, Virginia, family of Catholic Democrats, and served in the U.S. Navy and attended Harvard Business School. He worked for Goldman Sachs and started a media-focused boutique investment banking firm. Under his leadership the news site Breitbart became a platform for the ""alt-right,"" a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. ___ 6:15 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump has called New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key to pass on his sympathies for the powerful earthquake that killed two people. Key's office described the conversation on Wednesday as ""very warm and cordial."" The magnitude-7.8 quake that struck on Monday has left hundreds of tourists stranded in the coastal town of Kaikoura after landslides blocked off roads. The military is evacuating people in helicopters. Trump had tried to get in touch earlier in the week but Key had missed the call in the confusion after the quake. Key's office said in a statement that he had congratulated Trump on his election win. The leaders also discussed the New Zealand economy, trade, and the relationship between the two nations, which they agreed was in great shape. ___ 6:10 p.m. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has been one of Donald Trump's strongest critics, once comparing the choice between Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican primary as the difference between being poisoned and shot. But now that Trump's president-elect, Graham is looking for common ground. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Graham said ""count me in"" on infrastructure improvements, more military spending, conservative Supreme Court picks and repealing and replacing President Barack Obama's health care law. Though he says the last one will be ""harder than we all think."" He did appear to express concerns about Trump's relationship with Russia, and said his Senate panel would hold a series of hearings on that country's role in the world. Graham said: ""They are a bad actor in the world, they need to be reined in."" ___ 6:05 p.m. Some of the GOP's biggest donors and fundraisers will be leading president-elect Donald Trump's presidential inaugural committee. Trump's transition team announced Tuesday that investor Tom Barrack will serve as the committee's chairman. The finance co-chairs include Lew Eisenberg, who ran the Republican National Committee's joint fundraising operations with the Trump campaign. The committee's vice chairs include a host of the GOP's biggest donors, including casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Anthony Scaramucci, Mel Sembler, and casino developers Phil Ruffin and Steve Wynn. The group is responsible for planning and paying for the activities surrounding Trump's inauguration. ___ 5:45 p.m. Sen. Ted Cruz is meeting with President-elect Donald Trump in New York. Cruz and Trump have had a tortured relationship since the Republican presidential primary. Cruz derided Trump during the primary as a ""pathological liar"" and ""serial philanderer"" but came around in September and endorsed him. But even then the senator from Texas said the decision to back Trump was ""agonizing."" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said in a statement Tuesday that Cruz was ""pleased"" to have the chance to meet with Trump and he looked forward to assisting the Trump administration. Trump angered Cruz in the primaries by insulting his wife and suggesting, without evidence, that his Cuban-born father could have been linked to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. ___ 4:45 p.m. Outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid says President-elect Donald Trump should rescind Stephen Bannon's appointment as a top White House aide. Reid says that ""as long as a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office, it would be impossible to take Trump's efforts to heal the nation seriously."" Reid made the comment in a Senate floor speech. He joins a growing chorus of Democrats calling on Trump to get rid of Bannon, whose Breitbart website aligns with white nationalist ideologies. Reid said Trump's election had ""sparked a wave of hate crimes."" Nonetheless he said Democrats ""want to work with Mr. Trump when we can."" Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn then stood and remarked that ""we used to call people like that sore losers."" ___ 4:30 p.m. For nearly the entire week since he became president-elect, Donald Trump has been holed up in his gilded New York skyscraper. A steady stream of visitors has come to him, flooding through metal detectors and getting whisked up to Trump's offices and penthouse residence. It's good preparation for the insular, security-shrouded bubble that awaits Trump at the White House. Unlike President Barack Obama, who flew commercial and lived in a dingy Washington apartment within about a year of taking office, Trump has already spent decades living an unusually cloistered life. While Obama often bemoans his inability to take a walk or enjoy a meal at a sidewalk cafe, Trump doesn't appear to have much of an affinity for either. ___ 3:15 p.m. A leading Republican voice on national security matters says any attempt by the incoming Trump administration to reset relations with Russia would be ""unacceptable."" In a statement Tuesday, Sen. John McCain of Arizona says the price of starting anew with Moscow would be U.S. complicity in the ""butchery of the Syrian people"" being carried out by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. President-elect Donald Trump and Putin spoke by telephone Monday about future efforts to improve U.S.-Russian ties. Trump said in a statement that he is looking forward to having a ""strong and enduring relationship with Russia."" McCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman, dismissed Putin as a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny and murdered his political rivals and threatened U.S. allies. ___ 2:30 p.m. Former President George W. Bush says ""anger shouldn't drive policy"" and is defending encouraging global trade through pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement. Bush spoke Tuesday at a Dallas institute named for him. He said he'd refrain from criticizing President-elect Donald Trump and other White House successors. But he suggested that anger and frustration helped decide last week's presidential election and shouldn't shape future policy. Instead, he said policy should be influenced by ""what's best for the people who are angry."" Bush defended the trade agreement, which Trump has sharply criticized. Bush said expanded trade helped close wage gaps while benefiting Mexico, Canada and the U.S. ___ 2:20 p.m. French President Francois Hollande is suggesting he doesn't believe that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would throw out the Iran nuclear accord. Trump has called the accord the world's ""worst deal."" Hollande said in an interview with three French news outlets that Europe must start assuring its own security. The French president said ""Europe doesn't do enough,"" and that he's told his colleagues across the continent that they ""must take charge"" of Europe's defense. Hollande asked rhetorically whether ""the United States can, with Donald Trump, throw this accord into question? I don't think so."" ___ 2:06 p.m. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson will not be taking a position in President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Carson business manager Armstrong Williams tells The Associated Press that Carson has opted out of being considered for any cabinet or other administration positions, including leading the Department of Health & Human Services and the Department of education. Carson had never been officially offered a role in the Trump administration, but Williams says the president-elect had made clear he wanted his former rival-turned-adviser in some role. But he says Carson ""always knew that he could be more effective with the president-elect outside the administration."" ___ 1:40 p.m. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he intends to remain as governor but would consider a Trump administration post if offered. Christie spoke Tuesday on WPG talk radio from the Republican Governors Association conference in Florida. Christie says he has ""every intention"" of staying on as governor until 2018 when his term ends. Christie chaired President-elect Donald Trump's transition team until he was made vice chairman last week. He says he told Trump that if he is asked to serve he would consider a position in the administration. Christie was among the earliest backers of Trump, lending his vocal support soon after the businessman's New Hampshire primary victory. Trump's victory comes after the nearly six-week George Washington Bridge lane-closure trial in which two of Christie's former allies were convicted. ___ 1:35 p.m. A majority of D.C. Council members believe the city should spend less money on a reviewing stand for President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural parade than it did for President Barack Obama's inauguration four years ago. Three members of the left-leaning Council argued at a breakfast meeting Tuesday morning that the city shouldn't build a stand at all. Independent Council member Elissa Silverman says the city shouldn't celebrate Trump's inauguration because his policy proposals are ""hostile to our residents."" Other members said not building a stand would be disrespectful. Four years ago, the city spent nearly $350,000 on a heated, enclosed reviewing stand in front of City Hall. Democratic Council Chairman Phil Mendelson says he will suggest to Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser that the stand be ""less extravagant."" ___ 11:00 a.m. A Pentagon spokesman says President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has not yet contacted the Pentagon to arrange for briefings or meetings. The spokesman, Gordon Trowbridge, said that under Defense Secretary Ash Carter's direction, the Pentagon has prepared briefing materials to be made available to Trump transition officials. On Monday, Carter said a Trump transition team was expected at the Pentagon ""sometime this week."" The president-elect has not yet announced who he intends to nominate to be secretary of defense. ___ 9:50 a.m. Coordination between the White House and President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is on hold until Trump's team signs a key document. The process was put on hold after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was replaced as Trump's transition chairman by Mike Pence. The vice president-elect has yet to sign a memorandum of understanding facilitating interactions between transition officials and Obama administration officials. Responding to questions about the transition, White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said the White House is working with Trump's team to get the document signed. She said the Obama administration is ready to provide access to government personnel and resources to help Trump's team get ready to take over in January. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(all times local): 4:50 p.m. North Dakota's governor is criticizing a potential delay in completion of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Gov. Jack Dalrymple said Tuesday that an additional delay ""does nothing but prolong and intensify the public safety issues imposed on Morton County and the state of North Dakota since the beginning of August,"" when protests against the pipeline broke out. On Monday, the Army Corps of Engineers called for more study and input from the Standing Rock Sioux before it decides whether to allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The tribe says the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. In his statement, Dalrymple says a decision on the project easement ""is long overdue."" He says the pipeline would be safe. ___ 3:40 p.m. Environmental attorney and Waterkeeper Alliance President Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is joining the protest against the Dakota Access oil pipeline, saying it's important to ""the future of humanity."" The alliance seeks to protect watersheds worldwide. The Standing Rock Sioux believes the 1,200-mile pipeline that's to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to Illinois could harm drinking water. Kennedy on Tuesday visited the main protest camp, which is near the Missouri River in southern North Dakota. The pipeline route goes under the river, which is the source of the tribe's drinking water. Kennedy's visit came on a day when pipeline demonstrations were held across the country. Kennedy says the $3.8 billion pipeline will benefit billionaires, not the American people. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners says the pipeline is safe. ___ 2:10 p.m. Twenty-eight protesters against the Dakota Access oil pipeline were arrested west of Mandan, North Dakota, during a day in which activists held demonstrations nationwide. Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller says about 400 protesters put a pickup truck and tree branches on BNSF Railway tracks Tuesday near a pipeline work staging area. The railroad says trains were delayed three hours. Officers in riot gear used pepper spray and in one instance a stun gun against protesters who refused to leave. Activists called for demonstrations at Army Corps of Engineers offices and at banks financing the pipeline construction. Protests were reported across the country, from California to Vermont. The $3.8 billion pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil to a shipping point in Illinois. Opponents worry it will harm the environment. ___ 11:45 a.m. Hundreds of protesters against the Dakota Access oil pipeline gathered outside a work staging area west of Mandan, North Dakota, and disrupted freight train traffic. Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller says protesters on Tuesday morning put a pickup truck and tree branches on BNSF Railway tracks. It wasn't immediately clear how many trains were affected. Officers in riot gear responded. There were no immediate reports of arrests. Mandan is about 50 miles north of a camp where hundreds of protesters have gathered in recent months to oppose the $3.8 billion pipeline that's to carry North Dakota oil to a shipping point in Illinois. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was slated to visit the camp later Tuesday. He's an environmental attorney and president of Waterkeeper Alliance, which seeks to protect watersheds worldwide. ___ 10:55 a.m. The company building the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline is seeking a federal court's permission to lay pipe under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota and finish the four-state project. The Army Corps of Engineers called Monday for more study and input from the Standing Rock Sioux before it decides whether to allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The tribe says the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners and a subsidiary are asking U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., to confirm the company has the legal right to proceed. The Corps in July granted ETP the permits needed for the crossing, but it said in September that further analysis was warranted given tribal concerns. ETP says additional delay amounts to politic interference. ___ 8:40 a.m. The company building the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline is denouncing a decision by the Army Corps of Engineers to delay an easement to cross a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren said in a statement Monday that the decision is ""motivated purely by politics at the expense of a company that has done nothing but play by the rules."" The Corps wants more studies and tribal input before it decides whether to allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The Standing Rock Sioux says the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. Protests have been ongoing for months. ETP says it will ""vigorously pursue its legal rights."" The 1,200-mile pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois is largely complete outside of the river crossing. ___ 8 a.m. The Standing Rock Sioux chairman says the decision by the Army Corps of Engineers to delay an easement for the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline indicates protests against the project are succeeding. The Corps said Monday it needs more studies and tribal input before it can decide whether to allow the oil pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. The tribe says the pipeline would threaten drinking water and cultural sites. Protests against its construction have been ongoing for months. Chairman Dave Archambault said in a statement that the Corps' decision is encouraging and shows the demonstrations are bringing the tribe's concerns to light. An industry group supporting the pipeline criticized the Corps' decision. The MAIN Coalition called it an attempt at ""death by delay."" ___ 6:15 a.m. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is slated to join protesters of the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota. Also Tuesday, activists have called for demonstrators to protest at Army Corps of Engineers offices and offices of banks that are financing the pipeline project. The protesters want President Barack Obama to permanently halt the construction of the $3.8 billion pipeline. Kennedy is an environmental attorney and president of the New York-based Waterkeeper Alliance, which seeks to protect watersheds worldwide. The pipeline is to run beneath a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota that provides drinking water to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which says the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. The pipeline would deliver oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/13/hillary-clintons-historically-horrible-week/	Hillary Clinton’s historically horrible week	"   Hillary and Bill Clinton (EPA/OLIVIER DOULIERY / POOL)  Losing is one thing.  Losing when you are absolutely certain you are going to win is another -- and  far, far worse. Hillary Clinton lost the presidency on Tuesday, a race she, her campaign and virtually everyone else in the political world expected her to win. After all, she raised more money. And she used that money edge to run more TV ads in swing states and build top-tier organizations in them too.  Polling -- nationally and in swing states -- showed Clinton ahead of Donald Trump. Then she lost. It was a slow-motion collapse for Clinton.  Tuesday dawned full of optimism for her campaign as early voting in places like Florida and Nevada suggested that her vaunted organization was paying dividends.  Early exit polling passed around the political world in the mid-afternoon suggested her campaign was on track to win a solid -- and potentially large-scale -- victory. But, as night fell and more votes began to be counted, it became increasingly clear that Clinton's seemingly-unstoppable march to the nomination had been slowed if not halted altogether. Ohio fell to Trump -- by a surprisingly large margin. Then, in quick succession, Florida and North Carolina went to Trump. The map, which just a few hours before had looked so impenetrable for Trump, started to crack open. Pennsylvania went to Trump, the first time a Republican had won the state since 1988.  Then Wisconsin did too -- breaking a 32-year winless streak in the state for the GOP. By 2 am Wednesday morning, it was clear that Clinton was going to lose.  But it wasn't Clinton who spoke to her increasingly-distraught supporters in New York City. It was campaign chairman John Podesta, whose name had been in the news -- and not in a good way -- for the last few weeks as a subject of the WikiLeaks hack. Clinton eventually acknowledged the obvious Wednesday morning in a New York City hotel that doubled as a morgue for her political ambitions.  Campaign staff packed the room and struggled to show a smile amid a disaster made all the worse because they just hadn't seen it coming. ""This is painful, and it will be for a long time,"" Clinton admitted. She then delivered a moving tribute to resilience -- that in life you get knocked down but you need to just keep getting up. ""I've had successes and setbacks and sometimes painful ones,"" Clinton said. ""Many of you are at the beginning of your professional, public, and political careers -- you will have successes and setbacks too. This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it."" It was an inspiring message, yes. But also an acknowledgment by Clinton that she likely had been knocked down -- in the political arena -- for the last time.  This was the sad coda of the career of one of the most accomplished women of her generation (or maybe any generation).  Clinton's career ended with a whimper, not a bang -- a susurrus made all the more sad by its unexpectedness."

Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!""  ""We are fighting for every citizen that believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests,"" the billionaire real estate developer promised exuberant supporters at his last campaign rally in Manchester, N.H. But just days later, there is little evidence that the president-elect is seeking to restrain wealthy interests from having access to and influence in his administration. It's not just corporate lobbyists who are playing early, visible roles in the new power structure. Some of Trump's biggest political donors are shaping the incoming administration, including Rebekah Mercer, a daughter of billionaire Robert Mercer, who is figuring prominently in behind-the-scenes discussions, according to people familiar with the transition. Mercer is among four major donors appointed by Trump on Friday to a 16-person executive committee overseeing his transition. The others are campaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin, New York financier Anthony Scaramucci and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel.     During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in the District and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   Meanwhile, top campaign fundraisers and a raft of lobbyists tied to some of the country's wealthiest industries have been put in charge of hiring and planning for specific federal agencies. They include J. Steven Hart, chairman of the law and lobbying shop Williams & Jensen; Michael McKenna, an energy company lobbyist who is overseeing planning for the Energy Department; and Dallas fundraiser Ray Washburne, was has been tapped to oversee the Commerce Department. Billionaires who served as Trump's policy advisers, such as Oklahoma oil executive Harold Hamm, are under consideration for Cabinet positions. And Trump is still working to fashion ethical guardrails that would wall him off from his sprawling real estate empire. On Friday, the Trump Organization said it was focused on identifying how to ""immediately transfer"" management to his three oldest children -- an arrangement government ethics experts said was fraught with conflicts, particularly since his children are also helping oversee the transition. Meredith McGehee, who heads policy and strategy for Issue One, a bipartisan group that aims to reduce the influence of wealthy interests on politics, said there is ""tremendous dissonance"" between Trump's rhetoric and early actions. ""Much of what he said was, 'I'm going to change the game,' "" she said. ""Of all of his messages, that one I think clearly resonated the strongest. That's going to be incredibly difficult when the people you bring in are the experts at making the game work for them."" Trump aides and transition officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment about what role donors and lobbyists will play in the administration.     The Post's Marc Fisher explains how some of President-elect Donald Trump's traits could inform his leadership style when he takes office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)    [Pence replaces Christie as leader of Trump transition effort]  In the few days since Trump's surprise win, Washington's lobbying industry -- which largely eschewed his candidacy -- has clamored for a spot in the incoming administration. The transition team, which is scrambling to make 4,000 political appointments in less than three months, has welcomed lobbyists' involvement and expertise, according to people familiar with the operation. ""Every presidential candidate at one time or another runs against Washington,"" said energy lobbyist Scott H. Segal. ""But the last thing in the world any newly elected president wants to do is go into complicated issues with blinders on. As a result, they look to people as advisers and implementers that have a full understanding of the subject matter they are supposed to address."" The courting started before Election Day, when trade association representatives and lobbyists were invited to transition policy developments sessions. Lobbyists were solicited to give as much as $5,000 to finance the transition, a fundraising effort that accelerated last week as the team seeks to collect about $3 million more to hit a $5 million budget, according to a person familiar with the situation. Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, president of BGR Public Relations, said ""all the Washington regulars"" participated in the policy meetings, but he added that such access is no guarantee Trump will take his cues from K Street. ""Just because a transition task force makes a recommendation doesn't mean that Donald Trump will follow it,"" he said. Still, the prominence of established Washington figures and wealthy donors comes as a jarring contrast to Trump's unequivocal rhetoric on the campaign trail, when he decried inside-the-Beltway denizens as ""corrupt."" Ari Fleischer, who served as President George W. Bush's press secretary, said the policy decisions Trump makes in the early days will directly reflect on his credibility. ""The transition affords him an opportunity to show he's going to govern consistent with the promises he made,"" Fleischer said. ""If you are a reformer and you genuinely want to change the system, you ban people who you say you're going to ban. Anything less starts to represent compromise."" Michael Toner, who served as general counsel to the Bush-Cheney transition in 2000, said the 10 weeks after the election is a key period for establishing broad ethical policies that will govern the incoming administration. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to take several specific actions regarding lobbyists, including prohibiting White House and congressional officials from lobbying for five years after they leave government service. But his transition team has already rolled back some of the restrictions on lobbyists that Barack Obama established for his transition operation in 2008. Among the rules that have been discarded: a ban on lobbyists from contributing financially to the transition and a prohibition on lobbyists working on the transition from overseeing any fields of policy on which they had lobbied in the previous year. Several prominent lobbyists are overseeing the staffing of departments in which their clients have a direct interest, including energy adviser Michael Catanzaro, a partner at the lobbying firm CGCN, who has represented oil services giant Halliburton, Koch Industries and the petrochemical and refining association American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. The Trump team is putting some limits on lobbyists, according to a person with knowledge of the transition. As in past years, those working on the transition have agreed not to lobby any federal agencies they helped staff for a certain period of time. However, the length of the ban is unclear. Obama prohibited such lobbying for a year. It also remains unclear whether the new president will dole out plum appointments -- such as ambassadorships -- to major donors, a practice embraced by his predecessors, including Obama and Bush. While Trump has repeatedly proclaimed his independence from wealthy donors, at least 330 supporters contributed $100,000 or more to his campaign, the Republican National Committee and pro-Trump super PACs, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal campaign finance reports. Trump's biggest backers gave millions, including casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam ($11.2 million); Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus ($7.6 million); wrestling magnate Linda McMahon ($6 million); Robert Mercer ($3.4 million); and poultry executive Ronald Cameron and his wife, Nina ($2.9 million). Together, the top 100 donors donated $82 million to support his bid, with strong support from the finance, gambling and real estate industries.  [Trump's conflicts of interest are without precedent in American presidential history]  Another major uncertainty: how Trump will wall himself off from his private company, which has interests around the globe. On disclosure filings, Trump listed involvements in more than 500 companies, some in countries where the United States has sensitive diplomatic or financial relationships, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China. Trump companies are partially indebted to banks in Germany and China. On Friday, Amanda Miller, vice president of marketing for the Trump Organization, said in a statement that the company was still ""vetting various structures with the goal of the immediate transfer of management of The Trump Organization and its portfolio of businesses to Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump along with a team of highly skilled executives."" ""This is a top priority at the Organization and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations,"" she added. But ethics experts said putting Trump's children in charge of his empire would not distance the new president from his assets or avoid conflicts of interest. ""In a real blind trust, an independent trustee who has no connection to the beneficiary is appointed to manage the assets in the trust, and that trustee is supposed to be the only one who knows what is being done in the blind trust,"" said Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21, a government watchdog group. Campaign finance lawyer Trevor Potter, who drafted ethics agreements for 2008 GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and other officials, said Trump's business interests pose unprecedented conflicts of interest. ""Never in history have we had someone become president with the range of business interests -- domestic and international -- that Trump has,"" he said.  Robert Costa, Drew Harwell, Catherine Ho, Anu Narayanswamy and Elise Viebeck contributed to this report. "

Now Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the latest in Egypt's string of military officers-turned-presidents, has had to do the unthinkable to rescue the tanking economy of the Arab world's most populous nation. The currency has been floated freely for the first time and subsidies are being substantially cut. Prices have jolted upward as the Egyptian pound plunged in value and, overnight, fuel and gasoline became more expensive. The measures, carried out hours apart on Nov. 2. have caused panic among a population where poverty, unemployment and inflation are already high. At the same time, his government is keeping the iron grip it has held the past two years, curtailing freedoms, giving security forces a free rein, jailing thousands and managing a media machine that demonizes dissidents. The question is how long el-Sissi can keep a lid on discontent while, it is hoped, reforms bring economic growth that will ease the pain. Already, some voices are calling for political reforms as well. On Friday, Egypt received its reward for the painful shock therapy measures when the International Monetary Fund approved a $12 billion bailout package, including an immediate first installment of $2.75 billion. The hope is that the bailout plus reforms will salvage state finances and signal to international investors to start putting money back into the country. The same day gave a sign of the firm security hand. Calls for protests against the economic measures fizzled, with almost no one turning out in the streets. For days ahead of time, police had warned of harsh measures against anyone heeding the calls, which officials blamed on the banned Muslim Brotherhood. But analysts warn that a popular backlash can still come.  ""People are angry and frustrated over the rise in prices, but there is no leadership to organize protests. People cannot just take to the streets,"" said Khaled Dawoud, spokesman for the Democratic Alliance, an umbrella of six small left-center parties.  ""But you cannot rule out something happening out of the blue given the widespread anger."" About 40 percent of Egypt's 92 million people live under or hover just above the poverty line -- making them vulnerable to even small price hikes. Even before the measures, prices were going up on staples, electricity, and water. Now the Egyptian pound, which traded at 8.8 to the dollar before the flotation, is at around 17 to the dollar. On everyone's mind are bread riots that erupted in 1977 and forced then-President Anwar Sadat to back off his attempt to cut subsidies. El-Sissi and his government have promised programs to cushion the impact, including shifting from general subsidies to cash help directed at the poor and greater steps to ensure only the needy receive subsidized goods.  ""What is required now ... is to liberate the political environment in parallel with the freeing of the economy from its shackles,"" political scientist Ahmed Abd Rabbou said in a column this week in the independent Al-Shorouq daily. There is little sign of that happening. During the 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak, the millions who took to the streets chanted for a new social contract: Bread, human dignity and social justice. Instead, the country was mired in crisis, first under nearly 17 months of direct military rule and later with an elected Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, at the helm for a year. El-Sissi led the military's ouster of Morsi in 2013 and was elected president a year later, promising stability and an improved economy. He launched a series of mega projects that brought the state and military more into the economy but whose benefits were questioned by economists, including an $8.5 billion extension of the Suez Canal and plans to turn 1.5 million desert acres to farmland. His security agencies, meanwhile, jailed thousands, mostly Islamists, but also secular and leftist activists who fueled the 2011 uprising. A wide sector of the public backed the moves, convinced that stability was the priority.  ""Under el-Sissi, Egypt entered a new contract: The contract of submission,"" said Negad Borai, a rights lawyer who was put under criminal investigation after he proposed legislation against torture.  ""The validity of this contract and its continuity will hinge on the extent to which the state is willing to go to crush dissent."" In the weeks leading up to the currency flotation and fuel price hikes, pro-government TV show hosts persistently berated Egyptians, saying they don't work hard enough, depend too much on handouts or consume too much food or fuel. They also talked up fears of the Brotherhood stirring up unrest, warning Egypt could fall into chaos like Syria or Iraq if a firm hand is not kept. In his speeches, el-Sissi echoed that with repeated calls, wrapped in nationalist language, for Egyptians to work harder and consume less. Prominent analyst Abdullah el-Sennawi warned that Egyptians are being asked to sacrifice when the state is not.  ""There are conditions for everything. In this instance, they include ending political oppression, releasing detained young people, a more just distribution of burdens, introducing strict and tangible austerity in state institutions and fighting graft with actions, not just words,"" he wrote in a column on Wednesday. Michael W. Hanna, an Egypt expert with New York's Century Foundation, says the measures were way overdue but could have been taken earlier under better terms and more secure circumstances. Now the government must show it can shepherd the changes through.  ""It's an open question whether this will transition to something more sustainable and the government is disciplined enough to see through a reform process."" Some economists have said the government not only has to push forward with the reforms but also lift the hand of the government and military from the economy to let in investment. In an article published this week, Ziad Bahaa el-Din, a former deputy prime minister, prescribed a remedy that includes reviewing el-Sissi's mega-projects, regulating state intervention in the economy and improving the business climate. He also called for political reform, ""without which economic performance will not improve."" But the state is deeply wary of easing its security grip. Ibrahim Eissa, a critic of el-Sissi, wrote this week in the daily al-Maqal that popular anger is high, and authorities know that the lack of backlash so far is only ""an artificial calm.""  ""It's like a layer of ice that covers a lake of anger, concern, alarm and rejection for the policies of the current regime."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
