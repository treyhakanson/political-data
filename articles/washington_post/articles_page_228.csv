Four straight losses can weigh on a team that was undefeated before the streak started, dampening a Super Bowl aspiration at full strength just last month.  ""Right now, there's pressure on everybody,"" Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said. ""My dad told me a long time ago, 'If you make it through the downs, the ups will take care of itself.' So we're just going to keep doing what we do. If we get backed up into a corner, we're going to come out and fight."" The Arizona Cardinals won't be the ideal visitors on Sunday. Though they've been one of the NFC's many underperformers and yet to win a game outside of the Pacific time zone, the Cardinals (4-4-1) are plenty dangerous on both sides of the ball. They have their own urgency to catch up in the conference playoff race while starting a final stretch with five of seven games on the road . David Johnson leads the NFL in yards from scrimmage, with at least 100 in each game, and a defense that was dominant before Minnesota's momentum-killing bye week has been vulnerable against pass-catching running backs. The Vikings (5-4) will also be breaking in a new kicker, Kai Forbath , after releasing Blair Walsh.  ""A lot of people are doubting right now, and that's fine, but as long as everyone in this locker room believes, we're going to be OK,"" left guard Alex Boone said. Here are some more angles to the matchup: BRADFORD BLOSSOMING: Despite an injury-ravaged offensive line and a nonexistent running game, Vikings quarterback Sam Bradford has already set a career high with five games with a 100-plus passer rating. He's third in the NFL in completion percentage and fifth in interception percentage, still yet to be picked off in a home game. But cornerback Patrick Peterson and the rest of Arizona's accomplished, versatile defense will provide a stiff test.  ""Probably the best group that we've faced,"" Bradford said. GO-TO GUY: Minnesota's Stefon Diggs, who's tied for fourth in the league with 61 receptions, caught 13 passes in each of the past two games to set an NFL record. Three players share the all-time mark of 36 catches over a three-game span, with Pittsburgh's Antonio Brown the most recent to get there. There's no doubt, then, who will be responsible for containing Diggs: Peterson, whose 19 interceptions since he entered the league in 2011 are third most during that span. That's despite many quarterbacks deciding to throw away from the place on the field occupied by the three-time All-Pro.  ""It's going to be a great matchup,"" Bradford said. ""It's going to be fun to watch."" FITZGERALD THEATER: Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald will play in his home city for the fifth time in his 13-year career. He has never won in Minnesota.  ""The summertime, that's when I'm coming home for some leisure, but this is a business trip,"" said Fitzgerald, who's second in the NFL with 68 receptions. ""I'm coming for only one reason, and that's to try to get a win."" PRAISE FROM PALMER: Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer's respect for and insight into Zimmer's character and personality run deep. They were together from 2008 through 2010 in Cincinnati, where Zimmer was the defensive coordinator. Palmer said he sees parallels between Zimmer and Cardinals coach Bruce Arians, both of whom didn't get a head coach position until late in their careers.  ""Everybody's held accountable, whether you're the best player on the team or the guy that's just about to get cut,"" Palmer said. ""That's something that guys really respect, I know."" And Zimmer did not play favorites, Palmer said.  ""He doesn't hold back. He tells you the truth. He doesn't sugarcoat things,"" Palmer said. ""If you need to do better, you better do better or else he's going to replace you, and he's serious about things like that. There are no politically correct-type statements. He's very cut and dried, and what you see is what you get."" TACKLE'S CHALLENGE: John Wetzel had his first start at left tackle in Arizona's win over San Francisco last week and held his own in place of Jared Veldheer, who is out for the season with a torn triceps. Facing a tough defensive front in a loud stadium at Minnesota is another matter.  ""Everson Griffen is, I think, one of the most underrated defensive ends in the league,"" Arians said, going on to praise Vikings defensive end Brian Robison and defensive tackle Linval Joseph. Wetzel hadn't played in an NFL game until this season.  ""This is a big, big test,"" Arians said. ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Wirathu, a high-profile leader of the Myanmar Buddhist organization known as Ma Ba Tha, drew parallels between his views on Islam and those of the Republican president-elect. Trump's campaign was rife with anti-Muslim rhetoric and proposals that included banning Muslims from entering the country and heightening surveillance of mosques. The form his actual policies will take remains unclear.  ""We were blamed by the world, but we are just protecting our people and country,"" Wirathu said. ""... The world singled us out as narrow-minded. But as people from the country that is the grandfather of democracy and human rights elected Donald Trump, who is similar to me in prioritizing nationalism, there will be less finger-pointing from the international community."" He even floated the idea of cooperating with nationalist groups in the U.S.  ""In America, there can be organizations like us who are protecting against the dangers of Islamization. Those organizations can come to organizations in Myanmar to get suggestions or discuss,"" he said in an interview at his monastery in Mandalay on Nov. 12.  ""Myanmar doesn't really need to get suggestions from other countries. But they can get ideas from Myanmar."" Wirathu has been accused of inciting violence with hate-filled, anti-Islamic rhetoric in this Southeast Asian, Buddhist-majority country of about 55 million. Buddhist-led riots left more than 200 people dead in 2012 and forced hundreds of thousands more to flee their homes, most of them Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine state. Anti-Rohingya sentiment remains high in Myanmar. Members of the ethnic group are widely considered to have immigrated illegally from nearby Bangladesh, though many Rohingya families have lived in Myanmar for generations. At the same time, Wirathu's influence has weakened in the past year. He threw his support behind the military-backed government ahead of elections in November 2015, only to see the former ruling party fall to Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy in a landslide. In July, a senior NLD official in Yangon said that Ma Ba Tha, also known as the Committee to Protect Race and Religion, was not needed. Calls for the official to be disciplined went unanswered. In the same month, the country's official Buddhist clergy publicly distanced itself from the group.  ""Ma Ba Tha fades with barely a whimper,"" read a headline in the English-language Myanmar Times in August. Wirathu said he has no plans of fading into obscurity.  ""This government doesn't want our Ma Ba Tha,"" he said, seated behind a desk in a saffron robe as several aides took photos and video of his pronouncements. But the NLD's attempt to thwart the group will be ""hard for them,"" he added, as Ma Ba Tha is not breaking any laws.  ""Currently, we are waiting and looking at the situation as this government has only been here a short time and they don't know how to manage,"" he said. ""So we are not doing anything like campaigning or protesting to impact the government. But we will hold meetings, issue statements, help in our role."" For example, he said, his members have been distributing food in northern Rakhine state. Scores of Rohingya and some Myanmar troops have been killed in northern Rakhine since suspected militants attacked border posts last month, killing nine police officers. Rohingya activists say innocent villagers are being killed, but the government says it is only fighting ""violent attackers."" International media and aid groups have been kept away.

Yellen testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in September. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  Donald Trump's presidential victory has tossed new uncertainties into the carefully crafted plans of the Federal Reserve, complicating what was meant to be a slow-but-steady course to raise interest rates from historically low levels. The Fed still appears likely to raise rates in December, economists say, but big questions over Trump's policy agenda have clouded the outlook for future increases next year. The central bank also appears likely to gain two new Trump appointees on its board of governors, who will likely favor more aggressive action to raise rates, and to face a renewed push in Congress for stricter lawmaker oversight of its activities. Its chair, Janet L. Yellen, appears likely to serve out her term, which ends in early 2018. But she will do so after enduring heavy criticism -- and occasional praise -- from the new president while he was campaigning. At one point in the race, Trump said he has ""great respect"" for Yellen. At another, he said he was not a person who thought Yellen was doing a bad job. But he mostly criticized her throughout the race, accusing Yellen and the Fed of keeping rates low to help President Obama in advertisements and public statements. ""I think she is very political,"" Trump said in September, ""and to a certain extent, I think she should be ashamed of herself."" It would be unusual for Trump to continue that line of criticism once he is in the White House, because presidential administrations usually decline to discuss monetary policy, but it seems unlikely that he would appoint Yellen to another term. Yellen has defended herself and the Fed against the criticism. ""I can say emphatically,"" she said during a September news conference, ""that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy."" Analysts say Trump's statements are less likely to affect her decisions than the choices he makes on policy -- and how those choices might affect economic growth and inflation. ""If she thinks the economy needs more rate hikes, she'll do them,"" said Ryan Sweet, the director of real-time economics at Moody's Analytics. ""He really doesn't change her plan. The economy will change her plan, if needed."" The plan the Fed has inched toward all year is a measured normalization of interest rates, which have now sat near zero for the longest stretch in American history. Fed officials have already taken a first, small step to raise rates. They are expected to raise again in December. Forecasts by board members and regional bank presidents indicate that officials expect rates to rise by about a half-percentage point in 2017 and nearly a full point in 2018. Trump's plans could accelerate those hikes -- or sweep them off the table. The effects are particularly hard to predict because it is unclear how aggressively Trump will move on several fronts of economic policy, including taxes and trade, and what he will ultimately win congressional support for. Trump might, for example, push Congress to approve massive tax cuts and infrastructure spending increases, which could, at a moment when unemployment is low, both accelerate economic growth and inflation. He might erect high tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other countries, a move his team predicts would increase growth but which other economists have forecast would push America into recession. ""Trump's exact policies are unknown,"" researchers at the investment bank ING wrote in a report this week. ""Fiscal stimulus and tax cuts could generate inflationary pressure,"" forcing the Fed to raise rates more quickly. ""However, a protectionist approach could damage growth and call for further easing"" -- meaning, rate cuts and other monetary stimulus to prop up growth. Financial markets are focusing on the upside so far, with U.S. stocks rallying after Trump's win and bond yields suggesting an expectation of higher growth to come. Analysts say that appears to reflect a belief that Trump and Republican leaders are more likely to find common ground on tax cuts and deregulation -- which forecasters believe would boost growth -- than on potentially growth-dampening trade restrictions. ""It's fair and safe to say that the market is thinking of this in net positive terms,"" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist for RBC Capital Markets. ""People are reassessing their view on what growth and inflation are going to look like in a new Trump administration. If the tea leaves are right, it looks like we're headed for a little higher growth and a little higher inflation."" Perhaps the biggest unknown, for the Fed and for markets, is what sort of congressional moves the Trump administration might champion to increase oversight of the central bank. Republicans have floated several proposals, some of which would add only modest new accountability measures, and others that would curb the Fed's independence or change its policy mandate. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase wrote this week that they see those more aggressive proposals as ""less likely"" for Trump to sign into law than less aggressive ones. ""Nonetheless,"" the analysts wrote, ""these are risks that bear monitoring."""

Speaking to students at a conference in Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker said that ""I think that we'll waste time for two years while Mr. Trump tours a world that he is completely unaware of."" Juncker also acknowledged the differences between Trump's approach to issues of refugees compared with the EU. During the U.S. election campaign, Trump called into question the NATO alliance and was a vocal critic of the open border migration policies of some EU nations. ___ 5:10 p.m. Turkey's state-run news agency says the prime minister has congratulated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump over the phone. Anadolu Agency said Binali Yildirim called Trump on Friday and sent his wishes to the American people. Yildirim reportedly said they were looking forward to strengthening cooperation between the two countries, while Trump said he attached great importance to Turkey and that furthering dialogue was a priority. During a speech on Wednesday, Yildirim had called on Trump to extradite U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen -- blamed by Ankara for the failed coup in July -- as soon as he is sworn in. Ties between the two allies have been strained over perceptions in Turkey that the U.S. is reluctant to arrest and extradite Gulen. ___ 4:10 p.m. The former head of the British spy agency, MI6, says Donald Trump must keep a cool head during the stressful times ahead to reduce the threat of a nuclear war. Former Secret Intelligence Service chief John Sawers told the BBC he fears a nuclear clash between the United States and either China or Russia. According to Sawers, ""We're getting back into a world which is quite dangerous, and I think that is the biggest threat."" He said the most devastating scenario would be if relations with Beijing or Moscow turn confrontational or if the Trump administration ""overreacts."" Sawers observed: ""I don't think Donald Trump quite yet knows what the pressures will be on him when he becomes president."" He added: ""We've seen that when he feels slighted, when he feels criticized, he reacts quite fiercely."" ___ This item has been corrected to show the surname of the former M16 chief who commented on Trump is Sawers, not Sawyers. ___ 2:45 p.m. After Robert De Niro quipped that he might have to move to Italy now that Donald Trump is president-elect, a group in the actor's ancestral region of Molise has come up with a proposal to make him at home. The emigration association said Friday that it wants to make De Niro president of the small central Italy region, if only for a day. The association noted that De Niro ""is tied to his Molise origins and even speaks a good Italian-Molise dialect, even if he doesn't like to flaunt it."" De Niro made an anti-Trump video before the election. He said on the ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" talk show Wednesday that he also holds Italian citizenship and added, ""I may have to move there."" De Niro's great-grandparents emigrated from Molise in 1890. ___ 12 p.m. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him on winning the U.S. election and offer her country's cooperation. Merkel's spokesman says the German leader spoke to Trump by telephone late Thursday. Spokesman Georg Streiter told reporters in Berlin that Merkel stressed the common values of Germany and the United States. Immediately following Trump's election victory, Merkel had offered the new U.S. administration ""a close partnership"" on the basis of ""democracy, freedom, respect for the law and the dignity of human beings regardless of their origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation and political opinion."" Her comments were widely seen in Germany as a rebuke to Trump's rhetoric during the election campaign. ___ 11:25 a.m. A powerful Iraqi cleric whose followers once fought U.S. troops says Donald Trump's election victory is a sign of American decline. Muqtada al-Sadr, a Shiite who brought thousands of anti-government protesters into the streets of Baghdad earlier this year, urged Americans in a Friday statement to resist Trump's intolerant views. He says: ""We advise the American people not to be affected by the radicalism of their president, and they should not allow him to impose his influence."" Al-Sadr's militia, known as the Peace Brigades, is among the largest of several government-sanctioned Shiite armed groups battling Islamic State forces. He says his group considers America ""as the founder of terrorism, by its acts and behavior."" He added: ""Peace be upon the American people, those who like moderation and who want peace and peaceful coexistence between religions and ethnicities."" ___ 10:30 a.m. Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami says that President-elect Donald Trump should apologize to the Iranian people for calling them terrorists during his campaign. The senior religious scholar, in a Friday sermon broadcast live on state radio, said Trump should ""respectfully apologize to the nation."" Khatami warned Trump about confronting Iran, saying he should know better than to play with ""the tail of the lion."" The cleric said that Tehran had successfully foiled and frustrated several of Trump's White House predecessors. He said Iran's stance on the U.S. election is to avoid intervention or involvement in another country's internal affairs. He said, ""We respect the people of other countries and we respect their elections."" ___ 6:30 a.m. Japan's defense minister says her country already pays enough for U.S. troops based there, a response to repeated demands by President-elect Donald Trump that countries hosting American forces should pay more. Trump's remarks during the election campaign have raised concern in Japan about a possibility his administration may seek Japan's increased spending for American forces. Defense Minister Tomomi Inada stressed that the presence of U.S. troops in Japan serves as a key deterrence in the Asia-Pacific region and they should stay. Japan pays about 200 billion yen ($1.9 billion) a year -- or about 70 percent -- in so-called host-nation support for 50,000 U.S. troops. Inada said Friday: ""I believe it's enough. We pay what we are supposed to cover."" ___ This item has been corrected to show that Defense Minister Tomomi Inada is female. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

""I will take everything away from you,"" Gregory said he heard the officer say. The veteran reporter said his driver told him later that the officer also said, ""I will take your head off."" Gregory published the comments on his Twitter feed and said he later received calls from the mayor's office and a top police official. ""They were eager to follow up and learn more,"" Gregory said. ""They were very concerned and wanted to express their regrets to the driver."" The office of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) responded in a statement saying, ""The incident described on social media does not illustrate who we are as a city or how we carry ourselves when serving residents and members of the public."" The police and Bowser's aides ""have already made contact to understand what transpired and will review the matter,"" the statement added. Police said they have spoken to the driver. The incident occurred about 8 a.m. after Gregory had finished CNN's morning show, ""New Day,"" and was returning home. He said he was in the back of a sedan talking to his wife on the phone when his driver, who works for a company used by CNN on contract, passed a line of buses on New York Avenue near the I-395 interchange.  Gregory said the driver thought the buses were parked, but they were waiting for a light. Gregory said the D.C. officer driving a small SUV pulled over his driver for crossing the double-yellow line but did not issue a citation.  The driver, through Gregory, declined to be interviewed by The Washington Post. Gregory said he didn't know whether the alleged comments were directed at his driver's ethnicity or were made out of anger for the traffic violation. At the same time, the veteran reporter and former host of NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" said he could not remain silent.  [CNN journalist David Gregory tweets about encounter with D.C. officer]  ""I have the greatest respect for the police officers in our city and the job they do day in and day out,"" Gregory said. ""But we are in a highly charged atmosphere. I'm somebody who is immersed in covering and analyzing our political discourse in our country. Citizens have an obligation to look after each other. That is the reason I wanted to raise this."" Gregory called the comments ""striking and disturbing. To use that kind of language was beyond the pale."" The reported comments come days after the election of Donald Trump to the presidency and concerns among immigrant groups and others offended by Trump threatening mass deportation of people illegally in the country and banning of Muslims from entering, and whether his rhetoric targeting ethnic groups has given supporters license to lash out at minorities. Gregory said the driver has lived in the United States for many years, and Gregory said he believes the driver is a citizen. District officials said they are working to identify the officer and determine if he was wearing a body camera that could have recorded the interaction.  Gregory said the officer did not get out of his vehicle but appeared angry and yelled at his driver, whom he described as shaken by the incident. Gregory tweeted, and stated in an interview, that the driver ""broke traffic laws"" and deserved to be cited for a traffic infraction. Perry Stein contributed to this report "

Lawmakers voted 131-3 in favor of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's proposal, but the governing Fidesz party failed to secure any opposition support and fell two votes short of the two-thirds majority of all 199 deputies necessary. All opposition lawmakers either voted against the proposal or abstained. The failure to pass the five amendments, including one stating that a ""foreign population cannot be settled into Hungary,"" was Orban's second major setback after an Oct. 2 referendum -- in which more than 98 percent of voters supported the government's anti-migrant position -- was declared invalid because of low voter turnout. Foreign Minister Peter Sziijarto said the EU mandatory quota scheme to resettle asylum-seekers, which has yet to be approved, ""is a bad answer to the migrant crisis ... and will practically lead to Europe's ruin.""  ""Today it became clear that in terms of protecting the country, the Hungarian people can only count on the government,"" Szijjarto said. ""Defending the country's security and lowering the risk of terrorism are national issues ... but we can't count on the opposition parties."" Political analyst Zoltan Cegledi said the rejection of the amendments was a ""defeat of power politics"" in which Orban and Fidesz were emphasizing their ability to get things done no matter what.  ""The defeat puts Orban in a very difficult communications position in which he has to explain why he isn't capable of achieving anything,"" Cegledi said. Orban's ""zero migrants"" policies led Hungary to build fences last year on its southern borders with Serbia and Croatia to stop the migrant flow and also resulted in draconian rules which, according to human rights groups, have practically destroyed Hungary's asylum system. Last year, before the fences were fully in place by mid-October, nearly 400,000 migrants and refugees passed through Hungary on their way to Germany and elsewhere in Western Europe. Orban presented the constitutional amendments as necessary to keep out large numbers of mostly Muslim asylum seekers in order to protect Hungarian independence, identity and culture. Orban said the amendments were meant to show ""that, without our consent and approval, no one can decide who we want to live with and how."" Earlier this year, the far-right Jobbik party had proposed amendments similar to Orban's. Fidesz rejected the idea, banking instead on the expected success of the referendum. This time, Jobbik made its support conditional on eliminating ""residency bonds"" which give foreigners and their immediate families Hungarian papers in exchange for buying a five-year government bond worth 300,000 euros ($331,000). By the end of August, more than 7,500 people, including 6,405 from China and 497 from Russia, had gained residence in Hungary under the program. Jobbik chairman Gabor Vona said the bonds, which Transparency International Hungary flagged as ""the footprint of high-level corruption in the country,"" were the ""dirty business"" of Fidesz.  ""For Fidesz, dirty money is more important than the true security of the country,"" Vona told reporters after the vote. ""The very moment the government eliminates the bonds, Jobbik is willing to vote for the constitutional amendment even within 24 hours."" Fidesz has said it will likely eliminate the residency bonds but rejected Jobbik's ""blackmail.""  ""Tying support for the constitutional amendment to other conditions is tantamount to treason,"" said Lajos Kosa, head of the Fidesz faction in parliament. In response, Jobbik lawmakers held up a huge banner after the vote saying ""Traitors are those who, for money, also let in terrorists."" Analysts expect Fidesz to keep anti-migration high on the agenda in the run-up to elections expected in April 2018.  ""In xenophobia, Fidesz has found a far-right theme it can use and it works too well for it to be cast aside,"" Cegledi said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hun Sen has a very active online presence, and his opponents likewise use the internet to mobilize supporters. The rivalry between Hun Sen and Sam Rainsy evolved into a ""Facebook war,"" with each seeking to claim a greater number of ""likes."" At the height of their battling in March, the Phnom Penh Post published its finding that most of Hun Sen's ""likes"" originated from abroad, raising suspicions about their legitimacy. Currently, Hun Sen's page has 6.1 million ""likes,"" and Sam Rainsy's has 3.3 million. Cambodia's courts are widely seen as being under the influence of Hun Sen's government and his ruling Cambodian People's Party. The conviction is the latest in a series of cases against opposition leaders in what is generally seen as an attempt to disrupt their organizing efforts ahead of local elections next June. The next general election is not until the middle of 2018, but holding power at the local level is an advantage when national polls are held. Sam Rainsy is the most prominent target of these prosecutions, and has been in exile since last November to avoid a jail term on a conviction that he had thought was covered by a royal pardon. There are several other cases pending against him, at least two involving online postings. The government this month banned his re-entry from abroad, making it more difficult for him to fight the charges even if he chooses to return. Deputy party leader Kem Sokha has also been tied up in legal knots after a well-orchestrated scandal involving his alleged mistress, and was sentenced to a five-month jail term for refusing to appear in court to testify in a related case. He has been holed up at party headquarters in the Cambodian capital for several months. On Monday, a court sentenced an opposition senator to seven years in prison over comments he posted on Facebook criticizing a 36-year-old border agreement with neighboring Vietnam. The Phnom Penh Municipal Court found Hong Sok Hour guilty of falsifying public documents, using fake documents and inciting chaos. Sam Soeun filed his lawsuit about Facebook ""likes"" in March after Sam Rainsy accused him of being involved in a plan to boost Hun Sen's popularity by buying ""likes"" originating in places such as India and the Philippines, as well as ordering civil servants and soldiers in Cambodia to set up dummy Facebook accounts. Judge Im Vannak said Tuesday that Sam Rainsy acted with ill intentions. Sam Rainsy, in a statement posted on Facebook after the court's ruling, repeated his original allegation.  ""Prime Minister Hun Sen has been manipulating Facebook figures in order to boast about his (apparently impressive but fake) popularity, which he uses as a political justification to legitimize the ongoing violent crackdown on his more and more numerous critics,"" he said.

The popular leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party says in a Sunday Mail column that she ""fervently hopes"" Clinton will best Republican rival Donald Trump in Tuesday's U.S. presidential vote. It's unusual for political leaders to express their opinion on other country's elections while the campaign is still underway. Neutrality is usually observed. Nonetheless, Sturgeon says Clinton would be ""a great president"" and that the election of a woman leader in the U.S. would ""also mark the shattering of the glass ceiling in terms of equality for women."" Sturgeon also says Clinton, although not perfect, would be a great role model for women throughout the world. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
