Gen. Michael Flynn his national security adviser on Nov. 18, but Flynn has a history of making incendiary and Islamophobic statements that have drawn criticism from his military peers. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   President-elect Donald Trump's pick for national security adviser, among the most important jobs in the still-forming Trump administration, has said some pretty incendiary things on the Internet. Before being tapped to advise Trump on national security issues, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn was an intelligence officer and head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Obama until he was removed from his command in 2014 over his leadership style. Flynn went on to criticize some of his superiors, including Obama, regarding their stances on Islamist extremism. He also traveled to Russia on a trip paid for by state-run media and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn said that he was using the trip to advance U.S. interests.   [Trump's pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy]   Before joining the Trump campaign and drawing the ire of his colleagues for using his rank to support a political campaign that would often disparage the very establishment he had just departed, Flynn was well-regarded by his colleagues. In his book ""My Share of the Task,"" retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal wrote that Flynn was ""pure energy"" and had an ""uncanny ability"" to digest information, ""marshal his people, resources and energy to make it happen."" Apart from his military career and political ascension, Flynn also has a digital legacy that is problematic. Below are some of his tweets over the course of the Trump campaign. Ryan Lizza, a writer with the New Yorker, also put a number of Flynn's tweets on his feed Thursday night.

His most recent book is ""Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. The Supreme Court.""     The president-elect doesn't read many books. ""I never have,"" Donald Trump said last summer. ""I'm always busy doing a lot."" But that doesn't mean that you, America, have to give up the habit. Whether you're never-Trump or pro-Trump, reading can help you understand what is happening and what might happen to your country during the next four years. While the nation, under Trump, is entering new territory, it is not entirely uncharted. As the following books make clear, the raw populism, nativism and conspiracism of Trump's campaign -- and of key members of the team he is assembling -- have deep roots, both in the United States and abroad.   The Populist Moment: A Short History of the Agrarian Revolt in America (1978), by Lawrence Goodwyn   Echoes of the agrarian revolt of the 1890s -- the great insurgency of the Gilded Age -- can be heard today in our own populist moment. In this classic account, Lawrence Goodwyn describes how the movement flowed from a wellspring of grievances, principally the ""plain people's"" feeling that the new industrial order was not working for them and that the rules of finance, including the monetary system of the United States, were rigged against rural America.  Yet Goodwyn makes clear that populism was not merely a platform; it was, at bottom, ""an expression of self-respect"" in the face of bewildering economic change. By the end of the century, the movement -- rudderless, leaderless and, over time, coopted by the Democratic Party -- had petered out. ""The people"" and their political allies found themselves unable to compete with a Republican Party that had aligned itself with big business, left the legacy of Lincoln behind and adopted what Goodwyn calls an ""intensely nationalistic and racially exclusive"" identity.   The World of the John Birch Society: Conspiracy, Conservatism, and the Cold War (2014), by D.J. Mulloy   The John Birch Society was founded in 1958 by industrialists and conspiracists who believed -- in the words of their leader, Robert Welch -- that government was ""the greatest enemy of man."" That idea, commonplace on the right today, had few adherents in midcentury America. In ""The World of the John Birch Society,"" D.J. Mulloy tells the origin story of a political culture that is now, with Trump's election, ascendant.  To the Birch Society, politics was a Manichean struggle between darkness and light, and America was on the edge of annihilation -- if not by the H-bomb, then by the secret designs of a clique that Welch called ""the insiders"" or ""the Liberal Establishment."" John Birchers saw conspiracies everywhere, including the Oval Office: Welch famously denounced President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent"" of communism.  A source of constant controversy and ridicule, the Birch Society seemed, by the mid-1960s, to have lost its battle to ""awaken"" America. Michigan Gov. George Romney, a Republican, spoke for most in his party when he attacked society members as ""purveyors of hate."" But as Mulloy argues, the Birch Society -- its worldview, its energy at the grass roots, its organizational skill -- revived and, over time, reshaped the Republican Party.     The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s (2000), by Piers Brendon  In this sweeping, cinematic account of the world's descent into war, British historian Piers Brendon shows that fascism, during the 1930s, did not roll in on tanks and in grand processions; those came later. The near-collapse of capitalism during the Great Depression created, as Brendon puts it, a ""crisis of confidence"" among the world's democracies and fed the rage and despair of the disempowered, who demanded a return to some lost (and mythological) ideal of national greatness. Fascism also arrived in the form of apparent buffoons: Adolf Hitler, shabby and sullen, and Benito Mussolini, whose almost desperate displays of masculinity struck many non-Italians, including one foreign journalist, as ""absurd attitudinizing."" Yet the clowns soon commanded a cult of personality, suppressing civil liberties and extinguishing any form of opposition. Beyond the jackboot, the truncheon and the gun, their chief weapon was the lie: ""organized deception,"" in Brendon's words. New technology -- and new methods of propaganda -- gave dictators the ability to create and impose their own versions of reality.      The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin (2015), by Steven Lee Myers   A clear-eyed and chilling portrait of authoritarianism in the 21st century, Steven Lee Myers's biography of Vladimir Putin provides our best understanding yet of the only global leader for whom the president-elect has expressed consistent and unembarrassed admiration.  Putin won office in 2000 by making shrewd appeals to Russia's wounded patriotism and by promising to reverse the country's dramatic post-Cold War decline. As president, he moved steadily to assert personal control over the military and the media -- along with much of the economy. Industries, monopolies and vast riches in natural resources were put in the hands (and lined the pockets) of acolytes. Russians began to call their government ""Kremlin, Inc."" and Putin its CEO.  As he tightened his grip, the whole nation became ""hostage to the psychosomatic quirks of its leader,"" as the novelist Vladimir Sorokin wrote. ""All his fears, passions, weaknesses, and complexes become state policy."" The book's careful rendering of Putin's hardness and shrewdness suggests that his American admirer is badly outmatched.   Ripples of Hope: Great American Civil Rights Speeches (2003), edited by Josh Gottheimer   If there is a consensus view about anything in this country, in this moment, it is that the 2016 election was a debasing, dispiriting slog. Inspiration was in short supply. Yet it is present on nearly every page of ""Ripples of Hope,"" an anthology of civil rights speeches compiled by Josh Gottheimer, a newly elected Democratic congressman from New Jersey (and, full disclosure, a former Clinton White House colleague of mine). Here is the suffragette Carrie Chapman Catt, in 1917, acknowledging that ""there are a few 'women haters' left . . . but the world does not wait for such as these""; here is Sen. Joseph Montoya (N.M.), in 1967, declaring that ""the time is forever past"" when Latinos were ""content to stand silent at thousands of back doors. . . . Their eyes look up or forward, rather than down""; here is Martin Luther King Jr., telling an audience in Selma, Ala., in 1965: ""Don't despair. I must admit that there are some difficult days ahead. . . . But the psalmist is right. Weeping may tarry for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."" As former president Bill Clinton wrote in the book's foreword, these speeches summon hope from America's past, but even more, ""they are living reminders of the . . . work yet to be done.""   The Cycles of American History (1986), by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.   For those in need of further comfort, the title of this book might itself suffice. The late historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. posited that through the 20th century, the U.S. electorate swung between support of ""affirmative government"" and ""revulsion against it"" at 30-year intervals -- roughly the span of a single generation. Each new cohort aimed to correct (or overcorrect) the excesses and omissions of the one previous.  In 1999, in a new foreword, Schlesinger argued that the cycle had been disrupted, and the next progressive era forestalled, by the end of the Cold War and the rapid pace of the ""Computer Revolution."" Yet he held fast to his faith in history -- its continuities, its lessons. ""History,"" he wrote, ""by putting crisis in perspective, supplies the antidote to every generation's illusion that its own problems are uniquely oppressive.""  If history indeed moves in cycles, then this, too, shall pass.      "

(Reuters)   What do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they're all make-believe -- and invented by the same man. Paul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years. He has twice convinced the Internet that he's British graffiti artist Banksy; he also published the very viral, very fake news of a Yelp vs. ""South Park"" lawsuit last year.   [This is how Facebook's fake-news writers make money]   But in recent months, Horner has found the fake-news ecosystem growing more crowded, more political and vastly more influential: In March, Donald Trump's son Eric and his then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, even tweeted links to one of Horner's faux-articles. His stories have also appeared as news on Google.    (Paul Horner)  In light of concerns that stories like Horner's may have affected the presidential election, and in the wake of announcements that both Google and Facebook would take action against deceptive outlets, Intersect called Horner to discuss his perspective on fake news. This transcript has been edited for clarity, length and -- ahem -- bad language.   [The only true winners of this election are trolls]   You've been writing fake news for a while now -- you're kind of like the OG Facebook news hoaxer. Well, I'd call it hoaxing or fake news. You'd call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250,000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral? Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore -- I mean, that's how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn't care because they'd already accepted it. It's real scary. I've never seen anything like it. You mentioned Trump, and you've probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that? My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check anything -- they'll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist.    (Twitter via Mediaite)  Why? I mean -- why would you even write that? Just 'cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that's just insane. I've gone to Trump protests -- trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it.      Consider these points before sharing a news article on Facebook. It could be fake. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   I thought they'd fact-check it, and it'd make them look worse. I mean that's how this always works: Someone posts something I write, then they find out it's false, then they look like idiots. But Trump supporters -- they just keep running with it! They never fact-check anything! Now he's in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels [bad]. You think you personally helped elect Trump? I don't know. I don't know if I did or not. I don't know. I don't know.      Early on the morning of Nov. 9, Republican President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York, declaring victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   I guess I'm curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election -- especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs -- why didn't you stop? Why keep writing? I didn't think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn't messing them up as much as I wanted -- but I never thought he'd actually get elected. I didn't even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should've seen this coming -- everyone assumed Hillary [Clinton] would just get in. But she didn't, and Trump is president.   [Facebook has repeatedly trended fake news since firing its human editors]   Speaking of Clinton -- did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson's, for that matter? (Horner's Facebook picture shows him at a rally for Johnson.)  No. I hate Trump. Is that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirizing Clinton and other figures, but that ""no joke . . . in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it's the cure for cancer, is right-wing Republicans."" That makes it sound like you've found targeting conservatives is more profitable. Yeah, it is. They don't fact-check. But a Trump presidency is good for you from a business perspective, right? It's great for anybody who does anything with satire -- there's nothing you can't write about now that people won't believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. I wrote a lot of crazy anti-Muslim stuff -- like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line -- and people went along with it! Facebook and Google recently announced that they'd no longer let fake-news sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this? This whole Google AdSense thing is pretty scary. And all this Facebook stuff. I make most of my money from AdSense -- like, you wouldn't believe how much money I make from it. Right now I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense.   [Google's top news link for 'final election results' goes to a fake news site with false numbers]   I know ways of getting hooked up under different names and sites. So probably if they cracked down, I would try different things. I have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I'll just use others. They could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I'd be okay. Plus, Facebook and AdSense make a lot of money from [advertising on fake news sites] for them to just get rid of it. They'd lose a lot of money. But if it did really go away, that would suck. I don't know what I would do. Thinking about this less selfishly, though -- it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you're describing are pretty scary. Yeah, I mean -- a lot of the sites people are talking about, they're just total BS sites. There's no creativity or purpose behind them. I'm glad they're getting rid of them. I don't like getting lumped in with Huzlers. I like getting lumped in with the Onion. The stuff I do -- I spend more time on it. There's purpose and meaning behind it. I don't just write fake news just to write it. So, yeah, I see a lot of the sites they're listing, and I'm like -- good. There are so many horrible sites out there. I'm glad they're getting rid of those sites. I just hope they don't get rid of mine, too.          1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

The candidates vying to succeed her are focusing their campaigns on issues including homelessness, recycling and bullying prevention. Welcome to politics, elementary-school style. Seven candidates are running to be the fifth-grade ""kid governor"" of Connecticut in an election that seeks to spark deeper interest for all students in government and civics, subjects getting less attention in American schools today than in earlier decades. Similar efforts have sprouted as education-focused nonprofits and schools aim to prepare better-engaged citizens. Advocates say a need for more civic instruction has been apparent for years but was highlighted by the low voter turnout and acrid tone in the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.  ""Effective civics learning promotes civil discourse. Effective civics learning helps students develop the ability to discuss controversial issues respectfully. That seemed to be in very short supply in the election we've just gone through,"" said Ted McConnell, executive director of the Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools. ""Basic civics knowledge is wanting throughout our country."" After years of decline, many efforts are underway to restore the role advocates say schools were intended to play in teaching students their rights and responsibilities as citizens. The decline in schools began in the 1950s and accelerated in the 2000s as schools emphasized courses with more bearing on testing under No Child Left Behind, McConnell said. Where high schools once taught three civics courses, he said, it is generally down to one. -- Illinois, which had been among less than a dozen states without a civics requirement, required at least a semester of instruction for students to graduate beginning this year. -- Nonprofit groups such as Generation Citizen and Discovering Justice have mobilized volunteers to help high school teachers run action-oriented civics projects and teach the importance of good citizenship. -- States including California, Connecticut and New York have updated their social studies frameworks to put more emphasis on civics and participatory skills. In Connecticut, 4,400 fifth-graders from 45 cities and towns voted to choose the kid governor. The program, which also includes in-class lessons about government and engaging with community issues, was launched last year by the Connecticut Public Affairs Network, with sponsorship by the state Department of Education. The winner serves a one-year term. Responsibilities include developing a plan to deliver on campaign promises, keeping up a blog highlighting other students' efforts to make a difference, and making public appearances and speeches. The current kid governor, Elena Tipton, 11, of East Hartford, was elected last year on a kindness platform. She said she originally planned a campaign focused on bullying prevention, but said that would be giving bullies the attention that they want.  ""The best part about it is that I get to go around and meet all these different people and learn what they do to be kind,"" Elena said.  Research has shown that civics education, including discussions of current events, increases the likelihood young people will vote, said Peter Levine, an associate dean at the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University. There also is evidence, he said, that when children are engaged, their parents are more likely to vote. The framework adopted last year in Connecticut urges schools to teach civics throughout the curriculum, and not just in high school. A new initiative with the secretary of the state's office will recognize schools that taught the 2016 elections in innovative ways. Brian Cofrancesco, who runs the kid governor program, said it helps children understand the democratic process and the value of their own voice.  ""Kids are realizing,"" he said, ""every vote really does matter."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Whichever, Trump adviser brings it	" WASHINGTON -- When Donald Trump announced Stephen Bannon as his top White House strategist, critics re-erupted with allegations that Bannon was racist, sexist and anti-Semitic.  ""I promise you he's not as scary"" as people said, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on NBC's ""Today"" show Tuesday. She called concerns about Bannon ""very unfair."" If history is any guide, Bannon won't be putting those fears to rest anytime soon. As a conservative media brawler who became Trump's campaign chief executive, Bannon has discarded norms for discussing race, gender and religion, often framing even abstract political fights in deliberately inflammatory terms.  ""What we need to do is bitch-slap the Republican Party,"" Bannon said in a 2010 radio interview. For a man aggrieved with elite educational, business and media institutions, Bannon has risen to the top of some of them. Born into a Norfolk, Virginia, family of Catholic Democrats, Bannon served in the U.S. Navy before attending Harvard Business School. Afterward, he went to Goldman Sachs, leaving to start his own media-focused boutique investment banking firm. After selling the business to French banking giant Societe Generale, he became a film producer. Though he created successful Hollywood films, the groundwork for his future career in politics came from a Reagan biopic, ""In the Face of Evil,"" which introduced him to conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart and author Peter Schweizer. After Breitbart died unexpectedly in 2012, Bannon took the helm of a relaunch of his news site. Breitbart grew quickly, from 12 million monthly page views to more than 192 million by August of this year, according to the site. During the Republican Convention, Bannon said Breitbart was ""the platform for the alt-right,"" a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. Heavily influenced by the shock-based rhetoric of internet chat boards, the alt-right includes strains of white nationalism and aggressive anti-feminism. The alt-right's mainstream apologists describe those themes as a demonstration of free speech rather than a full-throated endorsement of prejudice. In interviews, Bannon has acknowledged that the alt-right may attract some racists, homophobes and anti-Semites, but said that he does not share those opinions -- and that the left harbors undesirable elements as well. Yet Breitbart actively cultivates some of those themes, and Bannon has shown little patience for adjusting the site's tone to pacify critics. Under Bannon, Breitbart kept a running tab of news stories titled ""black crime,"" which catalogued the activities of supposed ""black rape gangs"" and ""black mobs."" The site used a slur for transgender people in headlines and stories. And during the campaign -- a period in which Bannon stepped aside from running the site -- Breitbart.com sometimes went out of its way to identify Trump critics as Jews.  ""I've known and worked with Steve Bannon, and he has traditional conservative non-racist, non-prejudiced views about the world,"" said Joel Pollak, a senior editor at large at Breitbart, who called The Associated Press in response to a request for comment from Bannon on this story. ""Lately, media conventions have determined that some of the traditional views of most of Western civilization are offensive."" Bannon has publicly disavowed tolerance for prejudice. But allegations of anti-Semitism have also followed Bannon into his personal life as well. In 2007, his ex-wife alleged in court documents from their divorce that Bannon expressed open anti-Semitism, declaring that he didn't want their two daughters ""going to school with Jews."" Bannon disputed saying this. In a 2011 radio interview, Bannon declared that conservative women, including Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachmann, infuriated liberals because they ""would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children."" He contrasted that against a slur for lesbians. Regardless of Bannon's personal views on race and gender, he has heartily endorsed using inflammatory rhetoric to incite Breitbart's readership. In a December 2014 internal Breitbart email obtained by the Daily Beast, Bannon and an editor discussed a traditional Washington slight -- the possibility that Breitbart might not have been invited to a press conference by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. The conversation quickly spiraled into rage at the Republican political establishment. He compared leadership figures to women's genitalia. ""Let the grassroots turn on the hate because that's the ONLY thing that will make them do their duty."" Such opinions make Bannon an odd pairing with Reince Priebus, the Republican chairman whom Trump has named his chief of staff. Senior members of Trump's camp have downplayed the prospects for conflict.  ""When you're out there just criticizing, it's one thing,"" Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani said. ""When you actually get on the inside, there's a certain weight of responsibility to the American people that is on your shoulders. And I think Steve Bannon is the kind of guy who gets that."" ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A growing chorus of Democrats is seeking to rally those within the party to unite around a common goal of resisting Trump, while pressuring moderate Republicans to reject the most controversial appointments to Trump's administration. Immediately after Hillary Clinton's surprise loss to Trump a week ago, some suggested that they might aim to work with Trump on shared policy goals. But Democrats have taken the appointment of former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon as chief White House strategist and the emergence of Wall Street figures and lobbyists as candidates for top jobs as a strong indication of Trump's plans to veer sharply right and stray from the economic populist message that he championed as a candidate. Congressional Democrats say they have not ruled out working with Trump on areas of common ground, especially on infrastructure and populist economic policies, according to a senior Senate Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss party strategy. But they plan to train their attention on the immediate challenge of contesting Trump's appointments to key roles, especially those that require Senate confirmation.  [Obama warns against 'a crude sort of nationalism' taking root in the U.S.]      Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Senator-elect Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) denounce the acts of hatred that have arose since Donald Trump's election, and urge Trump to rescind Stephen Bannon's appointment. (Reuters)   ""There is not a lot of leverage there,"" the aide said, acknowledging that the party holds no authority to halt the hiring of aides such as Bannon who do not require Senate confirmation and has limited power to stop those appointments that do. ""The rub on a lot of the appointments will probably be those more moderate Republicans."" Organized labor leaders, who represent a key constituency of Democrats, have long said that their members agree with Trump on some economic issues, especially their shared opposition to free trade agreements that they say hurt American workers. But according to one senior labor official who spoke on the condition anonymity to talk candidly, the ascension of such figures as Bannon must be addressed before cooperation is put on the table. Critics say Bannon is a supporter of racist, anti-Semitic and misogynist views. ""We can't do business with this guy as long as he's in the business of hate,"" the official said. ""Why is that? Because we're Americans."" Nearly a week after extending an olive branch to the president-elect, suggesting that he and Democrats might find common ground on economic issues, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Tuesday significantly escalated her criticism of Trump's plans for his presidency. ""This just keeps going back to, what is Donald Trump going to do?"" Warren, a leading liberal voice within the party, said at a Wall Street Journal CEO Council event. ""And he's now giving us at least the first tangible sign of his vision of how to run a Trump presidency and a big part of that are lobbyists and Washington insiders and the other part of it is to bring someone who is a white supremacist into the White House to be a senior strategist."" In an impassioned speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), the outgoing minority leader, denounced Trump's decision to name Bannon to a senior role, citing his ties to the alt-right movement, which is associated with white nationalism. ""If Trump is serious about seeking unity, the first thing he should do is rescind his appointment of Steve Bannon,"" Reid said. ""Rescind it, don't do it.         1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flare up as opponents of President-elect Donald Trump express dismay with the election results, underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting a fractured country.

But there is little appetite among Democrats to launch a campaign of total resistance against Trump, especially on some issues where he may need Democratic support to overcome Republican opposition to proposals such as infrastructure. ""If he's going to be deporting millions of people, if he's going to continue sexist decisions that take away a woman's right to choose or, you know, support racist programs, I will do everything I can to make sure those policies are defeated,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). ""On the other hand, if he brings forward an infrastructure program, which is something I've advocated for years, along with many others -- it creates millions of jobs -- will I be supportive? Yeah."" The politics of total resistance is also viewed by some Democrats as a political miscalculation made by Republicans that they are unwilling to repeat. ""We have to do what we think is right depending on what issue he's pushing,"" said former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who is one of several candidates running for chair of the Democratic National Committee. ""If it's a decent bipartisan tax bill, that's great."" ""Should we resist the way Republicans resisted Obama? Of course not,"" he added. ""It's not good for the country."" The emerging strategy comes as forces within the party are vying for influence over who will lead Democrats both in Congress and outside it. A group of more recently elected congressional Democrats and those who represent Midwestern districts won a major victory on Tuesday when they successfully postponed the election of the House minority leader, a position that Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is seeking to hold onto. Those Democrats are clamoring for change, urging the party to make its leadership more representative of the party's younger and racially diverse coalition. Rank-and-file members also blame the Democratic leadership for failing to respond to the concerns of their constituents in parts of the country, such as the industrial Midwest, where Trump won surprise victories or beat expectations. ""There is broad angst in the Democratic caucus,"" Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), who supported the decision to delay the elections, told reporters. ""To stick with the same message over four bad election cycles is a mistake. I think part of it is that the messengers have to change."" A leading contender to challenge Pelosi is Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), an eastern Ohio lawmaker who would give voice to a desire for greater attention to job creation and working-class issues. Dean, who has previously served as DNC chair, is on a growing list of figures in the party seeking the DNC chairmanship. The Chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Jaime Harrison, has also put his name in the running and others, including former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley and Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, are considering runs. Another top candidate, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) also announced his candidacy this week. Some Democrats quietly worry that Ellison, a prominent black and Muslim lawmaker, would signal that the party is doubling down on social and cultural issues over addressing economic anxiety. Democrats such as Dean have also argued that the DNC job should go to a candidate who can commit to it full-time. Yet Ellison, who has been endorsed for the DNC job by several top congressional Democrats, was also an early supporter of Sanders in his primary run against Clinton and has focused on jobs and economic populism in his pitch for the job. ""My view is that progressives need to have a stronger sharper message on the economic anxiety that all people are facing, not just white working class voters, but all working-class voters,"" said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. ""But I also think there was a sharp anti-Washington message and that is something we need a political reform agenda to address as well."" Anguished Democrats are taking stock of the depth of their losses and trying to identify slivers of political openings in the Trump era. Debate about the best way forward consumed a group of top donors, such as billionaire investor George Soros, who gathered for a three-day meeting this week at a luxury hotel in Washington. Soros told fellow liberal donors on Tuesday that he believes Trump is a would-be dictator, adding that he was confident that America's institutions would serve as a check on the new president's power -- as long as a vigorous opposition is in place to push back against his policies, according to someone familiar with his remarks. In a question-and-answer session with Democracy Alliance President Gara LaMarche, the billionaire investor ticked off a list of urgent priorities for the left, including protecting Muslims and refugees who could be targeted by the new administration and strengthening groups that could challenge Trump on constitutional issues. ""I think once people see the agenda that they looked past in action -- abortion rights under threat, the cost to communities of deportations, the embodiment of bigotry and rise of hate crimes -- I think there will be buyer's remorse, perhaps even by Inauguration Day, that will give us an opportunity for a hearing,"" LaMarche said in an interview.

In a statement issued Tuesday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the price of starting anew with Moscow would be U.S. complicity in the ""butchery of the Syrian people"" being carried out by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad.  ""That is an unacceptable price for a great nation,"" McCain said. ""When America has been at its greatest, it is when we have stood on the side of those fighting tyranny. That is where we must stand again."" McCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman, dismissed Putin as a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political rivals and threatened U.S. allies. President-elect Donald Trump and Putin spoke by telephone Monday to discuss future efforts to improve U.S.-Russian ties. Trump's office said in a statement that he is looking forward to having a ""strong and enduring relationship with Russia."" Trump spoke favorably of Putin during the presidential campaign, but he outlined few specifics as to how he would go about recalibrating ties with Russia that had become badly frayed during Barack Obama's presidency.  ""The Obama administration's last attempt at resetting relations with Russia culminated in Putin's invasion of Ukraine and military intervention in the Middle East,"" McCain said. Throughout the campaign, the Kremlin insisted that it had no favorites and rejected claims of interference in the U.S. election. Russia's state-controlled media, however, made no secret of their sympathy for Trump. McCain offered Trump only lukewarm support during the campaign and earlier this year backed former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's broadside against the real estate mogul. Romney warned that if the GOP chose Trump, ""the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished."" In a statement following Romney's speech, McCain said Republicans should ""think long and hard about who they want to be our next commander in chief and leader of the free world."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a foreign policy hawk and close friend of McCain's, said Tuesday he plans to hold hearings on ""Russia's misadventures throughout the world."" Among the areas he wants to examine is whether Russia had a role in the hacking of Democratic Party organizations before the election.  ""When it comes to all things Russia, I am going to be hard ass,"" said Graham, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that controls foreign aid spending. Republicans can't ""sit on the sidelines"" and let allegations that a foreign government interfered in a U.S. election go unanswered because it may have been temporarily beneficial to the GOP's cause, he said.  ""This is a defining moment for the country,"" Graham said. ""I want a good relationship with Russia, but things have to substantially change."" ___ Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rplardner Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
