Some relatives talked about how the trial delays hurt them. Others say it will be hard to deal with the proceedings in December as Christmas neared. They all asked for Monday's competency hearing to be open.  ""I really want you to consider what kind of a signal you are sending to the community,"" said Alana Jackson, granddaughter of Daniel Simmons Sr. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel said he understood their concerns. But after also hearing from lawyers hired by The Associated Press and other media outlets, he said his mind hadn't changed. The hearing will include extensive statements made by Roof that might not be allowed at his death penalty trial. But they could find their way to jurors and taint their view of the defendant just days before jury selection is set to begin, Gergel said.  ""None of us are served by not doing this the right way and then having to do the trial all over again,"" the judge said. Only prosecutors, defense attorneys, the judge and court staff will be inside the courtroom Monday for Roof's competency hearing. Gergel promised to issue his ruling on whether Roof, 22, understands the hate crime, obstruction of religion and other charges against him and can help his attorneys in his defense over the long Thanksgiving weekend. That way, if Roof is found competent, jury selection can begin Nov. 28. And if Roof is not competent, he will immediately be sent for treatment at a mental hospital at a federal prison until he regains competency. Roof's lawyers questioned his competency earlier this month on the eve of jury selection. They have carefully ensured their reasons for wondering about his mental state have not become public, and Gergel has issued several redacted motions and rulings. Prosecutors have filed court papers saying Roof appears competent to them because he has shown proper behavior toward court personnel and been attentive at other hearings. They wanted the competency hearing open. Having the hearing open could help the defense because it could help people understand what drove the defendant to commit such a terrible act, creating sympathy, said Carl Muller, a lawyer hired by several media outlets. But Gergel said he had another, quite modern reason to close the hearing. One question posed to potential jurors on a survey asked where they got their news. Gergel said he expected about 15 percent of them to say social media. Instead, it was closer to 70 percent, making it much harder to avoid seeing coverage from the case.  ""I have said to them, 'Let's try to avoid the newspaper of TV,'"" the judge said. ""But what if it pops up on their iPhone?"" Gergel insisted he isn't trying to hide anything. Along with a written ruling, the judge said he also will release a redacted transcript of the hearing.  ""As much as we can disclose, as soon as we can disclose,"" Gergel promised. ___ Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at http://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP.

Eight years after his massive rally in Berlin turned Obama into a global phenomenon, he wrapped up his final official visit to Europe on Thursday with a plaintive warning to Western democracies at a time of rising populism. Do not, he said, ""take for granted our system of government and our way of life."" He conceded things left undone -- saying it would be ""naive"" to envision a breakthrough in Syria's raging civil war before he relinquishes the White House. But, speaking to reporters beside a woman described as his closest European ally, Obama said he remained ""optimistic"" about Trump's presidency, despite having sharply criticized him during the long, bitter election campaign. Yet Obama also drew a stark picture of a world without even-handed U.S. leadership -- a world in which a divided United States would lose its way and disengage. The United States is ""the voice that insists on rules and norms governing international affairs, the voice that helps to steer the world away from war wherever possible; that's our voice more often than not,"" Obama said. ""And we're not always successful, but if that voice is absent or divided, we will live in a meaner, harsher and more troubled world.""      During a speech in Athens Nov. 16., President Obama spoke about the importance of the democratic process, even ""when you don't get the results you want."" (The Washington Post)    [Obama bids bittersweet farewell to closest partner on world stage]  Asked to weigh in on U.S. protesters turning out in cities across the nation, he said, ""I would not advise people who feel strongly or who are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign, I wouldn't advise them to be silent."" In a sign of their close ties, Obama met both Wednesday and Thursday with Merkel, a centrist leader whom observers see as heir apparent to his legacy as the leading global advocate of liberal democracy. On Friday, the pair are set to convene with a broader group of leaders, including the heads of France, Britain, Italy and Spain at a time when the continent is unsettled by the U.S. transition of power. One of the thorniest issues: Trump's overtures toward a newly belligerent Russia. Obama challenged Trump to ""stand up to Russia"" at the right times. ""My hope is he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or violates international norms or leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in countries like Syria, that we just do what is convenient at the time,"" he said. Obama said he was heartened by Trump's recent recognition of the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Merkel, for her part, said she recognized that Germany could contribute more toward security -- an apparent response to Trump's calls for allies to shoulder more of their own defense. Yet ahead of their encounter with the media, the pair also delivered what appeared to be a joint rebuttal to Trump's most populist foreign policy pledges. They never mentioned Trump by name, but called in a joint op-ed article published in the German weekly WirtschaftsWoche for more transatlantic cooperation on a range of issues including free trade, security, climate change and fighting inequity and intolerance.         1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

On the campaign trail, Trump derided her open-door policy on refugees, saying it was ""ruining"" Germany. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier -- poised to win the German presidency next year -- has described Trump as a ""hate preacher."" And while global leaders appear to be rushing to congratulate Trump, Merkel, considered the European Union's most influential leader, is taking a cooler approach.  [Merkel congratulates/warns Trump]  She reiterated her belief Thursday that the U.S. relationship was the cornerstone of Germany's strategic future. But as she did in an earlier note to Trump, she cautioned that cooperation should be based on ""a common platform of democracy, freedom, advocacy for human rights all over the world and championing the open and liberal world order."" Obama and Merkel said Thursday that globalization and rapid advances in technology have left voters behind in both their nations, but they argued that there is no going back to ""pre-globalization"" times. They condemned the march of populism on both sides of the Atlantic, with Merkel defining it as ""people looking for simple or negative answers."" Obama also took aim at the spread of false news, a subject of increasing scrutiny in the United States and overseas.  ""There's so much active misinformation,"" Obama said, adding, ""It's packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television."" For Obama, Merkel is something of a political soul mate. No other world leader so closely matches Obama's ideology of tireless diplomacy with an emphasis on human rights, tolerance and equality. Sharing similar temperaments, Merkel and Obama forged a friendship that helped broker several major agreements -- including a deal to curb Iran's nuclear program and sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine. Merkel has not yet said whether she will seek reelection in national elections next year, but the RND newspaper network, citing unnamed party sources, reported Thursday that she would announce her decision Sunday. Some of her close allies have suggested she will run.   [Donald Trump's stunning flip-flop on Angela Merkel]  Describing their ties as a ""friendship,"" Obama joked that if he were German, he ""might vote"" for Merkel, whom he flatteringly described as ""tough."" When he suggested he might come back as a private citizen to attend Oktoberfest, Merkel replied, deadpan, ""Well, we have freedom of movement."" It is perhaps fitting that Obama bids farewell to Europe in Germany, the nation where his outdoor rally as a candidate in 2008 inspired millions. Although he has had ups and downs with the public here, Germans appeared to turn nostalgic during his last trip. ""Looking back, it now slowly sinks in that we fared very well with Obama,"" the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper said in an editorial Thursday. ""Yes, he got the Nobel Peace Prize far too early. He didn't shut Guantanamo. He couldn't pacify Syria. But still this president had an important impact on the relationship with Europe. . . . He actually practiced the 'common leadership' that his predecessors only spoke about in abstract terms.""   Nakamura reported from Washington.

At a national meeting of the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish civil rights group, about 1,000 people listened to talks expressing shock at the hatred expressed during the presidential campaign and questioned what they thought was a high-level of acceptance by other Americans.  ""I'm struggling right now in this American moment,"" said Yehuda Kurtzer, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America, an education and research organization, in his talk at the event. ""I wonder whether I have been -- and I think the answer is probably yes -- a little bit naive."" During this past year, anti-Semitic imagery proliferated on social media, Jewish journalists were targeted and longstanding anti-Jewish conspiracy theories got a fresh airing. Much of the bias originated with the alt-right, or alternative right, a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It's often associated with far right efforts to preserve ""white identity,"" oppose multiculturalism and defend ""Western values."" In addition to the online intimidation, reports of anti-Semitic vandalism and other attacks have risen. Last week, the day after the election, a Philadelphia storefront was sprayed with a swastika and the words ""Sieg Heil 2106,"" which means ""Hail Victory,"" a common Nazi chant, and the word ""Trump,"" with a swastika replacing the ""T."" These developments have stunned U.S. Jewish leaders, who in recent years had been more focused on anti-Semitism in Europe and on addressing complaints of anti-Jewish bias on college campuses amid the debate over the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. In a sign of the depth of American Jewish anxiety about anti-Semitism, ADL officials said donations to their organization increased 50-fold in the days immediately after the election and a large majority of the money came from first-time donors. Every one of their regional offices reported an uptick in calls from people wanting to donate or volunteer, the ADL said.  ""We must not be silent, we must raise our voices, we must act, and to act we must understand what we are up against,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of ADL, opening the meeting in Manhattan. As the presidential race intensified, Jews started seeing their names bracketed with a series of parentheses in harassing tweets, signaling that the person had been identified as a Jew. The image became known as the Jewish cowbell and its source was traced to neo-Nazis and white nationalists. The ADL investigated the harassment and found more than 800 journalists had suffered anti-Semitic attacks on Twitter during the election, mostly from anonymous Twitter accounts, although some belonged to white supremacists. In a common example of the reporters' experiences, Jane Eisner, editor-in-chief of the Forward, an influential Jewish newspaper that extensively covered the election, said she received an email the morning after the second presidential debate with an image of a Nazi solder pointing a gun at her head, which was Photoshopped onto a concentration camp uniform. Donald Trump's campaign came under scrutiny since much of the harassment came from accounts tied to his supporters. Trump drew direct criticism last July when he tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton's face with a six-pointed star, a pile of hundred dollar bills and the words ""most corrupt candidate ever."" The star was in the shape of the Jewish Star of David and was widely condemned as anti-Semitic. Trump's campaign said it was a sheriff's badge. Last month, Trump gave a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, in which he accused Clinton of holding secret meetings with bankers in a conspiracy to undermine U.S. sovereignty. The ADL said that whether intentional or not, Trump had reflected a classic anti-Semitic theme of Jewish control of banks. The president-elect's daughter Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who is now one of his top advisers, are Orthodox Jews. Kushner has defended Trump against allegations of bias. The issue erupted anew when Trump announced far-right publishing executive Stephen Bannon as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway called the accusations against Bannon ""very unfair."" Some Jewish groups have defended Bannon, including the hawkish Zionist Organization of America. Bernie Marcus, a founder of The Home Depot Inc. and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, said in a statement that Bannon was ""a passionate Zionist and supporter of Israel."" Marcus called the condemnations of Bannon an attempt to undermine the incoming administration. Seventy-one percent of Jews voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. Greenblatt worked in the Obama administration. Still, Jonathan Sarna, a Brandeis University professor and historian of American Judaism, said it would be wrong to attribute the criticisms of Trump appointments or his supporters to partisanship. ""I don't know anybody who is looking at this in a serious way who says nothing has changed,"" in regard to the level of anti-Semitism, Sarna said.  ""American Jews assumed that anti-Semitism had largely been overcome,"" he said. ""And then all of a sudden, unexpectedly, anti-Semitism of a virulent kind came roaring back.""

A couple of hundred protesters marched around downtown Bismarck on Thursday, prompting police to temporarily shut down a couple of streets. Police spokesman Sgt. Mark Buschena (boo-SHEE'-nuh) says eight people were arrested, including a man who allegedly resisted arrest, spit at officers and yanked on an officer's gun holster. Six others were arrested on criminal trespass charges, and another was arrested on a California warrant. Protesters have targeted numerous sites in Bismarck and neighboring Mandan since Monday, including the state Capitol and the state-owned Bank of North Dakota. About 500 people have been arrested since August in protests against the $3.8 billion pipeline that's to carry North Dakota oil to Illinois. ___ 12:25 p.m. An administrative law judge has been appointed to oversee a potential hearing on whether the company building the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline violated orders from North Dakota regulators. The state Public Service Commission last week proposed a fine of at least $15,000 against a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners. The PSC says the company in October failed to get approval to continue with pipeline work after diverting construction around tribal artifacts found along the pipeline route. The State Historic Preservation Office concurred with the company's plan, and ETP has said it didn't do anything wrong. It can agree to a fine or request a hearing to fight one. State Office of Administrative Hearings Director Timothy Dawson says any hearing likely wouldn't be until mid-December. ___ 12:15 p.m. A North Dakota legislative committee has voted to forego formal events at the state Capitol due to security reasons involving the Dakota Access pipeline protests, including a biennial tribal address. Thursday's 10-3 vote means the Legislature will not allow presentations from the state's chief justice and Native American tribal leaders when lawmakers reconvene in January. The measure exempts the governor's State of the State address. Republican House Majority Leader Al Carlson says ongoing protests of the Dakota Access pipeline have ""significantly strained"" the state Highway Patrol, which provides security at the state Capitol. Democrats on the North Dakota Legislative Committee opposed the motion. Rolla Rep. Marvin Nelson says scrubbing the traditional tribal address is not going to ""help further relations"" those who oppose the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Slager, who is white, is charged with murder in the shooting death of the 50-year-old Scott, a black motorist who was unarmed when he ran from the officer in April 2015. Scott was shot five times in the back in a shooting captured on cellphone video that was shared on the internet and stunned the nation. Forensics video analyst Grant Fredericks testified that he used computers to enhance the video to stabilize it and make it clearer. Although the video shown to the jury was shaky and blurry in spots, Fredericks said it shows Scott on his side with his arm around Slager's upper body. He said Slager's left hand can be seen holding Scott's wrist and there are Taser wires tangled around Slager before the shooting. The defense contends the two men wrestled and Scott got control of the officer's stun gun before the shooting. Fredericks combined cellphone video, dashcam video and audio and police radio audio to create a timeline of the shooting. A prosecution witness on Wednesday made a similar presentation that also included aerial footage of the incident scene recorded by a drone. Fredericks testified the prosecution video was misleading because the software used over-processed the video and that some video frames were stretched, making it appear Scott was farther away from Slager than he was at the time of the shooting. Fredericks was not allowed to testify about what he thought Slager and Scott said to each other during the incident. Slager can be clearly heard on enhanced audio shouting ""Taser! Taser! Taser!"" before firing his stun gun at Scott. Other voices were not so clear. With the jury out of the courtroom, a defense attorney handed a transcription to Circuit Judge Clifton Newman who read it and said the defense interpretation of the audio included Scott cursing at the police and Slager saying ""let go of my Taser or I'm going to have to shoot you."" But Newman ruled the evidence was hearsay because a defense audio expert, not Fredericks himself, has determined what the men may have been saying. Eleven white jurors and one black juror are hearing the case. Newman, who is black, on Thursday appointed the black juror as jury foreman. The trial resumes Monday. Court adjourned early Thursday, and there is no court Friday because the judge has a scheduling conflict. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Army Spc. Andre Shepherd deserted from his military base in southern Germany in 2007, claiming he wanted to avoid returning to Iraq where he feared being involved in war crimes. The 39-year-old, who has permanent residency in Germany because he is married to a German woman, took his case to court after German authorities rejected the asylum bid. The Munich administrative court noted in its ruling that the Apache helicopter mechanic had repeatedly re-enlisted with the U.S. military. Shepherd's lawyer plans to appeal the verdict, Germany's dpa news agency reported. In a statement sent to The Associated Press, the U.S. Army in Europe said it was aware of the case but wasn't seeking to participate in the legal proceedings.  ""We do not, as a general policy, proactively pursue deserters,"" the statement said.

The recommendation is among many unveiled Thursday by a state board that Gov. Rick Snyder tasked with proposing a strategy to protect children from all sources of lead poisoning. The emergency in Flint stems from old lead pipes contaminating the water after the city was switched in 2014 from Detroit's water system to improperly treated Flint River water while under state financial management. But lead poisoning is more frequently linked to paint and dust in older housing and soil. The toxin was banned from paint in 1978. The Child Lead Poisoning Elimination Board's report calls for the screening of all children for lead by the time they turn 1 and again between ages 2 and 3. Such testing is currently only required for low-income kids in the Medicaid or Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs. Under the federal health care law, lead screening for children at risk of exposure is considered a preventive service for which insurers cannot apply copays, deductibles or coinsurance. The report also recommends requiring that a lead inspection and risk assessment be done when any house built before 1978 is sold or transferred, unless lead in the home has already been fully addressed. If lead hazards were found, abatement would be required at the point of sale or transfer. In newer homes, the dust, soil and water would have to be tested. The owner would be required to disclose the information to a future buyer or renter. Lt. Brian Calley, who chairs the board, said ""great strides"" were made when lead was removed from paint and gasoline decades ago but that since then lead-prevention efforts ""kind of fell off the radar."" The current focus is on responding when kids have elevated levels of lead in their blood.  ""That's just not good enough on its own,"" Calley said Thursday. ""Preventing the poisoning from happening in the first place ... is where we want to shift the focus."" The report says blood-lead screening rates are ""very low"" and cites inadequate federal and state funding, which has led to a depleted local public health infrastructure that is unable to fully apply current laws and regulations. Calley, who said it will take ""a generation"" to implement the proposals, pointed to the U.S. government's ""huge"" approval this week of a waiver so Michigan can spend $119 million in predominantly federal money over five years to remove lead hazards from the homes of low-income residents in Flint and other communities. The Snyder administration also plans to propose lead-prevention funding in the next state budget. According to the report, identified cases of child lead poisoning have declined significantly in Michigan. In 1998, 44 percent of children under age 6 who were tested had elevated blood-lead levels. It was 3.4 percent in 2015, or nearly 4,800 children of about 141,000 tested. But Calley cautioned that only universal screening of young children and full reporting of results to a surveillance system for data analysis will help pinpoint the actual prevalence of lead exposure. About 38 percent of all Michigan 1- and 2-year-olds were tested last year. It was not immediately known how many states require universal screening. Massachusetts has such a requirement, and Maryland last year announced a plan calling for all children there to be tested at ages 1 and 2. The 12-member board includes top officials in the Snyder administration and outside experts such as Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, who helped expose Flint's crisis more than a year ago after state officials initially dismissed her findings. She said universal lead screening of children was done in the past, but that ""the world of medicine and public health thought we took care of lead"" only to learn since that there is no safe level.  ""We need to know where our children are that are being exposed so that we can identify target areas and then go back to that primary prevention work,"" Hanna-Attisha said. Also Thursday, state attorneys asked a federal judge in Detroit to halt his order that bottled water be delivered to lead-tainted homes in Flint unless residents opt out or officials verify that a filter has been properly installed. They said the injunction issued last week ""far exceeds"" what is necessary to ensure that residents have safe drinking water, and the state is likely to succeed on appeal. Henry Henderson, Midwest director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said trying to delay the order ""is an obvious insult to the people of Flint, whose tap water has been contaminated with lead for more than two years."" ___ Online: Child Lead Poisoning Eliminate Board report: http://bit.ly/2g2esFU ___ Follow David Eggert on Twitter at http://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/author/david-eggert Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a Benton County judge's trespassing order against the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, but modified the injunction to cover only activities such as picketing, demonstrations and flash mobs against the Bentonville-based company.  ""We agree with the union that the circuit court's injunction and declaration encompassing all non-shopping activity or conduct is simply too broad,"" the court said in its ruling. The union and its affiliate group, the Organization United for Respect at Wal-Mart, had argued that the National Labor Relations Board, not the Benton County judge, should have jurisdiction over the matter. Justices disagreed and noted that appellate courts in several other states have rejected that argument.  ""We are pleased at the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to narrow the overbroad order,"" Randy Parraz, campaign director for the union's Making Change at Wal-Mart campaign, said in a statement. ""Make no mistake, Making Change at Walmart will continue to fight for a better life for the millions of hard-working Walmart employees in every state across this country whose economic struggles have been long forgotten or ignored by Walmart and so many others."" Wal-Mart sued the union over the demonstrations, which it said has included flash mobs where demonstrators have banged on pots and pans and marched and chanted through its stores. Other activities have included rallies and picketing at its stores and offices, the company said. The retail giant has filed similar suits against the union in Florida and Texas in recent years.  ""We appreciate the court protecting property rights and upholding our right to seek enforcement of the trespass laws against unions in these situations,"" Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in an email. ""As the court's opinion notes, other states have agreed with this approach."" The union had argued that the company's trespassing complaint in Arkansas was nearly identical to one it had also filed with the national board. An attorney for Wal-Mart told the court last month that trespassing was a state issue and was properly before the state judge. In a separate opinion, Justice Josephine Linker Hart wrote that she agreed that the original trespassing order was too broad but believed justices should have sent the case back to the lower court rather than rewrite it themselves.  ""Further, picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, hand-billing and solicitation are all protected activities under the right circumstances,"" she wrote. ""It behooves this court to return this case to the circuit court where an order that clearly does not run afoul of the National Labor Relations Act can be crafted with the assistance of the litigants."" ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The national exit surveys' deeply flawed methodology distorts the Latino vote. Even the exits, however, find that the Latino electorate gave a supermajority of its vote to Clinton. Figuring in the increase in Latino voters, Donald Trump received only 18 percent of the Latino vote, the lowest level on record for any presidential candidate. Here's how we did our research Exit polls get results from a small, nonrepresentative sample of a handful of precincts. By contrast, the Latino Decisions election eve poll includes a random statewide sample of all Latino voters across each state. The survey was available in English or Spanish from point of first contact. Random sampling is the single-most important feature of accurate polling; bilingual polling is critical in the Latino community. Further, our data are then weighted to match the census for the correct geographic dispersion, age, education and gender of Latino voters.   [What a President Trump means for foreign policy]   Our Election Eve Poll included a minimum of 400 completed interviews of Latino voters in each of 11 states, a minimum of 800 in the heavily Latino Florida, another 400 across the remaining 38 states, for a total of 5600 interviews. All the interviews were dispersed geographically in keeping with the distribution of the Latino population. As a result, they are more reliable than exit interviews, which are necessarily clustered in a few specific precincts. For all these reasons, our results differ significantly from those of exit polls and, from a social science perspective, are more accurate and reliable. We are calling on the exit polls to reveal the exact methodology and demographics of their Latino sample so that those can be compared. More Latinos voted than ever before Our LD Turnout Predict tool estimates that 13.1 million to 14.7 million Latinos cast ballots in the 2016 election. That's a significant increase from the 11.2 million Latino votes cast in 2012.   [How the gender gap doomed Hillary Clinton]   Latinos turned out in high numbers, and they turned out early, outpacing early voting numbers from 2012 in essentially all key battleground states. That includes Florida, where their early vote numbers increased by nearly 90 percent from 2012. We saw similar growth in every heavily Latino county in Texas. For instance, in the strongly 90 percent Latino counties in the Rio Grande Valley, turnout increased 4 to 10 percent over 2012. Similarly, in heavily Latino precincts across Florida's Miami and Osceola counties, voter participation increased from 6 to 16 points. In New Mexico, precincts in Las Cruces that are 99 percent Latino showed consistent increases in voter turnout in 2016 over 2012. The ""real world"" election result data from across the country corroborates what we have been seeing all year in our polling data: Latinos were more enthusiastic about voting in 2016. When we look at the numbers from our Election Eve Poll, for example, we found that an all-time high of 53 percent of Latino voters nationwide voted early either by mail/absentee ballot (24 percent) or through an early voting location (29 percent), corroborating the early vote numbers reported before Election Day. In the final NALEO/Telemundo tracking poll, 76 percent said voting in 2016 was more important than any other election in their lives. They voted because they feared a President Trump Our polling throughout the election season indicated that the high levels of Latino enthusiasm about voting were driven largely by fear of a Trump victory, which we have called ""Trump Bump."" Trump's anti-Mexican and anti-immigrant comments throughout the campaign season appeared to energize the Latino electorate. Our Election Eve Poll finds that 55 percent of Latino voters stated that Trump was ""hostile"" toward Latinos or Hispanics and 29 percent said he ""did not care too much"" about Latinos. In 2012, only 18 percent viewed Romney as ""hostile"" while 56 percent said he ""did not care"" about Latinos.   [How Trump's election will affect U.S.-Russian relations]   In a poll we conducted immediately after the Republican National Convention, more than 80 percent of Latinos said the themes of the convention were anti-Latino and offensive -- 80 percent! Further, we found that 20 percent of 2016's Latino voters were exercising the franchise for the first time. That was true for more than a third of North Carolina's Latino voters. Latinos voted overwhelmingly for Clinton Nationally, Clinton received a record-high 79 percent to 18 percent for Trump, with 3 percent voting for one of the third-party candidates. This 61 percent gap is the largest we have recorded at Latino Decisions, outpacing the 2012 Obama advantage over Romney, at 75 to 23 percent. That varied by state. Latino support was at 88 percent in New York, and well above 80 percent across every state except for Florida. In Florida, influenced by the more conservative Cuban vote, Clinton won 67 percent and Trump 31 percent -- which still gave her a large increase over Obama, who won Florida Latinos 58 to 40 percent.   [When the White House changes hands, it's a dangerous time for foreign policy]   In heavily Latino counties, that preference was even more pronounced. For instance, Starr County, Tex., is 96 percent Latino; there, Trump won just 19 percent of all votes cast. In Florida's Miami-Dade County, the heavily Cuban precinct 419 -- which had cast only 28 percent votes for Obama -- jumped to 49 percent for Clinton, a 21 point increase. In the heavily Puerto Rican precinct 210 in Kissimee, Fla., Clinton defeated Trump 80 percent to 17 percent. In New Mexico's Las Cruces, precinct 80 cast only 9 percent of its votes for Trump. And in Milwaukee District 12, precinct 233, which is 77 percent Latino, the vote was 88 percent for Clinton to 9 percent for Trump. There are literally thousands of similar results across majority-Latino precincts in the country. The national exit polls apparently did not conduct any interviews in these Latino enclaves. Results have been consistent for months Our findings over the past several months have been highly consistent. Clinton was running far ahead of Trump with Latino voters throughout the election, with little fluctuation. Latino voters made up their minds early. When asked when they decided which presidential candidate they would vote for, 78 percent said they did so over the summer or earlier. Trump's immigration policy pronouncements began when he came down the escalator to announce his campaign and called Mexicans rapists and criminals. Latino voters took note from day one. Gabriel R.

(Evan Vucci/Associated Press)  I can't think of any good reason Donald Trump hasn't denounced the overt anti-Semitism of some of his fervent supporters, or the online bullying and threatening of Jewish critics. Nevertheless, there seems scant evidence that Trump is personally anti-Semitic, and some to the contrary. Many fervent anti-Semites seem to adore Trump, but he hasn't returned the favor. Not everyone agrees, however, that the Trump campaign isn't intentionally stoking anti-Semitism. The Post's Dana Milbank, reflecting widespread criticism in progressive circles, writes: On Friday, [Trump] released a closing ad for his campaign repeating offending lines from that speech, this time illustrated with images of prominent Jews: financier George Soros (accompanying the words ""those who control the levers of power""), Fed Chair Janet Yellen (with the words ""global special interests"") and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein (following the ""global power structure"" quote). The ad shows Hillary Clinton and says she partners ""with these people who don't have your good in mind."" I watched the ad when I first heard of the controversy, and while I can't logically rule out the possibility that someone intentionally chose to obliquely satisfy their anti-Semitic urges by including Yellen et al. in the ad, I found it hard to credit Milbank's claim that the ad shows that ""anti-Semitism is no longer an undertone of Trump's campaign. It's the melody."" Indeed, I doubt I would have noticed any potential anti-Semitic implications of the ad at all, had I not been alerted to them. First, and in contrast to almost every article I've read about the ad, suggesting that Jews were somehow featured, the Jews in the ad only appear for a total of about four seconds in a two-minute ad. Second, only Yellen and Soros are identified by name. I doubt 1 in 20 voters even knows who Yellen is, much less her ethnic background. Moreover, neither has a recognizably Jewish name -- if you were going for the anti-Semitic vote, why not use Clinton supporters far more well-known and identifiably Jewish, such as Steven Spielberg, Joe Lieberman, or even Sarah Silverman? I didn't know Yellen is Jewish. Third, Lloyd Blankfein is pictured, but not identified by name. How many voters would recognize Blankfein? I didn't. And how many of those know he's Jewish? Again, I didn't.    One Facebook friend suggested that the ad wasn't meant to appeal to the run-of-the-mill anti-Semite who doesn't know Yellen from a hole in the head, but to the hardcore white-supremacist types who keep track of important Jews and would even recognize Blankfein. But why waste your campaign's money with appeals to a group that likely numbers in the tens of thousands when there are literally millions of undecided voters still at large? Even more puzzling, why would you attack Jewish bankers to appeal to the best-informed segment of white supremacist extremists the same weekend you float the name of a Jewish banker, Steven Mnuchin, formerly of Blankfein's Goldman Sachs, as a possible Treasury secretary? Are the white supremacists supposed to be smart enough recognize Blankfein as a Jew, but not smart enough to know Mnuchin is a Jewish name, or to Google him? Of course, you might instead focus on this campaign ad, the focus of which is attacking Wall Street in general and the obviously Jewish-sounding Goldman Sachs in particular for ""rigging"" American politics.    Oops! That's a Bernie Sanders ad. Nor was this an anomaly, as Sanders's attacks on ""a handful of people on Wall Street [who] have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country"" were a mainstay of his campaign. While I disagree with the accusation in both instances, I can see the case that both Sanders's and Trump's ads played to varying degrees to latent anti-Semitic sentiment. I can't, however, understand how any political commentator, or ""defense"" organization such as the ADL, could call out Trump's alleged anti-Semitic ad after having been completely silent about Sanders's consistent attacks on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs and, in fact, Blankfein in particular. And yet if anyone influential who is now criticizing Trump also criticized Sanders for similar sins, I haven't been able to find it. Which makes one suspect that one's priors about Trump and Sanders are playing more of a role here than the objective content of their ads. As readers know, I despise Donald Trump. His campaign has often appealed to the worst instincts of the electorate. I hate to even write this post, lest it be seen as supportive of Trump. But judging by my Facebook feed, wildly exaggerated/double-standard criticism of Trump tempts a lot of reluctant conservatives to vote for Trump, as it reminds them of the unfairness all non-progressive politicians face from the establishment. So I think it's worth noting that there is no contradiction between being a NeverTrumper, and finding certain specific criticisms of Trump, including the one at issue here, to be exaggerated at best. DISCLOSURE: I'm voting for Gary Johnson.  "
