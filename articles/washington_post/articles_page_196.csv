It said a 26-year-old was shot and killed Friday. The Israeli military said dozens of Palestinians breached the buffer zone, damaged the fence and ""attempted to infiltrate Israel."" It said forces at the scene fired warning shots in the air to disperse them and that it is investigating the incident. The incident is the latest in over a year of violence. Palestinians have killed 36 Israelis and two visiting Americans in that time. Over 225 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, most of them said by Israel to be attackers Clashes erupt from time to time at the border after Friday prayers.

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) has been appointed to be the next attorney general. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Sen. Jeff Sessions. Rep. Mike Pompeo. Rudolph W. Giuliani. Of the 66 names we've heard have been floated or confirmed for President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet, 85 percent so far belong to men. They're vastly white. Many sprang from the private sector. Many represent hard-right Washington. (Check out the full list here.) This assembly, of course, is highly tentative. Trump is expected to pick 22 future leaders of the government by Inauguration Day, and we're still two months away. It's too early to say whether the next administration will be more gender-mixed or a total boy's club.  By Friday, Trump's candidate roster featured 10 women. They include South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Arizona governor Jan Brewer and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. They're all white, except for Haley, whose parents are Indian, and Sacramento first lady Michelle Rhee, the daughter of South Korean immigrants.  Trump the real estate executive has said that he filled top roles with women. Trump the presidential candidate announced an economic advisory team of 13 white men. The Trump campaign did not respond to The Washington Post's requests for comment.  Critics say the look of Trump's roster doesn't reflect the American people. ""That's not just politically incorrect -- it will lead to poorer decision making,"" wrote Valerie M. Hudson and Christina Asquith this week for Newsweek. ""And given that Trump has said he plans to expand the U.S. military and take a harder-line approach towards adversaries such as ISIS, it's also potentially dangerous."" Not that President Obama's Cabinet perfectly matched the population that voted him into the White House: Thirty-two percent of his administration is female. George W. Bush's team during his second term as president, meanwhile, was 18 percent female. Last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau built a cabinet with an equal number of men and women. When asked why, he said, ""Because it's 2015.""  ""By advancing these types of policies, we allow the people best suited to lead to rise up without being hampered by biases,"" economist Florence Kondylis said of Trudeau's decision.  Hillary Clinton had pledged to do the same. She told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in May, ""I am going to have a Cabinet that looks like America, and 50 percent of America is women, right?"" Research from Carnegie Mellon and MIT suggests that mixed-gender groups more skillfully solve problems than all-male groups, largely because diversity protects against perilous blind spots and women generally score higher on social intelligence tests. Psychologists Anita Woolley, Thomas Malone and Christopher Chabris knew individuals varied in their cognitive ability. They wanted to understand whether some groups, like some humans, were smarter than others. They found in a 2011 study that groups with more women tended to perform better than groups with mostly men.  ""In theory, yes, the 10 smartest people could make the smartest group, but it wouldn't be just because they were the most intelligent individuals,"" Wooley told the Harvard Business Review. ""What do you hear about great groups? Not that the members are all really smart but that they listen to each other. They share criticism constructively. They have open minds. They're not autocratic."" In other words, she said, they possess traits women, more often than men, are socially conditioned to develop.  Another study from Duke University found that male leaders are judged more harshly when they ask for help, so they may be more likely to act on an impulsive decision, rather than seek out counsel from people better versed in a subject.  In a relaxed environment, researchers haven't unearthed major differences in male and female decision-making. But Stephanie Preston, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, saw in her 2007 research that women, again and again, made more safe, advantageous decisions under pressure, while men, when faced with stress, were more likely to gamble and lose.

You don't get obsessive with hummus. He does. You don't research the long, weird history of nutmeg or put sumac in everything. He does. You never considered having spaghetti in the morning. He did -- and made it delicious. ""Why aren't we having pasta for breakfast? I don't understand why we don't do this?"" the TV chef and writer asked recently. You can find Brown at the intersection of food, science, history and theater. It's a weird place, as even he admits: ""I don't fit in anywhere."" He has a restless, inquisitive mind and a chemist's rigor. He blends his own red pepper flakes and yet knows how strange that is. ""I'm a freak,"" he confesses. Brown returns this fall with two typically idiosyncratic offerings: A cookbook of the unexpected stuff he eats at home and a live variety show that hits Broadway with a mix of unusual food demonstrations, puppets and songs.  ""EveryDayCook: This Time It's Personal,"" his eighth book and first in five years, has 100 quirky recipes, from mussels in miso to kimchi crabcakes. The recipes were adapted from memory; some were scribbled on cabinet doors.  ""Ostensibly, it's a self-portrait in food,"" he says. ""That is what I eat and cook. If you were to come over to my house, it would be something out of that book. I think I was at a point in life where it was time to do a self-portrait."" How Brown came up with one dish -- his breakfast carbonara -- is instructive: It was an accident. He had been intending to make biscuits and gravy with sausage but burned the biscuits. So he threw some leftover pasta into the gravy.  ""I started thinking, 'Wait a second, this isn't that far away from carbonara,'"" he recalled, and stated adding more ingredients. ""All of a sudden, I had a different dish. That was born of a complete goof on my part."" It was only after he saw the book's photos -- all taken by his assistant using an iPhone -- of the way he likes to serve his food that Brown, as he politely notes, ""was made mindful that I'm not normal.""  ""Not everyone plates their chips and salsa in a 1974 Mercury hubcap. Not everybody plates crackers in a Kodak slide carousel. I had not really reckoned with how odd I am,"" he says. ""If you don't like this book, odds are you don't like me. Because that's pretty much me."" There will be more of Brown on view on Broadway when his touring show ""Eat Your Science"" lands at the Barrymore Theatre. A former actor with a theater degree who did summer stock, Brown models his shows on ""The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour"" and describes it as ""culinary vaudeville.""  ""I can finally say to my mom, 'Yes, my theater degree did matter,'"" he jokes. Lee D. Marshall, a producer at MagicSpace Entertainment, says Brown's stage shows are funny and informative, drawing on his background as a writer, producer, cinematographer and comedian.  ""Most folks that are television chefs, they cook. He explains how things work,"" Marshall says. ""He can make making scrambled eggs the most interesting topic on the planet."" Brown says he doesn't get caught up in food trends and often doesn't trust them. He avoided jumping on the molecular gastronomy bandwagon a few years back because he really didn't care.  ""Nobody wakes up in the middle of the night craving soy sauce spheres. We wake up craving pizza. I'm far more interested in helping people get to the dishes they kind of already want,"" he says. Brown made his name with the quirky ""Good Eats"" on Food Network from 1999-2011. In each episode, Brown examined a new recipe or ingredient, the science behind it, the proper tools to use and its history. He plans on reviving the show as an online-only series. But though he's a star, Brown is leery of the Kitchen-Industrial Complex, telling fans they don't need to buy titanium corkscrews or an $8,000 pizza oven. On ""Good Eats,"" he insisted that every gadget do multiple tasks.  ""I have no endorsement deals and I don't have multiple homes,"" says Brown. ""At some point along the line, I decided authenticity above everything else."" He adds: ""I like empowering people."" His own tastes are, as you might expect, all over the map. He puts harissa and mayonnaise in his scrambled eggs, and adds curry to watermelon, suspecting that since India and the American South both have fearsome heat, they might have complementary flavors.  ""I'm pedantic, I guess, when it comes to my tastes,"" he says. ""I'm fascinated by Japanese food and, at the same time, I'd rather have a well-made Cuban (sandwich) than almost anything on earth. And I'm pretty sure french fries are the best food on earth."" ___ Online: http://altonbrown.com/ ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) arrives at Trump Tower on Monday in Manhattan. (Evan Vucci/AP)  The allegation that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) has said racially insensitive things has haunted President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general throughout his career. In fact, it almost derailed it. In 1986, Sessions was a 39-year-old U.S. attorney for Alabama when President Ronald Reagan's administration nominated him to serve as a federal judge. The position requires approval from the Senate. And as Sessions settled in for review by the Senate Judiciary Committee, his career in law was almost destroyed when former colleagues brought forward troubling accusations about things Sessions had said to them with regard to race. The accusations mostly came from (but were not limited to) Sessions's former deputy, Thomas Figures. He sent a letter to the Senate and reporters claiming his boss said insensitive things about black people, at times directly to him. Figures, who is black, said Sessions told him to be careful about what he said ''to white folks"" after Figures got into a heated argument with a white colleague. And Figures testified Sessions called him ""boy"" on multiple occasions. Figures also said Sessions had joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought its members were ""okay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana."" A Justice Department lawyer, J. Gerald Hebert, testified that Sessions had described the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union as ""un-American"" and ""Communist-inspired."" As he has his whole career, Sessions vigorously denied that he had or has any racial prejudice. Though he didn't specifically deny making any of the comments ascribed to him, Sessions told the Senate committee he had been quoted out of context. The New York Times reported at the time: ""Sessions acknowledged at the hearing that he once 'may have said something about the N.A.A.C.P. being un-American or Communist, but I meant no harm by it.'"" ""I am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create,"" Sessions testified. ""I am not a racist. I am not insensitive to blacks."" The damage, however, had been done. By the time the testimony was finished, Sessions's ""reputation was in tatters,"" wrote Isaac Stanley-Becker in The Post this July. Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.), then the leading Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the New York Times that after hearing Sessions's accusers out, his prospects for a nomination were ""bleak"" and Sessions appeared unfit for a federal judgeship. In the end, the Republican-controlled committee voted 10 to 8 to block Sessions's nomination, with two Republicans joining Democrats to stop it from going forward to a full vote in the Senate. At the time, CNN calculated, Sessions was only the second nominee in 50 years to be denied by the Senate for a federal judgeship. Sessions returned home, defeated but not destroyed. He went on to become attorney general of Alabama in 1994, and just two years later he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he has been ever since. He is quite popular in his home state: In subsequent reelections, Sessions has never won with less than 59 percent of the vote. In 2014, he ran unchallenged. In the ultimate ironic twist, Sessions now sits on the very same Senate committee that rejected him. Every so often, Sessions has reflected on that moment 30 years ago that almost destroyed his career. He told CNN in a 2009 interview that the accusations against him were ""heartbreaking."" And he told Stanley-Becker this summer: ""Racism is totally unacceptable in America. Everybody needs to be treated fairly and objectively."" Sessions hasn't been mired in a controversy since about his comments on race. But critics point to his voting record and the causes he has championed in the Senate to claim that Sessions harbors racial prejudice: He is one of the Senate's most hard-line anti-immigration lawmakers, and he has opposed the Voting Rights Act. The Southern Poverty Law Center's Heidi Beirich, who tracks hate speech, told Stanley-Becker that Sessions is guilty of it, and that his mere presence in Trump's inner circle is ""a tragedy for American politics."" Hebert, the former Justice Department lawyer who testified against Sessions in '86, told the New York Post on Friday that ""anybody who'd really put Jeff Sessions as head of the Justice Department with his record is not interested in uniting the country but dividing it further."" On the flip side, anti-illegal-immigration and immigration-reduction groups congratulated Sessions on the coming nomination. It's not clear whether the next time Sessions will sit before a Senate panel to be considered for a nomination -- likely early 2017 -- will shape up to be nearly as bumpy for him. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the current chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was among a number of Senate Republicans praising Sessions's fitness for the job.   I found out the rumor is FACT Sen Sessions is nominated to be AG I know he will be confirmed NOW I should get all my oversight Qs answered -- ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) November 18, 2016   But the soon-to-be top Senate Democrat, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) sounded an ominous tone about Sessions: I know Senator Sessions and we work out in the gym, but the fact that he is a Senator does not absolve him from answering tough questions in the confirmation process. Given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say. And key Senate Democrats on the Judiciary panel, such as California's Dianne Feinstein, are taking a much more cautious approach, essentially keeping their options open into how hard they want to go after Sessions for his troubles in '86.   Sen. Feinstein--who'll be top Judiciary Dem--sends shot across the bow in stmt on Sessions: ""Sometimes that means telling the president no."" pic.twitter.com/tVVco5PhcE -- Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) November 18, 2016   And here's outspoken liberal icon Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)   Elizabeth Warren says a Sessions AG nom means Trump is ""embracing the bigotry that fueled his campaign rallies."" pic.twitter.com/Yr2IILQDN9 -- Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) November 18, 2016   No matter how vigorously he denies accusations of racial prejudice, it seems, Sessions has been unable to live down what some of his colleagues said about him 30 years ago. And as Trump's pick to be the top U.S. law enforcement officer, the story that haunts him has come roaring back to life."

The German company said the job cuts, which account to around 5 percent of its global workforce, are part of a long-term plan to improve profitability and shift resources and investment to electric-powered vehicles and digital services. At a news conference at Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg, company officials said 23,000 of the job cuts will be in Germany and that the measures will save some 3.7 billion euros ($4 billion) a year from 2020. Volkswagen employs around 120,000 people at its namesake brand in Germany. The company also said it would be hiring for some 9,000 new positions related to new technology, and that some of those jobs could go to current employees. CEO Matthias Mueller said it was ""the biggest reform package in the history of our core brand."" In addition to Volkswagen, the company also makes cars under other brands including Porsche, Audi, SEAT, Skoda and Lamborghini. The announcement caps a difficult year for Volkswagen, which has been embroiled in an emissions-rigging scandal that damaged the company's reputation and cost it billions. In response, Volkswagen has agreed to pay $15 billion to U.S. authorities and owners of some 500,000 vehicles with software that turned off emissions controls. Around 11 million cars worldwide have the deceptive software. The scandal has been a spur for the company to address longstanding problems such as high fixed costs at its manufacturing locations in Germany and excessively top-down management that many say created an environment that enabled the cheating. Herbert Diess, head of the core Volkswagen brand, conceded that Volkswagen had let its costs rise and ""lost ground in terms of productivity."" The changes, he said, would make the company ""leaner and more efficient."" The cuts are aimed at addressing Volkswagen's longstanding cost issue. Volkswagen, with 624,000 employees around the world, sells roughly the same number of cars as Toyota and General Motors -- around 10 million a year. But Toyota does it with 349,000 workers and GM with 202,000. One reason often cited for VW's higher cost-base and headcount is the role that employee representatives play at the company. As at other large German companies, employees have half the seats on the board, a power they can use to resist moving production outside Germany or to suppliers. In addition, the state of Lower Saxony, where the headquarters is located, owns a stake in the company and tends to support employee interests as well. The cuts will mainly fall on its 120,000-strong factory workforce in Germany. Job cuts are also foreseen in Brazil and Argentina. The jobs will be reduced through voluntary departures such as early retirement and attrition. Labor representatives won a guarantee of no involuntary layoffs through 2025. The company has said it aims to cut nonessential costs and investments and shift resources toward battery-powered cars and internet-based services such as car-sharing and ride-sharing. The company had been slower than some competitors to move toward electric cars but has shifted its view after the scandal underlined diesel's limitations. Volkswagen now says it plans to introduce more than 30 electric-powered vehicles by 2025, and to sell 2 to 3 million of them a year. To make the job cuts, the company has cut a deal with its powerful worker representatives. Under the terms of the deal, Volkswagen has agreed to keep much of the future investment in new technology in Germany and to rely on voluntary departures such as early retirement, with no firings. Top employee representative Bernd Osterloh said ""the next generation of electric vehicles will be made here in Germany, not abroad."" Volkswagen's package of measures received a lukewarm welcome in markets. The company's share price closed down 0.8 percent at 128.05 euros, underperforming Germany's benchmark DAX stock index, which ended 0.2 percent lower. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/11/18/justice-is-served-by-the-appointment-of-jeff-sessions/	Justice is served by the appointment of Jeff Sessions	      President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)   Donald Trump's appointment of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general does a lot to signal the president-elect wants a no-nonsense, by-the-book Justice Department. Sessions has been my friend for 30 years and my senator for 20 years. His Justice Department will not meddle with local governments, it will be respectful and deferential to state legislatures and it won't look to make trouble with universities, school systems or private businesses. Importantly, Sessions's appointment tells the United States' beleaguered law enforcement agencies help is on the way. It also shows Trump wants to strike a blow to the corrosive, pretentious, sanctimonious political correctness his voters soundly rejected on Nov. 8. By making the appointment, Trump is confirming he dismisses the residual effects of the decades-old smear campaign the Democrats ran against Sessions when his nomination to be a federal judge was before the Senate for confirmation in 1986. It turns out the gods -- with Donald Trump's help -- are continuing to vindicate Sessions, who was attacked with condescending stereotypes Southerners and fair-minded people everywhere reject. Because of the Democrats' efforts to discredit him, Sessions wasn't confirmed -- but that same man was elected to the Senate, served with distinction on the Senate Judiciary Committee and now, it appears, will be America's next attorney general. It is also safe to assume that Sessions will be in the first chair when it comes to advising Trump on judicial appointments, and you can be sure that he will recommend real judicial scholars -- proven conservative judges and lawyers who have practical experience and a common-sense approach to interpreting the law as it is written and as it was intended. Laws will be enforced -- not created -- in a Sessions Justice Department. Jeff Sessions will be one of the adults in the room. He is tireless, studious, good-natured and a patriot. He does Alabama proud. Roll Tide!
6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/18/when-you-elect-a-white-nationalist-president-you-get-a-white-nationalist-presidency/	When you elect a white nationalist president, you get a white nationalist presidency	"      President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) to be CIA director, close allies say. Here's what we know about him. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)   Donald Trump announced three new appointments Friday: Michael Flynn for national security adviser, Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director and Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general. While Sessions is rightfully getting most of the attention, we have to look at Trump's emerging appointments in context. And that context is this: When you elect a white nationalist president, you get a white nationalist presidency.  It's telling that Pompeo, a hard-right tea partyer who has said that all Muslim American religious leaders are ""potentially complicit"" in terrorism, is the moderate in the group. You can be outraged at Trump's appointments -- not just these, but also that of Steve Bannon of the white nationalist website Breitbart News as his chief strategist -- and you should be. But you can't be surprised. This is who Trump was during the campaign, and this is who he's going to be.  Just to catch you up, Flynn, a retired general who was fired by President Obama a couple of years ago, is an unhinged Islamophobe who has called Islam ""a cancer"" and propagates insane conspiracy theories about sharia law spreading through America. In February, he tweeted an infantile anti-Islam video and wrote, ""Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others."" But he became Trump's closest military adviser mostly because he was one of the few retired generals who loudly embraced the candidate. The same is true of Sessions: He was the only senator who endorsed Trump in the primaries, and so earned vital points for loyalty. About the Alabama senator, I can't be more succinct than the lead of Ryan Reilly's article: The man who President-elect Donald Trump will nominate as the 84th attorney general of the United States was once rejected as a federal judge over allegations he called a black attorney ""boy,"" suggested a white lawyer working for black clients was a race traitor, joked that the only issue he had with the Ku Klux Klan was their drug use, and referred to civil rights groups as ""un-American"" organizations trying to ""force civil rights down the throats of people who were trying to put problems behind them."" Obama appointed the first African American attorney general, and then the first African American female attorney general. She will be succeeded by Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, named for the president of the Confederacy and a Confederate general. We should note that the case against Sessions isn't just about what he did prior to 1986. Ever since, he has been a fervent critic of civil rights and both illegal and legal immigration. In fact, there may be no more adamant opponent of immigration in the Senate. As Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) said in a statement today, ""No Senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, immigrants, and people of color than Sen. Sessions.""       President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)   What will the Justice Department look like under his leadership? Consider that Sessions's most notable case as a prosecutor before being nominated by Ronald Reagan to that federal judgeship was when he unsuccessfully prosecuted a former aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. for helping elderly African Americans vote absentee. Something tells me that the rights and concerns of white people are going to become a much higher priority at the Justice Department. While there are ways Trump is already betraying the voters who elected him, particularly with his eager embrace of lobbyists and Wall Street tycoons, when it comes to race they don't have much to fear. Trump's victory demonstrated the staggering power of a white nationalist appeal, and not because it drew in so many voters (let's not forget that Hillary Clinton got more votes than Trump, by 1.4 million and rising as of the latest count). The power of that appeal can be seen in what Trump voters were willing to overlook in order to vote for the white nationalist candidate. It's why, every time Trump said something awful or some new scandal was revealed, everyone who said ""Surely his candidacy is finished now"" was wrong. It's what kept him going strong when he questioned John McCain's service (the first thing people said would destroy him), when we learned about the scam that was Trump University, when we found out that he didn't pay federal taxes, and when we heard him on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women and then a dozen women came forward to say that he done what he said he did.  In every case, his supporters laughed it off. Trump's unapologetic embrace of white identity politics, coming after decades of Republicans who would only promote it through dog-whistles and implication, was so thrilling and empowering to them that there was almost nothing they couldn't accommodate themselves to, twisting the latest controversy around in their minds until it became evidence of Trump's virtue. Trump's white nationalism is what gave him the support of 81 percent of white evangelical Christians, despite his libertine lifestyle and disinterest in religion. It's what drove up turnout in all-white areas around the country. It's what made him the Republican nominee and what made him the president. It's who he is, and who he's always going to be. And the administration will be a reflection of the man."

The campaign to legalize marijuana achieved a major breakthrough, with victories in at least six states. In all, more than 150 measures appeared on statewide ballots in Tuesday's election. California, Nevada and Massachusetts approved measures legalizing the recreational use of marijuana, while Florida, Arkansas and North Dakota voted to allow pot for medical purposes. A recreational pot proposal lost in Arizona. The outcome of another in Maine was too close to call. Gun control was on the ballot in four states, including California, which already has some of the nation's toughest gun-related laws. Voters there approved a measure that will outlaw possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, require permits to buy ammunition and extend California's unique program that allows authorities to seize firearms from owners who bought guns legally but are no longer allowed to own them. Washington state approved a ballot measure that will allow judges to issue orders temporarily seizing guns from individuals who are deemed a threat. In Maine and Nevada, a group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent millions promoting ballot measures that would require background checks on nearly all gun sales and transfers. The measure was approved in Nevada but was rejected in Maine. With Congress unable to agree on an increase in the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, numerous states and cities have taken action on their own. In this election, Arizona, Colorado and Maine voters approved measures phasing in a $12 minimum hourly wages by 2020. In Washington state, where the minimum wage is $9.47 an hour, voters approved a measure raising that to $13.50 an hour by 2020. In Nebraska, voters reinstated the death penalty, reversing the Legislature's decision last year to repeal capital punishment. Nebraska has not executed an inmate since 1997. Ten men currently sit on death row. Overall, the results of the marijuana referendums were hailed as historic by legalization activists, given that California is the most populous state. Massachusetts became the first state east of the Rockies to join the movement. Florida, where the medical pot measure was backed by 71 percent of the voters, and Arkansas became the first states in the South with full-scale medical marijuana programs, which exist in 25 other states. Collectively, it was the closest the U.S. has ever come to a national referendum on marijuana, which remains prohibited under federal law.  ""These votes send a clear message to federal officials that it's time to stop arresting and incarcerating marijuana users,"" said Rob Kampia, executive director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project. The outcome will more than triple the number of Americans living in states where recreational pot is legal. The jurisdictions where that's already the case -- Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington state and the District of Columbia -- have less than 6 percent of the population. Nebraska was one of three states voting on capital punishment. California had two competing measures on its ballot, one to repeal its rarely used death penalty and the other to speed up appeals so convicted murderers are actually executed. The repeal measure was rejected; the reform measure received about 51 percent of the votes counted by Wednesday morning. Oklahoma residents approved a measure to make it harder to abolish capital punishment. It seeks to ensure the state has a way to execute prisoners even if a given method is blocked. Colorado voters approved a measure that will allow physicians to assist a terminally ill person in dying. That's already a practice in five other states. Coloradans defeated a proposal that would have set up the nation's first universal health care system. Among the other topics addressed by ballot measures: -- BILINGUAL EDUCATION: California voters repealed a nearly two-decade-old law that limited bilingual education in public schools. -- TAX HIKES: Oregon voters defeated a measure that would have imposed a 2.5 percent tax on corporate sales that exceed $25 million.

(Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)   LATROBE, Pa. -- Before midnight hit on Tuesday, it became clear to the regulars at Sharkey's Cafe that their guy, Donald Trump, would become the next president. As Fox News flashed new numbers on the screen, they took turns excitedly yelling out the victories.  ""If he wins, I want to change to CNN and watch them cry,"" said Kevin Somers, 54, a long-distance trucker who was having a Coors Light with his ex-wife and some friends.  Somers and more than a dozen others waited for Fox News to call the race and for Trump to give his victory speech. A few more people arrived and ordered drinks and pizza. They waited for another two hours. Closing time arrived and the bartenders started turning off televisions and sweeping up popcorn. ""If Trump wins tonight, I'm done with alcohol,"" said Shawn Gracie, 41, who lives in the area and was laid off from the Ford dealership in July. ""And go back on my diet. I feel like crap.""  [How Donald Trump broke the old rules of politics -- and won the White House]  This bar in southwestern Pennsylvania is in the heart of Trump Country and for months has been plastered with Trump signs. Everyone there that night was cheering for Trump to win, even though hours earlier they had mostly come to terms with the fact that the polls were probably right, and that Hillary Clinton would probably be their next president. While they love Trump, they hate Clinton even more -- and, that night, she wouldn't even allow them have a proper victory party.  Sitting in a booth, Margarita Rincon video-chatted with her daughter, who is a freshman at Kent State in Ohio. Rincon made a confession: She voted for Trump.  Her daughter, Margarita Douglas, groaned and rolled her eyes. She had begged her mother to vote for Clinton, telling her that Trump wants to deport immigrants like her and that he doesn't respect women. Rincon immigrated to the United States from Colombia two decades ago and has been a citizen for many years.  ""I tell her: I'm not illegal. That's only illegal people,"" said Rincon, 50, who works for a banquet facility. Rincon then excitedly started chanting: ""Trump! Trump! Trump!""  Her daughter responded: ""Noooooo."" She then flipped her camera to show two of her friends, who were also disappointed in the Trump win. But Douglas didn't request an absentee ballot and didn't vote.  ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" Rincon said again. It was after closing time when Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta came on the screen and told her supporters to go home and wait. ""She is done,"" Gracie said yelled. ""Ain't happening, Podesta."" Gracie soon decided to head home. Others followed him. They were sure Trump was the next president, but they wouldn't fully allow themselves to believe it.  It was a feeling that many wrestled with throughout the day.     Leslie Rossi is the creator and owner of the Trump House in Westmoreland County, Pa. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  Not far from this bar is a shrine to Trump and his movement, a farmhouse on state Route 982 that's painted like an American flag. Standing in the yard is a 14-foot-tall metal Trump. Throughout the day, Trump supporters cast their ballots at polling places across southwest Pennsylvania, then journeyed to the ""Trump House."" Many felt that their lives were about to change, even though the media, polls and pundits were still insisting their candidate had no chance.   [The media didn't want to believe Trump could win. So they looked the other way.]  ""I've never voted in my life until this,"" said Dave Fisher, 49, who used to make good money salvaging metal and taking it to processing plants in the Pittsburgh area. He saw that work dry up eight years ago, forcing him to work construction and a host of odd jobs for a fraction of the pay. ""There's never been anyone I really cared about. He put a spark in everything; he makes you want to be an American again, and that's what I've been looking for."" Fisher voted with his wife in their town of Belle Vernon early in the morning before driving about an hour northeast to the Trump House, and as they watched car after car pull into the makeshift parking lot near the pop-up political shrine, the couple said they didn't understand how he could lose. ""Everyone I talk to is Trump; very few are Hillary,"" said Charlotte Fisher, 52, an EMS communications officer. ""In our neighborhood, everything is Trump.""     The Trump House -- owned, run and financed by Leslie Rossi, a mother of eight who owns more than 60 properties in the area -- is equipped with spotlights and security cameras but no televisions. Those lingering in and around the house got their news from phones, scrolling through Facebook postings and text messages, and as the morning went by, the news seemed so uniformly good for Trump that Rossi and a few volunteers would quickly correct anyone who didn't express 100 percent certainty that he would win. ""I hope he wins,"" said Carlotta Harris, 70, who lives nearby and stopped by about 11 a.m. to get a yard sign to plant near her polling place. ""Get rid of the hope,"" said Barry Kinsey, a military veteran who volunteers at the house. ""He will be president. I know it. I know it in my military mind.""    Leslie Rossi hangs up a ""Deplorable"" shirt that fell from a doorway at the ""Trump House."" (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  As morning gave way to afternoon, though, optimism began giving way to suspicions of fraud, and some people began slowly building a case for why Trump might lose. There was a flurry of phone calls from people who heard that a polling station near St. Vincent College was making voters hide their Trump gear because it might be considered electioneering at the polls, although the poll workers stopped doing so after a series of complaints. There were stories -- usually heard from someone who heard it from someone else -- about malfunctioning voting machines. And there was even a vague report that some polling place in this county had voting machines removed for an unknown reason. Joyce Vargulish, a 77-year-old housekeeper who has worked for the same family for 54 years, said she heard from her boss about a woman he knows who claimed that her vote for Trump was mysteriously changed. ""She voted straight Republican. When she pulled the lever, it said: 'Thank you for voting Democrat,'"" said Vargulish, even though such a display does not appear when voting here. ""I told all of my family, because a lot of them never voted before, and I told them to be careful."" Vargulish said that she wears a Trump shirt every day, except for when she goes to church, and that her front yard is filled with Trump signs. Her daughter, she said, assured her that Trump would win in a landslide, but she was increasingly worried that he might lose. ""It's not about him. It's about her. I just cannot see her being president,"" Vargulish said, referring to Democrat Hillary Clinton as a yellow school bus rolled past with a handful of young boys hanging out the windows and chanting: ""Trump! Trump! Trump!""    Richard Larrabee said Obama isn't his president. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  Richard Larrabee, 69, overheard Vargulish and jumped in to share something that he had heard about Clinton: ""I just heard this morning that she's taking illegal immigrants on a bus from California, got them voting there, taking them to Nevada to vote again."" Rossi, the owner of Trump House, who has no affiliation with Trump's campaign or the Republican Party, has formed a relationship with Trump supporters in the region by handing out thousands of free Trump hats, T-shirts, bumper stickers and other merchandise. She has registered hundreds of people to vote and counseled those who have been told that they are deplorable for supporting Trump. ""I don't need Mr. Trump to tell me there's media bias or voter fraud, I have proof of it all around me in my small community,"" Rossi said. ""It's in my face. It's real."" The sun set, polls in other states closed and the initial optimism of the day, which had been supplanted by suspicion, was now changing again, this time into anxious excitement. Rossi celebrated having had 1,000 people visit so far since sunrise and sign her guest book. As the flow of cars was reduced to a trickle, she and two of her regular volunteers grabbed a Trump sign and went down to the road to wave at cars. Car after car honked. ""If they don't blow, they're Hillary people,"" she explained. As yet another car honked, Midge Stein, a 69-year-old Democrat who supports Trump, announced to the two other women: ""I think he's going to take it."" A car from Pittsburgh pulled up carrying Michael Loomis, a 52-year-old computer programmer who voted for Trump, and his friend, John Cihon, a 42-year-old utility company employee who voted for a third-party candidate. As soon as they arrived, Cihon sent a friend a text: ""I'm at the Trump House . . . There are no words."" Loomis wore a T-shirt labeling him a ""proud member of the basket of deplorables,"" and he introduced himself as ""a gay supporter of Trump."" He said that he was frustrated by the Affordable Care Act and that he liked Trump's tough stance on fighting Islamic State terrorists. He also said he liked Trump and described him as ""not completely stable,"" but in a good way. And then he said something that broke through the excitement: He wasn't sure that Trump would win. He had been watching the early-voting numbers, especially in Florida, and, to him, Clinton just seemed so far ahead. ""We won Florida,"" Rossi told him. ""We won in like a huge, huge way."" ""Trump won Florida?"" Loomis said. ""I can't believe that."" Loomis pulled up RealClearPolitics on his cellphone. The state had not been called yet -- Rosso was wrong about that -- but Trump was up with about 25 percent of votes having been counted. ""I mean, if he carries Florida, he's going to win this election,"" Loomis said. ""I did not expect him to win."" Just then, Cihon got a text and announced: ""He's winning the general right now."" Loomis hit refresh and saw the same thing in the preliminary results. ""Trump is ahead by 3 percent of the popular vote right now,"" he said. ""And that's a lot of the popular vote."" They stood there, hitting refresh over and over. With only a few hours to go until all of the polls closed, they were sure that it was only a matter of time. Trump was going to win. Everyone at Trump House believed it. Their lives really were going to change.

Judge Ros Piseth of the Phnom Penh Municipal Court found senator Hong Sok Hour, a member of country's main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, guilty of falsifying public documents, using fake documents and inciting chaos. Hong Sok Hour and his defense lawyer did not appear before the court, but Son Chhay, an opposition lawmaker who attended the hearing, told reporters that the conviction reflected the court's lack of independence. ""For me, I am already aware that this case is political motivated,"" Son Chhay said. Hong Sok Hour was arrested in August 2015 after Prime Minister Hun Sen accused him of treason for the online posting, which included the purported text of a 1979 treaty with Vietnam that declared that their mutual border would be dissolved. Hun Sen -- who was foreign minister at the time in a government installed by a Vietnamese occupation force that invaded Cambodia to oust the murderous Khmer Rouge regime -- insisted the treaty was forged. Hong Sok Hour is the latest opposition figure to run afoul of the law in what activists say is the willful use of the courts to suppress government critics. The case is one of several hanging over opposition leaders in what is generally seen as an attempt to disrupt their organizing efforts ahead of local elections next June. The next general election is not until the middle of 2018, but holding power at the local level is an advantage when national polls are held. On Friday, an appeals court upheld a five-month prison term for opposition leader Kem Sokha's refusal to twice answer a court summons, in a case involving his alleged mistress, but which his supporters say is politically motivated. A month ago, another opposition lawmaker, Um Sam Ann, who has been a strong critic of the government's handling of demarcating the border with Vietnam, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for his online postings.
