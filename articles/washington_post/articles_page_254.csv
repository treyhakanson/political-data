PETERSBURG, Russia -- A St. Petersburg stadium which will host a 2018 World Cup semifinal has been accused of breaking Russian rules on air quality. The construction site for the 69,000-seat arena in the city had levels of formaldehyde and ammonia in the air above permissible standards when measured in October, according to a report from a St. Petersburg state health inspection agency. The report, published by the St. Petersburg-based news site Fontanka, could not be independently verified by The Associated Press. The company responsible for overseeing the construction, Metrostroy, did not dispute Fontanka's allegations, but blamed any air quality violations on a previous contractor. It added levels were an ""intermediate"" measurement and ""taken during the active phase of construction and do not reflect the picture when the stadium enters service"" next month.

News outlets report the lawsuit was filed Wednesday, one year after 33-year-old John Livingston of Lillington was confronted by deputy Nicholas Kehagias while sitting on his front porch. Five other individuals have joined the lawsuit, which accuses Kehagias and two other deputies whose surnames begin with the letter K of calling themselves the ""KKK"" and training together in a type of ""fight club."" The deputy told The News & Observer of Raleigh in May that he feared for his life after his argument with Livingston turned physical and the man grabbed his Taser, shocking him for 20 seconds or more. A grand jury refused to indict him. The lawsuit says the autopsy showed multiple cuts opened up on Livingston's forehead and face during the assault, as well as multiple abrasions and impact bruises. It names six members of the Harnett County Sheriff's Office as defendants: former Sheriff Larry Rollins and current Sheriff Wayne Coats, Kehagias, and deputies Brandon Klingman, John Knight and John Werbelow. The department could not be immediately reached for comment. Separately, the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division has opened a criminal investigation into the operations of the sheriff's office. The lawsuit cites violations of the U.S. Constitution, which protects residents from unreasonable search and seizure by law enforcement. Excessive force and unwarranted entry are considered violations of the Fourth Amendment. The plaintiffs argue that supervisors ""knew or should have known"" about misconduct by Kehagias, and that if they had fired or reprimanded him, Livingston would not have been killed. Kehagias, who resigned in June, has said that critics have focused too intently on his foot being in the threshold of Livingston's door after being told he could not come inside. He said they're ""trying to nitpick a very small portion of this event that isn't something that I think is crucial to the matter."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The statement on Thursday says the disappearance of weapons from the Belgrade garrison was spotted during a regular checkup. It says the missing stock includes 70 handguns, five automatic rifles and two crates of ammunition. An investigation is underway, and officials didn't say when the discovery was made or for how long the weapons have been missing. Police on Wednesday reported the arrest of 10 suspected arms traffickers and a seizure of weapons, including rocket launchers, anti-tank mines and automatic guns. Arms smuggling has flourished in the Balkans following the 1990s wars. Some of the weapons used in last year's terror attacks in Paris originated in the Balkans. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Trump's meeting with Obama spanned 90 minutes, longer than originally scheduled. Obama said he was ""encouraged"" by Trump's willingness to work with his team during the transition of power, and the Republican called the president a ""very good man.""  ""I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including his counsel,"" Trump said from the Oval Office. He'll begin occupying the office on Jan. 20. While Trump noted that he and Obama had never met before, their political histories will forever be linked. Trump spent years perpetrating the lie that Obama was born outside the United States. The president campaigned aggressively against Trump during the 2016 campaign, warning that his election would put the republic at risk. But at least publicly, the two men appeared to put aside their animosity. As the meeting concluded and journalists scrambled out of the Oval Office, Obama smiled at his successor and explained the unfolding scene. ___ Russia eyes better ties with Trump; says contacts underway MOSCOW -- A top Russian diplomat and Vladimir Putin's spokesman said Thursday that Russian experts were in contact with some members of President-elect Donald Trump's staff during the presidential campaign, a period in which the United States accused Russia of hacking into Democratic Party emails systems. A spokeswoman for Trump denied the assertion, but it raised the ongoing suspicions about the president-elect's relationship with Putin's government that had dogged his campaign with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Russia is hopeful that a Trump presidency will herald improved relations with the United States. But, in a sign of the cold realism that Putin is known for, Moscow is not betting on an immediate drastic turnaround in the strained relationship. And while Trump himself has said he wants to be friends with Russia and join forces in the fight against terrorism, he has outlined few specifics as to how he would go about it. President Barack Obama began his presidency with a similar goal, only to see progress unravel over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press in an interview in New York that Russian experts had contacts with people in both the Trump and Clinton campaigns. He said such contacts are ""quite natural, quite normal."" ___ After off-mark polls, some question value of 'big data' For an American public that relies on data for everything from where to find the best taco to the likely victor in a baseball game, Election Day offered a jarring wake-up: The data was wrong. Donald Trump's stunning electoral win came despite prognosticators' overwhelming insistence he would lose. And it has forced many to question not just political polling, but other facets of life that are being informed and directed by data.  ""If 'big data' is not that useful for predicting an election then how much should we be relying on it for predicting civil uprisings in countries where we have an interest or predicting future terror attacks?"" asked Patrick Tucker, the author of ""The Naked Future: What Happens in a World That Anticipates Your Every Move?"" His book examines predictive analytics that aim to pinpoint answers to questions as varied as when a person will get married to how many kindergartners in a given class will end up with a cold. Technology has filled people's lives with crowdsourced, data-driven or otherwise instructive metrics and left many convinced of their validity. We look to Yelp rankings to find a good meal and TripAdvisor to gauge a city's finest hotel. Netflix tells us which shows are best to watch and Zillow tells us the worth of the home we might buy. Amazon, Google, Facebook -- all are ubiquitous presences in everyday life with data at their core. So many took the predictions of polling aggregators as gospel -- and their forecasts of Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the presidency went as high as 99 percent. ___ What went wrong in this year's presidential polls? WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump's victory came as a surprise to many Americans, the nation's pollsters most of all. Heading into Election Day, most national surveys overstated what will likely be a narrow popular vote advantage for Hillary Clinton and led many to believe she was a shoo-in to win the Electoral College.  ""The polls clearly got it wrong this time,"" the American Association for Public Opinion Research said Wednesday in a statement. The association traditionally assesses the state of public polling after each election cycle, and already has a committee in place to do so again this year.  ""I think it was an important polling miss. It would really be glossing over it to say that it was a typical year,"" said Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center. For now, it's impossible to know for certain what exactly went wrong for pollsters this year -- and, as votes are still being counted, exactly how far off they were. Some factors pollsters will examine: ___ Singer-Songwriter and poet Leonard Cohen dead at age 82 LOS ANGELES -- Leonard Cohen, the baritone-voiced Canadian singer-songwriter who seamlessly blended spirituality and sexuality in songs like ""Hallelujah,"" ''Suzanne"" and ""Bird on a Wire,"" has died at age 82. Cohen passed away and a memorial will take place in Los Angeles at a later date, Catherine McNelly, a representative from his record label, said Thursday. No further details on his death were given. Cohen, also renowned as a poet, novelist and aspiring Zen monk, blended folk music with a darker, sexual edge that won him fans around the world and among fellow musicians like Bob Dylan and R.E.M. He remained wildly popular into his 80s, when his deep voice plunged to seriously gravelly depths. He toured as recently as earlier this year and released a new album, ""You Want it Darker,"" just last month. His ""Hallelujah"" went from cult hit to modern standard, now an unending staple on movies, TV shows, YouTube videos, reality shows and high school choir concerts. ___ Trump bucks protocol on press access WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump is keeping Americans in the dark about his earliest conversations and decisions as president-elect, bucking a long-standing practice intended to ensure the public has a watchful eye on its new leader. Trump on Thursday refused to allow journalists to travel with him to Washington for his historic first meetings with President Barack Obama and congressional leaders. The Republican's top advisers rebuffed news organizations' requests for a small ""pool"" of journalists to trail him as he attended the meetings. The decision was part of an opaque pattern in Trump's moves since his victory Tuesday. He was entirely out of sight on Wednesday. His aides said he was huddled with advisers at his offices in New York. His team has not put out a daily schedule, or offered any detailed updates on how he has spent his time. They have not acknowledged phone calls or other contact with world leaders. When Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a congratulatory telegram to Trump on Wednesday, Moscow spread the word. A phone call with British Prime Minster Theresa May was announced in London. The pattern was repeated for calls with leaders of Israel, Egypt, South Korea and Australia. The White House typically releases statements on the president's phone calls with foreign leaders, providing some details about the conversation. Past presidents-elect have had early briefings with journalists, even in confusing first hours after Election Day. ___ The economy that Trump inherits: Durable but sluggish WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump inherits a much sturdier economy than the one Barack Obama carried into his second term four years ago. Back then, the scars of the Great Recession were still fresh. Joblessness was near 8 percent. Pay was flat. Europe faced a grave debt crisis that threatened to spread across the Atlantic. Now? The job market, with steady hiring and just 4.9 percent unemployment, has proved durable. Pay is finally accelerating. Auto sales are near a record pace. Housing is stronger. Europe's financial plight has stabilized. Yet the economy's long-standing shift toward workers with college degrees left people without them stuck with dimmer job opportunities and stagnant wages -- a trend for which Trump blamed trade deals that he said led manufacturers to move overseas. The Americans who elected Trump are longing not just for change but for a reversal of the Obama era -- one that will ignite growth, slash taxes, restore lost factory jobs and curb most federal regulations. Problem is, the economy's most vexing problems -- from an aging workforce to listless productivity to weak corporate spending -- defy quick fixes. Trump has pledged an economic renaissance yet has avoided the broad policy prescriptions widely seen as necessary for managing a government. Well before the election, Trump's supporters came to distrust government data that pointed to a recovery and to question the interventions by the Federal Reserve to sustain growth. But given his extravagant economic promises, the hotelier, real estate developer and TV celebrity faces an uphill challenge. ___ Anti-Trump protests continue around country NEW YORK -- Demonstrators in both red and blue states hit the streets for a second day Thursday to express their outrage over Donald Trump's unexpected presidential win. High-spirited high school students marched through San Francisco's downtown, chanting ""not my president"" and holding signs urging a Donald Trump eviction. They waved rainbow banners and Mexican flags, as bystanders in the heavily Democratic city high-fived the marchers from the sidelines.  ""As a white, queer person, we need unity with people of color, we need to stand up,"" said Claire Bye, a 15-year-old sophomore at Academy High School. ""I'm fighting for my rights as an LGBTQ person. I'm fighting for the rights of brown people, black people, Muslim people."" In New York City, about a hundred protesters gathered at Union Square in Manhattan to protest a Trump presidency. They held signs that read ""Divided States of America,"" ""Let the New Generation Speak"" and ""Not My President."" At a subway station along 14th Street, New Yorkers expressed their thoughts along the walls of a walkway using sticky notes -- ""Time to Fight Back"" and ""Keep the Faith! Our work is just beginning!"" ___ President-elect Trump means angst for 'Obamacare' consumers WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump's election ushers in a time of high anxiety for people with health insurance under President Barack Obama's law, which expanded coverage to millions but has struggled to find widespread public acceptance. While repeal now seems likely, that may take Congress months. A replacement for the 2010 health care law could take even longer, and may retain some of its features. Republicans are saying they want to protect people who now are covered from losing health care in the shift. While Congress labors, look for the Trump administration to use its regulatory powers to make changes. Voters ""don't want Washington to fix Obamacare, they want to make health care affordable,"" said House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, whose committee oversees much of health care. ""I'm confident we will have more truly affordable health care for just as many Americans.""  ""It's our goal to dismantle Obamacare and actually focus on lowering the cost of coverage for people,"" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., a member of the Republican leadership. ""It's a commitment on behalf of Congress and the president-elect to get this done."" The rhetoric may sound familiar, but the circumstances couldn't be more different. Up until now, repeated Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act have been practice runs. This will be real, and so will the consequences. Trump will have a four-year term in the White House, but Congress faces the voters again in two years. ___ Trump Train may have left GOP North Carolina governor behind RALEIGH, N.C. -- The Trump train that carried Republicans to victory all over the South may have left one car behind in North Carolina -- Gov. Pat McCrory, who trailed by a few thousand votes Thursday in a still too-close-to-call race that played out amid anger over the state's transgender bathroom law. The law limiting LGBT rights appeared to have a substantial role in the Election Day contest between McCrory, who signed the measure and vigorously defended it against boycotts and other protests, and Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper, who called for its repeal. McCrory, who in 2012 won the governorship by 500,000 votes in a blowout the same year President Barack Obama was re-elected, was losing by 5,000 votes out of nearly 4.7 million cast. In 2012, McCrory received 170,000 more votes than Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. This time, he trailed Donald Trump by 63,000 votes. McCrory could still win. There are tens of thousands of provisional ballots that have to be examined to determine whether they are valid and can be added to the vote tallies. Counties don't have to submit their final results until Nov. 18. North Carolina debated, passed and signed the bathroom bill in a one-day special session in March. The measure, known as House Bill 2, requires transgender people to use restrooms in schools and government buildings that correspond to the gender on their birth certificate.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)  The list of Republicans supporting Hillary Clinton is still growing. For months, we have been keeping track of all of the GOP politicians, administration officials, business leaders and donors who have crossed over to back Clinton over Donald Trump. The most recent high-profile announced was from former secretary of state Colin Powell. ""General Powell said at a meeting of the Long Island Association that he would be voting for Hillary Clinton,"" spokeswoman Peggy Cifrino said in late October. Powell added in a brief interview with The Post's Karen DeYoung that he picked Clinton ""because I think she's qualified, and the other gentleman is not qualified."" Powell's support isn't much of a surprise, given his support for President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and clear distaste for Donald Trump. In his leaked emails from last month, Powell also appeared to be talking over the best time to announce his support for Clinton. But at least it's official now. And Powell is now the third Bush Cabinet official to support Clinton. Below is that list as it stands: Former presidents (1?)  George H.W. Bush (?) -- Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a Facebook post that Bush told her this in-person. The president's office isn't confirming it, but she stands by it. ""That's what he said,"" she told Politico  Members of Congress (1)  Rep. Richard Hanna (N.Y.), a moderate Republican who is retiring this year, told Syracuse.com that he will support Clinton and that Trump is unfit to lead. He cited Trump's criticism of Khizr Khan.

Warner added: ""You can't pull up a quick text like 'National Security for Dummies.'"" Christine Todd Whitman, former New Jersey governor and George W. Bush administration official: ""Why Clinton is the only choice for president"" Chris Shays, former congressman from Connecticut -- ""I have friends who are up for office and they say, you know, if you don't support Donald Trump, you're hurting us because then we have to answer the question. And now I'm going one step further. So I am hurting them. But, you know, there's a time when you put your country first."" Sherwood Boehlert, former congressman from New York Connie Morella, former congresswoman from Maryland David Durenberger, former senator from Minnesota Claudine Schneider, former congresswoman from Rhode Island William Milliken, who served as governor of Michigan from 1969 to 1983 -- ""Because I feel so strongly about our nation's future, I will be joining the growing list of former and present government officials in casting my vote for Hillary Clinton for president in 2016."" Larry Pressler, former three-term Republican senator from South Dakota who lost an independent campaign for his old seat in 2014 -- ""I can't believe I'm endorsing Hillary Clinton for president, but I am.

Sally Bradshaw, former top Jeb Bush adviser, told CNN that she had left the Republican Party to become an independent because of Trump's presence at the top of the ticket -- and that if the race were close in her home state of Florida this fall, she would be voting for Clinton.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) is running to succeed retiring Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.). (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)  It's a good time to be Rep. Chris Van Hollen. His party is favored in the race for the White House, he's overwhelmingly expected to win the seat of retiring Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), and -- no matter which way the balance of power in the upper chamber falls -- he stands to benefit. If Democrats win control of the Senate, experts say, a possible President Hillary Clinton would need allies there who have relationships in the House of Representatives, so she can try to win Republican support for her agenda. If Republicans keep their Senate majority, Clinton would need Democrats in that chamber who can negotiate good-faith deals with leadership. That means Van Hollen (D-Md.), a polite and well-liked policy wonk who was a top lieutenant to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), should find multiple ways to flex his budget, foreign affairs and political muscles. ""The Senate provides a lot of potential influence to individual senators,"" he said in an interview, pausing to knock on a wooden table. ""If all goes well, I look forward to creatively using that influence for the benefit of the whole state, not just one congressional district."" After defeating House colleague Donna F. Edwards (D-Md.) in a bitter primary, Van Hollen, 57, faces statehouse Minority Whip Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County) in the general election. A father of three who lives with his wife, Katherine, in Kensington, Md., he would be Maryland's first senator from the Washington suburbs since Silver Spring attorney Blair Lee, who served a century ago.  [In a year of outsiders, Van Hollen is betting on his resume]  Van Hollen has campaigned vigorously across the state, presenting himself as a get-it-done legislator who can bridge deep partisan divides, and parrying Szeliga's criticism of his support of President Obama's Iran deal and Hillary Clinton.

Larry Hogan (R) as proof she can win in deep-blue Maryland, experts say the Democrats' 2-to-1 voter registration advantage is a much steeper hurdle when the White House is also in play. Van Hollen has raised vastly more money than Szeliga, and was nearly 30 points ahead of her among likely voters in a recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll. ""In presidential election years, if you're a Democrat running for statewide office, you're the only game in town,"" said Todd Eberly, a political science professor at St. Mary's College of Maryland. Climbing the ladder The son of a Foreign Service officer, Van Hollen was active in the anti-apartheid movement as a student at Swarthmore College. After graduation, he earned a graduate degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. In the late 1980s, he worked on Capitol Hill for Sen. Charles Mathias (R-Md.) and the Committee on Foreign Relations, then advised Gov. William Donald Schaefer (D-Md.) while attending Georgetown University Law Center. He ran for state legislature in 1990, driven by concern about overcrowded classrooms and underfunded schools in his home base, Montgomery County. After 12 years in Annapolis, Van Hollen won a House seat in 2002, narrowly beating eight-term Republican congresswoman Connie Morella after redistricting removed a chunk of GOP voters from the affluent and liberal 8th District. He had the opportunity to join the House Committee on Government Reform, chaired at the time by one of Morella's good friends, then-Rep. Thomas M. Davis III (R-Va.). Davis was not sure what to expect. ""He was surprisingly easy to work with,"" Davis said of Van Hollen. ""We had differences, but we would always work them out."" On issues such as Metro, which tends to unite Virginia and Maryland lawmakers regardless of party, Van Hollen put the region first, Davis said. He served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2008, when the party picked up a slew of seats amid Obama's election, and he stayed on for a second, dismal cycle in 2010 before becoming the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. In between, Pelosi named him her assistant, a leadership role that gave him juice among his colleagues and rivals, and made some wonder why he so quickly threw his hat into the senatorial ring when Mikulski announced her plans to retire. ""He could have been speaker of the House, if he stuck around,"" Davis said.    From left: Van Hollen and Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) speak at the Capitol in September 2013 after the Senate rejected budget legislation passed by the House. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)  Van Hollen counts among his accomplishments helping to pass the high-profile Affordable Care Act, as well as the lesser-known ABLE Act, which allows families to open tax-advantaged accounts for children with disabilities. Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.), the Senate sponsor of the bill, said he relied on Van Hollen to interpret its progress in the lower chamber in real time.  ""In our business, you're not often on the telephone late at night with a House member,"" Casey said. ""Several nights I had to call Chris and say, 'This is what so-and-so said -- What's it mean?' He was a great guide."" Van Hollen also was part of a bipartisan budget committee devoted -- unsuccessfully, it turned out -- to negotiating a spending deal both parties could stomach. He jokingly calls it the ""not-so-super committee."" In the 2012 presidential election, he helped Vice President Biden prepare for his nationally televised debate by playing the part of his opponent, Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), now the House speaker. Words that counted When Van Hollen decided to run for Senate, he quickly secured the endorsement of Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who paints the congressman as a person of substance comfortable with numbers. ""In leadership meetings we had with Pelosi, he didn't talk a lot. But when he did, it was important,"" Reid said. His backing did not keep Edwards from launching her own campaign, and the race between the two neighboring House members turned ugly when the abortion rights women's group Emily's List threw its considerable weight behind Edwards.  [Edwards: Why aren't black women ever described as 'born to' the Senate?]      Mikulski, the longest-serving woman in congressional history, also stayed silent through the primary. She now says she is ""excited about passing the torch"" to Van Hollen.  ""It is time for new leadership,"" she said in an interview. ""With his savvy, his know-how, his commitment, he'll be a very fine senator.""    Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) join Van Hollen at a reception at the Women's Club of Chevy Chase in 2001. (Robert A. Reeder/The Washington Post)  One of the first challenges facing whoever wins the election will be beating out Virginia in the competition to host a new FBI headquarters, an accomplishment Mikulski had wanted to achieve before the end of her tenure. The General Services Administration recently delayed the decision until March.     Van Hollen's interest in tackling global warming, the budget deficit and the nation's role in conflicts around the globe could land him on Foreign Relations, Budget or even Judiciary committees, those close to him say. Others speculate that he could run the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee one day. Gun control advocate Vincent DeMarco, who is president of Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence, said he hopes Van Hollen would continue the battle for stricter gun laws that he began in the House. Not a red meat guy As a candidate, Van Hollen has taken nothing for granted, campaigning hard for Clinton as well as himself. Appearing at the Democratic Club of the retirement community Leisure World the other day, he cautioned against complacency, reminding his audience of recent elections around the world that did not go according to projections.    Van Hollen gets a hug from Theda Rosenblum at Leisure World in Silver Spring, Md. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)  Voters in Colombia failed to ratify a peace deal ending a war with guerrilla fighters, for example, he said. And Britain voted to leave the European Union. Ticking off a litany of what he called Republican nominee Donald Trump's most outrageous comments, Van Hollen said: ""It would be a very scary thing if he were ever to get close to the White House."" He admonished supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) to come around for Clinton, saying that a decision not to vote or to choose a third-party candidate could hurt the Democrats. Green Party candidate Margaret Flowers is also running for Mikulski's Senate seat. Then he quoted Biden: ""Don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative."" In an otherwise wonky and forgettable diatribe, the line earned Van Hollen a big laugh. Earlier that day, he attended a protest outside Trump International Hotel in Washington organized by the Service Employees International Union, a labor group that helped propel Edwards into office in the House in 2008 but endorsed Van Hollen over her in the Senate primary. The would-be senator yelled into a bullhorn on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, as workers and organizers waved red and white ""Boycott"" signs. They wanted people to stop buying Trump products in solidarity with workers at his Las Vegas high-rise, who say Trump has refused to negotiate with them in good faith.    Van Hollen speaks to union workers as they picket outside the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Oct. 13. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)  ""Get back to the negotiating table, Mr. Trump,"" Van Hollen shouted. ""You can run, but you can no longer hide from the working people."" But Davis, the former GOP congressman from Virginia, said Van Hollen's natural role is not throwing red meat to the base. ""He's a Boy Scout in a world where that doesn't always get rewarded,"" he said.  Emily Guskin contributed to this report.

""The government and opposition promised to diminish the aggressive tone of the language being used in the political debate,"" Claudio Maria Celli, the Vatican's representative, read in a statement after the talks concluded early Monday, adding that the meeting was ""constructive and respectful.""  The opposition and government agreed to set up four working groups to discuss issues including the respect for the rule of law and national sovereignty; human rights and reparations to victims; the economy; and the generation of confidence and the electoral schedule, Celli said, adding that the current situation of political prisoners in the country would be reviewed. The opposition alliance, known as MUD, said in a separate statement that the next formal meeting would take place Nov. 11. As state television showed images of the meeting earlier Sunday evening, with President Nicolas Maduro seated at the head of a negotiating table, the opposition alliance said in a separate statement that it would walk away from any talks if its demands to end ""repression and persecution"" and free political prisoners weren't met soon. ""We have to be optimistic when it comes to peace,"" Maduro said earlier in the night during televised comments from the talks. ""There is no alternative to dialogue."" State television didn't immediately carry any comments from the opposition's delegation. Maduro met with Pope Francis in Rome last week after the opposition alliance confirmed that the Vatican had sent a representative to Venezuela's capital. Tensions have been rising since the national electoral council earlier this month suspended a recall referendum process against Maduro being sought by the opposition. Last week, Maduro threatened to jail anyone he accused of violating the constitution, including lawmakers, as the opposition-controlled National Assembly summoned him to testify in a political trial set for Tuesday. After a lukewarm turnout for a one-day national strike that opposition called Friday, Maduro made a sexual reference in front of assembled schoolchildren and said the opposition ""needs a little Viagra to see if they can get something up in the country."" The opposition alliance, which has called on supporters to march to the presidential palace Thursday if the referendum process wasn't reactivated, said Sunday in its statement that it would maintain its protest agenda to push for urgent political change. While representatives of three opposition parties including Accion Democratica, Un Nuevo Tiempo and the Primero Justicia party led by Gov. Henrique Capriles attended the talks, the Voluntad Popular party, which is led by its jailed leader, Leopoldo Lopez, did not attend. Voluntad Popular may join the talks at a later date if its conditions that include the release of political prisoners are addressed, MUD said. Maduro's administration is engaging in the Vatican-mediated talks to alleviate international pressure, divide the opposition and buy time, according to the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. ""While the government may strike a more conciliatory posture in the coming weeks, talks are unlikely to resolve the political crisis as the government remains fundamentally unwilling to cede to opposition demands and release its grip on power,"" Eurasia Group analysts Risa Grais-Targow and Agata Ciesielska wrote in a report Monday. Thomas Shannon, the U.S. under secretary of state for political affairs, will travel to Caracas on Monday and stay until Wednesday. "
