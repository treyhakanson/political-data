Donald Trump's pick for chief strategist and senior counselor signals the president-elect has no intention of abandoning his brash, outsider instincts as he puts together his new government. Trump didn't give Bannon the top White House job -- that went to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. Still, Trump made clear Sunday that a man many credit with righting the businessman's campaign -- and one others accuse of amplifying a bigoted fringe -- would have a plum position in the West Wing. Bannon joined Trump's election team as chief executive late in the campaign, following the departure of Trump's second campaign team in August. He quickly became a member of Trump's inner circle, frequently traveling with the candidate and working to re-shape his message to emphasize Trump's populist and outsider appeal. Bannon came from Breitbart News, an unabashedly pro-Trump outlet that had declared war on GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, with whom Trump will have to work to pass his agenda if Ryan retains his role. But other elements of Bannon's tenure are getting more attention. Under his leadership, the site pushed a nationalist, anti-establishment agenda and became one of the leading outlets of the so-called alt-right -- a movement often associated with far-right efforts to preserve ""white identity,"" oppose multiculturalism and defend ""Western values."" The site specializes in button-pushing, traffic-trolling headlines, including one that called conservative commentator Bill Kristol a ""Republican spoiler, renegade Jew."" Others asked, ""Would you rather your child had feminism or cancer?"" and ""Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy."" Priebus on Monday said ""That wasn't his writing,"" referring to Bannon, although he did not specify which, if any were Bannon's work. In the months Priebus has known Bannon, the media mogul ""has exhibited none of those qualities,"" the Republican chairman told NBC's ""Today.""  ""Here is a guy who is very, very smart, very temperate, and together we've been able to manage a lot of the decision making in regard to the campaign along with Kellyanne (Conway),"" he added. ""And it's worked very, very well."" Bannon has been personally accused of prejudice. His ex-wife said in court papers obtained by The Associated Press that Bannon made anti-Semitic remarks when the two battled over sending their daughters to private school nearly a decade ago. In a sworn court declaration following their divorce, Mary Louise Piccard said her ex-husband had objected to sending their twin daughters to an elite Los Angeles academy because he ""didn't want the girls going to school with Jews."" Alexandra Preate, a spokeswoman for Bannon, denied he'd ever said such things. Bannon also faced domestic violence charges following an altercation the pair had on New Year's Day 1996 following a spat over money. He was charged in 1996 with misdemeanor witness intimidation, domestic violence with traumatic injury and battery. The charges were dropped after Piccard didn't show up at trial. A Harvard MBA, Bannon began his career as a Goldman Sachs investment banker. He later capitalized on an entertainment industry deal that left him with a share of ""Seinfeld"" royalties, founded the Government Accountability Institute to ferret out ""crony capitalism"" and government corruption, and created a number of his own films, including paeans to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the tea party movement and Ronald Reagan. Breitbart's founder, the late Andrew Breitbart, once admiringly described Bannon as the Leni Riefenstahl of the tea party movement, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek profile. Riefenstahl was a filmmaker vilified after World War II for her propaganda pieces about Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. He was hired by Breitbart News after Breitbart died suddenly in 2012. Unafraid to play favorites, the website early last year prominently featured positive stories about Trump rival Ted Cruz. But as Trump gained momentum later in the year, the site began pumping out pro-Trump stories -- and remained a chief proponent of Trump's candidacy through the end of the race. Given his background and reputation, many had expected Bannon's arrival in August to signal a new, caustic phase for the Trump campaign. There were moments. Trump's pre-debate news conference with the women who'd accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault seemed to be signature Bannon. But largely, Trump appeared more comfortable and willing to stick to the teleprompter under the guidance of Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, who was promoted to the role of campaign manager when Bannon joined the team. Ultimately, Bannon's biggest influence appeared to be pushing Trump to adopt more populist rhetoric and paint rival Hillary Clinton as part of a globalist system bent on oppressing the country's working people. Trump's campaign said Bannon will work ""as equal partners"" with Priebus. The arrangement suggests the president-elect is putting a premium on loyalty and maintaining much of his existing inner circle as he begins to fill thousands of government positions over the coming weeks.  ""I want to thank President-elect Trump for the opportunity to work with Reince in driving the agenda of the Trump administration,"" Bannon said in a statement. ___ AP writer Laurie Kellman contributed to this report. ___ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

While he's announced one decision -- putting Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge of the transition instead of Chris Christie -- Trump must identify other people for top White House jobs and Cabinet posts. The president-elect remained out of sight at Trump Tower, with streets outside swarming with thousands objecting to the results of Election Day. At one point, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, a liberal critic of Trump who nevertheless had predicted his victory, entered the tower lobby with a camera crew in tow and asked to see Trump. ""I just thought I'd see if I could get into Trump Tower and ride the famous escalator,"" said Moore, who did just that until he reached the fourth floor and the Secret Service told him he could go no higher. Kellyanne Conway, who was Trump's campaign manager and is almost surely in line for a prominent job in his presidency, told reporters in the tower lobby that Trump's choice of a chief of staff was ""imminent,"" though not coming Saturday. Whoever fills that post will set the tone for Trump's White House and be a main conduit to Capitol Hill and Cabinet agencies. Trump is said to be considering Steve Bannon, his campaign chairman and a conservative media executive, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus for the job. Neither has significant policy experience, though Priebus is well-liked in Washington and has ties with lawmakers. Conway said Trump's next public appearance was expected ""in the next couple of days."" When asked if he'd take a victory tour soon, she said: ""It's possible. It's possible. We're working on the schedule."" She described his day as ""meetings, phone calls, conversations, interviews. What you would expect from a normal presidential transition."" In one gesture of normalcy, Trump pledged to be ""very restrained"" in the White House with his use of Twitter, ""if I use it at all."" But he did not sound convinced that he could leave it behind, when asked in a ""60 Minutes"" interview to be broadcast Sunday. Some of Trump's most inflammatory comments, in a campaign loaded with provocation, came in his late-night tweets.  ""I have a method of fighting back,"" Trump said of social media. He said Twitter is ""tremendous"" and helped him win races in states where he was vastly outspent. He said he thinks he's proved that social media can be more powerful than money. Moments after Moore's uninvited visit to Trump Tower, Nigel Farage, head of the ""Leave"" movement that won Britain's vote to exit the European Union, also arrived and met Trump. Trump frequently linked his campaign to the Brexit movement. Conway said the two men talked about ""freedom and winning and what this all means for the world."" For Trump, who ran on a pledge to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington insiders, the transition team is strikingly heavy on those with long political resumes. Another apparent contradiction emerged Friday as Trump, who repeatedly vowed to achieve the repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law, said he would be open to maintaining portions of it. Christie was a loyal adviser to Trump for much of the campaign, offered a key early endorsement and came close to being the businessman's pick for running mate. But Trump ultimately went with Pence, Indiana's governor and a former congressman with Washington experience and deep ties to conservatives, to take the transition forward. Christie will still be involved in the transition, joining a cluster of other steadfast Trump supporters serving as vice chairmen: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. In addition, three of Trump's adult children -- Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka -- are on the transition executive committee, along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband. Kushner was an influential adviser in Trump's campaign. The children's inclusion raised questions about Trump's ability to sever ties between the administration and the sprawling family business -- after the billionaire repeatedly said during the campaign that his grown children would not follow him to Washington but instead run the Trump Organization. Trump told The Wall Street Journal that after speaking with Obama at the White House, he was considering keeping the provision of the health law that allows children to stay on their parents' insurance policies until they turn 26. He said previously he may also keep the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of patients' existing conditions. Presidents-elect don't often appoint their running mates to lead their transition team.

Among the agreements is a pledge to hold new elections in Amazonas state to choose replacements for three National Assembly deputies who were dismissed by Venezuela's supreme court for alleged vote buying. The parties also agreed to respect the autonomy of Venezuela's legislature and to work to overcome the impasse created by the high court's decision to nullify the National Assembly's decisions. Vatican-appointed mediator Monsignor Claudio Celli announced the agreements after reading the conclusions from the second meeting of representatives of the opposition and the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro. Celli said there was also an agreement on how to name the replacements of two National Electoral Council members whose mandates end in December. The sides also said they had agreed on measures to combat the food and medicine shortages that have plagued the country. The negotiations will continue in the coming days. They are being sponsored by former presidents Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain, Martin Torrijos of Panama, and Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Republic. The talks are marked by distrust. Maduro's adversaries fear they are a delaying tactic to relieve pressures on a president whose popularity is collapsing amid triple-digit inflation, shortages of food and medicine, and a contracting economy. Earlier, the government released four jailed activists and the opposition agreed to delay a symbolic trial of Maduro in Congress and to scrap a protest march. Those moves were a response to the Vatican's efforts to avert bloodshed and dampen acrimony in the oil-rich South American country. Talks under its tutelage aim to defuse a crisis exacerbated by the government's derailing of a referendum to recall Maduro. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Republican president-elect is days away from naming his chief of staff, according to people with direct knowledge of his thinking. No position is considered more important than chief of staff, a behind-the-scenes power player who typically controls access to the president, guides the enactment of his policy priorities and oversees White House hiring. Trump has already narrowed his list to a handful of high-profile loyalists that includes Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, campaign CEO Steve Bannon and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. The incoming president repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" during his campaign's final weeks, yet both Priebus and Conway have operated for years in that same Washington ""swamp."" Bannon, by contrast, would represent a dramatically different direction, having spent recent years leading a conservative news site that fueled conspiracy theories popular with the ""alt-right"" movement of white nationalists. Trump ran as an outsider, but some suggest it would be risky to tap another outsider to serve as his right hand in the Oval Office.  ""I'm trying to think of who was successful as chief of staff as an outsider and I can't think of one,"" said John H. Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor who served as chief of staff for the first three years of former President George H.W. Bush's administration. A president's chief of staff sets the tone for the White House, guarding who has access to the president and what problems land on his desk. The role blends both policy and politics, working with congressional lawmakers and Cabinet officials. The chief of staff is also typically among the closest advisers to the president, providing counsel on domestic and foreign policy decisions. In 2013, President Barack Obama made the decision to abruptly pull back plans to launch airstrikes on Syria while walking on the South Lawn with his chief of staff, Denis McDonough. The chief of staff ""is often the last person who speaks to a president before a decision is made,"" said Sara Fagen, who worked under two chiefs of staff in the George W. Bush White House. ""This person has to have the confidence of the president and they have to have the kind of relationship with the president where they can give him candid advice and tell him things he does not want to hear."" It's also helpful, Sununu said, if the chief of staff ""understands the nuances and the politics of policy so that the president doesn't accidently get himself into a bind."" There are few people in Trump's inner circle who are experienced in the nuances of politics and policy. The businessman and reality television star is expected to lean heavily on Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a sitting governor who previously served in Congress for more than a decade. But with Trump having been shunned by most of the political world's most respected leaders for much of the last year, few of his closest campaign advisers have governing experience in Washington. Trump has only about 70 days to form a new government, including hundreds of senior-level employees across various federal agencies. The jobs -- and the selection of his Cabinet -- will be filled only after a chief of staff is selected. And with so many questions about Trump's specific priorities as president, his early personnel decisions become major signals of his intentions.  ""Personnel is policy,"" said Republican operative Ron Kaufman, who also served in the H.W. Bush's White House. The leading candidates for chief of staff include Priebus, who has served as chairman of the Republican National Committee since 2011. The Wisconsin native is close friends with House Speaker Paul Ryan and also popular among RNC members. He thrived as a fundraiser as the GOP chairman and led the party's voter outreach efforts that helped fuel Trump's stunning victory. Priebus has no governing experience. He became the national chairman after serving as chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Preibus is perhaps Trump's most trusted member of the GOP establishment, having traveled with him often during the campaign's final weeks. Bannon joined the Trump campaign in August after a second major staffing shakeup. He has little national profile, but became well-known among Washington's conservative fringe as the combative head of Breitbart News, a pro-Trump website that frequently targeted Republican leaders like Ryan and promotes false conspiracy theories. The site is popular among white nationalists. One Breitbart headline under Bannon's leadership referred to conservative columnist Bill Kristol as a ""renegade Jew."" Conway is a veteran Republican pollster who took over as Trump's campaign manager at about the same time Bannon was hired. She was viewed as an effective messenger on cable television and was largely credited with helping to keep Trump focused on his Democratic opponent in the campaign's final days. She previously led a ""super PAC"" that supported Ted Cruz's presidential bid and was funded by the Mercer family, who would later become prominent Trump backers. ___ AP writers Julie Pace, Erica Werner and Julie Bykowicz in Washington contributed to this report.

5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/11/donald-trumps-questionable-blind-trust-setup-just-got-more-questionable/	Donald Trump’s questionable ‘blind trust’ setup just got more questionable	"   Donald Trump with his sons Donald Trump Jr., from left, Eric Trump, his wife Melania Trump and his daughters Tiffany Trump and Ivanka Trump (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)  Donald Trump's decision to leave his children in control of his fortune during his presidency was already an unusual and eyebrow-raising setup. And on Friday, it became even more so. A day after Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, announced that Trump's three oldest children -- Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric -- would control what he labeled a ""blind trust"" for the president-elect, the Trump campaign announced Friday afternoon that all three would also serve on Trump's presidential transition team executive committee. In that role, the trio will have input when it comes to the people Trump picks for key administration posts. Watchdogs who were critical of Trump's ""blind trust"" in the first place say this proves that the lines between President Trump and his money will be too fuzzy under this setup. ""The fact that they have been included as part of the transition team just shows how inappropriate their role in bridging the gap between him as a businessman and politician is,"" said Meredith McGehee, a strategic adviser at the Campaign Legal Center. ""It's a clear demonstration that there is no firewall between the two."" McGehee and others have also cast doubt on the idea that the so-called ""blind trust"" is actually blind at all. She calls it a ""one-eye-closed-and-one-eye-open trust."" In addition to blurring the line between Trump's presidency and his money, skeptics note that his children will now also have control over the people who will be put in charge of regulatory decisions that could affect his multi-billion-dollar fortune. Kenneth Gross, a political law expert at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, said it would be okay for Trump to involve his kids in the transition, but their dual roles are problematic.          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

Added Karen Hobart Flynn, president of Common Cause: ""Having your children run your business is not a blind trust no matter what his attorneys choose to call it. And having those same children involved in the transition only compounds the conflict."" Reporters also reacted Friday afternoon with incredulity at the inclusion of the Trump kids on the transition team.   Trump children who Trump promised would be running his company as blind trust will be running transition. Massive/unprecedented conflict. -- Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) November 11, 2016   The transfer of the Trump Organization into his childrens' hands was reportedly being formalized Friday.   BREAKING: Trump Organization planning for an immediate transfer of management, business portfolio to children Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric -- Reuters Politics (@ReutersPolitics) November 11, 2016   Cohen, who is a lawyer for both Trump and the Trump Organization, detailed the ""blind trust"" arrangement -- which had previously been floated during the campaign -- Thursday in an interview with CNN. But ""blind trusts"" are generally considered to be situations in which the assets are controlled by independent parties who aren't in touch with the owner. Questions about how truly ""blind"" they are come up regularly in politics. Back in 2012, Mitt Romney was criticized for not having a true blind trust, given it was run by his old colleagues at Bain Capital, and Romney could easily see what Bain was up to. Nor is this the first time that potential financial conflicts of interest involving children have come up in this campaign. Watchdogs previously pressed Hillary Clinton not to leave daughter Chelsea Clinton in charge of the Clinton Foundation if she had been elected president. Cohen said on Thursday that Trump has no interest in growing his fortune as president. (It would be impossible to know if he did because Trump has never released his taxes.) But Cohen acknowledged the set-up won't please everyone. ""Will we be able to appease everybody? The answer is no. No matter what the man does, he can't appease everybody,"" Cohen said. ""But everything will be done legally. He's not interested in the company anymore. He said it [Wednesday] in front of a whole group of people. He's interested in fixing America.""      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   "

Democrats had seen 2016 as a chance to chip away at the large advantage in statehouses the Republicans have enjoyed since 2010. But in state after state, they fell short. With Tuesday's results, the Republicans will control at least as many legislative chambers as they do now -- 68 out of 99, an all-time high for the GOP. And they will have full control of 33 legislatures, up from 31. (That includes Nebraska, which has a technically nonpartisan, single-chamber legislature.) The Democrats will be in full command in 13 states. Republicans scored major victories by taking control of the Iowa and Minnesota Senates and the Kentucky House. They also held on to their majorities in chambers in several states that had been targeted by the Democrats, and apparently gained a tie in the previously Democratic-controlled Connecticut Senate. The GOP wave also extended to governor's races, where Republicans were expanding their sizable majority of seats. The election wasn't a total loss for Democrats. They picked up both chambers in Nevada and the House in New Mexico. They also took a one-seat advantage in the Washington Senate, but they still won't have operating control, because one Democrat caucuses with the Republicans. The results give Republicans a better chance of directing the redrawing of congressional and legislative districts that the states will undertake after the 2020 census. That, in turn, could help the GOP maintain its grip on power for years. Some Democrats said they think the party could bounce back and gain the upper hand during redistricting.  ""If a Trump presidency at all resemble the Trump candidacy, Democrats nationwide will be buoyed by Republican backlash in the next two election cycles,"" Carolyn Fiddler, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in an email. More immediately, the Republicans' successes on Tuesday could have implications for joint state-federal programs such as Medicaid, infrastructure funding and energy policy, all of which could change dramatically under a Trump administration.  ""It's an obvious and unavoidable trend at this point,"" said Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, which ran TV ads on behalf of legislative candidates in Kentucky and other competitive states. He said he expects more state control of health insurance if President Barack Obama's Affordable Health Care Act is scaled back or repealed. Anti-union right-to-work laws also could expand in the states. Stephen Voss, a University of Kentucky political scientist, said he expects rapid change in policies in his state with Republicans now firmly in control, including perhaps programs that use taxpayer money to send students to private schools. With the Kentucky win, Republicans now control every state legislative chamber in the South. One Democrat ousted was Greg Stumbo, the House speaker and former state attorney general who was a major force in Kentucky politics for decades. He represents a rural district where Hillary Clinton was especially unpopular. Republicans appeared to hold onto many legislative bodies that Democrats went after hard, including the Senate in West Virginia and the House in Michigan. In Iowa, the Republicans stunned the Democrats to easily take control of the Senate by picking up at least six seats in the 50-seat chamber. They needed to flip just three districts to win the chamber. The election swept out Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal, a powerful Democrat who had been a fixture in state government for three decades. Democrats had credited Gronstal in recent years with blocking GOP efforts to roll back gay marriage and abortion rights, enact restrictions on voting and limit the clout of public employee unions. They were devastated by his defeat.  ""That's very bad for our state,"" said Democratic activist Julie Stauch, who fought back tears Wednesday. She called Gronstal a party leader who would ""wield power for good. And that's lost."" Republicans now control the Iowa governor's office and both houses of the General Assembly for the first time since the late 1990s. ___ Follow Foley at http://twitter.com/rjfoley and Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill ___ Mulvihill reported from Haddonfield, New Jersey.

Vice Public Security Minister Meng Hongwei was named as the first Chinese to hold the post at the organization's general assembly on the Indonesian island of Bali, Interpol announced in a press release. The Lyon, France-based International Criminal Police Organization has 190 member nations and has the power to issue ""red notices."" It's the closest instrument to an international arrest warrant in use today. Interpol circulates those notices to member countries listing people who are wanted for extradition. While Interpol's charter officially bars it from undertaking ""any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character,"" critics say some governments, primarily Russia and Iran, have abused the system to harass and detain opponents of their regimes. Interpol says it has a special vetting process to prevent that from happening. Quoted in the Interpol release, Meng said he takes over at a time when the world is facing some of the most serious global public security challenges since World War II.  ""Interpol, guided by the best set of principles and mechanisms to date, has made a significant contribution to promoting international police cooperation,"" Meng was quoted as saying. ""Interpol should continue to adhere to these principles and strategies, while further innovating our work mechanisms in order to adapt to the changing security situation we see today."" Interpol's president is a largely symbolic but still influential figure who heads its executive committee responsible for providing guidance and direction and implementing decisions made by its general assembly. Interpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock is the organization's chief full-time official and heads the executive committee. Meng, who takes over from Mireille Ballestrazzi of France for a four-year term, will assume his new duties immediately. His election comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping is seeking to give new momentum to his 4-year-old campaign against corruption, including a push to seek the return of former officials and other suspects who had fled abroad. China filed a list of 100 of its most-wanted suspects with Interpol in April 2014, about one third of whom have since been repatriated to face justice at home. The anti-corruption drive is led by the Communist Party's internal watchdog body, the highly secretive Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, rather than the police, prompting questions about its transparency and fairness. More than 1 million officials have been handed punishments ranging from lengthy prison terms to administrative demerits or demotions. While authorities deny their targets are selected for political purposes, several of the highest-profile suspects have been associated with Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao and other rivals. China's police and judicial systems have been routinely criticized for abuses, including confessions under torture, arbitrary travel bans and the disappearance and detention without charges of political dissidents and their family members. That has prompted reluctance among many Western nations to sign extradition treaties with China or return suspects wanted for non-violent crimes. China also stands accused of abducting independent book sellers who published tomes on sensitive political topics from Hong Kong and Thailand. U.S. officials have meanwhile complained that China has asked for the return of corruption suspects while providing little or no information about the allegations against them. Given those circumstances, Meng's election is an ""alarming prospect,"" said Maya Wang, Hong Kong-based researcher with Human Rights Watch.  ""While we think it's important to fight corruption, the campaign has been politicized and undermines judicial independence,"" Wang said. Meng's election ""will probably embolden and encourage abuses in the system,"" she said, citing recent reports of close Chinese ally Russia's use of Interpol to attack President Vladimir Putin's political opponents. Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's regional director for East Asia, tweeted: ""This is extraordinarily worrying given China's longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad."" At the same time, China's 3-decade-old economic boom has produced waves of embezzlement, bribery, corruption and other forms of white-collar crime that have forced the government to spread a wide net to track down suspects and their illicit earnings. China also says it faces security threats from cross-border extremist Islamic groups seeking to overthrow Chinese rule over the far-western region of Xinjiang. Interpol member countries nominate officials for the post of president. Presidents are elected in a vote by members on a one country, one vote basis. There was one other candidate for president but the vote is always closed and results are not released publicly. Along with electing Meng, Interpol also approved a call for the ""systematic collection and recording of biometric information as part of terrorist profiles"" shared by the organization. About 830 police chiefs and senior law enforcement officials from 164 countries joined in the four-day meeting. China became a member in 1984. ___ Associated Press writer Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

""He just earned a mandate,"" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, who now faces working with a president with whom he had a turbulent relationship during the campaign. Democrats had envisioned that voters repulsed by Trump comments about women and Hispanics could provide potentially big Election Day gains in suburban and ethnically diverse areas. Instead, the Democrats suffered a dispiriting day with just modest pickups, a maximum of nine, as the GOP swept to control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. That was well below the 30 seats Democrats needed to capture House control. Republicans currently hold a 247-188 majority, including three vacant seats, the most the GOP has had since their 270 in 1931.  ""He turned politics on its head,"" Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters gathered Wednesday in his hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin. Ryan credited the president-elect with helping carry Republicans into Congress and promised to work ""hand-in-hand"" with him on a GOP agenda. By Wednesday, Republicans had at least 238 seats -- guaranteeing an extension of their six-year run of House control -- and just six of their incumbents had lost. The GOP retained seats in Minnesota, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa and Wisconsin that Democrats had coveted. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the two parties ""have a responsibility to come together and find common ground."" In a written statement, she suggested cooperating with Trump on infrastructure projects and said she will ""pray for his success."" It was initially unclear what impact the marginally smaller size of the GOP majority would have on Ryan, who'd angered some Republicans by refusing to campaign for Trump. While one member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus was defeated, several newly elected Republicans could bolster it. That would increase conservatives' leverage to demand their way on issues like curbing spending and government regulations. In Florida, freshman GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo won a race that underscored the limits of Trump's damage to Republicans. With around 7 in 10 of the Miami-area district's voters Hispanic, Democrats targeted it and the race became one of the country's most expensive with an $18 million price tag. But Curbelo distanced himself from his own party's nominee and prevailed. Virginia freshman Rep. Barbara Comstock kept her seat in the well-heeled Washington, D.C., suburbs despite Democrats' attempts to lash her to Trump. Democrats defeated two Florida GOP incumbents, but that seemed due to local circumstances. Rep. John Mica, 73, a 12-term veteran from the Orlando area, was criticized by GOP strategists for a lackluster campaign and lost to Democrat Stephanie Murphy, a political neophyte. Democrat Charlie Crist, once the state's Republican governor, defeated Rep. David Jolly in a St. Petersburg district redrawn to favor Democrats. Democrats also beat GOP Reps. Scott Garrett, a Freedom Caucus member from New Jersey's New York City suburbs; moderate Bob Dold from outside Chicago; Cresent Hardy of Nevada and New Hampshire's Frank Guinta. Just one Democratic incumbent had lost by Wednesday, Nebraska's Brad Ashford. Both parties' candidates and outside groups spent nearly $1.1 billion combined on House campaigns, shy of the $1.2 billion record in 2012, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. Republicans had only a slight financial edge. Even with the Ryan-led House GOP's current formidable advantage, work stalled this year on spending bills after hitting objections from conservatives. Moving into 2017, Congress faces a fresh round of budget legislation plus the need to renew the government's borrowing authority or face an economy-jarring federal default. Those are never easy to pass. Ryan, 46, has said he wants to be speaker in the new Congress and has expressed confidence in doing so. But he is not immune to ire from the Freedom Caucus, which chased former Speaker John Boehner from Congress last year, and other Republicans upset over his frigid treatment of Trump. Just a handful of disgruntled conservatives could possibly block Ryan from the 218 votes he'd need to retain his post. That would be an embarrassing setback for the GOP's 2012 vice presidential candidate, who may harbor White House aspirations. ___ Associated Press writer Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.
