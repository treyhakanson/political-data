The recommendation is among many unveiled Thursday by a state board that Gov. Rick Snyder tasked with proposing a strategy to protect children from all sources of lead poisoning. The emergency in Flint stems from old lead pipes contaminating the water after the city was switched in 2014 from Detroit's water system to improperly treated Flint River water while under state financial management. But lead poisoning is more frequently linked to paint and dust in older housing and soil. The toxin was banned from paint in 1978. The Child Lead Poisoning Elimination Board's report calls for the screening of all children for lead by the time they turn 1 and again between ages 2 and 3. Such testing is currently only required for low-income kids in the Medicaid or Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs. Under the federal health care law, lead screening for children at risk of exposure is considered a preventive service for which insurers cannot apply copays, deductibles or coinsurance. The report also recommends requiring that a lead inspection and risk assessment be done when any house built before 1978 is sold or transferred, unless lead in the home has already been fully addressed. If lead hazards were found, abatement would be required at the point of sale or transfer. In newer homes, the dust, soil and water would have to be tested. The owner would be required to disclose the information to a future buyer or renter. Lt. Brian Calley, who chairs the board, said ""great strides"" were made when lead was removed from paint and gasoline decades ago but that since then lead-prevention efforts ""kind of fell off the radar."" The current focus is on responding when kids have elevated levels of lead in their blood.  ""That's just not good enough on its own,"" Calley said Thursday. ""Preventing the poisoning from happening in the first place ... is where we want to shift the focus."" The report says blood-lead screening rates are ""very low"" and cites inadequate federal and state funding, which has led to a depleted local public health infrastructure that is unable to fully apply current laws and regulations. Calley, who said it will take ""a generation"" to implement the proposals, pointed to the U.S. government's ""huge"" approval this week of a waiver so Michigan can spend $119 million in predominantly federal money over five years to remove lead hazards from the homes of low-income residents in Flint and other communities. The Snyder administration also plans to propose lead-prevention funding in the next state budget. According to the report, identified cases of child lead poisoning have declined significantly in Michigan. In 1998, 44 percent of children under age 6 who were tested had elevated blood-lead levels. It was 3.4 percent in 2015, or nearly 4,800 children of about 141,000 tested. But Calley cautioned that only universal screening of young children and full reporting of results to a surveillance system for data analysis will help pinpoint the actual prevalence of lead exposure. About 38 percent of all Michigan 1- and 2-year-olds were tested last year. It was not immediately known how many states require universal screening. Massachusetts has such a requirement, and Maryland last year announced a plan calling for all children there to be tested at ages 1 and 2. The 12-member board includes top officials in the Snyder administration and outside experts such as Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, who helped expose Flint's crisis more than a year ago after state officials initially dismissed her findings. She said universal lead screening of children was done in the past, but that ""the world of medicine and public health thought we took care of lead"" only to learn since that there is no safe level.  ""We need to know where our children are that are being exposed so that we can identify target areas and then go back to that primary prevention work,"" Hanna-Attisha said. Also Thursday, state attorneys asked a federal judge in Detroit to halt his order that bottled water be delivered to lead-tainted homes in Flint unless residents opt out or officials verify that a filter has been properly installed. They said the injunction issued last week ""far exceeds"" what is necessary to ensure that residents have safe drinking water, and the state is likely to succeed on appeal. Henry Henderson, Midwest director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said trying to delay the order ""is an obvious insult to the people of Flint, whose tap water has been contaminated with lead for more than two years."" ___ Online: Child Lead Poisoning Eliminate Board report: http://bit.ly/2g2esFU ___ Follow David Eggert on Twitter at http://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/author/david-eggert Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Security Council voted unanimously to approve a one-year extension of their mandate Thursday. Investigators from the Joint Investigative Mechanism, or JIM, have determined that the Syrian government was behind at least three attacks involving chlorine gas and the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas. U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power welcomed the vote and thanked Russia for it's work on the resolution.  ""The JIM is a vital tool for fighting impunity, an independent group of experts with the tools to tell us who is using chemical weapons in Syria,"" Power said. ""The JIM's findings are clear. Investigators have concluded that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons against the Syrian people not just in one attack but in three confirmed attacks so far ... the JIM has, to date, reached this conclusion. There is credible evidence of many more chemical weapons attacks by the Assad regime."" The United States, Britain and France have been pressing the council to impose sanctions on the Syrian government for using chemical weapons. But Russia, Syria's closest ally, has repeatedly questioned investigators' conclusions linking chemical weapons use to the regime of President Bashar Assad. Russian deputy Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov said the resolution was ""the result of extensive negotiating marathons"" between his country and the U.S.  ""The document in view of our priorities on giving the mechanism a mandate of broader geographical scope and clearer anti-terrorist direction was agreed on with great difficulty, but we did and we accepted it because we see its strong points, too,"" Safronkov said. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the international watchdog, last week condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria and called on the government to allow inspections of sites of concern. The Syrian government denies using chemical weapons in the civil war, now in its sixth year. Human Rights Watch praised the mandate's extension and called on the U.N. to sanction those responsible.  ""The Security Council should quickly impose sanctions on senior leaders in the Syrian chain of command who have allowed the use of chemical weapons on their watch. If the Council fails to act, it is yet another reason for the General Assembly to take up the issue of accountability for these and other abuses in an emergency special session on Syria,"" said Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch. Following a chemical weapon attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds of civilians on Aug. 21, 2013, a U.S.-Russian agreement led to a Security Council resolution the following month ordering the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, precursors, and the equipment to produce the deadly agents. The Syrian government's support for the resolution and decision to join the OPCW warded off possible U.S. military strikes in the aftermath of the attack, which Damascus denied carrying out. Syria's declared stockpile of 1,300 metric tons of chemicals has been destroyed, but the OPCW is still investigating outstanding questions about possible undeclared chemical weapons. Chlorine is not a banned agent used in chemical weapons, like sarin or ricin. But it is toxic and its use in attacks in Syria started being reported last year. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Astor contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

At a national meeting of the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish civil rights group, about 1,000 people listened to talks expressing shock at the hatred expressed during the presidential campaign and questioned what they thought was a high-level of acceptance by other Americans.  ""I'm struggling right now in this American moment,"" said Yehuda Kurtzer, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America, an education and research organization, in his talk at the event. ""I wonder whether I have been -- and I think the answer is probably yes -- a little bit naive."" During this past year, anti-Semitic imagery proliferated on social media, Jewish journalists were targeted and longstanding anti-Jewish conspiracy theories got a fresh airing. Much of the bias originated with the alt-right, or alternative right, a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It's often associated with far right efforts to preserve ""white identity,"" oppose multiculturalism and defend ""Western values."" In addition to the online intimidation, reports of anti-Semitic vandalism and other attacks have risen. Last week, the day after the election, a Philadelphia storefront was sprayed with a swastika and the words ""Sieg Heil 2016,"" which means ""Hail Victory,"" a common Nazi chant, and the word ""Trump,"" with a swastika replacing the ""T."" These developments have stunned U.S. Jewish leaders, who in recent years had been more focused on anti-Semitism in Europe and on addressing complaints of anti-Jewish bias on college campuses amid the debate over the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. In a sign of the depth of American Jewish anxiety about anti-Semitism, ADL officials said donations to their organization increased 50-fold in the days immediately after the election and a large majority of the money came from first-time donors. Every one of their regional offices reported an uptick in calls from people wanting to donate or volunteer, the ADL said.  ""We must not be silent, we must raise our voices, we must act, and to act we must understand what we are up against,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of ADL, opening the meeting in Manhattan. As the presidential race intensified, Jews started seeing their names bracketed with a series of parentheses in harassing tweets, signaling that the person had been identified as a Jew. The image became known as the Jewish cowbell and its source was traced to neo-Nazis and white nationalists. The ADL investigated the harassment and found more than 800 journalists had suffered anti-Semitic attacks on Twitter during the election, mostly from anonymous Twitter accounts, although some belonged to white supremacists. In a common example of the reporters' experiences, Jane Eisner, editor-in-chief of the Forward, an influential Jewish newspaper that extensively covered the election, said she received an email the morning after the second presidential debate with an image of a Nazi solder pointing a gun at her head, which was Photoshopped onto a concentration camp uniform. Donald Trump's campaign came under scrutiny since much of the harassment came from accounts tied to his supporters. Trump drew direct criticism last July when he tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton's face with a six-pointed star, a pile of hundred dollar bills and the words ""most corrupt candidate ever."" The star was in the shape of the Jewish Star of David and was widely condemned as anti-Semitic. Trump's campaign said it was a sheriff's badge. Last month, Trump gave a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, in which he accused Clinton of holding secret meetings with bankers in a conspiracy to undermine U.S. sovereignty. The ADL said that whether intentional or not, Trump had reflected a classic anti-Semitic theme of Jewish control of banks. The president-elect's daughter Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who is now one of his top advisers, are Orthodox Jews. Kushner has defended Trump against allegations of bias. The issue erupted anew when Trump announced far-right publishing executive Stephen Bannon as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway called the accusations against Bannon ""very unfair."" Some Jewish groups have defended Bannon, including the hawkish Zionist Organization of America. Bernie Marcus, a founder of The Home Depot Inc. and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, said in a statement that Bannon was ""a passionate Zionist and supporter of Israel."" Marcus called the condemnations of Bannon an attempt to undermine the incoming administration. Seventy-one percent of Jews voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. Greenblatt worked in the Obama administration. Still, Jonathan Sarna, a Brandeis University professor and historian of American Judaism, said it would be wrong to attribute the criticisms of Trump appointments or his supporters to partisanship. ""I don't know anybody who is looking at this in a serious way who says nothing has changed,"" in regard to the level of anti-Semitism, Sarna said.  ""American Jews assumed that anti-Semitism had largely been overcome,"" he said. ""And then all of a sudden, unexpectedly, anti-Semitism of a virulent kind came roaring back."" ____ This story has been amended to reflect the correct phrase used in anti-Semitic graffiti on a Philadelphia storefront.

Georgetown (1-2) trailed by double figures most of the game, used a 22-7 run, capped by two free throws from L.J. Peak, to close within 74-72 with 50 seconds remaining. A free throw by Foster made it 75-72 before Simms' steal and free throws. Arkansas State got the ball back on a charge then lost it on a steal by Jagan Mosley but Pryor's rushed 3-pointer with four seconds left missed. The Red Wolves (2-1) took the lead for good at 13-12 with 11:47 left in the first half and were up 48-33 at halftime. Devin Carter scored 25 points for Arkansas State, which shot 56 percent, hit half its 12 3-point attempts and won the boards 35-30.

(Andrew Gombert/European Pressphoto Agency)  Peter Thiel was named as a member of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team Friday, a sign of the influence the billionaire tech investor will have in shaping the new administration. Thiel bucked the liberal leanings of Silicon Valley to support Trump and endured immense backlash from his peers as a result. Now, they will likely need him to act as their most prominent surrogate and advocate on regulatory and policy matters in Washington, industry officials and lobbyists said. Thiel has not ruled out formal involvement with the incoming administration, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Thiel has consistently said since even before Trump was elected that he has no desire for a full-time position in Washington. ""I think my future is going to continue to be in the tech industry. That's what I'm good at. That's what I enjoy doing,"" Thiel said on Oct. 31 at the National Press Club in Washington. However big his role, Thiel will certainly have Trump's attention on tech matters. The New York businessman is known to value loyalty, and Thiel served as a vocal supporter in the final months of a divisive campaign. Thiel spoke at the Republican National Convention in July, donated $1.25 million to Trump's campaign in October and convened journalists in Washington last month to explain his support for Trump. ['What Trump represents isn't crazy and it's not going away.' Peter Thiel defends support for Donald Trump.] ""A page in the book of history has turned, and there is an opening to think about some of our problems from a new perspective,"" Thiel told the New York Times after the election. ""I'll try to help the president in any way I can."" Thiel will be especially important to the industry as Trump's tech agenda remains largely an open question. Trump's remarks so far hasn't given Silicon Valley much reason to celebrate. His opposition to net neutrality and harsh stance on immigration is part of what pushed so many there to support his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. ""Many Silicon Valley leaders would be smart at this point to show a little more tolerance toward the position taken by Peter Thiel in terms of his relationship to and support of Trump. I think it's safe to say that Thiel made one of the most consequential venture bets in political history,"" said Matthew Johnson, a Republican lobbyist who heads the technology, telecom and intellectual property practice at the Podesta Group. ""Time will tell, but that bet should prove to be not just on Peter Thiel's behalf but on behalf of Silicon Valley as he may emerge as an emissary for the tech industry, for Silicon Valley, and perhaps counter some of the negative feelings that may still be there within the Trump world,"" Johnson added.      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   But the relationship between Thiel and the rest of the tech industry could remain tenuous as well, one industry lobbyist said. Thiel criticized Silicon Valley leaders as being out of touch with the needs of many Americans, saying recently that the industry has conflated its own prosperity with the prosperity of the nation overall. ""Thiel's disruptive nature may come in handy at helping Trump navigate tech issues, but the question is whether he will have all of tech's interests, the Bay Area's interests, at heart when giving his advice,"" said a Democratic tech industry lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the incoming administration. A tech company official who was not authorized to speak publicly said Trump's resistance to technology -- he reportedly does not use a computer, at least not regularly -- means the industry will have to more actively explain and defend its importance than it has under President Obama. So Thiel is likely to become a critical conduit to Trump for the industry, the official said. Staff writer Brian Fung contributed to this report.

For a carefully scripted royal visit, it marked the first time Shiites not allied with Bahrain's Sunni rulers reached the Prince of Wales' ears. Prince Charles and his wife Camilla's three-nation tour of the Gulf ended Friday in Bahrain, with the two waving goodbye from the door of their airplane. They left behind a Shiite-majority country in the grips of a crackdown on dissent, the like of which unseen since its 2011 Arab Spring protests.   ""I don't see what's gone on behind closed doors or whether the prince raised any questions of human rights,"" said Ebrahim Sharif, a leader in the secular Waad Party. ""Bahrain's government values its relations with the U.K. and if the U.K. puts its weight behind the improvement of human rights in Bahrain, the government will listen. They need friends."" It's not clear what Prince Charles told Bahrain's king, whom he briefly met, nor the crown prince, who attended many of his events smiling brightly for the gathered cameras of the British press. Bahrain's monarchy has a long love of the British royal family. The British Foreign Office, while saying it holds ""frank"" discussions with Bahrain, declined to discuss the prince's own comments. On Friday, the prince's Clarence House issued a statement saying ""their royal highnesses are aware of the points raised by human rights organizations and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are providing background briefings and information."" That wasn't much information for Sharif, who at times has been imprisoned in the tiny island nation. He told The Associated Press that he worried the prince's visit could ""whitewash"" the human rights situation in the small country off the coast of the Arabian Peninsula. Bahrain put down its Arab Spring protests with the help of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The protests were backed by the Shiite majority and others, and were aimed at demanding more political freedoms from the ruling Al Khalifa family. While low-level unrest persisted for years, things remained largely peaceful until April, when Bahrain's military announced it was ""ready to deal firmly and with determination with these sedition groups and their heads"" after a gasoline bomb killed a police officer. Since then, authorities suspended the country's largest Shiite opposition group, Al-Wefaq, and doubled a prison sentence for its secretary-general, Sheikh Ali Salman. Famed activist Nabeel Rajab was imprisoned and now awaits sentencing on a charge of spreading ""false news."" Zainab al-Khawaja, the daughter of well-known activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who himself is serving a life sentence over his role in the 2011 protests, was forced into exile. Meanwhile, the country's security forces have besieged a small town home to a Shiite cleric who had his citizenship stripped by the government earlier this year. For Prince Charles' visit with Camilla, the two were kept far away from the siege of Diraz, though the occasional anti-government graffiti could be seen out of the windows of their speeding motorcade. On Friday, as the call to prayer sounded near the British Embassy that hosted the commemoration ceremony, Diraz itself could not hold prayers. Leaving the embassy, Charles' convoy caught a brief glimpse of Shiite banners as well. But from there, it was off to government-sponsored improvement programs and a housing project. For Sharif, the government should work with an opposition that is ""flexible"" and ""realistic."" However, he warned greater problems awaited heavily leveraged Bahrain as global oil prices remain low.  ""All parties should compromise,"" he said. ""We can't have absolute power in the hands of the ruling family."" Asked if he worried about being imprisoned again over his comments, he laughed.  ""I am addicted to prison now,"" he said. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap . His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/jon-gambrell .

The gig marks a very public return for the reclusive comedian, who skyrocketed to fame with his Comedy Central sketch series ""Chappelle's Show,"" which offered sharp and irreverent social commentary, particularly around race. Memorable sketches include a ""Frontline"" parody that found Chappelle portraying a blind KKK member who didn't know he was actually black and a recurring bit that starred Chappelle as a crack addict with lips perpetually covered in white powder. There is also that classic sketch reenacting a surreal pick-up basketball game that Eddie Murphy and his brother Charlie played with Prince in the mid-80s.      So far this season, Margot Robbie, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Emily Blunt, Tom Hanks, Benedict Cumberbatch and Dave Chappelle have hosted ""Saturday Night Live."" A familiar pattern is emerging. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)   Chappelle abruptly left Comedy Central in 2005 after just two seasons -- months after he reportedly signed a $50 million deal to film a third and fourth season. (He had already filmed enough material to comprise the three episodes that account for the show's very truncated third season.) Chappelle headed to South Africa, sparking rumors that he was mentally ill or struggling with drug addiction, but Chappelle told Time's Johannesburg bureau chief that the country offered him the one thing he could no longer get in the states: quiet. ""I'm an introspective dude,"" he told the magazine. ""I enjoy my own thoughts sometimes. And I've been doing a lot of thinking here."" In the years since, Chappelle -- a Washington native who graduated from the Duke Ellington School of the Arts -- quietly returned to stand-up and has addressed the mystery surrounding  his departure in sporadic interviews. In a 2006 interview with Oprah (one subject of the show's humor), Chappelle said that the show's demanding schedule and its financial success had left him feeling stressed. He also felt the show's subtle satire had morphed into something more sinister. ""I was doing sketches that were funny, but socially irresponsible,"" he said. ""I felt like I was deliberately being encouraged and I was overwhelmed. It's like you're being flooded with things and you don't pay attention to things like your ethics."" Chappelle made the late-night rounds in 2014, leading up to a nine-show stint at Radio City Music Hall. ""Technically, I never quit. I am seven years late for work,"" he told David Letterman. Chappelle admitted he remained conflicted about the way he left the show. ""You know, whenever there's something that I'd like to have that I could have afforded that I can't now afford, well, then I'm upset about it,"" he said. ""But then when I see a guy going to do a job that's time consuming and he doesn't have the free time to do things that I get to do, then I feel good about it.""    Chappelle has continued stand-up, but remains an elusive, often misunderstood figure and has faced heckling at shows in recent years. At the Roots Picnic festival last month, Chappelle told the crowd., ""You guys don't know what I've been through, watching Key & Peele do my show the last five f-ing years."" He was joking, of course -- minutes earlier he had told the crowd that his presence meant that ""Kevin Hart couldn't be here and D'Angelo's late"" -- but Internet headlines screamed that he had ""slammed"" the comedy duo. In a stand-up set last Friday, Chappelle riffed on the election -- including the infamous tape of Donald Trump and Billy Bush's lewd remarks on ""Access Hollywood."" The Observer (whose publisher, Jared Kushner, is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka) reported that Chappelle's 60-minute set was ""largely devoted to slamming Hillary Clinton"" and that the comedian had ""shocked the New York crowd by defending Trump."" On Monday, TMZ asked Chappelle if he was a Trump supporter. ""Jeus Christ,"" Chappelle responded. ""I'm not a Trump supporter. Unequivocally, no. Not gonna elaborate on it. Just everybody vote. For whoever you want to vote for."" A spokesman for the comedian told Variety that Chappelle's routine had ""blasted both candidates"" and that the comedian was ""disgusted by the tone of the election and especially by the idea that his comedy would be misconstrued to defend Trump."" The rep added, ""By the way, he voted for Hillary."" As for what we can expect on Saturday, the running joke is that he might not turn up. In a promo for the show, Chappelle assures Jarobi White and Q-Tip (of ""A Tribe Called Quest,"" who will perform on this weekend's show) that he'll be there.    And anyone curious about his ability to craft political humor should look at a skit from the Season 2 finale of ""Chappelle's Show."" The comedian told the audience that he was often asked why, out of all the people he made fun of on the show, he didn't talk about the president. ""Well, because he's the president,"" Chappelle said. ""I know my limits, ladies and gentleman, and I wouldn't want to cross them,"" he continued. ""But I will say this. If our president were black we would not be at war right now. Not because a black person wouldn't do something like that. Just because America wouldn't let a black person do something like that without asking them a million questions."" Chappelle introduced a sketch called ""Black Bush,"" in which he depicted a black version of then-President George W. Bush trying to make the case for the Iraq War. The sketch plays on many of the stereotypes (Chappelle's Bush is cool, blunt and distrustful of the media) that have made the idea of a black president such an enduring source of humor for black comedians, and features cameos by Mos Def (as the CIA director) and Jamie Foxx (as Black Tony Blair). It's particularly amusing, even prescient, in retrospect. On Saturday, Chappelle will tell jokes to a nation that has already elected its first African American president. But we're also a nation that has elected Trump, following a contentious election that political commentator Van Jones described as ""a white-lash against a changing country"" and ""against a black president.""

(David Chang/European Pressphoto Agency)  One of the first things that President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to do in office is label China a currency manipulator. But to many economists, that charge is aimed at a world that has come and gone. Throughout the campaign, Trump criticized China for intentionally holding down the value of its currency to make its exports cheaper abroad. In an interview, Trump economic adviser Judy Shelton, co-director of the Sound Money Project, argued that addressing currency manipulation could help facilitate trade by forcing countries to adhere to the same standards. ""Currency depreciation is not competing. It's cheating,"" she said. The threat is likely to materialize in the new administration, given that a large number of Democrats also favor labeling China a currency manipulator. Yet many economists who study China say that, at least regarding currency, the charges of cheating don't stick -- anymore. ""When I heard Mr. Trump talking about China, I had this uncomfortable feeling that he was more than 10 years out of date,"" said Pieter Bottelier, an economist who has studied China's economic development for decades. ""The idea that China has manipulated its currency by keeping it artificially undervalued is totally untrue today. ... In fact, the situation is the exact opposite from what Mr. Trump seems to be claiming."" In the 1990s and early 2000s, China held down the value of its currency, called the yuan or renminbi, to the detriment of U.S. exporters, who found that their goods could not compete with China's low prices abroad. For almost two decades, currency manipulation gave Chinese exporters an edge that helped the country morph into an economic powerhouse. Today, that era in China's economy appears to be over, at least for now. Between 2005 and 2015, China allowed the yuan to gradually gain value, and over that decade, the currency appreciated by about a third. Until the middle of 2014, one could have argued that China was still intervening in foreign-exchange markets to keep the value of its currency low. But over the past year and half, the country's economic situation has transformed, economists say. As China's growth slows, its people have tried to send more capital out of the country to find more lucrative and safer investments around the world. That has put downward pressure on China's currency, and policymakers have switched to propping it up, rather than holding it down, economists say. When evaluated against the U.S. dollar, China's currency appears to be depreciating in recent months. But that is because the U.S. dollar has been gaining in strength. When measured against other currencies, such as the euro, the yuan looks more stable. In a report in October, the U.S. treasury said that China did not fulfill the three criteria currently necessary to be labeled a currency manipulator (which are having a large trade surplus with the United States, engaging in persistent and one-sided intervention in foreign-exchange markets, and having a material current account surplus). In fact, China met only one of the criteria (the trade surplus), while Japan, Korea, Germany, Taiwan and Switzerland each met two. The Treasury report concluded that China was actually intervening in foreign-exchange markets ""to prevent a rapid RMB depreciation that would have negative consequences for the Chinese and global economies."" Between August 2015 and August 2016, China sold more than $570 billion in foreign currency to prop up the value of the yuan, the Treasury report said -- a trend that is visible in the chart below.  ""The reality is that, if anything, China is doing the U.S. a favor by keeping its currency from falling as fast as markets seem to want it to fall,"" said Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of the recent book ""Gaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi."" The currency-manipulation charge stems from a real concern over the Chinese economy: that America's trade deficit with China continues to grow. But in its report, the Treasury Department concluded that the solution to China's massive trade surplus with the U.S. is not in China's currency, but in encouraging Beijing to rebalance its economy toward consuming more and producing less. China experts have championed these changes for years. Nothing would stop a Trump administration from changing Treasury rules and labeling China a currency manipulator anyway. That would trigger a formal process in which the U.S. government could limit Chinese investment in the United States or introduce tariffs and trade barriers against China. Such a move -- accurate or not -- could provoke retaliation from Beijing that could hurt U.S. companies and workers. Prasad says China is unlikely to bend to U.S. pressure, in part because it is in the midst of a political transition in which the government will probably want to appear strong to a domestic audience. In addition, the U.S. market today is not as central to China's economy as it once was: It accounts for about 17-18 percent of China's exports, down from about one-quarter years ago. If pressured, China could respond by restricting access to the Chinese market for some of America's biggest firms, such as Apple, Walmart or Boeing, as well as America's farmers. ""Taking action against China's currency or trade practices could very quickly escalate into a tit-for-tat battle that turns into an all-out trade war. The hope on both sides is that reason will prevail, but the political context in both countries makes this a particularly dangerous time when words and actions could have much greater consequences,"" Prasad says. To be sure, there are plenty of aspects of the Chinese economy that a Trump administration could criticize on stronger ground. China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 promising to grant companies around the world freer access to its markets. And in many sectors, such as financial services, technology and the media, China has broken those promises.

" NEW YORK -- The election is over, so what about all those frayed relationships among loved ones? Mothers and sons, sisters and brothers, friends unfriended -- it's been tough for some on opposing sides who must now figure out the way forward. They wonder what their ties will feel like a month from now. A year. What about the holidays? Leigh Anne O'Connor in Manhattan already has her answer, and her heart broke.  ""My dad just called and said he is not coming for Thanksgiving,"" she said Thursday. ""I cried last night when we hung up."" He supported President-elect Donald Trump, along with one of her sisters and other relatives. She did not.  ""He got into a 'discussion' on Facebook with a friend who will be at Thanksgiving and he also read something my oldest daughter wrote against our family members who supported Trump,"" O'Connor explained. ""My mom was always liberal. She died 12 years ago. Things would be different if she was still alive."" In Los Angeles, Tonya McKenzie said she expects her big brother to show up for turkey despite their political differences. She has always looked up to him but anticipates a new level of ""awkwardness"" after he went on a few social media rampages disparaging Hillary Clinton. Until then, McKenzie said they had been able to thoughtfully agree and disagree on specific issues and traits they liked about each presidential candidate, with the siblings often crossing party lines together. McKenzie wound up voting for Clinton. Though she likely knows the answer, ""I'm scared to ask him who he voted for,"" said McKenzie, who would rather dwell on more positive times. Kim Terca lives in San Francisco and works in the tech industry. She was raised in a conservative South Dakota Republican family and has always voted for Democrats or Independents. Until now. She voted for Trump, for many reasons, and won't be spending Thanksgiving or Christmas with a particular friend and her family as she has for the last two years.  ""She's been ghosting me for the last few months,"" Terca said Friday. ""But she did say at one point, 'Are you really for Trump?' We're not going to be close friends any more. No. It's really sad."" For Clinton supporter Taz Loomans, who lives in Portland, Oregon, her ache comes over her relationship with her older sister. Like McKenzie, she hasn't asked whether her loved one -- both are 40-somethings -- cast a vote for Trump. Loomans doesn't want to seal that in words.  ""We're a Muslim family. She hadn't been with Trump the whole time. She was really appalled at his candidacy and his racism. But at the end she said she hated Hillary more and was really suspicious of Hillary,"" Loomans said. Their bond is battered but not broken, she said, and she's not sure how her feelings will settle. They've spoken since the election.  ""I love my sister. I'm not going to disown her or stop speaking to her, but I've always looked up to her and her opinions. If she disagreed with me, it always made me think, oh maybe she has a point,"" Loomans said. ""But this kind of takes that away. She's not on a pedestal anymore."" The election cycle has clearly left some families battered, along with Amanda Rose in Louisville, Kentucky. She's a professional matchmaker.  ""I had one man that refused to continue to date a lady that voted for Trump. I have heard of countless conflicts with dates because of the election. It's been so bad I've decided not to set up any more dates till next week,"" Rose said Thursday. It's a husband-wife thing for Bill Seavey in Cambria, California. She's from Canada and a Trump voter. He was for Clinton.  ""There were some hurt feelings that we wouldn't accept each other's viewpoints,"" he said. ""We're civil people, love each other and we agreed to disagree. But I'm glad the election is over!"" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Find out where to cast your ballots here: http://bit.ly/1Wu5vkP . ___ ID RULES: Virginia voters must show a valid photo ID at the polls. Accepted forms of identification include: a driver's license, U.S. passport, student photo identification card for a Virginia college or university, and Virginia Voter Photo ID card. Voters who forget IDs must cast provisional ballots. That gives them until noon Friday to get a copy of an ID to the local electoral board in person, via email, in the mailed, or faxed. Voters who fail to do so won't have their votes counted. People without an ID can still apply for a free Virginia Voter Photo ID card at local voter registration offices. The general registrar will provide a temporary ID. ___ WHO'S ON THE BALLOT? -- PRESIDENT: Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump are fighting for the battleground state of Virginia. Also running are Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, Jill Stein of the Green Party, and independent candidate Evan McMullin. -- CONGRESS: Key races to watch are in the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 10th congressional districts. The 2nd District race features Republican state Del. Scott Taylor and Democratic candidate Shaun Brown. Brown, who served as a Virginia state delegate for Bernie Sanders, is hoping to become the state's first African-American congresswoman. Taylor, a former Navy SEAL, defeated 4th District Rep. Randy Forbes in the June primary after the congressman decided to run in the newly redrawn 2nd District instead of his home district. The 2nd District includes defense-heavy Hampton Roads, including the Norfolk Naval Base, the largest naval base in the world. Democratic state Sen. Don McEachin is facing off against Republican Mike Wade, the sheriff in Henrico County, to replace Forbes in the 4th District. Changes in the makeup of the district, which stretches from the Richmond suburbs to parts of Hampton Roads, are expected to benefit Democrats this year. GOP state Sen. Tom Garrett is battling Democrat Jane Dittmar, the former chair of the board of supervisors in Albemarle County, for the open seat in the 5th District. The district stretches from Fauquier County on the edge of northern Virginia through Charlottesville and down to much of southside Virginia. Republican Robert Hurt, who has represented the district since 2011, chose not to seek re-election. In northern Virginia's 10th District, freshman Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock is trying to fend off a serious challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett. Trump's unpopularity in northern Virginia has loomed large in the race, with Bennett trying to tie her opponent to the wealthy Republican businessman while Comstock has sought to distance herself from him. -- LOCAL RACES: Elections for mayor are being held in several cities, including Richmond, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach. ___ WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW? There will be two ballot questions this year, including a proposal to enshrine Virginia's right-to-work law in the state's Constitution. Virginia already has a right-to-work law -- which bars union membership as a condition of employment -- but supporters hope putting it in the constitution will make it more difficult for future administrations to change that policy. The other proposal on the ballot would allow localities to provide property tax exemptions for the spouse of a law-enforcement officer, firefighter, search and rescue personnel, or emergency medical services personnel who are killed in the line of duty.
