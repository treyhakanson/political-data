(Evan Vucci/Associated Press)  Lobbyists are continuing to advise Donald Trump's transition planning, despite the president-elect's pledge to rid the process of their involvement. A Trump spokesman said earlier this week that Vice President-elect Mike Pence and transition executive director Rick Dearborn were ""making good on President-elect Trump's promise that we're not going to have any lobbyists involved with the transition efforts."" But some lobbyists remain involved in the transition operation and others are advising as informal consultants, two people with knowledge of transition planning said. David Bernhardt, who is leading the transition's Interior Department issues, filed a termination report with the Senate on Friday that ends his representation of a lobbying client, Westlands Water District. The filing indicates he is staying on the transition, as Westlands was his only lobbying client in the most recent quarter of the year, lobbying records show. Bernhardt is a partner at the law-and-lobby firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. Earlier this week, a lobbyist who is a close aide to Pence, Josh Pitcock, filed paperwork terminating his status as a federal lobbyist. The filings -- known as ""deregistering"" -- allows them to comply with the transition's new lobbyist ban, which requires transition members to sign an agreement certifying they are not a registered lobbyist. The new lobbyist rule was announced Wednesday following criticism that Trump was welcoming lobbyists onto the transition despite his campaign pledge to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington. The abrupt change disrupted the already-hectic transition planning.   [Trump proposes five-year ban on executive branch officials and lawmakers who want to become lobbyists]   At least two lobbyists have since resigned, including Mike McKenna and Mike Catanzaro, who had both been working on the transition to help form energy policy. ""Although I have reluctantly decided that I cannot continue on the transition in an official capacity, I am excited about continuing to work to make America great again,"" McKenna said in a statement. A person familiar with Catanzaro's decision said he was honored to serve on the transition team but did not intend to join the administration."

When voters legalized recreational marijuana statewide two years ago, the communities -- from the cowboy town of Pendleton to Sweet Home in the Willamette Valley -- opted out. But many switched it up this month, voting to allow at least some form of the pot industry, including medical marijuana.  ""No one has done this in Oregon since liquor Prohibition,"" said Scott Winkels, a lobbyist with the League of Oregon Cities. ""This is the first time we've had to step in and develop and regulate a marketplace for a controlled substance since 1933."" Local officials must determine operating hours for marijuana retailers, growing farms and processors. They also were trying to figure out whether the businesses should be allowed near parks and what sort of security and odor controls the businesses must provide. The rule-setting also was happening in other states that have legalized recreational marijuana. In California, which approved pot last week, the San Jose City Council imposed a temporary ban -- including on outdoor gardens -- to give officials time to develop regulations for sales and farming. In Colorado, where voters passed marijuana in 2012, the rules were still being tweaked. This month, Denver became the first U.S. city to allow people to use marijuana in bars and restaurants, though state licensing officials announced a rule Friday that prohibits businesses with liquor licenses from allowing pot consumption on their premises. The move strikes a major blow to the voter-passed initiative. In Oregon, the Liquor Control Commission didn't begin finalizing regulations and licensing businesses until this year. The communities that approved marijuana businesses on Election Day are now starting to look at regulations.  ""Most have been borrowing from each other,"" said Rob Bovett, legal counsel of Association of Oregon Counties, describing efforts to establish ordinances. Opt-in ballot measures go into effect in January, Bovett said. If the jurisdictions want to reap the tax benefits at the earliest opportunity, they should have the regulations finalized before then so marijuana companies can seek licenses and start doing business, liquor commission spokesman Mark Pettinger said. The League of Oregon Cities has drawn up a guide to help struggling local officials. It says cities may impose restrictions on the hours of operation and the locations of producers, processors, wholesalers, as well as retailers and medical marijuana grow sites, processing sites and dispensaries. They may also regulate public access and how the businesses operate.  ""Probably most cities will use (the guide) as a template,"" Winkels said. ""The easiest way is to cut and paste the ordinance in ... though some will probably be making local adjustments."" Robert Snyder, lawyer for the town of Sweet Home, said forming the rules is ""going to take work"" and that it will be up to the city council to decide whether to get public input. One marijuana ballot measure that passed last week imposed a 3 percent local sales tax on marijuana products, on top of a 17 percent state sales tax, Bovett said. Even counties and cities that decided to prohibit marijuana businesses hedged their bets by approving the additional tax so they can be prepared to impose it if voters eventually say yes to pot.  ""All (of Oregon's) 111 cities and counties voted yes on the local tax,"" Bovett said. ___ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky . Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The measure on enshrining same-sex couples' right to wed in the constitution was defeated 19-8, with one abstention, in the Commission on Constitutional Matters. Commission chairman Edgar Castillo Martinez said the vote means the matter is ""totally and definitively concluded,"" according to a summary published online by the Chamber of Deputies. Mexico's Supreme Court ruled last year that it was unconstitutional for states to bar same-sex marriage. But the decision did not have the effect of overturning or rewriting any laws on the books, meaning individual couples still have to sue in each case for the right to wed. Same-sex marriage has been formally legalized only in some jurisdictions, such as Mexico City, the northern state of Coahuila and Quintana Roo state on the Caribbean coast. Pena Nieto's proposal in May would have codified the principles of the Supreme Court ruling in the constitution and extended the right to all of Mexico. The president's political party suffered big setbacks in midterm elections in June, and largely sat on the issue afterward. Lawmaker Guadalupe Acosta Naranjo of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party blamed political calculations for the defeat of the measure.  ""A reform of which we should feel proud,"" Acosta said, according to the transcript. ""Because the rights of minorities are not put to a vote. They are expanded and recognized, and it is congress that should protect them."" Candido Ochoa Rojas of the Green Party, which is allied with Pena Nieto's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, said he was voting against the measure due to constitutional conflicts and because marriage is governed by state civil codes.  ""How will it bolster the family if the preamble says that procreation is not a decisive element of marriage?"" Ochoa said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

During the final week of his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump vowed to repeal the 2010 health-care law so swiftly that he might summon Congress into a special session to accomplish the task. ""We will do it, and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe,"" he said. On Wednesday, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and other congressional Republicans voiced fresh determination to complete the deed. After dozens of fruitless repeal votes in the House, and a major rescission attempt this year that President Obama blocked, Ryan noted that ""now we have President Trump coming, who is asking us to do this."" According to lawmakers and health-policy analysts, the GOP majorities in both chambers are likely to employ Congress's reconciliation process to reverse critical aspects of the statute that involve federal spending, such as the subsidies helping millions of working- and middle-class Americans afford health plans. But analysts said a political path is less clear to dismantling other parts of the law, such as its insurance marketplaces, or to instituting a set of conservative health-care approaches.  [Obama's legislative legacy comes down to this question: What if?]      Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)   The ACA's most ardent supporters have begun a counteroffensive to stoke opposition to reversing ways in which the law has upgraded coverage and made it more affordable for some consumers. Families USA, a liberal consumer-health lobby, convened an afternoon call with more than 1,000 people from all 50 states to begin mapping a grass-roots campaign. ""The clock is ticking, because Republicans appear to be saying health care is going to be the first item on their list with repeal of the ACA being the banner for that,"" said Ron Pollack, Families USA's executive director for three decades. ""This will be the most intense fight I remember. . . . One should never underestimate an extraordinary backlash that occurs when people have something that they really value and it is taken away."" The Affordable Care Act, enacted in the spring of 2010 with virtually no GOP support, is a 2,000-page statute that has ushered in the broadest changes to the health-care system in half a century. With Trump's election, ""the ACA as we know it would seem to be toast,"" said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.  ""I don't think there has been a reversal of any public benefit that would be as large as this,"" Levitt said. The only other significant reversal by Congress of a major health-care policy -- the expansion of Medicare to include catastrophic coverage -- took place in 1989 before the benefit took effect. The challenge for Republicans, Levitt added, ""comes now in trying to come to some consensus about how to unwind it and what to replace it with.""  [Medical marijuana victories in Florida, North Dakota, Arkansas, Montana turn the tide]  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), one of the ACA's loudest critics, declined Wednesday to spell out details of the procedures Republicans would use to abolish the law. But in a media briefing to celebrate the Senate preserving its majority, he said, ""All of that is underway.""     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump View Graphic     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump  Congress demonstrated in January that it could use the Senate's reconciliation process -- requiring just 50 votes -- to send a repeal bill to the White House. Although GOP lawmakers understood that Obama would veto that legislation, ""it was a strategic move,"" said Tevi Troy, an ACA critic who is a former deputy health secretary and the chief executive of the American Health Policy Institute. ""Congress intentionally set it up so they could demonstrate a legislative pathway."" Under that bill, there would have been a two-year transition before any features of the law ended. The idea was to give congressional Republicans breathing space to design a replacement and pass a new law. But with the GOP holding 51 seats in the next Senate, it is unclear whether it will be able to amass the 60 votes needed to overcome a potential filibuster and adopt an alternative to the ACA. If the GOP repeals the law but then is ""unable to agree in two years on what will take its place, that is the nightmare scenario,"" said John McDonough, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who worked intensively on the ACA's creation as an aide to the late senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). Still, the reconciliation process could have sweeping effects if it reversed both the insurance subsidies in ACA marketplaces and a set of taxes that help pay for other parts of the law. If Congress undid a Medicare payroll tax, McDonough said, it would ""actually implement one of the largest tax cuts on high-income families ever.""   [Trump: If Obamacare is not repealed, it 'will destroy health care in America' ]   Trump has said that he favors keeping one key aspect, which outlaws the old practice by many insurers of refusing to cover people with preexisting medical problems or charging them more than other customers. The insurance industry has long said it would have a hard time abiding by this rule unless virtually all Americans are required to have insurance -- a central feature of the ACA that Trump wants to cut. Trump's campaign never put details on a set of conservative health-care ideas that he sketched out as a candidate. They included converting Medicaid from an entitlement program for lower-income Americans to annual block grants to states. Also proposed was letting individuals deduct the cost of insurance from their taxes. Even without details, congressional budget analysts and outside health-policy experts have estimated the likely impact of dismantling the ACA and replacing it with Trump's health policies.   [Experts from across the ideological spectrum put the presidential candidates' health-care positions in perspective]   The Congressional Budget Office forecast that, over the coming decade, repealing the law would cause the deficit to grow by $353 billion, while the number of people with insurance would fall by about 24 million. The Rand Corp. has predicted that in 2018, the first full year of Trump's tenure, his campaign's health plan would add nearly $6 billion to the deficit, primarily by undoing a slowdown in Medicare payments under the law. It also would decrease the number of insured by about 20 million people, according to Rand. In the short term, the sudden doubt about the law's future also has the potential to confuse -- and perhaps thwart -- the fourth open-enrollment season for ACA health plans through HealthCare.gov and similar state-run insurance marketplaces. The three-month sign-up period began Nov. 1 amid surging insurance premiums and diminished coverage options in many parts of the country. In his first briefing after the election, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said there were no specific steps the president or his aides plan to take to shore up policies with which his successor disagrees. ""This administration is going to continue to make a strong case that people should go to HealthCare.gov, consider the options that are available to them and sign up for health care,"" Earnest said.

The unnamed officer's federal lawsuit says he was struck in the face by a piece of concrete or a ""rock like substance"" thrown at police during a July 9 protest over the death of Alton Sterling, a black man shot and killed during a scuffle with two white officers. The suit doesn't accuse Mckesson of throwing anything at officers but claims he ""incited the violence"" on behalf of Black Lives Matter, which also is named as a defendant. Mckesson ""was in charge of the protests and he was seen and heard giving orders throughout the day and night of the protests,"" the suit says. ""The protest turned into a riot."" The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, says the officer lost teeth and had injuries to his jaw and brain. Mckesson, who said he hasn't seen the suit and couldn't immediately comment on it, was among nearly 200 protesters arrested during the protests sparked by Sterling's fatal shooting July 5. He and other protesters have sued the city of Baton Rouge over their arrests, accusing police of using excessive force and violating their constitutional rights. The officer suing Mckesson is identified only as ""John Doe"" in the suit, saying the anonymity is ""for his protection."" A separate court filing Monday cited the July 7 sniper attack that killed five Dallas police officers and the July 17 shooting that killed three law-enforcement officers in Baton Rouge as grounds for concealing the officer's identity. The suit describes Black Lives Matter as a ""national unincorporated association"" and claims Mckesson is a ""managing member"" of it. Mckesson described himself as a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement.  ""No organization started the movement,"" he said. Dane Ciolino, a Loyola University law professor in New Orleans, said it's ""really unusual"" for the officer to sue under a pseudonym in a case of this kind. Ciolino also said it could be difficult for the officer's attorneys to prove that Mckesson or Black Lives Matter ""aided and abetted"" the alleged battery or somehow negligently allowed it to happen.  ""Black Lives Matter is just a social movement. It's not an entity. I don't know how it could be liable,"" he said. Donna Grodner, a Baton Rouge-based attorney for the officer, declined to elaborate on the suit's allegations. She said the officer is still being treated for his injuries. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards has defended the police response to the protests. The governor, a Democrat who comes from a family of sheriffs, also noted that a police officer had teeth knocked out by a rock during the protests. It's unclear if that officer is the same one suing. Baton Rouge Police Sgt. Don Coppola, a department spokesman, declined to comment on the suit. Mckesson, a Baltimore resident, was arrested July 9 near Baton Rouge police headquarters on a charge of obstructing a highway. East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore has said Mckesson is one of roughly 100 arrested protesters who will not be prosecuted by his office for the same charge.

Now the Democratic vice presidential nominee is wrapping up a whirlwind three months on the campaign trail in front of a home crowd.  ""I like the energy I'm seeing in Virginia,"" Kaine told a crowd on the campus of George Mason University in Fairfax at a Monday night rally where he was joined by Vice President Joe Biden. It's a rare stop in his home state, as the U.S. senator and former Virginia governor has been on the road nearly every day since being tapped as Clinton's running mate in late July. With Clinton long favored to win in Virginia, Kaine has spent much of his time in key swing states like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The typical campaign day has been packed with interviews, rallies and fundraisers and Kaine has spent countless hours on a private charter plane or zipping along highways in motorcades. Tom Wolf, a former law partner who joined Kaine on the campaign trail, said his longtime friend is having fun and staying ""centered"" despite the long hours.  ""He genuinely enjoys campaigning, he likes meeting new people,"" said Wolf. Kaine has been a guest on late night TV, played harmonica with rock stars at rallies and fundraisers, and even attended his 40th high school reunion in Kansas City, Missouri. But Kaine's time on the trail has been largely low key. Republican Donald Trump and Clinton -- or her more high-profile surrogates like President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama -- have dominated the daily news cycles and left Kaine sometimes looking like the forgotten candidate. Kaine has also spent virtually no time campaigning with Clinton, and he said they sometimes go a week without talking. Kaine has plowed on as reliable foot soldier, dutifully attacking Trump in standard stump speeches before audiences large and small while avoided making any noticeable missteps that could draw negative attention. Though his appearance on the biggest stage, the vice presidential debate, received criticism on his aggressive style and constant interruptions of Republican Mike Pence. Much of Kaine's time on the trail was initially spent on the private fundraiser circuit, often doing several such events a day. In recent weeks, Kaine has used his Spanish fluency to be a key surrogate for Clinton among Hispanic voters. He's done about 50 interviews with Spanish-speaking media outlets and given some speeches entirely in Spanish. WikiLeaks, which has been posting stolen emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta, twice taunted Kaine that he's in for a ""surprise."" U.S. intelligence officials have said the leaked Podesta emails are part of a series of high-profile computer hacks of Democratic targets orchestrated by the Russian government. But WikiLeaks has so far not published anything damning about Kaine, who has shrugged off the threats. Kaine's Virginia homecoming comes amid tightening polls numbers in the state and The Associated Press has moved the Old Dominion from strong Democratic to leaning Democratic. Trump and Pence have made repeated visits to Virginia. Once a reliably Republican state, Virginia went twice for Obama and Kaine has said that helping turn the state blue in 2008 is among his greatest political accomplishments as governor. Kaine frequently talks about Virginia's shifting politics in speeches around the country. And when Kaine made a brief return to his home state for the vice presidential debate, Kaine told his fellow Virginia Democrats they should be proud of the progress they've made.

" WASHINGTON -- A hacked email released by WikiLeaks on Sunday suggests Hillary Clinton was miffed by Nancy Pelosi's initial refusal to endorse her during the Democratic presidential primary. Clinton aide Huma Abedin noted in a July 16, 2015, email to a list of people including campaign Chairman John Podesta that Clinton had asked for the House Democratic leader's endorsement over Sen. Bernie Sanders. Pelosi ""didn't say yes,"" Abedin wrote. ""HRC said she felt it was a non-answer."" Abedin suggested that she or Podesta call Pelosi's top aide ""to see what the deal is but she wasn't prepared for that answer,"" according to the email. It's not unusual for party leaders to avoid taking sides in primaries. Sanders -- and Pelosi -- ultimately endorsed Clinton. The email was among about 2,000 messages published Sunday by WikiLeaks. The emails were hacked from Podesta's private account. The U.S. government has said the Russian government was responsible for the hack, although WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said that no government or any other state parties had given the stolen emails to his organization. He offered no evidence to support his denials, and the wording of his statement did not rule out the possibility that the emails were obtained by a state actor and then provided to another party who then passed them to WikiLeaks. It is impossible to authenticate each hacked email that WikiLeaks has published, but Democrats have openly acknowledged they were hacked and have not pointed to any specific case where an email was altered to inflict political damage. Also released Sunday was an email from Hillary Clinton's spokesman Robby Mook to Podesta, in which Mook waved a cautionary flag about another Clinton insider who could be seen as an ethically questionable connection between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. In the March 11, 2015, email, Mook writes of Clinton Foundation donor Jose Villarreal that ""it looks like he's snared up in the conflict of interest stuff at State....not the WORST thing in the world, but there's a real argument here that he was at the nexus of foundation/state issues."" Mook adds: ""Mostly trumped up, but I'd question if we want him as an officer."" It's not clear what kind of ""officer"" Mook is referring to. Mook goes on to note that as secretary of state, Clinton ""took advantage of her financial networks and corporate connections to raise over $72 million from 66 corporations for the United States Pavilion at the World's Fair in Shanghai in 2010."" Villareal was selected to be the commissioner general of the U.S. Expo in Shanghai. Some of the corporations involved in the exhibit also contributed to the Clinton Foundation and received favorable treatment from the State Department, Mook's email says. Those corporations included Proctor & Gamble, Boeing and General Electric. ___ Associated Press writers Yvonne Gonzalez in Phoenix and Paisley Dodds in London contributed to this report.

The Republican nominee will hold a 10 p.m. rally Sunday at a fairgrounds in the Northern Virginia swing territory of Loudoun County. Pence, the governor of Indiana, was scheduled to appear at a rally at George Mason University Saturday at 8 p.m.  Two of Trump's children -- Donald Jr. and Ivanka Trump -- will come to Northern Virginia on Sunday and Monday, respectively. Trump's decision to appear in a populous, purple Washington exurb cuts against his broader strategy of running up the vote in heavily red, rural areas. Much of his last-minute appeals have been in tiny burgs like Selma, N.C., population 6,000. His foray into Northern Virginia appears to be a bid to hold down Clinton's margins in a region that, excluding the exurbs, leans heavily Democratic.   [Rural strategy takes Trump to very red places in final days]  ""We're going right into the lion's den,"" said John Fredericks, a conservative radio host and chairman of Trump's Virginia campaign. ""We're taking it right to their base. We're going to have a much better showing in Northern Virginia than anybody dreamed of. We are going to win Virginia."" Trump's planned visit comes as some Virginia Republicans were expressing newfound optimism about his chances here based on tightening polls. Clinton's decision last week to resume TV ads in the state and dispatch running mate Sen.Tim Kaine to his home state for two election eve rallies also raised hopes that Virginia was back in play. At a moment in the campaign when time is even more precious than money, Trump's 11th-hour visit signals some confidence that he can win the state. In addition to Trump, Pence and the Trump's children, the campaign will dispatch Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to hit suburban Richmond and rural Farmville and Lynchburg on Monday. ""Virginia is a state that is notorious for breaking late. 2016 is no exception,"" Mike Rubino, Trump's Virginia senior adviser, said in a text message. ""Mr. Trump's America First policy agenda is tailor made for this state and we are investing heavily in Virginia over the final days to ensure his message reaches every voter.""  [Republicans dare to hope: Did Virginia get her swing back?]  A Washington Post compilation of battleground-state polls finds Clinton winning Virginia 45 percent to Trump's 41 percent. Poll averages calculated by The Post reflect recent surveys that also include Libertarian Gary Johnson, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent candidate Evan McMullin in states where they are on the ballot and where results are available. Some neutral analysts and more than a few Republicans remained skeptical of Trump's chances. Clinton does not need to win Virginia's 13 electoral votes to pull off a victory, but Trump has a much narrower path to the White House without them. ""It's hard to judge Trump's strategy by his travel schedule when he has done events in Baltimore and Washington state,"" said Nathan L. Gonzales, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report. ""There's a difference between declaring that a state is 'in play' and it being a toss-up or even within reach. Trump's team apparently believes they have a chance in Virginia, but there's probably an easier to path to 270 [electoral votes] for him without winning the commonwealth.""  Brian Zuzenak, director of Clinton's Virginia campaign, said Democrats are working hard in the state and remain confident that the former secretary of state will prevail.  [Trump confounds many Republicans with last-minute push in Virginia]  ""We are proud of the organization we have built, and throughout this campaign we have seen Hillary's message and vision resonate with voters across the Commonwealth,"" he said in an email. Virginia was always expected to be a battleground, but Clinton had enjoyed a comfortable lead here for so long that both sides pulled their TV ads in the summer.  Trump returned with a $2 million television ad buy two weeks ago and appeared at a Virginia Beach rally on Oct. 22. But even some Republicans dismissed those moves as a wasteful attempt to dispel rumors that he was pulling out of the state entirely. Yet Republicans saw more reason to hope last week given tighter polls and Clinton's six-figure ad buy. Kaine announced election eve rallies in Northern Virginia and Richmond -- perhaps signaling a surprising need to shore up support in a state where he presided as a popular governor and which he represents in the U.S. Senate. At least so far, the Clinton campaign has not disclosed any plans to bring the candidate back to Virginia. She has not appeared at an event here since July. ""I don't think Democrats are taking anything for granted, but there are bigger concerns than Virginia on the electoral map, such as Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, and maybe even Michigan and Wisconsin,"" Gonzales said.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA:  SELMA, N.C. -- As he barnstorms the country in the final days of the campaign, Donald Trump has made a notable number of stops in relatively out-of-the-way places like this one, most of which are already guaranteed to break heavily for Republicans. After his motorcade traveled 47 miles from the Raleigh airport last night, the GOP nominee spoke to an energetic crowd of 15,000 during an outdoor rally on a farm in this town of 6,000. Mitt Romney carried Johnston County with 63.4 percent four years ago, but the former Massachusetts governor received only 48,000 of his 2.3 million votes in North Carolina from here. Trump's advisers believe he can win over rural whites by a much bigger margin than Romney and come away with significantly more votes, which they gamble will offset his weakness among suburban Republicans. They believe off-the-charts turnout in the country will tip the balance in a battleground state that remains a true toss-up. A week ago Wednesday, Trump went to Kinston -- in the coastal plains region of eastern North Carolina. The population is 21,000. Earlier yesterday afternoon, on the other side of the state, Trump spoke in Concord, on the periphery of the Charlotte metro area, in a county Romney won with 60 percent. Many savvy Republican operatives are puzzled by these scheduling decisions. They just don't think there are that many additional votes to net, and they believe Trump should be focusing more on shoring up recalcitrant Republicans who might be amenable to coming home in the wake of the FBI announcement about new emails in the Hillary Clinton investigation. I've written several times about Trump's time management problem, from the ribbon cutting for his new D.C. hotel last week to his Albuquerque visit on Sunday. Remember when he wasted a week campaigning in California in June? Or when he held a big rally in Mississippi this August? Or when he went to his golf course in Scotland? In this case, there is a more legitimate -- even if ill-advised -- theory of the case. Polonius might even say there a method in the madness.    A supporter in Selma. (Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA)   -- Trump supporters who live in the rural areas that Trump has lavished with attention predict it will pay huge dividends and fuel what they expect to be a landslide victory next Tuesday. Fifteen voters I interviewed at Trump's rally made this point: Neal Brantley did not vote for Romney in 2012 because he perceived him as too moderate. He wrote in Ron Paul's name instead. Asked if locals are more excited about 2016 than past elections, the 76-year-old fence builder stretched out his arms as wide as they would go. ""I never heard anything I would call 'enthusiasm' before now,"" he said. ""It's the difference between this point and this point."" Brantley is also a leader in the local chapter of Sons of Confederate Veterans and likes to wear a replica of Robert E. Lee's uniform. Because he has a white beard, he said many people tell him that he looks just like the Civil War commander. ""How much smaller a town can you get than here? This is truly real America right here,"" he said. Tracy Haas, 43, a business manager for a nonprofit, said it is ""mind blowing"" that Trump would come here -- in a good way. ""It was genius of him,"" she said. ""People on the Democrat side probably laughed at him because it's little ole Selma, but it was so genius. I mean we're on a farm, and that's what Johnston County is all about -- the country."" ""It means so much that he's here,"" added Judy Bennett, 47, a property manager who lives a mile down the road. ""It puts our county on the map. A potential president of the United States has been here now! Hillary would never come because we're not important enough to her. She doesn't care about us.""    A little boy watches Trump in Selma, N.C., last night. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)   -- Review Trump's schedule, and you'll see how this strategy is manifesting itself far beyond North Carolina: On Wednesday, he went to Pensacola, Fla. He stumped in Eau Claire, Wis., on Tuesday, instead of the Milwaukee suburbs, where's he badly underperforming and needs to shore up soft Republicans. On Sunday, it was Greeley, Colo. Last Thursday, it was Springfield, Ohio. He's also invested time trying to win one electoral vote from rural Maine. The National Rifle Association, the conservative outside group that has been most helpful to Trump, has trained its advertising fire on these same rural voters in target states, including North Carolina.    Check out the word ""Hillary"" on Trump's teleprompter last night. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)   -- For Trump, vanity might also be a factor. The reality TV star draws energy from large, raucous audiences. His advance guys have an easier time building crowds in places like Selma. Literally, the loudest cheers last night came when Trump talked about the size of his crowd. He did it three times during a 45-minute speech. ""Even the pundits, even the ones that don't like me, say there's never been anything like this. You just take a look at this field,"" he said. ""We're just five days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. ... You are going to remember this night as a very important night."" Eileen LePage, 47, said she could not bring herself to vote for Romney last time because he is too much of a squishy politician, but she cannot wait to go vote for Trump. Though she lives in Selma, she said even here there is ""a stigma"" attached to publicly supporting him. Her sons were nervous they'd be called racists at school by the African American students. And she worried about how the Mexican immigrants who attend her Catholic parish might respond. But seeing so many members of the local community -- though virtually all white -- was exhilarating and even liberating. The speech was immediately followed by a fireworks show. The crowd chanted U-S-A, and the lyrics ""you can't always get what you want"" blared over the loudspeakers. At the exit, a vendor sold target practice sheets with a bull's eye over Clinton's head for $2 -- ""or three for $5."" He also hawked buttons that said, ""Cubs win. Trump wins.""

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- America's labor market continues to show signs of gradual strengthening, with newly released government data showing the economy added 161,000 jobs last month. From Ana Swanson: ""Annual wage growth surged to levels not seen since before the financial crisis, while the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9 percent in October from 5 percent the previous month. Economists ... had expected U.S. employers to add 173,000 new jobs in October, roughly on pace with average monthly job gains over the course of the year. The final piece of economic data released before the presidential election on Tuesday, the jobs report showed an economy that is steadily emerging from the shadow of the Great Recession.""    A crowd of about 5,500 watched Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Pharrell Williams at Coastal Credit Union Music Park in Raleigh last night. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- Our Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll gives Clinton a three-point edge over Trump nationally, 47 to 44 percent. The poll finds the popular vote could be amazingly similar to 2012, when Obama won by a four-point margin. From our in-house pollsters Scott Clement and Emily Guskin:  Trump holds a clear 48-39 percent advantage on who is best ""to deal with corruption in government."" Trump leads with independents by eight points in the latest wave (47-39). That mirrors Romney's five-point win with the group. Twenty-nine percent believe the most important issue is the economy. That's followed by corruption in government, terrorism and national security, health care and immigration.     Megyn Kelly poses for a portrait in New York. Her book ""Settle For More"" comes out on Nov. 15. (Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File)   -- Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly reportedly alleges in her new memoir that Roger Ailes tried to sexually assault her in his New York office and hinted that she would be fired when she ""pushed him away."" Radar Online's Sharon Churcher got an early look at the book: ""Kelly claims he started to harass her in the summer of 2005, a few months after she was hired as a legal correspondent in Fox's Washington bureau. She writes that she was informed by her managing editor that she'd 'captured the attention of Mr. Ailes' and she was summoned to the first of a series of meetings in his Manhattan office. 'Roger began pushing the limits,' she alleges. 'There was a pattern to his behavior. I would be called into Roger's office, he would shut the door, and over the next hour or two, he would engage in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with me.'"" The now 76-year-old offered to advance her career ""in exchange for sexual favors,"" Radar reports. In 2006, she says he began trying to kiss her on the lips -- and when she refused, asked her when her contract was up. ""And then, for the third time, he tried to kiss me,"" Kelly writes.

(Mikhail Metzel/AP/Pool)   IMPORTANT READS ON RUSSIA:  -- ""From 'reset' to 'pause': The real story behind Hillary Clinton's feud with Vladimir Putin,"" by Joby Warrick and Karen DeYoung: ""In one of her last acts as secretary of state in early 2013, [Clinton] wrote a confidential memo to the White House on how to handle Vladimir Putin. ... Her bluntly worded advice: Snub him. 'Don't appear too eager to work together,' Clinton urged. ... 'Don't flatter Putin with high-level attention. Decline his invitation for a presidential summit.' It was harsh advice coming from the administration's top diplomat, and Obama would ignore key parts of it. But the memo succinctly captured a personal view about Putin on the part of the future Democratic presidential nominee: a deep skepticism, informed by bitter experience, that would be likely to define U.S.-Russian relations if Clinton is elected. Her lasting conclusion, as she would acknowledge, was that 'strength and resolve were the only language Putin would understand.' For Clinton, the rhetoric reflects genuine disappointment and frustration from a tumultuous term as secretary of state during which cooperation between Moscow and Washington briefly soared, only to come crashing to Earth after Putin's reelection."" -- U.S. intelligence agencies do not see Russia as capable of using cyberespionage to alter the outcome of next week's presidential election, BUT they are warning that Moscow may continue meddling even after the voting has ended to sow doubts about legitimacy and extend political turbulence. From Greg Miller and Adam Entous: ""U.S. security officials have not ruled out Russian-sponsored disruption on Election Day. In recent weeks, officials at the [DHS] have collected evidence of apparent Russian 'scanning' of state-run databases and computer voting systems. 'Whether they were really trying hard to get in, it's not clear,' a U.S. official said. Still, the decentralized nature of U.S. polling would make it extraordinarily difficult to subvert a nationwide race. Instead, U.S. officials said it is more likely that Russia would use hacking tools to expose or fabricate signs of vote-rigging, aiming to delegitimize an election outcome that [Trump] has said he may refuse to accept if he does not win."" -- Facebook must fix this --> ""How MACEDONIA Became A Global Hub For Pro-Trump Misinformation,"" by BuzzFeed's Craig Silverman and Lawrence Alexander: ""'This is the news of the millennium!' said the story on WorldPoliticus.com. Citing unnamed FBI sources, it claimed [Clinton] will be indicted in 2017 for crimes related to her email scandal. 'Your Prayers Have Been Answered,' declared the headline. For Trump supporters, that certainly seemed to be the case. They helped the baseless story generate over 140,000 [Facebook shares] ... Meanwhile, roughly 6,000 miles away in a small Macedonian town, a young man watched as money began trickling into his Google AdSense account. Over the past year, the central Macedonian town of Veles (population 45,000) has experienced a digital gold rush as locals launched at least 140 US politics websites. These sites have American-sounding domain names [and] almost all publish aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives."" The young Macedonians who run these sites don't care about Trump. Their motivations are purely economic: ""As Facebook earning reports show, a U.S. Facebook user is worth about four times a non-U.S. user. Several teens said they learned the best way to generate traffic is to get their stories to spread on Facebook -- and the best way to generate Facebook shares to publish sensationalist -- often false -- content catering to Trump supporters. 'Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading but the rationale is that 'if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it,' one site creator admitted.""    (AFP/Getty)   A FLURRY OF POLLS: -- NBC-WSJ-Marist says GEORGIA is deadlocked, with Trump up just one point (45-44). Donald is in pretty good shape in two other traditionally red states. Among likely voters, he has a five-point lead in ARIZONA and a nine-point lead in TEXAS. -- A Boston Globe-Suffolk University poll shows Clinton and Trump deadlocked in NEW HAMPSHIRE at 42 percent. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte leads Maggie Hassan by two points.  -- A Simpson College-RABA Research poll shows Trump up just three points in IOWA (44-41). If Clinton wins, one in five Iowans said they do not think the country is ready for its first woman president. But three in four voters said they trust the election system. -- Monmouth suggests that UTAH is moving back pretty comfortably into Trump's column. Independent Evan McMullin trails Trump by 13 points after being in the margin of recent polls. -- Quinnipiac University has some fresh down-ballot numbers. Where four Republican incumbents stand: Richard Burr is down four in North Carolina, trailing Deborah Ross 49-45.

DISPATCHES FROM THE BATTLEGROUNDS: -- ""Officer slayings bring a new anguish to IOWA at end of a rancorous election,"" by Colby Itkowitz and Mark Berman in Des Moines: ""A day after police in Iowa captured a man they say killed two officers in a pair of brazen ambushes, authorities said they still didn't know the motive for the 'cowardly' attacks, and residents grappled with their anguish. Scott Michael Greene, 46, whose relationship with his mother had disintegrated so badly that each received protective orders against the other, was formally charged with two counts of first-degree murder. He was taken from the hospital where he had been evaluated to the Polk County jail, restrained ... by the handcuffs of the two slain officers. Outside the Des Moines police department, a steady stream of mourners gathered around a makeshift memorial -- a parked patrol car barely visible under the flower bouquets, stuffed animals, condolence notes and children's drawings. Mary White, 42, stood by the memorial with her arm around her 11-year-old son, Alex, their eyes both red-rimmed from crying. 'Everybody is against everybody. Why? Why are we enemies?'"" -- The Trump Effect: We're seeing an uptick in Latinos voting early across the country. From John Wagner, Anne Gearan and Jose A. DelReal: Hispanic voters represented 13.2 percent of all early voters in ARIZONA as of this week, up from 11 percent at the same point in 2012 and 8.1 percent in 2008. In NEVADA, Latinos make up 11.8 percent of early voters so far, compared with 10.5 percent in 2012 and 9.1 percent in 2008. And in FLORIDA, they accounted for 14.1 percent of all returned ballots as of Tuesday, up from 9.6 percent at the same point in 2008. ... COLORADO and VIRGINIA have also seen increases in Latino participation, state officials said. And in the traditionally red state of Texas, counties located along the Mexican border have seen large surges in early voters."" -- A Univision poll finds Clinton leading Trump by 30 points among FLORIDA Hispanics. This is remarkable when you consider that the state's Hispanics (because of the large, anti-communist Cuban population) used to favor Republicans. Her 60-30 advantage in the state is fueled largely by the influx of Puerto Ricans, who support her by a 71 percent margin. The Puerto Ricans put Obama over the top in the Sunshine State in 2012 too. -- In PHOENIX, Tim Kaine delivered a speech entirely in Spanish as part of the Clinton campaign's broader effort to juice Latino turnout. Trump is ""someone who thinks 'Latino outreach' means tweeting out a picture of a taco bowl,"" said the vice presidential nominee. He blasted Trump for calling Alicia Machado ""Miss Housekeeping"" and suggesting that the Indiana-born judge Gonzalo Curiel is ""biased"" against Trump because of his Mexican heritage. (CNN) -- Voter suppression? Reuters' Julia Harte obtained emails that show NORTH CAROLINA state and county Republican officials lobbied members of at least 17 county election boards to keep early-voting sites open for shorter hours on weekends and in evenings -- times when Democratic voters usually turn out in disproportionately high numbers. -- A federal judge rejected a PENNSYLVANIA GOP effort to roll back restrictions on poll watching rules. ""There is no need for this judicial fire drill and [the Republican Party] offers no reasonable explanation or justification for the harried process they created,"" a U.S. district judge wrote Thursday.

The ads will run on at least two popular stations per district, including hip-hop and R&B stations, running at least twice an hour until Election Day. ""We have the opportunity to build on all the progress we've made, to fight for the issues you and I believe in,"" the president says in one ad. ""I'm doing everything I can to make sure our Democrats all around the country have what they need to win, and that's why I need you."" (CNN) -- The Clinton campaign has reached out to ""dozens"" of Democratic House and Senate candidates this week to offer a formal endorsement and support from her massive digital organizing program. From BuzzFeed's Ruby Cramer: ""Clinton officials contacted a select group of House and Senate campaigns across the county with the same question: What do you need? On the table: Clinton's endorsement, to use in whatever way best suits the candidate, along with a menu of options from the campaign's digital field operation -- social media posts, text messages, emails encouraging voters to volunteer, and access to Clinton's online organizing tools. Dozens of Democratic House and Senate candidates -- including in non-battleground states Indiana, New York, and California -- heard from the campaign early this week, in most cases from one of its state directors.""    Clinton and Kaine in Annandale, Va., this summer. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- ""Republicans dare to hope: Did VIRGINIA get her swing back?"" by Laura Vozzella and Jenna Portnoy: ""Clinton is airing ads again in Virginia. ... Kaine will spend precious time campaigning in Northern Virginia and Richmond [on Monday]. Polls are tightening. And so Republicans who long ago gave up any hope that Trump could win here are starting to wonder: Is Virginia back in play? When Trump returned with a $2 million television ad buy two weeks ago, even fellow Republicans panned the move as a financially unjustifiable face-saver, one meant to beat back rumors that he was pulling out of the state entirely. [Now], some Republicans who had privately thrown in the towel months ago were expressing newfound optimism Thursday. 'It's looking extremely close,' [said one party official]. 'I think what we're seeing is ghosts of 2014 in terms of the closeness of the race.'"" ""Terry McAuliffe has been determined to deliver the state for Clinton, staying in almost daily contact with Bill Clinton and Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager who also led McAuliffe's race for governor,"" Laura and Jenna note. ""He has said publicly for months that he expected the race to tighten. In private, he continues to express confidence in the outcome."" -- Reality check: While Virginia will be closer than conventional wisdom currently suggests (never forget how close that 2013 governor's race wound up), Clinton is virtually certain to win.  A Roanoke College Poll this morning has Clinton up seven points post-Comey (45-38). Seven in 10 likely voters agreed Clinton is more qualified to be president than Trump. People in the Trump high command do not think the commonwealth is winnable, which is why Donald is not traveling there. Democrats are only putting six figures into Virginia TV time, which is not very much when you consider how much cash she has on hand and the relative size of the Old Dominion. David Wasserman, an editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, concurs: ""Although absentee voting has been underwhelming in heavily black localities, it's been impressive in Northern Virginia -- and, for what it's worth, in areas with pockets of Latino voters. Trump still has enormous problems with suburban, college-educated women, who are a huge voting force in places like Fairfax, Loudoun and Henrico counties.""    Hillary stumps with Bernie in Raleigh last night. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   THE LATEST ON THE EMAILS: -- Deep divisions inside the FBI and the Justice Department over how to Clinton's email investigation will likely fester even after Tuesday's election -- and pose a significant test for Jim Comey's leadership amid the infighting. From Matt Zapotosky, Rosalind S. Helderman, Sari Horwitz and Ellen Nakashima: ""Although investigators had discovered the emails in early October, software glitches prevented them from separating [Huma Abedin]-related emails from the hundreds of thousands of messages recovered until Oct. 19 or 20."" And while Comey had been quickly alerted by his deputy to the original find, he took no further action until the day after his final briefing on Oct. 27. ""If Clinton is elected, Comey might have to contend with one or more investigations involving a sitting president. If she is not, he might face criticism for upending her bid."" -- Clinton declined on Thursday to say whether, if elected, she would ask the FBI director to resign: ""I'm not going to, you know, either get ahead of myself by assuming I'll be fortunate enough to be elected,"" Clinton said in a radio interview. ""That's really up to you and your listeners."" She added she would also ""never comment on any kind of, you know, personnel issue."" -- Kaine said he is ""puzzled"" by Comey's letter to Congress, but does not believe the decision was made with any sort of political motive: ""I don't think he is trying to influence the outcome of the election, I don't question his integrity, but I do have serious questions about the judgment demonstrated by this ... highly unusual letter that was so cryptic that he kind of had to do a do-over letter the next day that he put out next week,"" the senator said during a Fox radio interview on Thursday. His tone comes as a rhetorical softening from other Clinton allies, who have delivered harsher broadsides against the FBI director since his bombshell announcement. (Politico) -- The State Department released more than 1,200 pages of new Clinton emails recovered from her server. Many of the documents, however, are near-duplicates of messages that have already been made public. (Politico's Josh Gerstein) -- Dallas Observer, ""The Dallas IRS Office That's Quietly Determining the Fate of the Clinton Foundation,"" by Joe Pappalardo: ""The Earle Cabell Federal Building in downtown Dallas is an all-purpose office complex, a bastion of federal bureaucracy. ... Most people come for a passport or to get business done in front of a federal judge. But inside, a quiet review is underway that has direct ties to the raging presidential election: The local branch of the IRS' Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division is reviewing the tax status of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This IRS review has not generated similar waves as [DOJ] probes into the foundation, and has largely been forgotten in the campaign's melee. It's just not as sexy as private email servers, FBI infighting and charges of political pressure ... But even though this examination is less scrutinized and is harder to conceptualize, it's impact may be important. The report won't likely be done in time to influence the presidential campaign -- even though the review started more than four months ago -- but it could certainly influence the first term of Hillary Clinton presidency."" -- Should they keep control of the House in the next Congress, Republicans could easily launch impeachment proceedings, with political will as the most significant obstacle. From Mike DeBonis: ""The House Judiciary Committee typically investigates charges of official wrongdoing and, if it finds them to be warranted, forwards articles of impeachment to the House floor."" Neither Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz nor Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte have called for Clinton's impeachment, though they have made clear they intend to continue probing her emails: ""In a joint letter sent Thursday, the two chairmen called on [Loretta Lynch] to preserve documents related to the email investigation, including the new evidence the FBI disclosed last week. [They] also asked the federal investigators to probe whether Clinton committed perjury during 2015 testimony."" -- Nancy Pelosi said the premature talk of impeachment is ""a brazen attempt to nullify the vote of the American people, outside our constitutional framework and destructive to the Framers' intent."" -- New York Times, ""Family Disputes and a Nasty Can of Beans: Hillary Clinton as Litigator,"" by Amy Chozick: ""Mrs. Clinton's 1970s-era adventures in the Arkansas bar could have provided some of the color for a John Grisham novel -- or for a fish-out-of-water comedy like 'My Cousin Vinny.' ... It was not glamorous: She represented a moving company whose customer had sued it for damaging a coffee table, a crop-duster who flew his airplane too close to his rice fields ... and a canning company that was sued after a man opened his pork and beans and found the rear end of a rat. Yet a tour of Mrs. Clinton's early work ... turns up much of what would distinguish her as a politician many years later: Diligent preparation and a surgical approach to dismantling opposing arguments. A capacity for warmth with clients and adversaries alike. Toughness and deftness in the face of male condescension. And a minimal appetite for the spotlight, if not quite an aversion to it.""    Melanie Trump speaks in Berwyn, Pa. (AP/Patrick Semansky)   THE DAILY DONALD: -- Melania Trump delivered rare public remarks in Pennsylvania, vowing to work against cyberbullying should her husband win. From Mary Jordan: ""Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough,"" she said -- sounding nothing at all like Trump, whose insults and name-calling are a central part of his campaign. ""As adults, many of us are able to handle mean words, even lies,"" she said in a speech aimed at winning over more female voters. ""They hurt when they are made fun of or made to feel less in looks or intelligence. We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other."" But her calls for civility may have been too little, too late -- as even some Trump supporters lamented the crude language often used by the Republican nominee online and on the campaign trail. ""'I am a woman, and of course it bothers me,' said Victoria Granero, 60, who still plans to vote for Trump. Noting that the Republican nominee is trailing badly with female voters and that his wife offered a refreshingly different approach ... Granero was puzzled about only now getting to hear from Melania Trump. 'Why didn't he send her out earlier?'"" she asked. ""I don't think she can help him now."" Plagiarism watch: Journalists covering the speech quickly noticed that one of Melania's optimistic mantras -- ""if you could dream it, you could become it"" -- was first uttered by Trump's second wife, Marla Maples, in 2011... Reporters also had a field day highlighting examples of Donald cyber-bullying as Melania decried it:  Melania Trump: ""They are hurt when they are made fun of, or made to feel less in looks or intelligence."" Hmm: pic.twitter.com/Bhv0O5xrGm-- Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) November 3, 2016   -- Eric Trump made headlines of his own for suggesting that former Ku Klux Klan leader and Louisiana Senate candidate David Duke ""deserves a bullet"": ""Ross, it's disgusting and by the way, if I said exactly what you said, I'd get killed for it but I think I'll say it anyway,"" the younger Trump said in a Denver radio interview, after the host said Duke ""deserves"" to be shot. ""The guy does deserve a bullet. I mean, these aren't good people. These are horrible people. In fact, I commend my father. My father's the first Republican who's gone out and said, 'Listen, what's happened to the African-American community is horrible and I'm going to take care of it.'"" (CNN) -- Ted Cruz stumped alongside Mike Pence in Iowa, but he carefully avoided ever using Trump's name! He instead spoke in vague terms to the importance of ""defeating Clinton"" and keeping Congressional majorities. ""We're going to keep Republican control of the Senate and we're going to defeat Hillary Clinton in this presidential election,"" Cruz said. Paul Ryan, who reluctantly endorsed Trump, is also going to campaign with Pence. (Politico) -- Marc Fisher, who co-authored The Post's Trump biography this summer, looks at how he might deal with a likely loss next week: ""Losing to Clinton on Tuesday would be Trump's most public and devastating failure. How does a man whose image is based on being the ultimate winner cope with losing? ... His behavior in defeat has stayed remarkably consistent throughout his career: He acts like it didn't happen. Either he didn't really lose, or it was someone else's fault. At New York Military Academy, the boarding school where Trump spent much of his adolescence, his baseball coach and mentor, Theodore Dobias, saw Trump as a kid who 'would do anything to win ... [he] just wanted to be first, in everything, and he wanted people to know he was first.' Losing, Trump has stated throughout his public life, is degrading, pathetic, unacceptable. 'Man is the most vicious of all animals,' he once told a writer, 'and life is a series of battles ending in victory or defeat. You just can't let people make a sucker out of you.'"" -- New York Times, ""Trump's Income Isn't Always What He Says It Is, Records Suggest,"" by Russ Beuttner: ""[Trump] has repeatedly held out his financial disclosures as a justification for breaking with tradition and refusing to release his personal tax returns. 'You don't learn that much from tax returns,' he said in September during his first debate ... 'You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.' But an examination of his tax appeals on several properties ... shows that what Mr. Trump has reported on those forms is nowhere near a complete picture of his financial state. The records demonstrate that large portions of those numbers represent cash coming into his businesses before covering costs like mortgage payments, payroll and maintenance. After expenses, some of his businesses make a small fraction of what he reported on his disclosure forms, or actually lose money. ... In fact, it is virtually impossible to determine from the forms just how much he is earning in any year."" -- CNBC spoke to branding experts who identified ""multiple reasons"" why Trump's campaign may not hurt his businesses in the long run: ""Trump was disliked even before he launched his campaign and stuck to his brand of 'aggressively' marketing himself and 'stirring emotions, said [one branding expert]. Consumers often discern between a product and the person behind it. ... Some [also] say Trump has won new support for future ventures, such as a rumored TV network, from a wider demographic -- blue-collar Americans -- even if some high-end consumers abandon him. 'I think he could potentially lose more of his high-end customer base simply because they are not necessarily the ones in his voting demographic,' [said another branding expert and author]. 'But at the same time he could potentially have opened up a whole new market for himself in middle-market goods and services.'"" -- Trump is signaling interest in appointing Goldman Sachs alum Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary should he win. From Politico's Zachary Warmbrodt: The decision comes as his transition team has been searching for private-sector executives who could be named to the Cabinet posting. But it is also totally at odds with Trumps rhetoric on the trail.    Demonstrators walk past a U.S. flag embroidered with Trump comments during a protest outside his D.C. hotel. (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst)   CONSERVATIVE ELITES MAKE THEIR CLOSING ARGUMENT AGAINST TRUMP: -- ""In a normal election, the FBI and WikiLeaks factors might be disqualifying,"" conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer writes. ""[But] as final evidence of how bad are our choices in 2016, Trump's liabilities, especially on foreign policy, outweigh hers. We are entering a period of unprecedented threat to the international order that has prevailed under American leadership since 1945. After eight years ... the three major revisionist powers -- Russia, China, and Iran -- see their chance to achieve regional dominance and diminish, if not expel, American influence. At a time of such tectonic instability, even the most experienced head of state requires wisdom and delicacy to maintain equilibrium. Trump has neither. His joining of supreme ignorance to supreme arrogance, combined with a pathological sensitivity to any perceived slight, is a standing invitation to calamitous miscalculation. It took seven decades to build this open, free international order. It could be brought down in a single presidential term. That would be a high price to pay for the catharsis of kicking over a table."" -- From Post columnist and former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson: ""I never imagined that Republican leaders -- many of whom I know and have respected -- would fall in line with such dangerous delusions, on the theory that anything is better than [Clinton]. Most options are better than Clinton. But not all. And not this. The GOP has largely accommodated itself to a candidate with no respect for, or knowledge of, the constitutional order. Every constitutional conservative should be revolted. Those who are complicit have adopted a particularly dangerous form of power-loving hypocrisy. It is almost beyond belief that Americans should bless and normalize Trump's appeal. Normalize vindictiveness and prejudice. Normalize conspiracy theories and the abandonment of reason. Normalize every shouted epithet, every cruel ethnic and religious stereotype, every act of bullying in the cause of American 'greatness' ... In the end, a Trump victory would normalize the belief that the structures of self-government are unequal to the crisis of our time. And this would not merely replace the presidential portrait above the fireplace. It would deface it."" -- ""Trump doesn't happen in a more or less united party, he happens in a broken one,"" writes WSJ columnist Peggy Noonan. ""But the split in the party happened in the past 15 years. When you give a party two unwon wars, one a true foreign-policy catastrophe, and a great recession, it will begin to break because its members lose confidence in its leaders. When the top of the party believes in things that the bottom of the party doesn't want (on immigration, entitlements and trade), things will break further. The bottom will begin to feel the top no longer cares about it. That will end their loyalty. Mr. Trump's Republican foes are wrong in thinking his followers are just sticking with the party. They're not, they've broken from the party. In such circumstances the base of a party will do surprising things, such as turn, in hopeful desperation, to a strange outsider in hopes maybe he can break through the mess."" -- ""Trump doesn't happen in a more or less united party, he happens in a broken one,"" Peggy Noonan writes in her Wall Street Journal column.

But, your run-of-the-mill election map won't show you that:     If you chart the states by electoral votes, a more accurate picture of which states will elect Trump or Clinton emerges.

A SWAT team was sent to their Virginia home, false charges were filed against him and he was accused online of molesting a girl. The 'reign of terror,' as he described it, was so bad that Moreno said he eventually tried to take his own life. Now, he and his family have finally turned the tables on one of the men they accused of tormenting them, winning a $1.4 million civil judgment in court. The ruling by a Loudoun County jury late last month is one of the largest in an Internet trolling case in the nation's history. The family doubts it will ever collect the full sum but hopes the verdict is a warning to cyberbullies everywhere. 'It's important to realize that cyberbullying can lead to this horrible stuff that spills into the real world,' said Sharon Moreno. 'It's especially difficult for vulnerable people.'""

Companies Write Them Checks,"" by Eric Lipton and Robert Faturechi: ""Big-money corporate lobbying has reached into one of the most obscure corners of state government: the offices of secretaries of state, the people charged with running elections impartially. The targeting of secretaries of state with campaign donations, corporate-funded weekend outings and secret meetings with industry lobbyists reflects an intense focus on often overlooked ballot questions, which the secretaries frequently help write. The ballot initiatives are meant to give voters a direct voice on policy issues ... But corporate and other special interests are doing their best to build close ties with the secretaries because a difference of even a few words on a ballot measure can have an enormous impact on the outcome."" Secretaries of state from Washington, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada - all Republicans - participated  in closed-door meetings with [corporate lobbyists] ... [Now], the influence campaign has intensified, with more citizen-driven ballot initiatives to be decided on Election Day this year than at any time in the past decade.""

Two Sundays later, the message had changed: Satan was working through former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Oct. 16 bulletin from the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church was stuffed with a flyer written in both English and Spanish that cited five legislative policies -- support for abortion, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, human cloning, and embryonic stem cell research -- that will doom a politician and their supporters to eternal damnation. 'It is a mortal sin to vote Democrat ... immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell,' the flyer said.""

The eye-grabbing attraction is four metal poles and barbed wire fencing in a metal cage that is anchored into the ground. Inside the cage stands a large [Trump] campaign sign. On the front of the cage are two signs. One reads 'POSTED. NO TRESPASSING. KEEP OUT.' The second reads 'TRESSPASS (sic) WILL BE SHOT' Early this year, Poe put a small Trump campaign sign in his front yard with no protection around it. Poe said someone stole it, so he put an even larger sign in his yard with barbed wire around it. Someone went through the barbed wire and also stole that sign. 'So I went a step further and built this steel cage, which is anchored in the ground ... we are getting ready to put spotlights on it,' Poe said.
