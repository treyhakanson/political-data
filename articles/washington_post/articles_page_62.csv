The 10-3 vote by the North Dakota Legislative Management Committee means there'll be no presentations from the state's chief justice or tribal leaders when lawmakers reconvene Jan. 3. The measure exempts the governor's State of the State address, which is required by state law. Ongoing protests of the four-state, $3.8 million pipeline in southern North Dakota have ""significantly strained"" law enforcement and the state Highway Patrol, which provides security at the state Capitol, Republican House Majority Leader Al Carlson said. Nearly 500 people have been arrested since August, the encampments show no sign of breaking up and there have been four large organized protests in the Bismarck-Mandan area this week; Thursday's protests in Bismarck led to eight arrests.  ""We're trying to be proactive,"" Carlson said. ""In no way is this infringing on anyone's First Amendment rights. History shows us in recent months that we need to be cautious."" Democrats on the committee opposed the motion, especially since it scrubbed the traditional tribal address.  ""This is not going to help tribal relations and it probably will set us up for even more bad situations,"" said Rep. Marvin Nelson of Rolla. ""We need to be making every effort we can to reach out to the tribes at this time."" By tradition, lawmakers hear speeches during the first week of each odd-numbered-year session, including from North Dakota's chief justice and by one leader from the state's tribes -- Spirit Lake Sioux, Three Affiliated Tribes the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and the Standing Rock Sioux. No tribe had been chosen to give the address for 2017, a tradition that dates back to 1985, according to Legislative Council Director Jim Smith. The chairman of the tribe behind the legal push to stop the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline, Standing Rock Sioux's Dave Archambault, gave the address in 2015, asking lawmakers to do more to protect public safety and the environment during the state's oil boom. His tribe and other protest supporters say the pipeline, being built by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, because the tribe says threatens its water sources and cultural sites. Carlson said the Legislature will err on the side of safety at the Capitol.  ""Protecting people is our No. 1 priority,"" he said. In early November, nearly 20 protesters who sat, chanted, sang and refused orders to leave were arrested in the building's judicial wing. And the Highway Patrol said security footage caught two people dressed splattering motor oil on the sidewalk and Capitol building on Halloween night. They also left a sign with the message, ""You can't drink oil,"" appearing to be in solidarity with the protesters, who call themselves water protectors. Also Thursday, an administrative law judge was appointed to oversee a potential hearing on whether ETP violated orders from state regulators, which could result in a $15,000 fine. The State Historic Preservation Office concurred with the company's plan to divert construction around artifacts -- a plan the Public Service Commission says it didn't approve -- and ETP has said it didn't do anything wrong. It can agree to a fine or request a hearing to fight one. Though any hearing wouldn't likely happen until next month. ___ Associated Press writer Blake Nicholson contributed to this report.

On Capitol Hill, his incoming vice president aimed to project unity at home. Trump planned a face-to-face meeting late Thursday with Shinzo Abe, his first with a world leader since last week's vote, after consulting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and sitting down with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a potential contender to lead the State Department. In Washington, Vice President-elect Mike Pence huddled with Republican leaders in Congress. He then met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the newly elected leader of the Senate Democrats, seeking to convey respect as Democrats prepare for Republican rule of both chambers and the White House for the first time in a decade.  ""We look forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward,"" Pence said outside Schumer's Senate office. In a separate gesture of reconciliation with establishment Republicans, Trump planned to meet with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who lambasted Trump as a ""con man"" and a ""fraud"" in a stinging speech last March. Trump responded by repeatedly referring to Romney as a ""loser."" The two began mending fences after Trump's victory when Romney called with congratulations. They are to meet this weekend, a transition official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss Trump's schedule publicly. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said they were still ""working on"" the meeting. Trump's actions Thursday aimed to show leaders both in the U.S. and overseas that he could soften his rhetoric, offer pragmatism in the White House and reaffirm longstanding American alliances. Since his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton last week, Trump has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and nearly three dozen other world leaders by telephone. But Abe's visit to Trump's midtown Manhattan high-rise was his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since the end of the campaign. Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States, also visited the skyscraper and called Trump ""a true friend of Israel."" He specifically cited as another ""friend"" Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, whose selection as a top White House adviser has created a backlash among Democrats. Bannon's news website has peddled conspiracy theories, white nationalism and anti-Semitism.  ""We look forward to working with the Trump administration, with all the members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, in making the U.S.-Israel alliance stronger than ever,"" Dermer said. Trump, a reality television star, business mogul and political newcomer, also rolled out new teams that will interact with the State Department, Pentagon, Justice Department and other national security agencies. The move is part of the government transition before Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. One potential Cabinet member, Eva Moskowitz, said had taken herself out of the running to become education secretary. Moskowitz, a Democrat and advocate for charter schools, met with Trump this week, stoking speculation that she might inject a bit of bipartisanship in the new administration. Moskowitz, who voted for Clinton, suggested there were ""positive signs"" that Trump might govern differently than he campaigned, but she wrote in a letter to parents that many of her students, who are overwhelmingly black and Latino, would feel that ""they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign."" Conway said she expected initial announcements of Cabinet choices to come ""before or right after Thanksgiving,"" telling reporters Trump he was ""loving"" the transition. ""He's a transactional guy. He's somebody who's used to delivering results and producing."" Trump's calendar has been packed with sit-downs. During his meeting with Kissinger, who led the State Department under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, the two discussed relations with China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. Other meetings have included Haley, the daughter of Indian-born parents, who would bring diversity to a Trump administration, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling. As he left Trump Tower, Hensarling, who leads the House Financial Services Committee, said he and the president-elect had discussed tax and trade policies -- and he left open the possibility of joining the administration.  ""I stand ready to help the president in any capacity possible,"" he said. ""I've got a great position in public policy today. If he wants to talk to me obviously about serving somewhere else, we'll look at serving somewhere else."" ___ Thomas reported from Washington.

Andy Harris (R-Md.) on Thursday lost his bid for chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a conservative policy-oriented caucus that will work to push the party and President-elect Donald Trump to the right. A three-term congressman whose district is based on the Eastern Shore, Harris was defeated by Rep. Mark Walker, a freshman lawmaker from North Carolina. ""There has never been a better time for a bold conservative vision for America,"" Walker said in a statement. ""Looking at the election results, it is clear the American people want to reclaim constitutional principles and reinvigorate our economy. It is unacceptable for us not to deliver on the faith the voters have invested in us.""  [House GOP not conservative enough? Rep. Andy Harris says he can fix that.]  Before the election, Walker said tax reform and the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act were among his top priorities. Harris, a member of the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus as well as the 170- member RSC, said that he wanted to unite the two groups. Harris's spokeswoman said that he will remain a member of both.

About 17,000 people marched to the embassy without incident, although some protesters taunted and threw garbage at about 1,000 participating supporters of the governing Syriza party. Some 3,000 police were deployed in central Athens as a precaution. But the violence came from another quarter of the city. Dozens of anarchists occupied the National Technical University complex, site of the failed pro-democracy revolt, and attacked police with petrol bombs, flares and stones. Riot police responded with tear gas and stun grenades as street battles lurched outside the university in the densely-inhabited Exarcheia district, well away from the embassy. Police arrested at least two people, but no injuries were reported. The march Thursday began at the gates of the university, also known as the Polytechnic, where in 1973 the military sent in a tank to crush student demonstrations. Several people were killed during the crackdown, but historians disagree on the precise death toll. The university has been the flashpoint of many anti-government protests over the years. Before the march started, suspected anarchists stole two riot police shields and helmets and hung them on a statue in Exarcheia. Violence also broke out during marches in other Greek cities to commemorate the uprising. In Greece's second-largest city of Thessaloniki, in the north, 8,000 protesters marched to the U.S. Consulate. Anarchists attacked police with firebombs, and one group burned a U.S. flag outside the building. Two suspected rioters were detained. In the northwestern town of Ioannina, the local police chief was hospitalized after a demonstrator hit him on the head with a wooden club. An anti-American protest Tuesday during a visit by President Barack Obama to Athens was marred by extensive clashes around the Polytechnic between anarchists and Greek riot police. Many Greek left-wing supporters still deeply resent the U.S. for supporting the oppressive dictatorship in Greece at the height of the Cold War. ___ Costas Kantouris in Thessaloniki contributed to this story.

The Kremlin accused Obama of trying to lock in bad relations before Trump takes office. In Europe for his last time as president, Obama said he doesn't expect Trump to mirror his own strategy on Russia, and hopes his successor will work constructively with the superpower where appropriate. Yet he insisted the U.S. mustn't gloss over deep disagreements over Syria, Ukraine and basic democratic values.  ""My hope is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach,"" Obama said, using a German term for a foreign policy driven by expediency. He said he hopes the businessman won't cut deals with Russia if it hurts other countries or ""just do whatever is convenient at the time."" Obama's remarks in a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel marked his most explicit attempt since the election to influence the policies Trump will pursue as president. Obama has privately urged Trump not to obliterate the efforts of the last eight years, but in public he has tried to avoid boxing in his successor. Yet Trump's unexpected victory has put Obama in the unwelcome position of having to reassure foreign leaders that Trump won't follow through on alarming positions he staked out in his campaign, such as the notion the U.S. might not defend its NATO allies. NATO members and other European countries are worried that under Trump, the U.S. will stop trying to police Russia's behavior the way it has under Obama. Most concerning to U.S. allies are Trump's effusive comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin, one of the first world leaders he spoke to after winning the election. The Kremlin has said Putin and Trump agreed in that call to try to fully normalize U.S.-Russia relations, an alarming prospect for Russia's neighbors who fear the U.S. will let sanctions on Moscow lapse and acquiesce to Russia's behavior in Ukraine and Syria. Putin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told Russian news agencies that Obama's administration was ""doing everything it can to drive bilateral ties into such a deadlock that would make it difficult for a new team to get them out from, if it wishes to do so."" The White House declined to comment on that accusation. Ushakov also said that Trump's call with Putin had revealed a ""shared desire"" to fight terrorism and collaborate on Syria. Obama's administration accuses Russia of prolonging Syria's civil war by intervening militarily to prop up President Bashar Assad. Germany's Merkel, for her part, said she was approaching the incoming Trump administration with ""an open mind"" and was encouraged that the presidential process in the U.S. was ""working smoothly"" so far. Obama's closest partner on the world stage, Merkel has been instrumental in Obama's efforts to coordinate U.S. and European approaches toward Russia, as well as other conflicts including the Syria crisis and the fight against the Islamic State group. Thursday's meeting was the last for Obama -- who leaves office in January -- and Merkel, who declined to say whether she plans to run for re-election. As for the limit on U.S. presidents serving two terms, Merkel said simply, ""It's a tough rule: Eight years and that's it."" Obama, speaking broadly about his own successor, said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about Trump. He said that ""solemn responsibilities"" and ""extraordinary demands"" of the presidency tend to demand a level of seriousness, implying Trump might rein in some of the bellicose statements of the campaign trail.  ""If you're not serious about the job, then you probably won't be there very long because it will expose problems,"" Obama said. With Obama leaving office Jan. 20, the U.S. is stepping up efforts to deter Russia from using cyberattacks to meddle in the United States. The Obama administration has been incensed by Russia's suspected hacking of U.S. political groups. Obama said he'd told Putin that ""there has been very clear proof that they have engaged in cyberattacks."" A senior U.S. official said the administration had taken the notable step of complaining to Russia through a secure, round-the-clock ""hotline"" originally setup to avert a nuclear war. The U.S. relayed its complaint on Oct. 31 -- a week before Election Day -- said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss private diplomatic conversations.  ""The Russians have a very active and aggressive capability to conduct information operations,"" James Clapper, the top U.S. intelligence official, told Congress on Thursday. ""I expect that would continue."" ___ Associated Press writers Nancy Benac and Deb Riechmann in Washington, Kirsten Grieshaber and Frank Jordans in Berlin, and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

But democracy requires respecting the winner’s legitimacy.	"   Anti-Trump demonstrators protest outside of Los Angeles City Hall on Thursday. (Patrick T. Fallon/Reuters)  After Donald Trump's election, his political opponents have divided themselves into two broad camps. One is exemplified by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. They have made speeches widely described as gracious, that have not only stressed the peaceful transition of power but also claimed that Democrats owe good wishes to the president-elect. Thus Clinton said of Trump, ""We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" Obama, in a statement that was more of a plea to Democrats than a report of their existing feelings, said, ""We are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country."" Protesters in several cities have spoken very differently. Convinced of Trump's virulent bigotry, they view his presidency as a direct danger to women and to immigrant communities. Pursuing this to what they take to be its logical consequence, they have rejected the very legitimacy of a Trump presidency (under the slogans #notmypresident or #nevermypresident). One Austin city councilor, rejecting the call for healing, called for immediate protests, strikes and civil disobedience, and said that if Trump came to town he would refuse to shake his hand. Those advocating charity think that to play by the constitutional rules, we have to presume that those who hold office mean well and can, with help, do the right thing. The less charitable regard the president-elect as fundamentally corrupt, unfit or malicious. They furthermore think that this provides grounds for rejecting the soon-to-be president's authority, for not acknowledging him as truly or properly holding the office. There are good reasons to believe that both these attitudes are confused and mistaken. They conflate a president's legitimate authority with his or her competence, virtue or justice. My research on David Hume's political thought -- derived from that great philosopher and historian's reflections on hundreds of years of history -- suggests that the whole point of a constitutional system is to ensure that questions of legitimate authority have essentially nothing to do with questions of competence, virtue or even justice. This seems counterintuitive. But then, constitutional government is counterintuitive. It might seem more natural for people to come together and pick the leader who seems to be the best because he or she is smartest, strongest, wisest, most pious, related to previous leaders by blood or marriage, or some combination. But though this method seems to come naturally, both intuitively and historically, it is not good. Except in tiny societies, people won't know the prospective leaders personally, and will have to rely on chancy reputation. More problematically, people are likely to disagree over who is the best leader, especially in diverse societies divided by religion, culture and ethnic identity. Indeed, these disagreements may easily lead to war between different factions, each with its own preferred leader or petty warlord. This is why civilized government requires that we come to accept -- through a mix of accident, reflection, habit and bitter experience -- a set of rules for choosing leaders. Our attachment to such rules has to be stronger than our attachment to our favored choices themselves. When, and only when, that's the case, we can say that the government is constitutional rather than based on ""personal"" authority. Hume portrays hereditary monarchy as one big step toward constitutionalism. It may seem crazy for people to accept a monarch's son or daughter as the next monarch, regardless of his or her personal qualities. It seems less crazy once we realize that the alternative was a set of wars over which member of the royal family had superior personal qualities. In Hume's view, this is why the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms ultimately became one, called ""England"": The other six royal families, lacking clear rules of hereditary succession, killed themselves off in games of thrones. While hereditary monarchy beats civil war, our current method of choosing leaders -- constitutional, representative democracy -- beats monarchy. Because leaders are chosen through votes, not birth, we can hope that they will be roughly responsive to popular demands. And because their rule is limited, rather than absolute, the costs of ending up with the wrong leader are lower than they were under Henry the Eighth. But there still is a basic difference between submitting to a leader toward whom we feel love, admiration or trust, and submitting to a set of rules for choosing leaders toward whom we may feel none of these things. We must, therefore, accept that the figure named by our accepted procedure gets to serve as our leader even if we personally think that person unfit for, or unworthy of, the job. We think we want charismatic leaders. The problem is that one person's charismatic model of all the virtues is another person's thuggish dolt. Once the rules select a winner, citizens must accept that that person is entitled to hold the office (on a constitutional or procedural level) even if we think he or she absolutely doesn't (on a substantive level) deserve to. From one perspective, this is deeply frustrating. At best, our relationship to our leaders will rarely be one of fervent personal attachment (because we rarely get our first choice). At worst, the system demands that we proclaim and practice allegiance to leaders who strike us as malicious or foolish. Yet this distinction between procedural legitimacy and substantive virtue can also be liberating. As long as one accepts the election result -- with the proviso that the winner respect constitutional laws and conventions -- one is not required to feel, or even feign, admiration for our leaders themselves, nor to support anything they would like to accomplish. A constitutional system does not require that people agree on either our leaders' personal qualities or their political goals. Though we must accept the authority of leaders we thoroughly hate, we are also free to thoroughly hate those placed in authority. Of course, there may remain reasons to work across lines of hatred for particular purposes where shared interest or the public good requires it. Democrats promising to work with Trump on his infrastructure proposals are presumably thinking pragmatically in this way. It may also be that people making statements that presume that the new leader has good intentions are subtly warning that they will oppose him if their presumptions are disappointed. Obama's and Clinton's speeches, read carefully, may just be more polite versions of Bernie Sanders' characteristically pugnacious statement that progressives will work with Trump ""to the degree that he is serious"" about pursuing policies that help working families, but ""will vigorously oppose him"" if his policies are ""racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment."" But these political choices are strategic and rhetorical. They are not matters of constitutional ethics. Constitutional citizenship requires that we unequivocally accept the results of an election that our preferred candidate loses -- and no more. When protesters say ""not my president"" or ""Dump Trump,"" they are breaching constitutional norms. But if they say instead (as many do) ""F--- Trump,"" they are respecting such norms. Constitutionalism allows them to hate and oppose Trump as much as they want, as long as they recognize that he is president. It is precisely because everyone is required to respect the rules of the game that no one is required to respect the winner.
