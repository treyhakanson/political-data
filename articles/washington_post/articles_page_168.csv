And it raised questions about whether the city of Wellington put people at risk by reopening buildings too soon. The nation was spared the devastation of five years ago when 185 people were killed in the Christchurch earthquake. But some consider it was more by luck this time than by good planning. Here's what happened, minute by minute, after the quake hit early Monday, with details on how officials intend to improve: ___ 12:02 A.M. A magnitude-7.8 earthquake strikes New Zealand near the coastal town of Kaikoura. It rumbles for 21/2 minutes, triggering six separate faults that begin on land and continue out to sea. The duty officer for the country's official earthquake warning site is asleep. Although earthquakes pose a huge threat to New Zealand, the GeoNet site is not monitored around the clock. ___ 12:03 A.M. GeoNet generates its first computer estimate for the quake: magnitude 6.5. It's a big miss. Quakes are measured on an exponential scale, and this one would prove to be 20 times larger and 89 times more powerful than that. For some quake-hardened New Zealanders, a magnitude 6.5 might signal it's time to get some more sleep. A magnitude 7.8 might signal it's time to run for higher ground. ___ 12:05 A.M. The nation's emergency call number, 111, fails after operators evacuate their building in the capital, Wellington. As ceiling tiles fall around them, operators think they've activated a backup system, but in their haste to leave have failed to do so. ___ 12:09 A.M. GeoNet's automatic estimates of the quake have risen to magnitude 7.5. The duty officer is now awake and reviews the data. She downgrades the quake to a magnitude 6.6, and upgrades the site's confidence in its estimate. GeoNet director Ken Gledhill said that estimate was a result of a glitch in their system, in which the monitoring stations closest to the quake were relied upon too heavily. He said those stations became overloaded and did not work properly during the severe quake.  ""We have to wake people and get them out of bed to look at complex data and make serious calls very quickly,"" he said. ""It is not an ideal situation."" Gledhill wants the site monitored 24 hours a day and appears to be gaining support for that. ___ 12:13 A.M. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii estimates the quake at a magnitude 7.4 and says it doesn't believe there's a tsunami threat. Kanoa Koyanagi, a geophysicist at the center, said the quake was borderline for issuing an alert. He said the center is primarily concerned with tsunamis that might affect the broader Pacific region or might hit a country that doesn't have its own monitoring system.  ""When it comes to the 'threat' or 'no threat' message, we've turned over that responsibility to those countries that already have a tsunami warning system,"" he said. That includes New Zealand. But it turns out authorities in New Zealand were looking to the Pacific warning center for direction on whether there was a threat, according to Gledhill. He said GeoNet workers noticed a tide gauge in Kaikoura was dropping rapidly, a sign that a tsunami might be coming. So they told civil defense authorities. Experts believe the quake was so powerful it permanently raised the entire coastline in places by up to 1 meter (3.3 feet), exposing local abalone, or paua. ___ 12:21 A.M. The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, issues its first estimate of the quake: magnitude 7.4. The USGS uses seismometers from around the world to monitor earthquakes around the clock. Geophysicist Jessica Turner said the Kaikoura quake was particularly complicated to assess because it triggered so many faults over such a wide area. She said the only way to properly gauge the size of an earthquake is to wait until the waves of energy have traveled through the Earth's crust.  ""With really large earthquakes, the first magnitude is always going to be a little off,"" she said. ""But we want to get our quickest information out there, so people can have the information and brace themselves for aftershocks."" She said New Zealand's reliance on local seismometers works for smaller quakes, but will inevitably make it difficult to measure larger quakes. ___ 12:37 A.M. New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management sends out a tweet: ""There is no tsunami threat to New Zealand."" It's retweeted hundreds of times. The agency based its assessment in part on the erroneous belief that the quake had struck only on land, which doesn't usually produce a tsunami. By now, authorities were watching the Kaikoura gauge and other tide gauges with alarm. The agency's director, Sarah Stuart-Black, declined this past week to answer questions about how it made its decisions after the quake. The Pacific warning center was also watching the tide gauges, but Koyanagi said it was already too late to warn Kaikoura.  ""If you feel strong shaking, and you're near the coast, you've got to move to higher ground,"" he said. ""Because there's not going to be a warning in time for that situation."" ___ 12:56 A.M. Civil defense authorities reverse course: ""situation has changed -- tsunami is possible,"" they tweet. They advise people move away from the coast. By now, a tsunami of about 2 meters (7 feet) has already hit the coast around Kaikoura. Residents caught a break: It hit at low tide. Gledhill says it could have caused deaths and huge amounts of damage if it had hit at high tide. The rest of the country escapes major problems as well. ___ 12:57 A.M. Police report the emergency number is working again after crews activate a secondary backup system. Many near the quake's epicenter have no way to make calls anyway, because phone lines and cell networks are down. ___ 1:01 A.M. Civil defense officials issue more tsunami warnings. Some local authorities begin sounding piercing tsunami alarms. Some places, including Wellington, have no alarms. In other places, local officials elect not to use them.  ""No one is happy with it,"" said Gerry Brownlee, New Zealand's acting minister of civil defense. ""Civil defense has already recognized that we could do better."" Brownlee said he wants to examine the structure of the organization. And officials also want to introduce a push alert system for cellphones, a system some other countries already have. ___ 1:18 A.M. The U.S. Geological Survey makes its final quake assessment: magnitude 7.8. Scientists at the USGS have used 163 stations worldwide to make their call, including 29 in New Zealand. Turner, the geophysicist, said the rule of thumb is that people can expect aftershocks of up to one magnitude less than the initial quake. Monday's quake ended up holding to that rule: Strong aftershocks continued to rumble throughout the day, causing more damage, and the two biggest were magnitude 6.2. But at this moment, most New Zealanders, reliant on GeoNet for their earthquake information, still believe the quake is a magnitude 6.6, potentially impacting what decisions they make. ___ 1:51 a.m. GeoNet upgrades its quake estimate to magnitude 7.5. Two days later, the agency will consult with USGS and agree that it was a 7.8. ___ 5:12 A.M. The Wellington City Council asks people to stay home from work on Monday while crews assess buildings. They later say the city will reopen for business Tuesday. ___ TUESDAY-FRIDAY Wellington authorities evacuate several downtown buildings and cordon off streets. A nine-story office building and a parking garage are found to be in danger of collapsing, and surrounding buildings are cleared as well. A girl's high school decides to close one of its buildings and send its younger students home as a precaution. The list of building closures grows to about two dozen. Deep beneath the prime minister's office, the emergency bunker used by civil defense leaders springs a water leak. Stuart-Black, the agency director, says that the leak was caused by the quake, but that it was small and quickly repaired. Some residents fault city officials for reopening buildings too hastily. Brownlee, the acting minister of civil defense, says the majority of Wellington buildings are performing well, and people shouldn't get too pessimistic. ""In these circumstances, life does go on,"" he says. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

But now, even this bare-bones way of life is threatened. The family, along with another 242 cave-dwelling households dotted around the capital of Bamiyan province, also called Bamiyan, could be forced to move soon. They are what's left of around 10,000 families who have been relocated over the past decade as part of the local government's program to protect the unique man-made grottoes that it hopes will transform Bamiyan into a global tourist destination once Afghanistan's war with the insurgent Taliban, now in its 16th year, is finally over. The couple moved here from neighboring Maidan-Wardak province because they believed it was a stepping stone to a better future.  ""We had no money and my husband couldn't get a job,"" Marzia said as she breastfed her baby. ""We left because we were poor."" But 12 years later they are still living in the cave, along with their five children aged from 10 months to 8 years, including 6-year-old Freshta who hasn't been the same since a land mine exploded close by her four years ago. Her mental development stopped and she spends most of her time lolling on the thin mat that covers the cave's floor. Any original features, such as the brightly-colored geometric murals that were painted by the monks who created these caves, are long gone. They've been destroyed by time, the elements and the wear-and-tear of hundreds of years of habitation -- including the fires that residents build for cooking and heat.  ""Life here is difficult,"" Marzia, 30, said. Water must be fetched from a nearby stream, and a 9-volt battery charges a solar panel that provides light after dark. Cooking is done on a stove fuelled by a gas bottle. They have installed a door and a step up into the one room that all seven members of the family share. Smaller caves outside are used for storage. On the rural outskirts of the city, amid the rutted fields where the province's main potato crop is grown, the cave-dwellers do what they can with their meagre resources, determined that the next generation will have a better life. As Shiite Muslims of the Hazara minority they have suffered historic persecution, but they have also benefitted from immense largesse from international charities and governments. Amid an intensifying Taliban-led insurgency, Bamiyan is a haven of peace, as the Shiite Hazaras have successfully kept the war off their territory since the end of the Sunni Taliban's regime -- under which they were persecuted and much of the province's Buddhist heritage destroyed. A proliferation in recent years of all-covering burqas and hijabs among the local women attests to a growing concern about the war as it spreads elsewhere in the country. Freshta Ahmadi runs a school for 25 children aged 4 to 9 years old, who gather in the living room of her family's three-room cave home six days a week to learn reading, writing and math. Freshta is 18, in her last year of secondary school and hopes one day to become a doctor. She has been running the cave school since 2012 with money donated by Parsa, an Afghan charity.  ""These children are from poor families, their fathers are itinerant workers, farmers, or refugees from other poorer areas,"" she said. Their circumstances don't dampen ambition, however -- the children, mostly girls, stand in turn at the whiteboard, complete a few exercises in front of their classmates, then reiterate their plans for a future as doctors, police officers or engineers. Bamiyan is probably best known as the site of two massive Buddhas, one 55 meters (180 feet) tall, the other 38 meters (124 feet) tall, that were carved into the cliff face above the modern city between the 4th and 6th Centuries and which were destroyed by the Taliban at the urging of al-Qaida in early 2001, in a defiant show of extremist power and hubris ahead of the attacks on the United States on September 11 that year. Their memory lingers now in gaping niches where the magnificent statues stood as part of an extensive monastic center that included up to 12,000 caves used by monks as devotional getaways. It formed an elaborate network of monasteries, assembly halls, residencies and large sanctuaries that were decorated with frescos and statues, many produced with techniques unique to this part of the world, according to archaeologist Rasool Shojaei, who previously worked on their restoration with the United Nations' Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. UNESCO has classified the ""cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley"" as a world heritage site representing Buddhist and Islamic religious and artistic developments from the 1st to 13th Centuries. The provincial government is working with UNESCO to restore the valley's eight significant sites, including the Ghulghulah fortress, believed to be Bamiyan's original staging post on the old Silk Road that linked China to India. The fortress was razed by Genghis Khan's hoards in the early 13th Century and never regained its glory. Determined to develop on its own terms, the province hosts around a dozen international events a year, said Kabir Dadras, head of the local office of the Ministry of Information and Culture, including a marathon, a skiing competition and a variety of cultural festivals. ""Bamiyan is very popular with Indians, Japanese and Koreans because of the Buddhist heritage,"" he said. As part of those plans, he said, all the people still living in the grottoes, and assessed as sufficiently poverty-stricken to qualify for the government's land re-distribution program, will be moved to new townships on the outskirts of the city by 2018, he said. For Marzia, it's been a lot of talk and no action. ""I've spoken with the governor and a lot of officials have been here to see us,"" she said. ""They keep promising that they will give us a flat, but we've no idea when, or even if, it will happen."" Meanwhile, her 8-year-old daughter Shepha Qah, who studies at the Parsa cave school, harbors hopes of becoming a doctor. ""I have belief in my daughter's ambitions, that's why we left Maidan-Wardak, so that our children could go to school and have a better life,"" said Marzia. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Security forces loyal to the anti-government Shiite Houthi rebels dispersed dozens of protesters in Sanaa on Sunday. They also maintained a heavier than usual presence throughout the capital in anticipation of renewed protests. Lengthy power outages and fuel shortages have also added to the suffering of many in Sanaa and Aden. Yemen has been in the midst of a civil war since September 2014 when the Houthi rebels captured Sanaa, forcing President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to eventually seek refuge in Saudi Arabia.

In the short term, Republican Donald Trump's victory means that at some point next year, the nine-member court will be restored to full capacity, once again with a majority of Republican-appointed justices.  Democratic attempts to filibuster Trump's choice would likely lead Republicans to end that option for Supreme Court justices, just as Democrats did for other judicial nominations when their party controlled the Senate. Trump's upset victory likely changes the court's docket as well: Court challenges to President Obama's regulations regarding the Affordable Care Act and immigration, which have preoccupied the justices in recent terms, will likely disappear under a President Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress.  [Live updates from the 2016 election and reactions]      These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump View Graphic     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump  The long-term question will be Trump's ultimate impact on the court's membership, and whether he gets the chance to do more than choose the successor to Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.  Two of the court's liberals, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, are 83 and 78, respectively. Moderate conservative Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is 80. As long as those three stay, the court's rulings on sensitive social issues -- protecting abortion rights, affirmative action and gay rights, for instance -- are secure.  ""A lot of the big things are actually ones on which the court already has a so-called liberal majority,"" Neal K. Katyal, the acting solicitor general under President Obama, said before the court's term began last month. Tuesday's election assures that Kennedy will remain the court's pivotal justice, for now. Trump has said he will draw his Supreme Court nominee from a list of 20 judges and one senator: Mike Lee of Utah. All appear to be more conservative than Kennedy, the court's longest-serving justice.  [Donald Trump wins presidency in stunning upset]  Kennedy is the member of the current court most likely to be in the majority when the court splits 5 to 4 in its most controversial decisions.

He joined them and wrote the majority opinion finding that gay couples have a constitutional right to marry; in fact, Kennedy has written all of the court's cases protecting gay rights. Last term, he wrote the decision approving the limited use of race in college admission decisions, and voted to strike down a Texas law that the court said imposed unnecessary burdens on a woman's right to obtain an abortion. But three of the five justices supporting those issues are the oldest on the court. Abortion rights advocates immediately sounded an alarm.   [Supreme Court's ideological direction depends on election]  ""President-elect Trump has publicly pledged to overturn Roe and promised punishment for the one in three American women who will have an abortion in her lifetime,"" said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. She was referring to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision assuring a woman's right to an abortion Garland, a moderate liberal who is chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, would likely have replaced Kennedy as the justice in the middle. Obama nominated him last March in part because Republicans in the past have said he was the most likely Democratic nominee to win confirmation. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared on the night of Scalia's death that Republicans would not act on any Obama nominee. The move brought charges that McConnell had politicized the process, but the gambit worked: It will now be a Republican president making the lifetime appointment to replace Scalia. Trump has said his nominee will come from the list compiled with the help of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and the legal group, the Federalist Society. His nominee will be like Scalia in seeking to overturn Roe and be a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, Trump has said. All eyes will now be on the court's oldest members, Kennedy and Ginsburg. Replacing Kennedy with a more stalwart conservative would immediately impact the court's dynamics. He has given no indication about how long he intends to serve on the court. Ginsburg has said she will serve as long as she is up to the job. She would likely be loath to allow Trump to pick her successor; she caused an uproar this summer when in media interviews she called him a ""faker"" and said she feared for the court and the country if he were elected. Ginsburg turned aside calls from some liberals that she retire years ago, so that Obama could name her replacement. She said it was unclear whether the Senate would confirm her successor. And she told The Washington Post that there was no rush: She felt it was likely that another Democrat would be elected after Obama.

Trump positioned himself as a kind of final bulwark against browning, culturally evolving America, but in the end, his true legacy may be that he accelerated that ongoing transformation's electoral impact. We don't know if that will happen, of course. Trump could still win, if the polls are wrong. But the early evidence already suggests that this may end up being the story of the evening. All of the rhetoric Trump employed to drive up the Missing White Vote (disaffected, mostly blue collar whites who could purportedly be lured into voting by Trump's nativism, his xenophobic lies and distortions about illegal immigration, and his trade bluster) may in the end be serving to drive up the Missing Nonwhite Vote (Latinos who have now been brought into the electorate). And all of the alpha-male chest-thumping and displays of misogynistic showmanship that enabled Trump to dominate amid a GOP primary electorate may drive up female general election turnout -- and produce a historic gender gap, to boot.      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made his final pitch to voters in Grand Rapids, Mich., after midnight on Nov. 8. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   A good deal of the analysis out there suggests that the surges in Latino and female turnout in the early voting are real, and portend something significant, and possibly lasting. In Florida, the early voting has produced record turnout. Marc Caputo brings us the numbers: While Democrats have not quite matched their 2012 early voting margin over Republicans, they still hold the lead. But more to the point, the percentage of white early voters has dropped a couple of points, while the percentage of Hispanic early voters has gone up a couple of points. While blacks have also dropped -- and whether Dems can make this up today is an important outstanding question -- the net result is that the Florida early voting electorate is more diverse than last time. As Florida based Democratic consultant Steve Schale puts it, this diversifying electorate suggests that the Obama coalition that allowed him to eke out the slimmest of victories in the state is likely to hold for Clinton this time. Even more important, perhaps, 36 percent of the Latino early voters are new voters, which suggests that Democrats are bringing in the Missing Nonwhite Vote. And if Trump loses Florida, of course, it's game over. Over in Nevada, journalist Jon Ralston has concluded that the surge in early voting in his state -- in particular, among Latinos -- may have already put it out of reach for Trump. Nevada is an important piece of the puzzle: If Clinton can hold Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado, Nevada would give her a win (even without Florida or North Carolina or Ohio), barring a surprise Trump pickup in a blue industrial Midwestern state. And if Trump loses Nevada, that puts even more pressure on him to find an improbable pickup of that kind. Meanwhile, a New York Times analysis concludes this about the female vote:  In every battleground state, the share of women as a percentage of the overall electorate has been higher in early voting than it was in the 2012 election. Women, especially those with college degrees, have been galvanized this year. If they continue with their trend in the early vote and outperform their turnout from 2012, Mr. Trump could face a punishing defeat.  It's important to understand that the Trump campaign also views things in these terms. Remember, when it became clear that Trump would not be able to expand his appeal among the college educated whites who may vote Democratic for the first time in 60 years, his campaign adopted a last-ditch strategy designed to depress turnout among Democratic voters, by going full scorched earth. Most indications are that this is failing. Yes, there are signs that African American turnout may flag, and that could matter in places like Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio. But in the end, Democrats may make that up on Election Day. And the more important and decisive story may be that Trump drove up turnout among Latinos and women. If this ends up bringing a lot of new Latino voters into the electorate, and drives college educated white women into the Democratic camp in historic numbers, the question -- should Clinton win -- will then be what sort of lasting impact those developments will have on our politics. The answer to that question, in the end, may end up being one of Trump's true legacies. ************************************************************************ * THE FINAL FORECASTS: The Upshot gives Clinton an 84-16 percent chance of winning, showing a leveling off and even a slight upswing after her chances had been declining. FiveThirtyEight gives Clinton a 71.6-28.4 percent chance, showing a sudden, sharp rise in her chances in the last few days. The polling averages show Clinton leading by 3.1 points (The Upshot); 3.2 points (Real Clear Politics); 3.9 points (FiveThirtyEight); or 5.2 points (HuffPollster). * THE FINAL FORECASTS, SENATE EDITION: Sabato's Crystal Ball predicts a 50-50 split in the Senate, with Dems winning seats in Wisconsin, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Nevada, while losing in North Carolina, Florida, Indiana, and Missouri. Cook Political Report predicts Dems will pick up between four and six seats, which would mean (if Clinton wins) anything from a 50-50 split to a 52-48 advantage. * OFFICIALS BRACE FOR VOTER INTIMIDATION: The Post reports: Election monitors are especially worried this year about the specter of voter intimidation....Election officials in Pennsylvania and Arizona have become so concerned in recent days about potential intimidation that they issued advisories spelling out what types of threatening behavior are banned and the exact dimensions of buffer zones surrounding polling places. This, of course, is exactly what Trump hoped to achieve with his nonstop lies about our rigged election and his calls for supporters to monitor the polls. * POLL CLOSINGS TO WATCH: Much of Florida's polls close at 7 p.m. Polls in North Carolina close at 7:30 p.m. And polls in Florida's western panhandle and in Pennsylvania close at 8 p.m. The results out of those three states will tell us a lot about whether we're in for a long night or a quicker one. * REPUBLICANS FRET ABOUT GROUND GAME: David Drucker reports that GOP insiders think the Republican National Committee's ground game will fall short today: Republican insiders say the RNC battleground field operation and data analytics department are not as robust as those deployed and developed by the Clinton campaign...Trump, a believer in the power of his high-octane, filled-to-capacity rallies, ultimately ceded control of the ground game to the RNC....""The reality is that Trump has less than nothing and the RNC has...more smoke and mirrors than a haunted house,"" a Republican said. Trump long thought he could supplant conventional organizing with massive rallies and huge doses of free media coverage. It may prove another way in which he doesn't have Magical Political Powers, after all. * SUN BELT DRIVES CLINTON CAMP'S CONFIDENCE: Jonathan Martin and Nate Cohn explain why the Clinton campaign is optimistic and what it means:  Mrs. Clinton's aides express...optimism about Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia, but they are less bullish about their prospects in Michigan...Iowa and Ohio....Democrats...have effectively swapped much of their working-class white base for the so-called rising demographic of millennials, nonwhite voters and suburbanites clustered near cities such as Denver, Miami, Las Vegas and Washington.  The questions are whether the gains in the Sun Belt overwhelm the losses in the Rust Belt, and what that means for the parties going forward. * TRUMP RALLY MOMENT OF THE DAY, SHE'S-A-WITCH EDITION: Lovely, as always: Earlier Monday, a rowdy crowd in Scranton, Pa., shouted, ""She's a witch!"" and ""She's a demon!""as Trump berated Clinton. When he began to lambast the news media as dishonest, the audience erupted into a thunderous chant of ""CNN sucks!"" Can't you just feel the economic anxiety? * AND TRUMP SCORES HUGE ENDORSEMENT (MAYBE): This is an interesting detail from a Trump rally in New Hampshire:  In Manchester, he read aloud a letter that he said was from Bill Belichick, the coach of the New England Patriots football team. ""Congratulations on a tremendous campaign,"" it purportedly read. ""You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully.""

She was 78. The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, her goddaughter, Gabrielle D'Alemberte, told the Associated Press. Ms. Reno was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1995, while she was attorney general. Ms. Reno brought a fierce independence to her job. From the FBI siege of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., to the investigation into Clinton's sexual relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky, she was adamant that her prosecutors and agents work outside the influence of politics, media or popular opinion. Her supporters believed that she brought a heightened level of integrity and professionalism to the attorney general's office. They admired her insistence on legal exactitude from her employees and praised her caution in prosecutions. Ms. Reno resisted weeks of pressure to arrest Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, waiting until she thought agents had sufficient legal justification to tie him to the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. He was later convicted.   On Feb. 12, 1993, President Clinton named Janet Reno the nation's first female attorney general. (Doug Mills/AP)  ""She was a very powerful force for lawfulness,"" said Walter E. Dellinger III, a Duke University law professor who served as solicitor general during Ms. Reno's tenure. ""She was always challenging to make sure there was a sound legal basis for what people were doing. And she was adamant about separating the department from politics."" Business leaders criticized her lengthy prosecution of Microsoft on charges of anti-competitive violations -- a case that ultimately ended in a settlement during the George W. Bush administration. Civil libertarians took Ms. Reno to task for her handling of the espionage case against former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist Wen Ho Lee, who was held in solitary confinement for nine months after being charged with mishandling nuclear secrets, only to be released after entering a plea deal on a lesser charge. Even Clinton said he was troubled by the case. Ms. Reno refused to apologize. Republicans criticized her bitterly for what they said was pandering to the Clinton White House -- she refused, for instance, to launch an independent investigation into whether Vice President Al Gore illegally raised funds from the White House during the 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign. Democrats, meanwhile, disparaged her for abandoning her political patrons. Ms. Reno said first lady Hillary Clinton never forgave her for authorizing an investigation into the Lewinsky affair. Ms. Reno remained in office longer than any other attorney general of the 20th century. She won high marks outside the capital for her plain-spoken manner and folksiness: her preference for kayaking on the Potomac River to hobnobbing on Washington's cocktail circuit; her oft-told childhood stories from the Everglades, with a mother who wrestled alligators; and her home in Florida with a family of peacocks, all named Horace. A self-described ""awkward old maid"" who stood nearly 6-foot-2, Ms. Reno showed a willingness to lampoon her image. She joined actor Will Ferrell on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" as he played a wooden version of her in a skit called ""Janet Reno's Dance Party."" She was Bill Clinton's third pick for attorney general. He had promised to nominate a woman for the post, but his first two choices -- Zoe Baird, a corporate lawyer, and Kimba Wood, a federal judge in New York -- withdrew after allegations that they had hired illegal immigrants as nannies.         1 of 16       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                       Skip Ad   x           Remembering former U.S. attorney general Janet Reno      View Photos   Janet Reno, first female attorney general, dies at 78.

Ms. Reno also drew praise from Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund and a friend of Hillary Clinton. Edelman reportedly admired Ms. Reno's aggressive prosecution of child abusers and child-support cases. When he nominated Ms. Reno for attorney general, the president noted that she kept her phone number listed -- an unusual risk for a prosecutor.  ""She has lived the kind of life in real contact with the toughest problems of this country that I think will serve her very well as the nation's chief law enforcement officer,"" Clinton said. 'I made the decision' Janet Wood Reno was born July 21, 1938, in Miami. Her father, Henry, spent more than 40 years as a police reporter for the Miami Herald. Her mother, the former Jane Wood, was an investigative reporter for the now-defunct Miami News. When Janet Reno was a child, the family moved into a home her mother built outside Miami, on what was then the edge of the Everglades.  Ms. Reno graduated in 1960 from Cornell University and in 1963 from Harvard Law School, where she was one of a handful of women in a class of more than 500. After a stint at a small Miami law firm (she said larger firms passed her by because of her gender), she slowly advanced in private practice, became active in local Democratic politics and was hired by the Dade County State Attorney's Office in the early 1970s. The prosecutor's administrative assistant, Seymour Gelber, assigned her to what he thought was the dead-end job of organizing the office's juvenile division. ""It was an appendage nobody paid much attention to, so I sent Janet over there and figured she would dawdle around like everybody else and write another report,"" Gelber told the Chicago Tribune in 1993. ""Instead, she pasted the juvenile court together in about two months."" Protecting children would remain a focus of Ms. Reno's career. In speech after speech, she connected crime to social conditions such as poverty and a broken school system. She was appointed Dade County state's attorney in 1978 and won five straight elections, running as a Democrat. Many minority residents blamed Ms. Reno for the 1980 acquittal of four white police officers accused of killing an unarmed black motorcyclist. The case sparked riots in Miami in which more than a dozen people were killed and hundreds were injured, and Gov. Bob Graham (D) called in thousands of National Guard troops to keep the peace. Mobs reportedly shouted ""Re-no!"" as they set fires. Ms. Reno's work reaching out to black and Latino residents eventually helped calm tensions. She put a priority on hiring minorities and aggressively pursued absentee fathers to pay their child-support obligations. Clinton nominated Ms. Reno to the attorney general post in February 1993. At the time, he praised her rock-solid integrity -- a characteristic that led her to buy cars new, at sticker price, to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Within a month of her appointment, Ms. Reno confronted a case that colleagues said would define the rest of her career: the standoff with followers of self-proclaimed prophet David Koresh at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco. Koresh's group had already killed four federal officers and had withstood a weeks-long standoff with the FBI when agents asked Ms. Reno to authorize a raid of the compound. She gave the go-ahead for the agents to storm the building with tear gas after being convinced that children were being abused inside, she said. During the raid, a fire broke out and engulfed the compound, killing all 80 or so people inside.  Later that day, an anguished-looking Ms. Reno stood in front of television cameras and took full blame. ""I made the decision,"" she said. ""I'm accountable. The buck stops with me."" She later stood her ground during a House Judiciary Committee hearing when Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) told her that she was right to offer her resignation.  ""I'd like you to know that there is at least one member of Congress that isn't going to rationalize the death of two dozen children,"" he said. ""I haven't tried to rationalize the death of children, congressman,"" she responded, glaring, her voice quavering. ""I feel more strongly about it than you will ever know. But I have neither tried to rationalize the death of four agents, and I will not walk away from a compound where ATF agents had been killed by people who knew they were agents and leave them unsurrounded. . . . Most of all, congressman, I will not engage in recrimination."" For the rest of Ms. Reno's career, fringe groups pointed to Waco as an example of the deadly misuse of federal force. Timothy McVeigh, responsible for the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people and injured scores more, reportedly saw Waco as inspiration for his terrorism. Although personally opposed to capital punishment, Ms. Reno authorized her prosecutors to seek the death penalty for McVeigh. He was killed by lethal injection in June 2001, the first federal execution since 1963. Late in her term as attorney general, Ms. Reno again faced questions about the use of federal force. The Miami relatives of young Elian Gonzalez, whose mother had drowned as the pair attempted to flee Cuba to the United States, refused to return the child to his father, who wanted to take him back to Cuba. The saga of the 6-year-old held the country's attention for much of early 2000, with Miami's Cuban expatriate community adamant that the boy stay in the United States, a federal judge ordering that they return him to his father, and Ms. Reno flying to Florida to negotiate. After the Miami family members ignored Ms. Reno's deadline for them to comply with the judge's order, she authorized federal agents to enter their home and seize the boy. A photo of a SWAT-equipped border patrol agent appearing to point a gun at the young Gonzales in a closet became a much-reproduced image -- a visceral symbol of the passions felt on all sides of the debate. After stepping down from the attorney general's office in 2001, Ms. Reno returned to Florida and the next year ran for governor. Despite her almost universal name recognition, party officials threw their backing behind Tampa lawyer Bill McBride, reportedly because Ms. Reno had not sought their blessing before embarking on her campaign. Ms. Reno narrowly lost the nomination. McBride subsequently lost to Jeb Bush in the general election. During the next decade, Ms. Reno gave speeches about criminal-justice issues, particularly as they related to children. She served on the board of the Innocence Project, the nonprofit organization that works to exonerate the wrongly convicted through DNA evidence. Ms. Reno never married and did not have children. Survivors include a sister, Maggy Hurchalla. When asked by reporters what she wanted to do after Washington, she said she wanted to read, garden and perfect her Eskimo roll, a kayaking maneuver.   "

Chinese authorities say the law is required to prevent crime and terrorism. It also prohibits activity aimed at ""overthrowing the socialist system,"" a reference to challenges to the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Chinese leaders promote internet use for business and education but try to block access to material deemed subversive or obscene. The country has the biggest population of Internet users at 710 million, according to government data. The latest measure approved by the National People's Congress requires companies to enforce censorship and aid in investigations and imposes standards for security technology. It tightens controls on where Chinese citizens' data can be stored. Human rights groups complain it will extend controls on a society in which media are controlled by the ruling party and the internet has provided a rare forum for individuals to express themselves to a large audience.  ""The new cyber-security law tightens the authorities' repressive grip on the internet,"" said Patrick Poon, a China researcher for Amnesty International, in a statement. ""It goes further than ever before in codifying abusive practices, with a near total disregard for the rights to freedom of expression and privacy."" Passage of the law comes amid a crackdown on dissent under Communist Party leader Xi Jinping in which hundreds of human rights activists and legal professionals have been detained or questioned. A coalition of business groups warned in August the latest proposed measures might limit access to China's market for security technology in violation of Beijing's World Trade Organization commitments. Business groups have complained Beijing increasingly is using regulation to try to squeeze foreign competitors out of promising industries.  ""We believe this is a step backwards for innovation in China that won't do much to improve security,"" said James Zimmerman, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, in a statement. He said it will ""create barriers to trade and innovation."" The law's requirements for national security reviews and data sharing will ""unnecessarily weaken security and potentially expose personal information,"" said Zimmerman. He said some measures ""seem to emphasize protectionism rather than security."" Chinese authorities cite the need to protect banks and other industries. But officials of Chinese industry groups quoted in the state press have said previous restrictions on use of foreign security technology also were intended to shield the country's fledgling providers from competition. Computer hacking is a chronic source of tension between Beijing and Washington. Foreign security researchers point to China as a major source of hacking attacks aimed at stealing trade secrets. In 2014, American prosecutors charged five Chinese military officers with hacking and economic espionage against six U.S. companies. Chinese authorities deny they encourage hacking and say their country is a victim of cyberattacks. On Monday, a Chinese official defended the law and rejected suggestions it was meant to keep out foreign vendors.  ""Any company that wants to come in, as long as they obey Chinese laws, serve the interests Chinese consumers, we welcome them to come in, and to prosper together,"" said Zhao Zeliang, director-general of the cybersecurity bureau of the Cyberspace Administration of China, at a news conference. Business groups say a provision requiring security technology to be ""secure and controllable"" might require providers to tell Chinese authorities how their products work, raising the risk trade secrets might be leaked. The coalition in August said the proposed measures did nothing to improve security and might weaken data protection. Zhao tried to quell concern about the ""secure and controllable"" passage, saying criticism of it was based on ""a misunderstanding, a bias.""  ""Our requirements have been consistent: Vendors must not use their position as service providers to get user information or data,"" he said. ""Vendors cannot use their positions to illegally control and damage systems. Vendors must not harm fair competition or consumers."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

How about instead reading some classic graphic novels that offer extraordinarily relevant insights into the insanity of the 2016 presidential campaign? Here are three of my favorites. ""Cerebus: High Society,"" by Dave Sim ""High Society"" is the second book in what would become an epic 300-issue series. In Sim's early political masterpiece, the still-young Cerebus the Aardvark arrives in the city-state of Iest, where he is groomed for political power by the mysterious, uber-competent Lady Astoria. She guides the rough-edged aardvark through the byzantine politics of Iest. In short order, Cerebus wins and loses the position of ""Ranking Diplomatic Representative"" of Palnu, the economic powerhouse led by his former employer, the Groucho Marx-inspired Lord Julius. Astoria then puts Cerebus forward as a candidate for prime minister as a populist nationalist candidate promising to stand up to Palnu. Confident that Iestan voters understand their complete and total economic dependence on Palnu, Julius responds by fielding a goat. (Not a talking goat character, a real goat.) In an all too familiar demonstration of the power of partisanship, the goat, despite being a goat, immediately wins the support of half the electorate. After a hilariously chaotic campaign, Cerebus ultimately becomes prime minister by a single vote, after the Iestan equivalent of a ballot recount -- he has to travel up north and track down the local official who had refused to register a vote out of disdain for elections. That victory has consequences. Cerebus is himself very much a Trump-like figure. If anyone in the series resembles Clinton, it is the hyper-competent and ruthlessly pragmatic Astoria. The goat is, well, a goat. Cerebus is, at this point of the series, a shrewd, hypermasculine character obsessed with power for its own sake and utterly uninterested in policy -- a running joke is that he falls asleep during cabinet meetings and policy debates. As soon as he becomes prime minister, Cerebus disbands the legislature (Headlines: ""Don't say we didn't warn you; Goat organizes resistance movement"") and announces an ""amnesty program"" (""Turn in all traitors or be executed yourself; Goat arrested on morals charge."") He sells off the crown jewels to hire a mercenary army, then launches a series of disastrous wars that bankrupt the city-state and ultimately lead to its conquest. The self-defeating nature of an unquenchable thirst for power -- whether by Cerebus, Astoria or anyone -- is a central theme of Sim's overarching 300-issue story. It's worth reading this weekend (download an authorized, free digital version here) for the manic fun of a political campaign -- that is thankfully fictional -- and for reflecting on the sobering consequences of populist power gone wrong.  ""Transmetropolitan,"" by Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson The bald, tattooed and borderline insane journalist Spider Jerusalem will always be one of Warren Ellis's greatest creations. Set in a technopunk, dystopian future, ""Transmetropolitan's"" overarching story unfolds over 10 collections in which Jerusalem chronicles and ultimately impacts the rise and fall of two monstrous politicians. Because of its determined lunacy, it is perhaps one of the few literary portrayals of politics that can stand up to the 2016 election. The first half of the series focuses on ""the Beast,"" the sitting president. Jerusalem had originally come to fame writing about the campaign that brought the Beast to power; his last column before disappearing into the mountains for four years was the word ""f---"" repeated 8,000 times. The Nixonesque Beast is portrayed as an utterly cynical political brute who will use any means necessary to hold on to power, including a covert massacre of his home city. ""If the president of the United States does it, it can't be a crime,"" he tells Jerusalem during a candid interview. The Beast is soon overshadowed by his opponent Gary Callahan, who wins first his party's nomination and then the presidency. Callahan, whom Jerusalem dubbed ""the Smiler,"" initially seems like a normal person but ultimately proves even more monstrous. He specializes in orchestrating the deaths of loved ones to distract attention from his political scandals. Over the last half of the book, President Callahan and Jerusalem go to war. What follows is both a frightening portrayal of an amoral lunatic wielding the power of the state, and a remarkably optimistic portrayal of the power of a crusading press to break through the lies and deceptions of that state. I won't spoil the ending, but I can say that journalists who have spent the last year trying to dig out the truth and bring it to the public in this absurdist election cycle might find unlikely inspiration in Spider Jerusalem. Maybe, despite all the chaos and insanity, all that reporting really can make a difference. ""DMZ,"" by Brian Wood and Riccardo Burchielli.  Wood's 72-issue series traces the harrowing adventures of Matty Roth, a photojournalist dropped in Manhattan, the De-Militarized Zone of warring sides in the second American civil war. The story portrays the warlords who dominate Manhattan's DMZ, the ordinary citizens who struggle to survive, and the absolute amorality and cynicism of the leadership of both sides of the civil war. Roth's photojournalism, like Jerusalem's, ultimately helps to break through the fog of official disinformation about the war. What is most relevant about Wood's narrative, which he began writing in 2005, is his frighteningly matter-of-fact account of how a rural insurgency quickly takes hold and divides the country. DMZ tracks an uprising of secessionists called ""The Free States of America"" (FSA -- seriously!), who declare a government in Helena, Mont. As it spread rapidly across the country, Roth recalls, ""no one could grasp how it could happen... so many people were in denial. They laughed at the idea of this redneck army in pickup trucks. But the laughing didn't last long."" The National Guard dissolves as many of its members took off their uniforms or defected to the insurgency. As the FSA spreads East, it convinces many rural and small town Americans to join the uprising. When the U.S. military finally confronts the insurgency in Pennsylvania, pilots refuse to use air power against its own people and the FSA wins. The insurgency is halted in New York, which becomes the titular DMZ dividing the USA and the FSA. Five years later, the FSA has proven unable to conquer major cities but the U.S. government is still bogged down fighting ""the same asymmetrical insurgent warfare that bogged down the U.S. military overseas."" At one point late in the story, a U.S. soldier stationed in Yemen is shown on television complaining that he wished the troops could return to defend the homeland. DMZ will make for disturbing reading today for those who look at armed militias organizing to monitor polls and fear that civil war and insurgency really can happen here. It may also serve as a cautionary tale for cynical politicians and media personalities playing with insurgent fire. Again, I won't spoil the ending, but the entire series makes for a grimly captivating read about an uncomfortably relevant potential American dystopia. ""High Society,"" ""Transmetropolitan"" and ""DMZ"" are all brilliantly written and illustrated productions. They are far more fun, much richer and less didactic than these bare bones descriptions allow (and, fair warning, in the case of ""Transmetropolitan"" at least, extremely NSFW). If you need to distract yourself from refreshing your news feed for the 10th time in the last hour, give Dave Sim, Warren Ellis and Brian Wood a try."
