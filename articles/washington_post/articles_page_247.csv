Attorneys for state Treasurer Nick Khouri and members of a receivership transition board filed the request Thursday, nearly a week after U.S. District Judge David Lawson's ruling. He said bottled water must be delivered unless residents opt out or officials verify that a water filter has been properly installed. State attorneys say the injunction ""far exceeds"" what is necessary to ensure residents have access to safe drinking water, and the state is likely to succeed when it appeals to a federal appeals court. One of the plaintiffs, the Natural Resources Defense Council, says seeking to delay the order is an ""obvious insult to the people of Flint."" ___ 9:35 a.m. Michigan will consider requiring all infants and toddlers to be tested for lead as part of an initiative to eradicate children's exposure to the neurotoxin. The recommendation is among many unveiled Thursday by a state board formed in the wake of Flint's water crisis. The emergency stems from old lead pipes contaminating drinking water after the city switched to improperly treated water while under state management. But lead poisoning is more frequently linked to paint and dust in older housing and soil. The board's report to Gov. Rick Snyder calls for the screening of all children for lead by the time they turn 1 and again between ages 2 and 3. Such testing currently is only required for low-income kids in the Medicaid or Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Times ""is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'"" Trump has tweeted about the newspaper six times since being elected, mostly to criticize the paper's coverage of him. The Times said Thursday that it added 41,000 paid subscriptions to its newspaper and digital news products in the week since Election Day. The Times said the increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. Earlier this month, the New York Times Co. reported a sharp drop in advertising revenue during its third quarter, but said digital news subscriptions rose in the period by 116,000 to bring its total to 1.3 million subscriptions.

U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel held a hearing Thursday to give anyone a chance to object to his ruling closing Roof's competency hearing next week. But he didn't restrict what the eight family members of victims or the pastor of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church could say. Some relatives talked about how the trial delays hurt them. Others say it will be hard to deal with the trial in December as Christmas neared. They all asked for Monday's competency hearing to be open. Gergel says he is moved by their pain. But he says the hearing will remain closed. ____ 3:35 a.m. A federal judge will hear arguments on whether he should change his mind and open to the public a hearing on whether Dylann Roof is competent to stand trial for killing nine black worshippers in a Charleston church. Judge Richard Gergel will hear from lawyers hired by The Associated Press and other media outlets at 1 p.m. Thursday. Gergel ruled Wednesday that Roof's competency hearing next week should be closed because statements from Roof and other evidence from the hearing could prevent potential jurors from giving him a fair trial. Roof's attorneys questioned his ability to help them at his death penalty trial on the eve of jury selection earlier this month. Gergel has tentatively ruled he'll begin jury selection Nov. 28 if Roof is found competent. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But there are cities and states where homelessness is on the rise. The Department of Housing and Urban Development said Thursday many cities in the West are struggling with homelessness. They say a lack of affordable housing and growing problems with opioid addiction are contributing to the problem. Nationwide, veteran homelessness has decreased dramatically in the last several years. Officials credit a program initiated by President Barack Obama urging communities to have a plan in place to prevent and reduce homelessness. They hope communities apply what they've learned helping veterans to other groups with high rates of homelessness. The federal government releases the numbers after volunteers across the country count homeless people in their local areas. ___ 12:40 a.m. The federal government is estimating the number of homeless people nationwide. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will announce state-by-state figures Thursday. Officials say homelessness has declined nationwide in recent years, especially among military veterans. They credit a program initiated by President Barack Obama which urges every community to have a plan in place to prevent and reduce homelessness. But there are parts of the country such as Hawaii where homelessness has been increasing. The island state is struggling with an affordable housing shortage.

Pat McCrory, who trailed by a few thousand votes Thursday in a still too-close-to-call race that played out amid anger over the state's transgender bathroom law. The law limiting LGBT rights appeared to have a substantial role in the Election Day contest between McCrory, who signed the measure and vigorously defended it against boycotts and other protests, and Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper, who called for its repeal. McCrory, who in 2012 won the governorship by 500,000 votes in a blowout the same year President Barack Obama was re-elected, was losing by 5,000 votes out of nearly 4.7 million cast. In 2012, McCrory received 170,000 more votes than Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. This time, he trailed Donald Trump by 63,000 votes. McCrory could still win. There are tens of thousands of provisional ballots that have to be examined to determine whether they are valid and can be added to the vote tallies. Counties don't have to submit their final results until Nov. 18. North Carolina debated, passed and signed the bathroom bill in a one-day special session in March. The measure, known as House Bill 2, requires transgender people to use restrooms in schools and government buildings that correspond to the gender on their birth certificate. The law also leaves out gay and transgender people from state anti-discrimination protection. And it disallows local measures that offer protection. The national backlash began immediately. Charlotte lost the NBA All-Star game. The NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference pulled basketball tournament games out of North Carolina, a punishing blow in a state where college basketball is practically religion. Bruce Springsteen and other stars canceled concerts. Businesses like PayPal stopped expansions or moves. Even some of McCrory's supporters were bothered -- not necessarily by the law itself but by the costly and embarrassing spectacle that resulted.  ""The bathroom thing was ludicrous. It took away from a lot of the good he did, like bring jobs back,"" said 54-year-old John Muter, who still voted for McCrory. House Bill 2 struck down an LGBT rights ordinance in Charlotte, where McCrory was mayor for 14 years. Mecklenburg County, which is made up mostly of Charlotte, gave its hometown son a 3,100-vote victory in 2012. On Tuesday, McCrory lost Mecklenburg County by 136,000 votes. William Brinkley was one of those Charlotte voters who flipped their votes, upset that McCrory and other Republicans poked their nose into local business.  ""I'm totally against the entire scheming that they want to pass something without the populace's consent. Trying to do stuff in a closed session is not the way to get stuff done in this state,"" the 27-year-old business consultant said recently. ""I 100 percent think it's an invasion of freedom."" As expected, the bathroom law hurt McCrory in the state's booming and diverse urban areas, such as Charlotte and the Raleigh-Durham area, with their large banking and technology sectors. Unofficial results Tuesday showed that even in many of the rural areas that he won, McCrory didn't match Trump's vote totals. Gay rights organizations welcomed the outcome.  ""There's no question the voters have spoken and resoundingly rejected the hate that is H.B. 2,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. Asked about the law's effect on the vote totals, McCrory campaign spokesman Ricky Diaz said by email there's no outcome yet and others will have time to dissect the election once a winner is declared. Still, even if Cooper prevails, not much may change. Republicans maintained veto-proof majorities in the state Senate and House. The bathroom law was not the only thing to hurt McCrory. The governor took criticism in the past year in the Charlotte area for not actively trying to block construction of toll lanes on Interstate 77. Another place that felt the effects of House Bill 2 -- and other Republican policies -- was the city of Wilmington. Before McCrory took office, Wilmington had a booming $170 million film industry. But the elimination of state tax incentives for film projects and the entertainment industry's backlash against House Bill 2 have cut that to about $60 million this year, said Johnny Griffin, director of the Wilmington Regional Film Commission. McCrory won the county by 15,500 votes in 2012 and lost it by 5,000 votes this time. Trump won the county on Tuesday by 4,000 votes.  ""Trump carried New Hanover County, but McCrory didn't?"" Griffin said. ""The film industry is very important in this town. People get it."" ___ Tom Foreman Jr. contributed to this report from Charlotte, North Carolina. ___ Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at http://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP .

And Evan McMullin may do just that -- at least here in Utah.  A former CIA officer, investment banker and, most recently, Capitol Hill staffer, McMullin has spent the past three months on a quixotic bid to become president. It is an endeavor, he says, spurred by disgust with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump and a desire to see a return to a principled conservatism of individual liberty and inclusion.  ""Somebody had to stand up for equality and liberty in this election, especially a conservative needed to do this,"" McMullin, sipping a Diet Coke, said in his Salt Lake City campaign office on Monday. McMullin is getting the most traction here in this solidly Republican state where Trump's brash style hasn't played well with a large part of the electorate. Mormon voters, in particular, are turned off by the thrice-married New Yorker and his views on immigration, refugees and women.      Where early voters have already cast their ballots View Graphic     Where early voters have already cast their ballots   [In Utah, Trump's brash style doesn't sit well with a certain sliver of the GOP base]  McMullin was born here, attended Brigham Young University and is a Mormon. In recent weeks, he has been on the receiving end of vicious attacks, including a white nationalist who set up robo-calls highlighting McMullin's personal life by claiming the bachelor candidate is gay -- McMullin says he is not -- and stating that his mother married a woman after divorcing McMullin's father, which is true.  ""You know the attacks are going to be vicious and full of lies,"" he said. ""That's what I think keeps a lot of people away from doing this.""  Most recent polling here shows Trump with an edge, followed by McMullin, and Clinton in third.  McMullin and his running mate, Mindy Finn, a conservative strategist in her mid-30s, have campaigned throughout the country, going to black churches in Atlanta and meeting with Muslim groups in Michigan. The campaign has been spreading the word mostly through Facebook and Twitter and has been targeting younger conservatives. But the duo have focused their efforts on the mountain West, stumping in Idaho and Wyoming -- both states that rejected Trump and Clinton in the primaries -- and Colorado, and have focused their final efforts on trying to win Utah.  ""It's just only natural that an effort like this that's electorally focused on stopping them both and is otherwise focused on building a new conservative movement . . . be here,"" McMullin said. The candidate is antiabortion, against same-sex marriage and wants to return more power to the states. He said a decade spent in the CIA, where he fought the war on terrorism and had a talent for recruiting extremists as assets, taught him to use power judiciously and the need for reforms at the Pentagon.      View Graphic       [Inside Evan McMullin's 10 years undercover in the CIA]  With McMullin on the ballot in only 11 states, his path to the White House is slim to the point of almost nonexistent -- and he and his staff know it. The only path is winning Utah's six electoral votes and an electoral college tie that would be thrown to the House, and then somehow persuade Republicans there to pick him.  But McMullin, his staff and volunteers -- the campaign said there are 5,000 of them making calls nationwide -- believe they have created a new conservative movement, and only time will tell what shape it will take.  Others are less sure.  ""I'm pretty skeptical of a new conservative movement,"" said Jeremy Pope, a political science professor at Brigham Young University. He said McMullin could stand for a new type of conservatism and has a shot of winning Utah, although he believes it is a long one. The issue, he said, is persuading Republicans used to voting a straight ticket to not do so.  But McMullin has stirred something here in Utah, where he received a rousing welcome when he walked into the diner. He shook hands with people eating eggs and hamburgers, punctuating his conversations with ""Cool"" and ""Awesome.""   McMullin walked over toward a jukebox, where he posed for a photo with 2-year-old Derek Ball and his 8-year-old brother, James. Their mother, 36-year-old Robin Ball, teared up when talking about McMullin. She and her husband are Republicans who discovered McMullin and have been spreading the word on Facebook.  ""I feel like it's the opposite of a protest vote,"" she said. ""Rather than protest out of fear, it's standing for what I believe.""   "

Clinton urged voters to embrace a ""hopeful, inclusive, bighearted America,"" while Trump called for support to ""beat the corrupt system."" The candidates planned to campaign late into the night, a frenzied end to a bitter election year that has laid bare the nation's deep economic and cultural divides. Clinton opened the day Monday buoyed by FBI Director James Comey's announcement Sunday that he would not recommend criminal charges against her following a new email review. The inquiry had sapped a surging Clinton momentum at a crucial moment in the race, though she still heads into Election Day with multiple paths to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the nation's first female president.  ""I think I have some work to do to bring the country together,"" she acknowledged as she boarded her plane for her last battleground tour. ""I really do want to be the president for everybody."" Looking beyond Election Day, Clinton said in a radio interview that she hopes Trump will play a ""constructive role"" in helping bring the country together if she defeats him. Trump was aggressive to the end, slamming Clinton as the ""face of failure."" Having made the new FBI review a centerpiece of his closing case to voters, he argued that the Democrat was being protected by a ""totally rigged system.""  ""You have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system and deliver justice,"" Trump said. ""Do not let this opportunity slip away."" The comments were a reminder that Comey's news, delivered in a letter to lawmakers on Sunday, was a doubled-edged sword for Clinton. While it vindicated her claims that the emails would not yield new evidence, it ensured that a controversy that has dogged her campaign from the start would follow her through Election Day. Across the country, nearly 24 million early ballots were cast under the shadow of Comey's initial announcement of a new email review. That number represents more than half of the roughly 42.5 million people who had cast votes by Monday afternoon, according to Associated Press data. The inquiry involved material found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide. Comey said Sunday the FBI reviewed communications ""to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state."" Clinton tried to fly above the controversy Monday and was not expected to address the matter during stops in Michigan and North Carolina. She was also headlining an evening rally in Philadelphia with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, along with rock stars Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. Nearing the end of his two terms in the White House, Obama was nostalgic as he launched his own busy day of events, noting that he was probably making his last campaign swing for the foreseeable future.  ""Whatever credibility I have earned after eight years as president, I am asking you to trust me on this. I am voting for Hillary Clinton,"" Obama said. Clinton is banking in part on high turnout -- particularly among Obama's young, diverse coalition of voters -- to carry her over the finish line Tuesday. Roughly half the states with advance voting have reported record turnout, including Florida and Nevada, which have booming Hispanic populations, a possible good sign for Clinton. In Florida alone, Hispanic participation is up by more than 453,000 votes, nearly doubling the 2012 level. Black turnout is up compared to 2012, but that share of the total vote is lower due to bigger jumps among Latinos and whites, according to University of Florida professor Daniel Smith In Nevada, where more than three-fourths of expected ballots have been cast, Democrats also lead, 42 percent to 36 percent. Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie downplayed the impact of increased Hispanic participation, telling reporters on a conference call, ""We feel that we're going to get a good share of those votes."" However, he sidestepped two questions about the level of Hispanic vote Trump needs to win the presidency. Without victories in Florida and Nevada, Trump's path to 270 electoral votes would be exceedingly narrow. He already must win nearly all of the roughly dozen battleground states. Trump planned to campaign at a breakneck pace through Election Day. Following the rally in Florida, he headed to North Carolina and then was off to Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. After voting in New York Tuesday morning, After that, Trump was to return to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and New Hampshire. Midway through his travels Monday, Trump praised his supporters for having created a ""movement."" But he warned it would all slip away if he loses Tuesday.  ""Go vote,"" he urged. ""Or honestly, we've all wasted our time."" ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey, Hope Yen, Jonathan Lemire and Steve Peoples in Washington and Josh Lederman in Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed to this report. _ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC, Lisa Lerer at http://twitter.com/llerer and Jill Colvin at http://twitter.com/colvinj Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Now the Democratic vice presidential nominee is wrapping up a whirlwind three months on the campaign in front of a home crowd. On Monday, a day before Election Day, Kaine is holding rallies in Northern Virginia and at the airport in Richmond, his hometown. It's a rare stop in his home state, as the U.S. senator and former Virginia governor has been on the road nearly every day since being tapped as Clinton's running mate in late July. With Clinton long being favored to win in Virginia, Kaine has spent much of his time on the campaign trail in key swing states like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The typical campaign day has been jam packed with interviews, rallies and fundraisers and Kaine has spent countless hours on a private charter plane or zipping along highways in motorcades. But Tom Wolf, a former law partner who joined Kaine on the campaign trail, said his longtime friend is having fun and staying ""centered"" despite the long hours.  ""He genuinely enjoys campaigning, he likes meeting new people,"" said Wolf. It's not all been drudgery, as Kaine has been a guest on late night TV, played harmonica with rock stars at rallies and fundraisers, and even attended his 40th high school reunion in Kansas City, Missouri. Kaine's time on the trail has been largely low key. Republican Donald Trump and Clinton -- or her more high profile surrogates like President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama -- have dominated the daily news cycles and left Kaine sometimes looking like the forgotten candidate. Kaine has also spent virtually no time campaigning with Clinton, and he said they sometimes go a week without talking. But Kaine has plowed on as reliable foot soldier, dutifully attacking Trump in standard stump speeches before audiences large and small while avoided making any noticeable missteps that could draw negative attention. Though his appearance on the biggest stage, the vice presidential debate, received criticism his aggressive style and constant interruptions of Republican Mike Pence. Much of Kaine's time on the trail was initially spent on the private fundraiser circuit, often doing several such events a day. In recent weeks, Kaine has used his Spanish fluency to be a key surrogate for Clinton among Hispanic voters. He's done about 50 interviews with Spanish-speaking media outlets and given some speeches entirely in Spanish. WikiLeaks, which has been posting stolen emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta, twice taunted Kaine that he's in for a ""surprise."" U.S. intelligence officials have said the leaked Podesta emails are part of a series of high-profile computer hacks of Democratic targets orchestrated by the Russian government. But WikiLeaks has so far not published anything damning about Kaine, who has shrugged off the threats. Kaine's Virginia homecoming comes amid tightening polls numbers in the state and The Associated Press has moved the Old Dominion from strong Democratic to leaning Democratic. Trump and Pence have made repeated visits to Virginia. Once a reliably Republican state, Virginia went twice for Obama and Kaine has said that helping turn the state blue in 2008 is among his greatest political accomplishments as governor. Kaine frequently talks about Virginia's shifting politics in speeches around the country. And when Kaine made a brief return to his home state for the vice presidential debate, Kaine told his fellow Virginia Democrats they should be proud of the progress they've made.  ""Do you see how far we've come,"" Kaine said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

The staffers will be dispatched to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations, such as discrimination on the basis of race. The announcement comes amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. The number of personnel is fewer than the roughly 780 monitors and observers who were dispatched during the 2012 presidential election. The Justice Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Acts. That decision has led to a reduction in trained observers, who enjoy unfettered access to the polls and cannot be removed from the sites. Even so, the Justice Department said it was still sending staffers to five more states than it did during the 2012 election. Most of the more than 500 staffers will be monitors, who rely on the cooperation of local officials to do their jobs. Observers in this election are limited to a handful of jurisdictions around the country where federal court orders are in place that authorize their presence. Justice Department officials say they hope voters will not detect any difference in the federal presence.  ""In most cases, voters on the ground will see very little practical difference between monitors and observers,"" Vanita Gupta, head of the department's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. ""We work closely and cooperatively with jurisdictions around the country to ensure that trained personnel are able to keep an eye on the proceedings from an immediate vantage point."" Among the states receiving federal monitors are those that have changed their voting rights laws since the last general election, or that are seen as more likely to experience problems on Tuesday. The Justice Department listed five counties each in North Carolina and Florida where staff will be sent.  ""The department is deeply committed to the fair and unbiased application of our voting rights laws and we will work tirelessly to ensure that every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement. ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Maybe they think awful things but you have no way of knowing. Everything that you thought could not possibly have happened did not happen. Then you wake up."
