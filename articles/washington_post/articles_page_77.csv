Rallying supporters on social media with the hashtag #SanctuaryCampus, organizers said actions were planned at more than 80 schools, including Vermont's Middlebury College, where about 400 people gathered, and Yale University, where demonstrators numbered about 600. Students sought assurances that their schools would not share their personal information with immigration officials or allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on campus.  ""Can you imagine the fear that it would inflict on college campuses if having ICE agents walk into a campus becomes the status quo?"" organizer Carlos Rojas of the group Movimiento Cosecha, said by phone from New Jersey. ""It would be terrifying."" The actions continued days of demonstrations that have broken out in cities and high school campuses following Trump's election victory last week. The Republican's campaign promises included a vow to deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally.  ""I'm very fearful,"" said Miriam Zamudio, whose parents brought her to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 6 or 7. She worries that the family information she provided on her application for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Status will endanger her parents, who are living in the country without legal permission.  ""We don't know what Trump is going to do,"" Zamudio said by phone as she prepared to join a protest at Rutgers University in New Jersey. ""We don't know if he is going to demand this information and we want our administration and our school to stand with us."" Faculty and staff at several universities have signed petitions in support of making their campuses sanctuaries for people threatened with deportation -- or anyone who faces discrimination.  ""We are alarmed at the vitriol that students and community members are experiencing across the United States in the aftermath of the recent election. Reports of gross imitations of disabled youth, threats to aid in the deportation of students and their families, renewed deployments of the 'N' word, sexual aggressions against young women, bullying of Muslim and LGBTQ+ youth, reappearances of swastikas, among other acts, point to hostilities that infiltrate our campus,"" petition to administrators at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign said. At the University of Memphis, students chanted ""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here"" and ""No racists, no KKK, no fascist USA,"" The Commercial Appeal reported. Junior Luke Wilson stood nearby, holding a sign that said ""You're all cry babies."" Similar sentiments appeared on Twitter and other social media platforms, along with messages of support.  ""We know that there are going to be people on both sides of the issue,"" Rojas said. ""But I think that what no one could argue with is that a university and a college campus have a moral responsibility to make the students that are paying tuition and just want to get an education feel safe."" Department of Homeland Security Press Secretary Gillian Christensen said existing ICE and Customs and Border Protection policies guide enforcement at ""sensitive locations,"" which include colleges and universities.  ""The ICE and CBP sensitive locations policies, which remain in effect, provide that enforcement actions at sensitive locations should generally be avoided, and require either prior approval from an appropriate supervisory official or exigent circumstances necessitating immediate action,"" Christensen said by email. ""DHS is committed to ensuring that people seeking to participate in activities or utilize services provided at any sensitive location are free to do so without fear or hesitation."" Yale Ph.D. student Ramon Garibaldo told the crowd to remain hopeful.  ""I fear for my existence every day,"" said Garibaldo, whose parents brought him from Mexico. ""My mom, my dad they crossed borders for me to be here. So we aren't going to bow down to the orders of one man."" ____ Thompson reported from Buffalo, New York.

(All times EST): 6:28 p.m. Kansas congressman Tim Huelskamp says someone ""close to the transition"" of President-elect Donald Trump has contacted him about becoming agriculture secretary. Huelskamp lost the GOP primary in his agriculture-heavy Kansas district this year after he was booted from the House Agriculture Committee amid fights with Republican leadership. He also opposed a five-year farm law enacted in 2014. The Kansas Farm Bureau, Kansas Livestock Association and National Association of Wheat Growers endorsed Huelskamp's challenger, Roger Marshall. Huelskamp said Wednesday that the USDA needs major reform, including stronger work requirements for food stamps. Some other possible candidates for agriculture secretary include Charles Conner of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, a former Bush USDA official; former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue; Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller; and Nebraska cattle rancher Charles Herbster. ___ 5:45 p.m. South Carolina's lieutenant governor says a member of Donald Trump's transition team has asked if he's interested in being attorney general. Henry McMaster also says he's been told that South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is being considered for secretary of state. McMaster tells The Associated Press he was contacted Wednesday. The former U.S. attorney and two-term state attorney general declined to specify who on the team called him. McMaster was an early backer of Trump. Haley endorsed and campaigned with Sen. Marco Rubio for South Carolina's first-in-the-South presidential primary. When Rubio dropped out, she backed Ted Cruz and continued to criticize Trump. ___ 5:15 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have received their first looks at the President's Daily Brief -- the highest level intelligence document prepared in the United States. Trump received his on Tuesday and Pence was briefed on Wednesday in Washington, according to an individual familiar with the briefings schedule. The individual, who was not authorized to discuss the briefings, spoke only on condition of anonymity. Intelligence officials briefed Trump and Pence after the GOP convention, but the President's Daily Brief has more detail, including information about U.S. covert operations. President Harry S. Truman started the practice because he first learned about the U.S. project to develop an atomic bomb only 12 days into his presidency. He pledged not to leave his successor in that position. ___ 3:08 p.m. Donald Trump is considering charter school advocate Eva Moskowitz to serve as education secretary, according to a senior Trump official. The official says Moskowitz, the founder of Success Academy Charter Schools, was at Trump Tower Wednesday meeting with the president-elect's team. Moskowitz is a former New York City councilwoman and a Democrat. She's clashed with Mayor Bill de Blasio over the expansion of some of her charter schools. De Blasio was also at Trump Tower Wednesday meeting with the president-election. The Trump official discussed Moskowitz on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to publicly discuss the internal transition process. --By Julie Pace ___ 2:40 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden says he's not worried about the incoming administration's readiness to take over the White House. Biden told reporters after meeting with Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Wednesday that he's ""confident on day one everything will be in good hands."" Addressing reports of infighting within President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, Biden said that ""no administration's ready on day one. We weren't really on day one."" Biden and his wife Jill spent nearly two hours with their successors Wednesday afternoon, sitting down for lunch with the Vice President-elect and his wife, Karen, and giving them a tour of the vice presidential residence and grounds. Biden also said he's not worried about the new administration dismantling his legacy, despite the President-elect's very different policy agenda. Biden said that he hopes the Pences enjoy the home at Washington's Naval Observatory as much as he did. ___ 2:30 p.m. The top Republican in the Senate says ""it's time for the election to be over."" Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also declined to answer questions about President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon as senior counselor, saying he wouldn't comment about White House staffing. Bannon's hiring has come under fire because of his Breitbart news site's derogatory comments about blacks, Muslims and women. McConnell told reporters on Wednesday that he would not go back and re-litigate what was said during a hotly contested presidential race. He said the focus is on working with Trump to repeal and replace the health care law, overhaul the tax system and deal with other issues. He also declined to comment on Trump's call for a ban on all executive-branch officials from lobbying for five years after leaving their government jobs. ___ 1:55 p.m. House Democrats have sent a letter to President-elect Donald Trump asking him to rescind the appointment of Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon as a senior White House adviser. The letter, which has signatures from 169 out of the 188 Democrats in the House, says the appointment of conservative flame-thrower Bannon undermines Trump's ability to unite the country. It points out stories from the website that are derogatory toward Jews and Muslims, among other groups.  ""Millions of Americans have expressed fear and concern about how they will be treated by the Trump Administration and your appointment of Mr. Bannon only exacerbates and validates their concerns,"" the letter reads. Rep. David N. Cicilline, D-R.I, organized the effort. ""Bigotry, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia should have no place in our society,"" he said. ___ 1:10 p.m. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says he met with President-elect Donald Trump and ""let him know that so many New Yorkers are fearful"" of what his administration could bring. De Blasio spoke to reporters after his hour-long meeting at Trump Tower Wednesday, which he categorized as ""respectful"" and ""candid"" with a real ""give-and-take."" The mayor, a liberal Democrat, and Trump have previously clashed. He said concerns with Trump's support of aggressive policing tactics, his tax plans and any move to deport immigrants living in the United States illegally. De Blasio said that Trump ""loves this city"" and added that he urged the Republican president-elect to send a ""sign of unity"" to his hometown, which overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton. ___ 11:50 a.m. A spokesman for President-elect Donald Trump says the transition team is ""not going to rush"" to put forward potential Cabinet selections. Jason Miller said Wednesday that Trump's team wants to feel confident their choices will be able to be confirmed by the Senate and can implement the president-elect's vision. Miller told reporters at Trump Tower in New York City that President Barack Obama did not have ""his entire Cabinet formed within the first week"" after his election in 2008. He said the transition team has a ""very solid plan"" and they're taking a ""methodical approach"" to filling Trump's Cabinet and White House. ___ 11:35 a.m. Over 300 U.S. businesses have signed a statement calling on President-elect Donald Trump to support the Paris Agreement on climate change -- including General Mills, eBay, Intel, Unilever, and dozens of other Fortune 500 companies. Their statement reads ""implementing the Paris Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy and prosperity to all."" The statement is addressed to Trump, President Barack Obama and members of Congress. It calls on elected U.S. officials to maintain the country's policy and financial commitments to lower carbon emissions. Lara Birkes, chief sustainability officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, says ""the Paris Agreement was a vital step forward, but its power is in our collective action."" ___ 11:32 a.m. Czech President Milos Zeman has called U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's former wife, Ivana, to thank her for her ""courage"" and interest to become the new U.S. ambassador to Prague. In a Wednesday statement, Zeman said he's pleased with that because ""the U.S. cannot send a better ambassador to Prague"" than her. Zeman said he would be delighted to meet her at the Prague Castle, the seat of presidency and is looking forward to introduce her to his wife, also named Ivana. Ivana, Trump's first wife and the mother of his three oldest children, is of Czech origin. Zeman was among several European leaders, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who endorsed Trump during the campaign. Zeman said he shared Trump's views of migration and the fight against the Islamic terrorism. Trump's presidential transition team provided no readout of the conversation between the Czech leader and his ex-wife. ___ 9:15 a.m. The White House Correspondents' Association says it is ""unacceptable"" that President-elect Donald Trump is traveling without a regular pool of journalists to inform the public of his whereabouts. Trump left his residence Tuesday night for a family dinner after his transition team had told journalists he would not be in public the rest of the day. A protective pool of journalists is supposed to join the president or president-elect's motorcade to record their whereabouts and be on hand in the event of breaking news. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks has said the team plans to respect the traditions of press access at the White House. WHCA President Jeff Mason says ""the time to act on that promise is now."" Mason says it is critical that journalists covering the president-elect ""be allowed to do their job."" __ 7:50 a.m. Ohio congressman Tim Ryan says Democrats should get back to economic basics of manufacturing, not veer to its liberal wing in the wake of Republican Donald Trump's election victory. Ryan is considering challenging Rep. Nancy Pelosi as House Democratic leader because he says the party risks sliding back into an ideological past rather than moving forward. He told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Wednesday that Democrats ""have to grab that idea of making things in America again.""  ""No one wants to hear about job retraining,"" he said. ""They want jobs."" ___ 6:30 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump is denying reports that efforts are underway to get security clearances for his adult children. In a post on his verified Twitter account @realDonaldTrump early Wednesday, the billionaire businessman who's to be inaugurated as the nation's 45th president on Jan. 20, said, ""I am not trying to get top security clearances for my children."" Trump, who has been immersed in transition planning at his office skyscraper in New York in recent days, added, ""This was a typically false news story."" There had been rampant speculation in recent days that such an effort was being attempted. Asked about it earlier this week, Kellyanne Conway, who was Trump's campaign manager, said in a broadcast interview she wasn't ""intimately' familiar with the issue and indicated she couldn't confirm it. 4:20 a.m. Turkey's president has criticized protests in the United States against Donald Trump, saying the president-elect should be respected and given time to show how he will govern. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday before a visit to Pakistan, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the protesters were ""attacking"" Trump because ""the person they wanted wasn't elected president."" Erdogan said: ""Hold on a second. The election process just ended, show some respect! How will he govern, let's see that first."" The Turkish leader added: This is important in terms of showing who respects democracy in the world."" 3:30 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump hadn't been seen in public for days when he walked into New York's 21 Club to applause from fellow diners. The unannounced evening out with family was a contrast to the behind-the scenes machinations that suggested a struggling transition as names surfaced and sank for top administration positions. Not to worry, Trump suggested in a Tuesday night tweet: ""Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!"" Before dinner at the midtown Manhattan restaurant-- he broke with protocol and left his press contingent behind -- Trump met with the head of his transition team, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, but another day passed without a Cabinet announcement.

As Trump met with senior advisers to discuss potential Cabinet candidates, there were further signs that power in his transition effort was consolidating within an ever-smaller group of loyalists generally not aligned with Republican members of the Washington establishment.  [The latest news on the Trump presidential transition]  Among them is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a top Trump adviser known for his hard-line views on immigration. His former staff director at the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brian Benczkowski, is now helping to manage the Justice Department transition for Trump's team, according to two prominent Republican lawyers with knowledge of the matter. Benczkowski replaced Kevin O'Connor, a former U.S. attorney and associate attorney general who had been managing the Justice Department transition, the lawyers said. A white-collar defense attorney at Kirkland & Ellis, Benczkowski previously worked in a number of senior Justice Department jobs and is a respected lawyer.         1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        His elevation is likely another indication that power has shifted away from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who was recently replaced as head of the transition team by Vice President-elect Mike Pence and who had been considered an emissary to more mainstream Republicans. Benczkowski declined to comment. Pence is scheduled to meet with Congressional leaders in Washington on Thursday, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The new developments came as Sessions himself emerged as a top candidate for defense secretary, along with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). Both would bring hawkish views and military experience, but neither has executive experience running a massive bureaucracy such as the Pentagon. Trump was also visited Wednesday by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who emerged from a meeting with the president-elect saying that he told Trump that ""so many New Yorkers are fearful"" of what he plans to do as president. De Blasio, a liberal Democrat, has clashed with Trump in the past. And like mayors in many of the nation's major cities with diverse cultures, he has said New York City authorities would not assist federal immigration officials with the deportations of immigrants who are here illegally, providing them sanctuary. Despite such differences, De Blasio said the hour-long session was ""respectful"" and added that Trump ""loves this city.''     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet  From the lobby of Trump tower, reporters spotted a coterie of guests entering the building, including New York Jets owner and Republican megadonor Woody Johnson, Trump's children, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and his wife Lara Trump and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is considered a potential Cabinet nominee. Transition turmoil On his Twitter account, Trump took particular aim at a favorite target, the New York Times, which reported Wednesday that the transition has been marked by firings and infighting, and that U.S. allies were having trouble reaching Trump at New York's Trump Tower as he plans his government. ""The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. . . . I have received and taken calls from many foreign leaders,'' Trump wrote in a series of posts on the microblogging site. He also denied reports that his transition team has sought security clearances for his children. In his tweets, Trump falsely implies the Times reported that he had not spoken with foreign leaders and never points out exactly what the Times had in error. The Times did report that American allies were ""blindly dialing in to Trump Tower"" in an attempt to reach the president-elect and that key members of the transition team had been fired. The paper reported that even key U.S. allies such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and British Prime Minister Theresa May had been patched through to Trump ""with little warning,"" citing a Western diplomat. Later in the day, the transition team released a list of foreign leaders that Trump and Pence have spoked with.   [Trump's gripes about the Times are usually about stories that prove accurate]  The Washington Post has also reported about turbulence in Trump's transition. But Peter Hoekstra, a Republican former congressman from Michigan, defended Trump in an interview Wednesday, saying the president-elect's team has ""a monumental job to do and a short time to do it."" ""I'm just watching all the sniping coming in. They're not doing this right. They're not doing that right,'' said Hoekstra, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman who is reportedly under consideration for CIA director. ""This is what any transition team would do. You start with the people who brought you. I think the Trump team is going to expand its outreach, absolutely. But they're going to do it in a methodical way.'' The reported bloodletting in Trump's transition team that began with last week's ouster of Christie had escalated Tuesday with new departures, particularly in the area of national security.  Former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) announced that he had left his position as the transition's senior national security adviser. Rogers, a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the leading candidate for CIA director, was among at least four transition officials purged this week, apparently because of perceived connections to Christie. As turbulence within the team grew, some key members of Trump's party began to question his views and the remaining candidates for top positions. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Trump's efforts to work more closely with Russian President Vladimir Putin amounted to ""complicity in [the] butchery of the Syrian people"" and ""an unacceptable price for a great nation."" Trump met Tuesday with Pence, who replaced Christie at the head of the transition Friday, to discuss Cabinet and White House personnel choices. Little to no information was released by the transition office, leaving a clutch of reporters gathered in the lobby of Trump Tower to hustle after team members passing between the front doors and the elevators.   Trump posted a message Tuesday night on Twitter saying that a ""very organized process [is] taking place"" as he decides on Cabinet and other positions. ""I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!""  As he had during the campaign, Trump appeared to be increasingly uncomfortable with outsiders and suspicious of those considered part of what one insider called the ""bicoastal elite,"" who are perceived as trying to ""insinuate"" themselves into positions of power. Those in the inner circle reportedly were winnowed to loyalists who had stuck with Trump throughout the campaign and helped devise his winning strategy. They include Sessions, former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and members of Trump's family, including son-in-law Jared Kushner. ""This is a very insular, pretty closely held circle of people,"" said Philip D. Zelikow, a former director of the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia and a senior figure in the George W. Bush transition. ""Confusion is the norm"" for transitions, he said, ""but there are some unusual features here, because they're trying to make some statements."" ""They feel like their election was a lot of the American people wanting to throw a brick through a window,"" Zelikow said. ""They want to make appointments that make it sound like glass is being broken.""  [President Obama warns against 'a crude sort of nationalism' in the U.S.]  Increasingly, among the shards are more mainline Republicans in the national security field. In an angry Twitter post Tuesday, Eliot A. Cohen, a leading voice of opposition to Trump during the campaign who had advised those interested in administration jobs to take them, abruptly changed his mind, saying the transition ""will be ugly."" After responding to a transition insider seeking names of possible appointees, Cohen said, he received what he described as an ""unhinged"" email from the same person saying ""YOU LOST"" and accusing Trump critics of trying to infiltrate the administration's ranks. ""It became clear to me that they view jobs as lollipops, things you give out to good boys and girls, instead of the sense that actually what you're trying to do is recruit the best possible talent to fill the most important, demanding, lowest-paying executive jobs in the world,"" Cohen said. Rogers's departure coincided with word from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose possible selection as secretary of state comforted more mainline Republicans, that he was unlikely to be chosen. ""Has my name been in the mix? I'm pretty sure, yeah. Have I been having intimate conversations? No,"" Corker said in an interview. ""Do I understand that it's likely that people who've been involved in the center of this for some time, and have been surrogating on television, are likely front-runners? I would say that's likely, yes."" The two people whose names are mentioned most often for the diplomatic job -- Giuliani and John R. Bolton, an undersecretary of state and one-year ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration -- are Trump loyalists. But both could be problematic, even among Republicans who would have to confirm them. Giuliani, thought to be an early choice for attorney general, was said by a person close to the transition team to have personally appealed to Trump for the diplomatic job. He has virtually no diplomatic experience or knowledge of the State Department bureaucracy. Bolton, a national security hawk who got his U.N. job through a recess appointment after the Senate refused to confirm him, was a leading advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, contradicting Trump's campaign position opposing it. Congress voices concern Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that Bolton would be a ""disaster"" and that he would actively oppose his nomination. Others were more supportive. ""If he picks John Bolton, then I'll support John Bolton. If he picks Rudy, I'll support Rudy,"" said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). The shortlist for defense secretary is said to include Sessions, Flynn and Cotton. Although Sessions serves on the Armed Services Committee, his main issue there has been immigration. Cotton is a Harvard Law School graduate who just seven years ago was a first lieutenant in the Army. Senate confirmation of Flynn, who also has voiced interest in serving as director of national intelligence, could be difficult, said the person close to the transition team. He was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency after two years over concerns about his leadership, and he has potentially problematic connections to foreign governments.

State Comptroller Peter Franchot (D) announced the findings Wednesday while testifying before a legislative committee that oversees the management of public funds. ""This review has been an instructive process for us in the comptroller's office, providing an opportunity to redouble our commitment to improve the way we deliver results on behalf of Maryland's taxpayers,"" Franchot said. Franchot acknowledged last December that his agency had misallocated local income-tax revenue, shortchanging some jurisdictions while giving others more than they were due. He hired an outside consultant to determine the extent and causes of the mistakes. In a separate review, state auditors reported in September that the comptroller's office sent $8.7 million in local tax revenue to the wrong Montgomery County municipalities between 2010 and 2014, affecting 14,000 tax returns. The auditors blamed the mistakes on a lack of proper controls and policies in Maryland, which is unique in collecting local income taxes on behalf of counties, municipalities and special taxing districts. The audit ordered by Franchot found that the agency misallocated another $12.7 million from 2010 to 2014, bringing the total to about $21.3 million out of roughly $20.8 billion in tax revenue that the agency processed over the five-year span. Franchot's office began notifying jurisdictions on Wednesday as to how the mistakes affected them, including how much money each locality will either owe or be owed. The comptroller said his office will reimburse all shortchanged jurisdictions within days and allow those that owe money to repay the funds over 10 years starting in 2024. A special $1 billion reserve fund will cover the reimbursements, ensuring that the corrections do not impact taxpayers or the state's current spending plans. Franchot, a Montgomery County resident who has been comptroller since 2007, attributed the mistakes to his office's use of a software system that misidentified the proper taxing districts for many properties, particularly those in districts that span several municipalities or counties. Only Baltimore was unaffected, because none of its districts extend beyond the city. Franchot noted that his agency's accuracy rate for revenue allocations was 99.9 percent. He announced plans to prevent future problems with an initiative dubbed ""Project Perfect,"" which will involve technological upgrades, changes to his agency's procedures, independent audits every two years and continuous verification of taxpayer addresses. The comptroller's office will replace its software system within five years, at an estimated cost of about $100 million. Del. Ana Sol Gutierrez (D-Montgomery), who co-chairs the oversight committee and is a trained systems engineer, said the comptroller's office could have easily prevented the glitches that caused the revenue to be misallocated. ""Whoever did your design simply missed it,"" she said. ""I think that was a serious error."" The comptroller thanked the legislature for its oversight of the issue but credited his agency with recognizing the problem and addressing it. ""I'd love to blame this on my predecessors, but this is our problem,"" Franchot said. ""We recognized it, we researched it, we fixed it -- we think."" "
4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/14/what-does-donald-trump-need-for-a-successful-residency-bureaucrats/	What does Donald Trump need for a successful presidency? Bureaucrats.	"   President-elect Donald Trump, with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, speaks at an election night rally in New York. Trump on Sunday named Priebus as his White House chief of staff. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)  After Donald Trump's surprising presidential victory last week, the big question is: How will he govern? A key source of insight will be the people he picks for his Cabinet and the nearly 4,000 appointed positions in the bureaucracy. Despite regular attacks on the bureaucracy during his campaign, Trump needs federal agencies to be fully staffed and competent if he hopes to succeed. Political science research suggests that his problems are only beginning. Lawmaking is not just a process by which Congress passes a bill and the president signs it. Much of it relies on federal agencies. Their rulemaking, which accounts for 90 percent of all federal laws, is how much policymaking in the United States actually occurs. An incompetent, understaffed bureaucracy bodes poorly for effective governing. Staffing key agency posts is already a difficult task. Officials in Bill Clinton's administration describe the appointment process as ""chaotic,"" ""emotional"" and ""overwhelming,"" according to David Lewis's research. It looks as though Trump's team is a living testament to these challenges. Research on presidential appointments around transitions shows that, first, presidents attempt to control agencies they don't trust by appointing loyal partisans to middle-management positions. The key question is then whether these loyalists also have the requisite qualifications and experience. As Marissa Golden argues, career bureaucrats -- those not appointed by the president -- are willing to work with political appointees, but the quality of the appointees matters. When presidents do appoint qualified people, some bureaucrats may leave because of ideological differences with their new boss, but not because of any deeply held concerns about the mission of the agency. But appointing less-qualified loyalists is a different matter. When presidents seek to politicize agencies via purely patronage appointments, agencies will suffer much more. Many career bureaucrats, believing that their efforts will be wasted under incompetent leadership pursuing objectionable goals, leave the agency for good. The challenge confronting Trump is that many qualified appointees -- such as Republicans who served under George W. Bush -- publicly opposed Trump during the election. As a result, Trump's transition team is having difficulty filling national security jobs. Similarly, careerists in the Education Department and the Justice Department, observing the published lists of possible Cabinet appointees, are considering leaving en masse. A week before the election, a survey of federal workers found that only 65 percent would commit to serving under a Trump administration. The actual number is likely to be higher, but empty posts in the bureaucracy are still a cause for concern. A large-scale exodus of career bureaucrats has serious consequences for policy outcomes. For example, according to work by Anthony Bertelli and David Lewis, the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Bush suffered from high turnover as a result of appointed executives and the inexperienced leadership of Michael Brown. In the months immediately before Hurricane Katrina in 2005, 17 of 46 FEMA policy positions were empty. Another example involves the CIA. In 2004, as David Lewis describes, the Bush administration and congressional Republicans viewed the CIA as ""dysfunctional"" and a ""rogue agency."" Bush appointed Porter Goss as CIA director with a clear mandate to hire loyal partisans to get the agency in line. Goss and his appointees told career CIA employees that they needed to support the administration and then froze out those who disagreed. Mass resignations quickly followed -- among them 20 top managers, including the director of central intelligence and the executive director. Bureaucratic agencies are pivotal actors in American policymaking. For his presidency to succeed, Trump's transition team must reach out to qualified public servants and forgo any desire for revenge. It needs to limit turnover of career bureaucrats as much as possible. If his administration fails at this, a wave of unqualified partisans entering the bureaucracy could damage some of our government's most resilient institutions.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)  I was on a panel on the election last night at UCLA, and one of the questions was about ""what to do now?"" As you might gather, the audience was likely overwhelmingly on the left, and to many students the question was ""How do we resist the Republican program?""; to some of the questioners and some of the panelists, it seemed to be ""How do we resist the awful people who support the Republican program?"" Though I voted against Trump, these are not generally my political allies. But I felt I had an obligation to the students to give them the best advice I could, since I'm a teacher at their institution. One of the students -- who I didn't know -- came up to me afterward and said that she thought the lawyer analogy I drew was helpful to her, which influenced me to write this up. Here's roughly what I came up with, and I think it might be useful for young conservatives and young libertarians as well as young liberals. (Some conservatives can be as good at deploring as some liberals, and some libertarians use their affection for both social and economic freedoms to deplore twice as much either the liberals or the conservatives.) * * * My advice: Stop deploring. Hillary Clinton's condemnation of half of Trump supporters as a ""basket of deplorables"" was a famous wrong move on her part (as Romney's 47 percent comment had been a wrong move on his). But it's important to think about why it's a bad approach: Why, even if some of your adversaries' views really are deplorable, thinking this way isn't useful. If you're trying to influence the public, think of yourself as a lawyer, and of voters as your judges and jurors. Except that there are no peremptory challenges or challenges for cause. You can't strike people because they're prejudiced, or because you think they are. You're stuck with them, and they'll be passing judgment on your client -- on your ideas and ideals that you are arguing for. Now what are you going to do? Good lawyers don't deplore their judges and jurors. Partly that's because they don't want to alienate the people who will be passing judgment on them. Deploring obviously turns off the deplored. But it's also because deploring blinds the deplorer. If you focus on how evil some of your judges are, you won't do a good job of figuring out how you can persuade them -- how you can find common ground, how you can fit your requests into their worldview. Good lawyering, like good politics, in large measure relies on empathy: The ability (which starts the willingness) to put yourself into the judge's and juror's shoes, to identify the arguments against you that they see as most compelling and to figure out how you can make your arguments compelling to people like them -- not to people like you, but to people like them, however benighted you might otherwise think they are. That's especially because giving in to the urge to deplore will systematically lead you to misjudge what really animates some of your judges and jurors. The most natural thing in the world is for us to assume the best motives on the part of our friends and to assume the worst motives on the part of our adversaries. Indeed, it's natural because it's often so emotionally rewarding. Sometimes we're right about the motives of some chunk of our adversaries. But often we're wrong. Focusing on how deplorable some judges' or jurors' views are will often lead us to misunderstand what really drives them, and how we can use that to lead them to our way of thinking (or at least our way of voting). Not all opponents of immigration, for instance -- or of illegal immigration -- are racists or xenophobes. Maybe even most of them aren't. But whether or not they are, deploring them won't help you persuade them to vote for your clients. Trying to empathize with them, on the other hand, might help. [To my conservative and libertarian friends (and to myself) I'd say a similar thing about opponents of conservative Christian influence on public life, or opponents of free markets, or opponents of gun rights or free speech on campuses or drug legalization.]"

"   Hillary Clinton embraces her running mate, Tim Kaine, during a news conference in New York on Wednesday. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)    Republicans know the debate all too well: Is the problem a bad candidate or an entrenched, outmoded approach to politics? Republicans wrestled with this after the 2012 election. Now it's the Democrats' turn. We begin with a cautionary (or consoling) note: In 2016, Democrats ran a very, very flawed candidate who nevertheless won the popular vote and (so far) 228 electoral votes. Now the splash of cold water on their faces: They've lost the House and Senate, 33 governorships (maybe ""just"" 32 if North Carolina's Democratic razor-thin victory holds up) and 69 of 99 state legislative chambers. That sounds like a more endemic problem. What did Democrats, or President Obama specifically, do wrong or miss? Maybe nothing. It's very hard for one party to win three presidential races in a row. A few thousand votes here or there, and Hillary Clinton would be president-elect. In a change election, the party that holds the White House is always in trouble. Well, maybe something. Obama's agenda had to be advanced by executive action (Iran deal, deferred deportation) and partisan margins (Obamacare). He thought he had moved the party and the country left. He hadn't, and when he tried to do so unilaterally, without popular consensus and bipartisan support, there was a backlash. It didn't help when he frequently accused opponents of ill will or set up straw men rather than acknowledging his opponents' real arguments. He preached to the choir but never persuaded half of the country of the merits of his agenda. He harped on extended coverage achieved under Obamacare but never took seriously the affordability complaints. Priorities. After the initial stimulus and health-care legislation passed, the president devoted much of his attention and political capital to issues such as climate change (at the expense of projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline and the coal industry), LBGT rights, the Iran deal and DREAMers. What's in there for the part of the country that went whole-hog for Donald Trump? Not much. There was no rural recovery initiative, massive worker-retraining surge or full-throated domestic energy initiative. Obama was unable to raise the minimum wage or expand the earned-income tax credit. In shrinking the military substantially, Obama sent thousands of our military men and women, disproportionately from red America, back to the private sector -- and afforded them rotten medical care from Veterans Affairs. When the opioid abuse issue came to the forefront, it was Congress that led the way. A regulatory war on the coal industry pleased environmentalists on the coasts but hurt the economic prospects of those in the middle of the country. Interestingly, GOP governors (in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and even Illinois) were laser-focused on many of these issues. They got credit and were rewarded with votes in both rural and urban areas. Cultural touchstones. The Democratic Party since the New Deal has always had to manage conflicting interests of its constituent groups (labor, minorities, rural poor, educated elites). The balancing act gets harder as America gets polarized and gaps in social class become chasms. Bill Clinton, because he grew up among them, never lost a cultural familiarity with small-town and rural Americans. The rest of the party? Not so much. As lawyers and college-educated professionals fill the ranks of the political class, they increasingly identify with secular, socially liberal, environmentally conscious elites. That leaves ""Trump's America"" feeling alienated, looked down upon and nostalgic for a sort of Disneyland Main Street America. So not only is the Democratic Party not doing much for them, but also too many Democratic pols don't seem to know or like them much anymore. Weak foreign policy. The United States is on defense around the world after a series of calamitous decisions and a good deal of reticence about advancing American interests. (Ironically, Trump would make things worse by deferring to Russia, but this is about raw emotion and not coherent policy.) Trump's voters see the United States losing influence in the Middle East, in Europe and Asia. (Again, ironically, our standing in Asia would get worse if the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a Trump bugaboo, gets killed.) Obama tells us we are overly sensitive about terrorism because we see so much of it on TV. For people who feel as though they have gotten short shrift, who see their immediate communities in decline, the sight of the United States in decline internationally is doubly galling. How do Democrats address their woes? We tend to think that deferring even more heavily to urban elites, going to the far-left on social, cultural and national security issues, will only worsen the problem. (Do Democrats really want to be running Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis types again?) Just as the right in the GOP thought doubling down on staunch conservatism after 2008 and 2012 was the way to go (at least Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas did), the Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wing of the Democratic Party will try to sharpen its ideological outlook and go to the far-left. That might work to a degree in the Democratic primary system. Ultimately, however, Americans demonstrate a steadfast aversion to ideological zealots, whether they are Cruz or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). It is a shame that Vice President Joe Biden didn't run for president. He adeptly bridges -- as Bill Clinton did -- the gap between Midwest factory worker and liberal millennial, between California environmentalist and coal-country retiree. The party will need to find leaders who can reach across the class and regional divides; maybe it did in recruiting Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.)  -- a religious Catholic, a progressive, a father of a Marine -- to run for vice president. (It's noteworthy that Kaine represents a state with both upscale northern D.C. suburbs and southwestern coal-country towns.) Democrats should also recognize that neither party operates in isolation. Trump will invariably disappoint his base, his sky-high expectations won't be met and economic ups and downs will test his slogan-driven politics. Providing an alternative agenda when the other side implodes is essential to a political comeback. Obama demolished the notion that a candidate for president had to have years and years of federal government experience; Trump demolished the notion that one needs any at all. That may free up the Democratic Party to find all sorts of people from the heartland, people who can connect without condescending, satisfy the Bernie Sanders flock and not scare off socially conservative moderates in swing states. If Warren Buffett were younger or Mark Cuban were interested, Democrats could go for the billionaire-outsider. Or maybe a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. If not, a more traditional pol from a state that is not the sole province of urban progressives (e.g. Kaine, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota) might be the best bet. A newer face, a native of ""flyover country"" and an agenda based on working-class families (of whatever race) might lead the party back to health. Given what occurred this time, no potential presidential candidate is too inexperienced. Next time, however, there should be no ethical baggage or sense of entitlement.  "

Trump's meeting with Obama spanned 90 minutes, longer than originally scheduled. Obama said he was ""encouraged"" by Trump's willingness to work with his team during the transition of power, and the Republican called the president a ""very good man.""  ""I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including his counsel,"" Trump said from the Oval Office. He'll begin occupying the office on Jan. 20. While Trump noted that he and Obama had never met before, their political histories will forever be linked. Trump spent years perpetrating the lie that Obama was born outside the United States. The president campaigned aggressively against Trump during the 2016 campaign, warning that his election would put the republic at risk. But at least publicly, the two men appeared to put aside their animosity. As the meeting concluded and journalists scrambled out of the Oval Office, Obama smiled at his successor and explained the unfolding scene.  ""We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed the country succeeds,"" Obama said. From the White House, Trump headed to Capitol Hill for meetings with House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to discuss the GOP legislative agenda. Ryan, who holds the most powerful post in Congress, was a sometime critic of Trump and never campaigned with the nominee. Emerging from the meetings, Trump sketched out priorities for his presidency.  ""We're going to move very strongly on immigration,"" he said. ""We will move very strongly on health care. And we're looking at jobs. Big league jobs."" Ryan took Trump on a tour of the Speaker's Balcony overlooking the National Mall, the scene of Trump's upcoming inauguration. The view, Trump said, was ""really, really beautiful."" Trump was also beginning the process of putting together his White House team. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who worked his way into Trump's inner circle during the election, and top campaign official Kellyanne Conway were emerging as possible picks for White House chief of staff, according to two people familiar with the transition planning. A third person said conservative media executive Steve Bannon was also in the mix, though others insisted Bannon would not have a White House role. Those involved in the process insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly. A decision on chief of staff is expected in the coming days. First lady Michelle Obama met privately in the White House residence with Trump's wife, Melania, while Vice President Joe Biden saw Vice President-elect Mike Pence late Thursday. Trump's team was said to be sketching a robust role for Pence, an experienced Washington hand, that would include both domestic and foreign policy responsibilities. Obama and Trump met alone, with no staff present, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters following the discussion.  ""The two men did not relitigate their differences in the Oval Office,"" Earnest said. ""We're on to the next phase."" Trump traveled to Washington from New York on his private jet, breaking with protocol by not bringing journalists in his motorcade or on his plane to document his historic visit to the White House. Trump was harshly critical of the media during his campaign and for a time banned news organizations whose coverage he disliked from his events. At the White House, Obama chief of staff Denis McDonough was seen walking along the South Lawn driveway with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. A handful of Trump aides trailed them. The show of civility at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue contrasted with postelection scenes of protests across a politically divided country. Demonstrators from New England to the heartland and the West Coast vented against the election winner on Wednesday, chanting ""Not my president,"" burning a papier-mache Trump head, beating a Trump pinata and carrying signs that said ""Impeach Trump."" More than 100 protesters held a sit-in outside Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House. The mostly student protesters held signs saying ""Love Trumps Hate,"" a phrase Democrat Hillary Clinton often used during the campaign. Trump's advisers, many of whom were stunned by his unexpected victory, plunged into the huge task of staffing government agencies. A transition website, GreatAgain.gov, referenced 4,000 political appointee openings. Officials at the Pentagon and State Department said they had not yet been contacted. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the agency stood ready ""to work with the incoming team once that team is designated and arrives here. But we don't have any firm word as to when that will be."" As president-elect, Trump is entitled to the same daily intelligence briefing as Obama -- including information on U.S. covert operations, information gleaned about world leaders and other data gathered by America's 17 intelligence agencies. The White House said it would organize two exercises involving multiple agencies to help Trump's team learn how to respond to major domestic incidents. ___ AP writers Erica Werner, Andrew Taylor, Julie Bykowicz, Steve Peoples, Matthew Lee and Robert Burns in Washington, and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Chris Christie based on what was revealed during the recently completed George Washington Bridge lane-closing trial in which two of his former aides were convicted. Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg said there was ""considerable testimony"" during the trial that Christie knew about the bridge conspiracy, in which, prosecutors say, three allies closed lanes near the bridge to create traffic headaches in Fort Lee to retaliate against its Democratic mayor for not endorsing him for re-election. The bridge, one of the world's busiest, connects Fort Lee and New York City. In a statement, Weinberg, who co-chaired a legislative committee that probed the lane-closing scandal in 2014, called on Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto to consider the impeachment.  ""The allegations of federal prosecutors and statements of witnesses who testified under oath cannot go unanswered and impeaching Chris Christie would bar him from further public service in this State,"" Weinberg wrote. Weinberg's request comes as Christie, who failed in a presidential bid this year, is deeply involved with Republican President-elect Donald Trump as the chair of his White House transition team. Prieto responded in a statement that the Assembly is ""weighing all potential legislative activity."" He said it was disappointing Weinberg made her request in a press release. Impeachment proceedings would begin in the Assembly, before being voted on in the Senate. A jury convicted Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, Christie's appointee to a top executive position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge, last week. Kelly and Baroni had denied the charges against them, saying that the government twisted federal law to turn their actions into crimes and that people with more power and influence were involved but weren't prosecuted. Christie has denied any knowledge of the lane closures until weeks or months after they occurred in September 2013. But Kelly, Baroni and a third former Christie ally, who testified against them, said under oath that Christie knew about the plan to close lanes either in advance or during the four days it was in progress. Kelly also testified she told Christie of the Fort Lee mayor's concerns about political retribution during the week of the closures. Christie is facing a criminal misconduct complaint filed last month by a resident who said that the governor ""knowingly refrained from ordering that his subordinates take all necessary action to re-open local access lanes"" and that residents were ""deprived the benefit and enjoyment of their community."" Last month a judge ruled the case can move forward, and a hearing is scheduled for this month. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Voters chose a 48-year-old, urbane, liberal black man, then a 70-year-old, unrepentantly coarse white man who is conservative, or something. Ain't that America? Change comes in all forms and with wrenching lurches in a nation founded by bloody revolt and enervated through the generations by political and cultural revolution, sometimes to the edge of bloodshed or over. There's no getting a grip on this country. The U.S. serves up in-your-face cowboy culture, in-your-face counterculture, aggressively faith-based political movements, electric Bernie Sanders socialism and lots more chances to smoke pot legally, as well as workaday lives and pinstriped suits. Americans vote for shake-up artists, not every time but enough times to set the country apart from democracies where the ship of state turns more slowly and majestically.  ""The path that this country has taken has never been a straight line,"" Obama said Wednesday. ""We zig and we zag."" Obama, the zig, was a guy so cool in the eyes of much of the world that he got a Nobel Peace Prize before he'd had a chance to do much. (At the time, in his first year, the U.S. was fighting two wars.) Trump, the zag, is a hurler of insults, a raw orator you can't turn away from if you can bring yourself to tune in, a boor with women, a peddler of falsehoods that made millions of eyes roll but spoke to a larger truth in the eyes of supporters. Foreigners shake their heads at a country that over the years defines cool, then represents what crazy looks like. Trump won with the backing of a long-prized, but declining, segment of white voters, especially men, especially less educated ones. They were on top of the political world for ages, part of Richard Nixon's Silent Majority, Reagan's haul of blue-collar Democrats and Bill Clinton's bubbas. Now they fade in an increasingly diverse country. But Tuesday, everything old was new again and they said: Yes, we still can. Obama came to national attention with a speech of poetry and power that dreamed of red states and blue states joined spiritually as united states. It took the breath away of some Republicans as well as many Democrats. It was a pipe dream, he admitted years later. Divisions of red and blue, white and black, young and old, coastal and heartland, are epic now -- tribal. Though polar opposites in character, politics and experience, Obama and Trump have some commonality. They both seized on dissatisfaction and rode the revolutionary impulse to success. Though not a neophyte like Trump, Obama had to claw against the establishment -- personified in 2008 by primary rival Hillary Clinton -- and benefited from that underdog posture. This time Democrats served up the establishment, in Clinton, the candidate who told snickering donors about the ""irredeemable"" ''deplorables"" backing Trump, and woke up Wednesday to devastation, if they ever slept. Obama and Trump tapped their different political tribes on the way to the White House, but with some overlap. In Ohio's Belmont County, which Obama won in 2008, Trump swept almost 70 percent of the votes. In nearby Mahoning County, which Obama won by 28 points in 2012, Clinton edged Trump by only three points. In other words, some people in working-class America who voted for Obama before turned to Trump this time. So, now, a nation that is pretty upbeat about the job the cool black president is doing hands the reins to a man who spun conspiracy theories about Obama's country of birth. They will be together on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, peacefully handing over power. It is usually a moment of grace and probably, somehow, will be that once more. Then it's on with the zigzag, a time to be certain of nothing except that revolution, from some quarter at some point, will come again. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
