The rally came three days after police named the Christian governor of Jakarta, the capital, as a suspect in a blasphemy investigation in a major test of the Muslim-majority nation's reputation for religious tolerance. Earlier this month, Jakarta was rocked by a massive protest by conservative Muslims against the popular governor, Basuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaja Purnama, with one person killed and dozens injured in rioting. Hard-liners have threatened more protests if Ahok isn't arrested. More than 10,000 people, including religious leaders, legislators and members of human rights groups, took part in Saturday's rally, which was centered at the National Monument, with many participants marching along nearby main streets.  ""We are gathering here not to protest but to show that we are not easily divided by religious or political issues,"" said Budiman Sujatmiko, a legislator from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, the country's largest political group. The crowd, many waving the red-and-white national flag, cheered and chanted, ""United Indonesia cannot not be defeated."" The Islamic Defenders Front, a vigilante group that wants to impose Shariah law in Indonesia, began demanding Ahok's arrest after a video circulated online in which he joked to an audience about a passage in the Quran that could be interpreted as prohibiting Muslims from accepting non-Muslims as leaders. The governor has apologized for the comment. Blasphemy is a criminal offense in Indonesia. Amnesty International documented 106 convictions between 2004 and 2014, with some individuals imprisoned for up to five years. Ahok is the second Christian governor of Jakarta since Indonesia declared independence in 1945, and the first ethnic Chinese to run the sprawling, chaotic city. He is popular with the city's middle class, but has made enemies from a tough stance against corruption and an urban program that has evicted thousands of the city's poorest from slums.

The 1,000-square-meter (1,077-square-foot) bunker with reinforced concrete walls up to 2.4 meters (8-feet) thick was built between 1981 and 1986 to shelter elite police and interior ministry staff in the event of a nuclear attack. The museum that opened in Tirana now holds photographs and equipment that illustrate the political persecution of some 100,000 Albanians from 1945 until 1991. The ""Pillar"" museum, as the nuclear bunker was codenamed, is one of several former hideouts the Albanian government has repurposed for the public since it came to power three years ago. Both an island fortress and another underground bunker designed for Albania's army command are now open to tourists, as is a leaf-covered villa that once housed the former communist country's secret police, known as Sigurimi. More may come from the scores of military installations erected during the paranoid, isolationist regime of the late dictator Enver Hoxha, who ruled with an iron fist after the end of World War II until December 1990. Hoxha's regime, with an imaginary fear of invasion by the ""imperialist United States and social-imperialist Soviet Union,"" built concrete bunkers of all sizes around the country. At one time there were rumored to be as many as 700,000, but the government says 175,000 were built. Prime Minister Edi Rama said the new museum reflects his Cabinet's ""will to pay back a debt to the memory of the former political persecuted, forgotten in the last 25 years."" Located downtown, it was designed to attract visitors from Albania and beyond ""to learn about the ways that the former communist police persecuted their opponents,"" curator Carlo Bollino said.  ""This is the first memorial for the victims of the communist terror,"" Bollino said. Twenty rooms in the new museum show Albania's police history from 1912 until 1991, as well as the names of 6,027 people executed during the communist regime, the 34,000 imprisoned and the more than 50,000 sent to isolated internment camps. The bunker was never used, ""though it has always been operational,"" according to Mehdi Sulo, 70, a museum guide. It also has been a focus of political demonstrations. In an anti-government rally a year ago, supporters of the main opposition Democratic Party destroyed part of a replica bunker built as the museum's entrance. They complained that Rama's governing Socialist Party was trying to glorify the country's dark past. The holes the demonstrators made in the entrance purposely were not repaired.  ""Bunkers once aimed at putting the enemy away, now they serve to attract people to remember the difficult past,"" Rama said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Before starting the job, Pompeo would have to be confirmed by the Senate. One issue that could dominate a confirmation hearing is Pompeo's views on using harsh interrogation techniques on detainees. Trump has backed these techniques, saying: ""We should go tougher than waterboarding,"" which simulates drowning. During the campaign, Trump suggested that he would push to change laws that prohibit waterboarding and other harsh techniques, saying that banning them puts the U.S. at a strategic disadvantage against Islamic State militants. Pompeo, 52, was elected to Congress during the tea party wave of 2010. He was appointed to the House Select Benghazi Committee to probe the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The panel's final report this summer sharply criticized the Obama administration for a series of mistakes but produced no new evidence pointing to wrongdoing by Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time. Pompeo and fellow Republican Jim Jordan of Ohio, however, issued a separate report slamming Clinton and the Obama administration. Pompeo told reporters that the former first lady and senator was ""morally reprehensible."" He also has been a fierce critic of Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, which granted Tehran sanctions relief for rolling back its nuclear weapons program. And he has said that Muslim leaders are ""potentially complicit"" in terrorist attacks if they do not denounce those made in the name of Islam.  ""They must cite the Koran as evidence that the murder of innocents is not permitted,"" he said in a 2013 House floor speech. A member of the House intelligence committee, Pompeo denounced Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who stole and leaked highly classified documents to journalists, revealing the NSA's bulk collection of millions of Americans' phone records. During an appearance on C-SPAN in February, Pompeo said Snowden should receive the death penalty for his actions.  ""He should be brought back from Russia and given due process and I think the proper outcome would be that he would be given a death sentence for having put friends of mine, friends of yours who serve in the military today at enormous risk because of the information he stole and then released to foreign powers,"" Pompeo said then. Despite their opposing views on many issues, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, congratulated Pompeo.  ""Mike is very bright and hard-working and will devote himself to helping the agency develop the best possible intelligence for policy makers,"" Schiff said. ""While we have had our share of strong differences -- principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi -- I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA director."" Pompeo was born in Orange, California, and lives in Wichita, Kansas. He enrolled as a teenager at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. and graduated first in his class in 1986. According to biographical information on his House web site, Pompeo served as a ""cavalry officer patrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Berlin Wall."" He is a graduate of Harvard Law School and was editor of the Harvard Law Review. After college, he set up Thayer Aerospace and was its chief executive officer for more than 10 years. Later he was president of Sentry International, a company that sold equipment for oil fields and manufacturing. He recently led a House Republican task force that found intelligence assessments approved by senior leaders at U.S. Central Command exaggerated the progress of anti-terrorism efforts they ran against IS militants. House GOP leaders formed the task force after lawmakers learned that an unnamed analyst assigned to the command had filed a formal complaint alleging that intelligence about the Islamic State group had been manipulated. Pompeo said in a statement this week that no one has ""yet been held responsible."" Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee conducted their own inquiry, which found problems but no evidence that intelligence had been politicized. A spokesman for CENTCOM had declined to comment further because the task force and inspector general inquiries are still proceeding. Pompeo has received more than $40,000 from the political action committee of Koch Industries, not including individual contributions from its employees, according to a review of federal campaign finance records. The firm is run by major political donors Charles and David Koch. He initially supported Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for the Republican nomination for president, but then promoted Trump's bid for the White House. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Gillum and Matthew Daly contributed to this report.

Lars Loekke Rasmussen said he had invited the center-right Liberal Alliance and the Conservative Party to join the Cabinet he formed after the June 28, 2015 election. He didn't call early elections. His Liberal Party holds 34 of Parliament's 179 seats and can only stay in power with support from the two small parties and the anti-immigration, populist Danish People's Party.  ""It will, of course, require that we all make compromises,"" Loekke Rasmussen said. ""A three-clover government will have many benefits."" Loekke Rasmussen said the leaders of the Liberal Alliance and Conservative parties were invited to talks starting Monday because the ruling party has more in common with them than with the Danish People's Party. Both party leaders have said they will attend. His move was seen as a way to pressure the Liberal Alliance to water down its demand to cut the top income tax rate by 5 percentage points. The party has threatened to bring down the government, if its demand is not met. If the pair joins, Loekke Rasmussen's government would still be shy of a 90-seat majority in Parliament require support from the Danish People's Party and its 37 seats. The party vehemently opposes tax cuts for the wealthy. Pundits say the reason the prime minister is not calling an election is recent opinion polls showing the left-leaning opposition bloc has a lead and could likely form a government Loekke Rasmussen's government has been behind tightening of Denmark's immigration law with the support of the opposition Social Democrats.

He is the first senator-elect to be tapped to head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.  ""The map is tough for Democrats, but I have no doubt that Senator-elect Van Hollen is up to the task,"" said New York Sen. Charles Schumer, who will become Senate Democratic Leader in January.

Haitian authorities acknowledge the timing isn't ideal, but say it's time for the drifting country to move forward.  ""The upcoming elections will be crucial for the democratic future of the country,"" Interim President Jocelerme Privert said in a national address this week. Sunday's voters will choose from among 27 candidates for president, with the top two finishers going to a Jan. 29 runoff. They will also be electing 16 senators and 25 members of the Chamber of Deputies. The electoral cycle began more than a year ago, but it's been repeatedly derailed. A first-round presidential vote held in October 2015 was annulled after a special commission found it appeared to be tainted by fraud. Privert, chosen by Parliament, remains in office even though his 120-day term ended in June amid posturing and delays by the deeply polarized country's political class. A redo vote was finally scheduled for early October. But that had to be scrapped when Hurricane Matthew devastated the country on Oct. 4. Since then, roughly 250 storm-damaged schools and other voting centers have been mended. In some places tents will serve as emergency election stations. The U.S. Embassy this week applauded ""significant steps"" taken by Haiti following Matthew to ensure that elections will be held. But the State Department still revised a travel alert, urging U.S. citizens in Haiti to exercise caution because ""tensions remain high."" Election officials are hoping to improve on the 26 percent turnout in the annulled round of voting last year, but they are battling election fatigue, voter disenchantment and obstacles facing residents in storm-ravaged areas.  ""We know that people in the south part of the country are very much concerned about their survival, about food, about shelter,"" said Rosny Desroches of the Haitian watchdog group Citizen Observatory for Institutionalizing Democracy. ""For some people elections might appear as a kind of secondary concern."" Some Haitians in the storm-impacted southwest say they resent being asked to vote as they struggle with basic necessities in Matthew's aftermath.  ""There are so many troubles. To me, it seems unfair to hold this vote now,"" said Mario Jean Michel, owner of a small hotel in the shattered city of Jeremie. But others say they're eager to get elections over with, hopeful a new administration will better their lives and improve relief efforts.  ""Everyone I know is ready to vote,"" said Walna Gevere from the southwest town of Anse d'Hainault. There's no clear front-runner in the crowded presidential field. Polls are contradictory and unreliable. Some analysts believe the top contenders are Jovenel Moise, the leading candidate in the annulled 2015 vote and the choice of ex-President Michel Martelly, and Jude Celestin, a former state construction chief who led an election boycott last year after finishing second. There have been fewer big rallies than during previous campaigns, and many of the election posters plastered around the crowded capital feature candidates who have long since dropped out. Still, there has been an uptick in inflammatory rhetoric. Ex-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, campaigning for the candidate of his Fanmi Lavalas party, recently called for ""dechoukaj"" -- Haiti's word for its own brand of mayhem -- if the vote is unfair. And complaints of rigged voting are common in Haitian politics.  ""Allegations of fraud are a strategy that politicians regularly use, even with nothing to show as proof,"" Uder Antoine, executive director of the electoral council, told The Associated Press. Thousands of U.N. police officers and peacekeeping troops will assist the nearly 9,500 members of Haiti's police force in maintaining election security. Major presidential candidates have used youth-friendly cellphone apps to promise a jobs bonanza in an attempt to rally enthusiasm among young people in a country where the median age is 22. Candidate Jean-Henry Ceant vows to create 100,000 jobs in 100 days. Lavalas hopeful Maryse Narcisse is promising a subway and cable car network in the capital's metropolitan area. Celestin says the economy will grow a whopping 12 percent in his final year in office. Specifics on how any of this would be accomplished are scarce.  ""Candidates are promising things that only God could deliver with a miracle,"" said 25-year-old student Edens Lanois Sincere, an aspiring economist. ___ David McFadden on Twitter: www.twitter.com/dmcfadd Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

As Thanksgiving approaches, Americans look back on the first English settlers in what is now New England. Since these Puritans fill the earliest chapters of the American story, they make plenty of appearances in our shared imagination. But debates over who the Puritans were, what they stood for and how they contributed to our sense of national identity are shrouded in misunderstandings. Here are a few.  Myth No. 1 The Puritans established a theocracy. As the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences puts it, ""With the Puritan migration to New England during the 1630s, theocratic governments were established."" And the Encyclopedia Britannica echoes the claim, stating that ""the Puritans established a theocratic government.""  It's not true. A theocracy is a government run by religious authorities claiming divine sanction for their political leadership. In 1631, the Massachusetts Bay Colony's governor, John Winthrop, expanded the franchise to all free adult males in the colony. These men voted for their representatives to the General Court (their legislature), who then voted for the governor and his council of assistants.  None of these elected officials were clergymen, because no minister was allowed to hold political office. Equally important, anyone holding political office who was censured or excommunicated by his church could not lose his office because of his religious difficulties. While it's true that the first generation of men were required to be full church members in order to vote or hold political office, that requirement was modified in 1658 and permanently retired in 1664. The Puritan government in Massachusetts did frequently seek the advice of its ministers, but it was under no obligation to take that advice, and it frequently did not.   Myth No. 2 Puritans had a special hatred of American Indians. The Puritans' supposed white-hot hatred of Indians is often invoked around Thanksgiving, as Americans reflect on the circumstances of our nation's founding. Many articles point to the slaughter of Pequot men, women and children at the tribe's village, near present-day Mystic, Conn., in 1637, during the Pequot War, as evidence of the special enmity between Puritans and Indians. Capt. John Underhill, a militia leader, described the carnage in that battle: ""Down fell men, women, and children. . . . Should not Christians have more mercy and compassion? Sometimes the Scripture declareth women and children must perish with their parents. . . . We had sufficient light from the word of God for our proceedings."" It's true that Puritans mistrusted Indians, deplored their religions as savagery and devil-worship, fought them, and enslaved them.  But this wasn't much different than the approach they had taken to different groups back in Europe, where some of them, like Underhill, fought in the Thirty Years' War, and many pressured King James I to send English troops to assist Protestant forces on the continent. The massacre at Mystic was quite similar to the scores of town-burnings in Europe during the Thirty Years' War: Twenty thousand were killed in the 1631 razing of Magdeburg, Germany, for instance. In November 1631, a visitor to another sacked village in Germany ""was appalled to find the vineyards and fields red with blood, with corpses scattered in bizarre positions over a three-mile radius."" If you had to choose a group the Puritans really had a special hatred for, it would be Catholics. (After that came splinter groups like Quakers and Anabaptists, and then anyone else who was not a Puritan.) In one regard, the Puritans cut Indians more slack than Catholics. They preferred to try to convert Indians first, believing that, unlike Catholics -- who had sworn loyalty to the pope and chosen to resist Protestantism -- the Indians couldn't be blamed for their heathenism. In parts of New England, Puritans and Indians lived in neighboring towns, did business with each other, sometimes worshipped together and had complex loyalties. This was evident during King Philip's War in 1676-1677, when some settlers refused to fight their Indian neighbors.  Myth No. 3 Puritans hated sex. In the Huffington Post, science writer Dan Agin described Puritans' ""dictatorial repression of daily life, mostly of sexual behavior."" Anya Taylor-Joy, star of the 2015 movie ""The Witch,"" said she learned from the film's script that ""everything about being a Puritan . . . seems to be going against what it means to be human."" Even the word ""puritanical"" is usually taken to mean sexless and joyless, as in a New York Times article chalking up American prudishness to Puritan roots.  What, then, are we to make of this letter from Winthrop, many times the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, to his fiancee, Margaret Tyndal? ""Being filled with the joy of thy love, and wanting opportunity of more familiar communion with thee, which my heart fervently desires, I am constrained to ease the burden of my mind by this poor help of my scribbling pen. . . . Love was their banqueting house, love was their wine, love was their ensign; love was his invitings, love was her faintings; love was his apples, love was her comforts, love was his embracings, love was her refreshing.""  The Puritans believed that the love between married people was the closest humans could get on Earth to experiencing the joy of being united with Christ in heaven. And love in marriage had no higher expression than sex. The Puritan minister at Cambridge, Mass., Thomas Shepard, often described the passion people felt in marriage in his sermons: ""In all marriage bonds there is a choice made, and, if love be great, there is little standing on terms -- let me have him though I beg with him.""  Myth No. 4 Puritans came to America to establish freedom of religion. It's hard to suppress disappointment with the Puritans when one reads that they ""pulled up the gangplank behind them"" once they arrived in America, as one author put it, not allowing Quakers and others to worship freely -- especially because many works of U.S. history, including the PBS documentary ""First Freedom,"" locate the origin of American views on freedom of religion with our earliest Puritan founders.  But the Puritans didn't leave England to found a society where all religions would be tolerated. After all, they were granted the pejorative moniker ""Puritan"" in England because of their efforts to purge Catholic influences from the Anglican Church. They sought religious freedom only for themselves.  In 17th-century Europe, every kingdom had an official religion, and the monarch was the head of the church. There were a few exceptions, but it was certainly the case in England, where King Charles I led the Anglican Church when the Puritans left for America. Since the Puritans wanted to change Anglican worship by, among other things, ridding priests of expensive robes, putting an end to kneeling for Communion and doing away with the Book of Common Prayer, they were persecuted for treason -- for challenging the king's authority to dictate forms of worship. So they went to America to create a political entity where their brand of ""reformed"" Anglicanism was the only religion. Myth No. 5 Puritans were relentless witch hunters. Because of the infamous Salem witch trials, in which 20 people accused of witchcraft were executed, the New England Puritans are often framed as a wildly superstitious and persecutory people with a special hysteria for sniffing out witchcraft. ""Witchcraft was portentous,"" Stacy Schiff wrote in her recent book on the Salem trials, ""a Puritan favorite.""  It's true that the Puritans believed in witchcraft, as did every society in Europe at the time. But they were not hysterical about it, and the number of witchcraft cases that made it to court is vanishingly small. From the first witchcraft trial in New England in 1638 to the last in 1697, excluding Salem, 65 people were tried, out of a population of tens of thousands. More than half were acquitted. Only 16 were executed. The Salem episode was the only time in Puritan New England's history that an actual panic developed over witchcraft. That's what makes Salem memorable: It was an anomaly.   outlook@washpost.com   Five myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

The group, which is supported by many civic organizations and opposition parties, has vowed to proceed with Saturday's rally in Kuala Lumpur despite a police ban and fears of clashes with a pro-government group. Bersih said on Twitter that its chairwoman Maria Chin and another official, Mandeep Singh, were taken by police. It said police also confiscated 10 laptop computers, payrolls and bank statements.  ""Despite the authorities' desperate measures to stop us, (the rally) will go on. See you on the streets tomorrow!"" the group tweeted. Lawyer Melissa Sasidaran said Chin was being held for ""activities detrimental to parliamentary democracy"" and Singh for alleged rioting. She said a student leader and three politicians had also been detained. Police officials could not be reached for comment. Najib has kept an iron grip since graft allegations emerged two years ago involving the indebted 1MDB state fund that he founded. 1MDB is at the center of investigations in the U.S. and several other countries. A rally that Bersih organized in August 2015 also demanding Najib's resignation brought together 50,000 people, according to police estimates. Bersih said the number was much higher. Najib, who has denied any wrongdoing, has said he won't be cowed by the rallies. In a statement on his Facebook page and blog, Najib called Bersih ""deceitful"" and said it has become a tool for opposition parties to unseat a democratically elected government. A ruling party politician, Jamal Mohamad Yunos, plans to lead a counter rally in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, prompting fears of a clash between his group, dubbed the ""Red Shirts,"" and Bersih's ""Yellow Shirt"" supporters. Police have banned both rallies and the government has warned that police will act against any participants. The human rights group Amnesty International called for the immediate release of the Bersih activists, describing them as prisoners of conscience.  ""These arrests are the latest in a series of crude and heavy-handed attempts to intimidate Malaysian civil society activists and other human rights defenders,"" the group's deputy director for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, Josef Benedict, said in a statement. The investigations into 1MDB fund are centered on allegations of a global embezzlement and money-laundering scheme. Najib started the fund shortly after taking office in 2009 to promote economic development projects, but the fund accumulated billions in debt over the years. The U.S. Justice Department said that at least $3.5 billion had been stolen from 1MDB by people close to Najib and initiated action in July to seize $1.3 billion it said was taken from the fund to buy assets in the U.S. The U.S. government complaints also said that more than $700 million had landed in the accounts of ""Malaysian Official 1."" They did not name the official, but appear to be referring to Najib. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Judge Ei Thavrak of Phnom Penh Municipal Court found Senator Thak Lany of the Cambodia National Rescue Party guilty of defamation and inciting chaos. Thak Lany has been abroad and did not appear at the trial. Her conviction is the latest in a series of legal cases against opposition leaders in what is generally seen as an attempt to disrupt their organizing efforts ahead of local elections next June. Opposition leader Sam Rainsy has remained abroad after a defamation conviction against him was reinstated last year, and his deputy is taking refuge at party headquarters from legal problems. Prime Minister Hun Sen filed a lawsuit in August in response to a July speech by Thak Lany to her supporters in northeastern Ratanakkiri province in which she allegedly accused Hun Sen of ordering the murder of political analyst Kem Ley. The senator has said that a recording of her speech was edited to incriminate her. The fatal shooting of Kem Ley in the middle of the Cambodian capital raised suspicions of a political conspiracy, though police said the accused attacker confessed to shooting him because of an unpaid debt. Tens of thousands of Cambodians marched in his funeral procession. The judge ordered Thak Lany to pay an 8 million riel ($2,000) fine to the state and pay 100 riel (25 cents) in compensation that Hun Sen had demanded. The verdict also ordered authorities to find Thak Lany so she could be jailed. Hun Sen filed the same charges against Sam Rainsy for remarks he posted on Facebook linking the authorities to the killing of Kem Ley, but his trial has not yet been scheduled. Sam Rainsy is the most prominent target of Hun Sen's government, and has been in exile since last November to avoid a jail term on a conviction that he had thought was covered by a royal pardon. There are several other cases pending against him, at least two involving online postings. The government this month banned his re-entry from abroad, making it more difficult for him to fight the charges even if he wishes to return. Last week, Sam Rainsy was found guilty of defamation for alleging that a senior government official sought to inflate Prime Minister Hun Sen's online popularity by buying ""likes"" for his Facebook page. The court ordered Sam Rainsy to pay a fine of 10 million riel ($2,500) in addition to 15 million riel ($3,750) in compensation to Sam Soeun, a senior official assigned to oversee Hun Sen's Facebook page.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)  One of the fun things about a surprising political event is watching the reaction of writers with predetermined axes to grind. Don't get me wrong, all of us have our pet arguments and theories. The most devoted pundits, however, figure out how to graft their favorite arguments onto an explanation for What Just Happened. Donald Trump's solid victory in the electoral college certainly qualifies as a surprising political event. Indeed, the fact that it was surprising forms the core of political philosophy professor Jason Blakely's latest article in the Atlantic, titled ""Is Political Science This Year's Election Casualty?"" Blakely clearly believes that the answer is yes: ""Election forecasting is part of a wider trend in higher education to present the study of politics as a 'science.' But on November 8, 2016, the science of politics was almost uniformly and spectacularly wrong."" We'll revisit the claims in that sentence in a second, but for now, let's ask what Blakely thinks political scientists will and should do in the wake of this alleged epic fail:  Inevitably, higher education and the mainstream in political science will follow the same line of self-criticism. And no one would be surprised if the American Political Science Association (a more-than 13,000-member association of professional, academic political scientists) invites Nate Cohn, Nate Silver, or Sam Wang to a panel discussion next summer to argue about how to make a model and tweak technical differences. Yet when this happens, the larger philosophical questions -- about whether the study of politics is indeed a science -- will go unasked, and Americans will have missed a massive opportunity at self-correction in academia, the media, and society at large. ... Humanists across the social sciences, history, literature, and legal studies have argued for decades that politics is not a science but one of the humanities. In the view of humanists like myself, political knowledge is much closer to history than to physics or biology. The reason for this, as the philosopher Charles Taylor famously put it, is because human beings are ""self-interpreting animals."" That is, humans are creative agents whose beliefs are held for contingent reasons that can always change, and therefore not susceptible to the causal predictions of the natural sciences. This means demographics, economy, voting history, and the other classifications that political scientists and statistics gurus use to scientifically model predictions are never destiny for human beings. So, in other words, the author of a book about Charles Taylor thinks political scientists need to listen more to Charles Taylor. Now as someone who has noted this election cycle that political science theories can be self-refuting, I'm not completely unsympathetic to Blakely's plea for attention to the discipline's humanities side. But his entire argument rests on the belief that political science got it wrong in 2016. Let's revisit that assumption. Most election prediction models in political science rest on a few core variables: economic indicators, the number of terms the incumbent party has been in power, etc. In August, Vox's Dylan Matthews reported on what those models predicted for 2016:  Jacob Montgomery of Washington University in St. Louis and Texas A&M's Florian Hollenbach combined six such models into an ""ensemble model"" that blends them together based on historical accuracy. The forecast projected that Republicans would get 50.9 percent of the two-party vote and Democrats would receive 49.1 percent of the vote. As with any model, there's a margin of error (the 95 percent confidence interval is from 43.61 percent of the vote for Democrats to 53.44 percent), but the point estimate was a GOP victory. But this is a so-called ""fundamentals model"": It isn't based on specific knowledge of the two nominees or what kinds of campaigns they're running or how they're polling each day. Instead, it relies more heavily on data that's been predictive across past elections: the state of the economy, President Obama's approval rating, the fact that Democrats are seeking a third term in the White House, and more.  Now the point of Matthews's essay was that Trump was underperforming those models in the polling. Indeed, Emory political science professor Alan Abramowitz, whose model had the best track recorded, disavowed it back in June because he thought Trump was such an ""out-of-bounds"" candidate. As it turns out, Abramowitz wasn't entirely wrong. Trump did underperform the political science models, all of which focus on the popular vote. As of right now (votes are still being counted), Trump received 49.6 percent of the popular vote and Hillary Clinton received 50.4 percent. So, in the end, the political science models were off by a whopping percentage point in their collective prediction, in that they overestimated Trump's voting share. Still, as Vox's Andrew Prokop noted last week, ""these fundamental factors all pointed to a very close race that could conceivably go either way."" Now if you read Blakely's essay, you quickly realize his ire is focused on the use of polling as a predictor for the election. Even here, however, the average of the national polls showed a narrow Clinton victory in the popular vote. Which is what happened. As RealClearPolitics' Sean Trende -- whose analysis of this election cycle has been stellar -- notes: In fact, despite the hue and cry, the national polls were actually a touch better in 2016 than in 2012. Four years ago, the final RCP National Average gave President Obama a 0.7-point lead; he won by 3.9 points, for an error of 3.2 points. The final RCP Four-Way National Poll Average showed Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote by 3.3 points. She will probably win the popular vote by a point or so, which would equate to an error of around two points. ... What occurred wasn't a failure of the polls. As with Brexit, it was a failure of punditry.  Pundits saw Clinton with a 1.9 percent lead in Pennsylvania and assumed she would win. The correct interpretation was that, if Clinton's actual vote share were just one point lower and Trump's just one point higher, Trump would be tied or even a bit ahead. So, in other words, if pundits had paid closer attention to the polling and the political science, they would have done better. The 2016 election was unusual in many ways, but in terms of predicting the outcome, this was the way in which it was particularly unusual:   The spread between the Electoral College and the popular vote was the widest since 1948. pic.twitter.com/BbvmvFy2lC -- Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 14, 2016   This gap absolutely merits further analysis. If there's a failing in political science models, it's that this is the second time in the past five presidential election cycles that the popular vote and the electoral college don't match up. The implicit assumption in the political science models is that those two should correlate almost perfectly. Clearly, they might not. Given his ax, Blakely wants to be angry at political science. The problem is that he's actually angry at the prediction sites such as the Upshot and the Princeton Election Consortium that radically underestimated Trump's chances of victory. Given the outcome, those are fair targets. But they're not political science targets. Blakely needs better aim with his ax."
