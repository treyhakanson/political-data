Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said last week he had a warm and ""very frank"" 15-minute discussion with Trump within hours of the Republican nominee claiming victory in the presidential election. The U.S.-based Australian golfer confirmed he gave Trump's number to Australia's ambassador to the U.S., Joe Hockey, after the election.  ""It was a pleasure and an honor to facilitate the connection between P.M. Turnbull and President-elect Trump at the request of Ambassador Hockey,"" Norman said in a statement.  ""I have great respect for both men who have been voted in by the people of their respective countries and I am fortunate enough to call Mr. Trump a friend, so I was happy to put them in touch to further the incredible long-standing relationship the two countries have experienced,"" he said. Turnbull described Norman as ""a great advocate for strengthening the Australian-American alliance."" Turnbull declined to explain why Australia did not have Trump's number before the election or say whether he had thought Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton would win.  ""In diplomacy and politics, you use lots of networks and all I can say is we have great networks, great connections and Greg Norman is a great Australian,"" Turnbull told reporters. Turnbull was the second world leader to call to congratulate the president-elect, Sydney's The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported. Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has said Trump told him that he was the first world leader to get through. The New York Times reported Tuesday that prominent U.S. allies were scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Trump in a sign that his transition was in disarray. At times, leaders had been patched through to Trump in his office block with little warning, an unnamed Western diplomat told the newspaper. But Trump tweeted on Wednesday: ""I have recieved (sic) and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them."" Trump's staff have broken from tradition by failing to acknowledge phone calls or other contact with world leaders. Norman wrote in a Newsweek opinion piece published Tuesday that he had spoken to Trump ""on numerous occasions since the election and I think he will surprise many with what he will do with the presidency"" with the help of a quality cabinet.  ""I have spoken to the prime minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, and he is onboard with wanting to see President-elect Trump succeed,"" Norman wrote. Norman and Turnbull dined at Hockey's Washington residence on Sept. 23. Norman posted a photograph on his Instagram account of himself with Turnbull on that occasion.

PAUL, Minn. -- The Latest on the investigation into the fatal shooting of Philando Castile, a black man, by a Minnesota police officer (all times local): 6:30 p.m. Protesters who gathered at the school where the victim of a Minnesota police shooting worked say they will keep calling for justice until there's a conviction in the case. The rally came after St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez was charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of 32-year-old Philando Castile, a black man who was fatally shot July 6 in suburban St. Paul. About 50 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read ""No Justice, No Peace"" and ""Black Lives Matter."" Activist Loretta VanPelt told the group that they won a battle, but not the war. Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said she believes Yanez should face a stiffer charge, such as murder. ___ 4:50 p.m. The head of a police union representing a Minnesota officer facing charges in the shooting death of a black motorist is asking residents to withhold their judgment. County prosecutors charged St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez with second-degree manslaughter Wednesday. Yanez shot and killed 32-year-old Philando Castile during a July 6 traffic stop in a suburb of St. Paul. Sean Gormley is executive director of Law Enforcement Labor Services, Minnesota's largest police union. He says Yanez is innocent until proven guilty. Community activists had awaited the decision regarding Castile's killing for months and urged prosecutors to charge Yanez. ___ 4:15 p.m. The girlfriend of a black Minnesota man killed during a traffic stop says she's saddened and relieved the officer who shot him has been charged. County prosecutors charged St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez with second-degree manslaughter in the death of 32-year-old Philando Castile. Castile was fatally shot July 6 in suburban St. Paul. Diamond Reynolds and her daughter, who was 4 at the time, were in the car during the fatal stop. She credits her decision to stream the shooting's aftermath live on Facebook as a factor in the officer being charged Wednesday. Reynolds says she's grateful Yanez was charged but had hoped for more severe charges. She says she misses her boyfriend. ___ 3:45 p.m. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton says the announcement of charges against a suburban St. Paul police officer who killed a black man during a traffic stop in July is an ""important step"" toward determining justice. Dayton released a statement commending prosecutors for their careful review of the killing of 32-year-old Philando Castile. Prosecutors charged St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez with manslaughter Wednesday for the July 6 shooting. Dayton says now the judicial process must resolve the proper outcome. The shooting's aftermath was streamed live on Facebook by Castile's girlfriend, who was in the car with Castile and her young daughter. At the time, Dayton said he didn't think the officer would have shot Castile if Castile was white and not black. ___ 1:50 p.m. Family members of a Minnesota man fatally shot by a police officer in a traffic stop in July says they are pleased that the officer has been charged with manslaughter. Valerie Castile is the mother of Philando Castile, a black man who was 32 when he was shot after his car was pulled over in a St. Paul suburb. Castile says the charge against officer Jeronimo Yanez is the strongest the family could have hoped for under Minnesota law. A prosecutor said Wednesday in filing the charge that Yanez wasn't justified in using deadly force. Glenda Hatchett, an attorney for the family, called the charge ""an important signal to this nation."" ___ 1 p.m. A Minnesota police officer charged with manslaughter in the shooting death of Philando Castile told his partner shortly before pulling the black motorist over that he looked like a suspect in a convenience store robbery. But a criminal complaint says an investigation has ruled out the 32-year-old Castile as a suspect in that robbery. Other details in the complaint include a report that one of seven bullets fired by Officer Jeronimo Yanez struck the back seat where the young daughter of Castile's girlfriend was sitting. Another struck the armrest between Castile and his girlfriend. Yanez was charged with two felony counts for recklessly firing his weapon. ___ 11:45 a.m. A prosecutor says the Minnesota police officer charged in the shooting death of a black man hasn't been arrested but has agreed to turn himself in. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi says he expects St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez to make his first court appearance Friday on a charge of second-degree manslaughter in the death of Philando Castile. In announcing the charges Wednesday, Choi said Yanez was not justified in using deadly force against the 32-year-old Castile during a traffic stop in suburban St. Paul on July 6. Yanez is Latino. ___ 11:30 a.m. A Minnesota prosecutor says evidence shows Philando Castile, a black motorist, complied with a police officer and told him he was carrying a gun in the critical moments before he was shot to death. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said Wednesday that when Castile's body was pulled from the car, his .40-caliber handgun was deep in a front pocket of his shorts. Officer Jeronimo Yanez pulled Castile over in a St. Paul suburb July 6. Choi says evidence including squad car video shows that when Yanez approached the car, Castile calmly told him he was carrying a gun. Choi says the officer told Castile not to pull it out, and Castile and his girlfriend both responded that he wasn't. Choi says the officer then screamed, pulled his gun and fired seven shots. Choi announced second-degree manslaughter charges against Yanez on Wednesday. ___ 11:05 a.m. A Minnesota prosecutor says the police officer who shot and killed a black motorist in suburban St. Paul in July had no good reason to use deadly force. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi announced Wednesday that he is filing second-degree manslaughter charges against St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez. Yanez shot and killed 32-year-old Philando Castile on July 6 during a traffic stop. The shooting's aftermath was streamed live on Facebook by Castile's girlfriend, who was in the car with him. Choi says Castile had informed Yanez when the officer approached the car that he had a handgun. But Choi says evidence shows that Castile never removed or tried to remove the gun from his right pocket. Choi says unreasonable fear on the part of a police officer cannot justify the use of deadly force. ___ 10:40 a.m. A Minnesota police officer has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of a black man in a St. Paul suburb. Prosecutors announced the charge against St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez on Wednesday. Yanez fatally shot 32-year-old Philando Castile during a July 6 traffic stop in Falcon Heights. The shooting's gruesome aftermath was streamed live on Facebook by Castile's girlfriend, who was with him. She said Castile was shot while reaching for his ID after telling Yanez he had a gun permit and was armed. Yanez is Latino. Castile was black. Family members claim Castile was racially profiled. Yanez's attorney has said the officer made the stop because Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect, and Yanez reacted to the presence of a gun. ___ 9:10 a.m. Authorities are planning to provide an update about their investigation into the killing of a black man who was shot by a Minnesota police officer. Prosecutors have been considering charges against St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez. They are planning to provide an update Wednesday morning. Yanez fatally shot 32-year-old Philando Castile during a July 6 traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights. The shooting's gruesome aftermath was streamed live on Facebook by Castile's girlfriend. She said Castile was shot while reaching for his ID after telling Yanez he had a gun permit and was armed. The announcement comes a day after the one-year anniversary of another high-profile police killing in Minnesota. Jamar Clark was killed in Minneapolis last year. No charges were filed in that case.

Getting Clinton and Trump voters talking is one way to heal.	"   Hillary Clinton supporters in New York react as the Election Day results become clear.  (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)  As 29-year-old Harvard Business School student Henry Tsai struggled to process Hillary Clinton's loss in the presidential election last week, he realized he would never understand it without the perspective of a Donald Trump voter. The problem was that he didn't know anyone who voted for Trump. It is perhaps one of the most salient lessons of this norm-defying election cycle: Americans are so deeply entrenched in their societal enclaves that they don't listen to opposing views. Often it is because they have no exposure to them in the first place. For Tsai, who received his undergraduate degree at Stanford and worked for several years in Silicon Valley, his social network -- while diverse in race, gender, sexual orientation and ethnicity -- was more siloed than he thought. Just two days after the election, after the candidate he supported lost, he sought to change that. His goal was to facilitate dialogue between supporters of Clinton and those of her GOP rival, Donald Trump. At first, he simply created a Google Document sign-up form and shared it with his Facebook friends, asking if they would like to be matched with someone who voted differently. He called it, ""Hi From the Other Side."" By Sunday night, he'd received 1,300 messages and counting from people eager to connect -- many from people he didn't know. Most are Clinton supporters, but Tsai said that's simply a reflection of his network. He intends to reach out directly to Republican groups to even out the mix. He spruced up the sign-in page over the weekend. It now has the look of a more professional website. He also created a how-to guide so that, when matched, people can productively communicate their ideas and beliefs. ""It's easy to demonize people on the other side, and I think it is an issue and it seems like we talk past each other and there's almost this sort of dismissiveness that there's no way the other side can be right,"" Tsai said in an interview. ""It's something I'm trying to work on in my personal life. I don't have to agree with it, but it seems only fair that I take a moment to understand.""   [What is this election missing? Empathy for Trump voters.]   These efforts to reach out in ways big and small are happening all over the country. They're showing up in Facebook posts and among colleagues. It was the central message encouraged by Clinton, Trump and President Obama in the hours after the election. They called for unity and inclusiveness, and asked Americans to give the other side a chance. It's not always a comfortable thing to do, said Carolyn Lukensmeyer, executive director of the National Institute for Civil Discourse, an initiative created by the University of Arizona as a response to the attempted assassination of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). Lukensmeyer and her team have worked for the past five years on strategies that encourage elected officials and the public to engage in meaningful ways that move beyond partisanship. After this especially bitter election, their work seems more important than ever, she said. It starts, she said, with having what her organization calls ""the unlikely conversation."" ""How could you look in the mirror and ask, 'Who did I close out and who do I want to experience having a friendly conversation [with] again?'"" Lukenmeyer said. ""One of the principles is to really listen to understand. Make no attempt to challenge their position, you have to listen until you understand that position and something happens when two people go through that process."" What happens, she said, is that people start seeing one another not as adversaries, but as humans. That's not to suggest people can't challenge opposing views, but she suggested that given how far apart Americans are right now the first step needs to be to ""really listen to one another and hear one another's positions"" because only then will there be an opening to find potential inroads. It won't happen overnight, she said. The wounds from this campaign are deep, and some people may not be ready to have that conversation yet. There are Clinton supporters in major cities protesting a Trump presidency. Some Trump supporters have engaged in hate crimes. No one is suggesting that those actions be ignored or that either side alone is responsible for reaching out. But there is a legitimate reason many Trump voters thought the system no longer worked for them and there's very good reason why Clinton voters are scared of what's to come. Still, both Tsai and Lukenmeyer said they were heartened by the overwhelmingly positive response from those who now, or eventually, want to try. ""I'm past my [anger] and grief stage and now just want to listen and understand,"" said one message Tsai received. ""I know I made a lot of mistakes prior to [the] election in stereotyping and generalizing the opposing side and I want to make amends for that. The only way forward is for each side to empathize with the other and find the common ground."" Understanding the emotional and ideological motivations for how someone voted will be an essential part of moving forward as a nation, but coming together can also be done sans politics. For weeks leading up to the election, Brandon Ryff's dental practice in Scottsdale, Ariz., could have been a test case for the nation. His 11 employees were almost equally divided between Trump and Clinton, and the tension in the office was impossible to ignore. Many of them had worked together for years, some decades, and now they felt as though they didn't know one another at all. ""It never really got nasty because they respect each other, but you could tell they would get annoyed, that it was frustrating that this person doesn't see this the way I see things,"" Ryff said. ""It was very tense, you could feel the tension."" The day after the election, Ryff, 31, said it felt even more heightened at work. His Trump-supporting employees seemed to be walking on eggshells, and the Clinton voters were expressing disbelief and anger. It made Ryff think about a Pedigree dog food commercial he had seen recently. It showed a woman with a lost dog ask for help with finding its owner at a Trump rally while wearing a Clinton shirt and then at a Clinton rally while wearing a Trump one. People at both events were kind to her. The message was simple: Beyond our political differences, there is a lot that unites us, such as a love for dogs:    So, in that spirit, Ryff announced a work unity lunch Thursday afternoon. He brought in sandwiches for the staff and they gathered for a meal together. Not as Democrats and Republicans, but as co-workers and as friends. ""Once we all sat down we weren't talking politics, we were just being people,"" he said. ""What I can remember was incessant laughter, how can all these people with opposing views be laughing at the same thing if we're all so different?""

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts  Depending on when Election Day and Inauguration fall, a president has from 72 to 75 days for transition. As of Monday,  Donald J. Trump has 66. In this compressed period, President-elect Trump must set up a new government and hire about 4,000 people to run it. The transition will bring plenty of other demands: Phone calls to thank donors, congratulatory phone calls from foreign leaders, members of Congress and other supporters. Daily intelligence briefings. Formal political functions. Personnel announcements. Communications with foreign dignitaries. Rest and relaxation. Modern presidents from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama have allocated their time differently to these matters, reflecting their personal styles and priorities. Reagan, for example, retreated to California for much of his transition, splitting his time between Los Angeles and his ranch near Santa Barbara. He held few press conferences. Bill Clinton did intensive public outreach through summits.    How four former presidents allocated their transition time (Source: Partnership for Public Service)  These details come from the Presidential Transition Guide produced by the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service, which began meeting over the summer with the Trump and Hillary Clinton campaigns to prepare for a transfer of power when Obama leaves office. Obama took an extended vacation to Hawaii and stayed away from Washington until his inauguration, except for an initial White House meeting. George W. Bush, whose official transition was delayed by the recount and litigation of his race with Al Gore, flew members of Congress and other leaders to his Texas ranch for meetings. Clinton made speeches and spoke to the media during his transition. Bush tended toward photo-ops, while Obama relied on web videos to announce policy.    Source: Partnership for Public Service     Source: Partnership for Public Service  And of the four presidents, Obama took the most vacation time during his transition, while Reagan had the most ""weekend and personal time,"" the transition guide says.    How four former presidents allocated their transition time. (Source: The Partnership for Public Service)  How will Trump do it? Judging by the last week, he may spend most of his time at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where he has just formalized his transition team and is developing a short list for cabinet secretaries. Lower-level political appointments are being handed by the transition team at the Washington headquarters of the General Services Administration, 1800 F Street. Trump has not said publicly how often he plans to come to Washington or if he will meet with prospective nominees at one of his golf courses in Florida and New Jersey or at his townhouse apartment in Manhattan. He may take some days off at one of these golf courses too. Our colleague Marc Fisher, co-author with Michael Kranish of Trump Revealed: An American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money and Power, gave us some clues to how Trump might spend his time and how he might start the business of governing.    How four former presidents allocated their transition time (Source: Partnership for Public Service)  Trump mainly works. He rarely sleeps, as little as two-to-four hours a night. He watches enormous amounts of television all through the night. He's a homebody who rarely leaves Trump Tower or Mar-A-Lago, his Florida retreat. He does occasionally golf with business associates or other celebrities, but has done little of that over the course of the campaign. He spends a lot of time on the phone, and surely is doing a vast amount of that. He could, in keeping with his pattern on the campaign trail, do rally-style events before his inauguration. He's not likely to spend a lot of time in meetings. There's also the question of whether Trump extends an olive branch to Hillary Clinton, and whether she accepts. The president-elect traditionally meets with his defeated opponent to show ""goodwill toward political adversaries,"" the guide says, and look for areas of common ground. This happened for Obama and rival Sen. John McCain after Obama's victory in 2008, about two weeks after the election. McCain flew to the Obama transition office in Chicago.Following the meeting, the men issued a joint statement: ""We hope to work together in the days and months ahead on critical challenges like solving our financial crisis, creating a new energy economy, and protecting our nation's security."""

Now President Barack Obama must use his last major trip abroad to try to calm shocked world leaders about the outcome of the U.S. election, and what comes next when Donald Trump is president. Trump's unforeseen victory has triggered pangs of uncertainty at home and grave concerns around the world. Though Obama has urged unity and said the U.S. must root for Trump's success, his trip to Greece, Germany and Peru forces him to confront global concerns about the future of America's leadership.  ""In some ways, there's nothing to say,"" said Heather Conley, a Europe scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Conley said Obama's trip, planned when it seemed certain Hillary Clinton would win, had been designed to reassure the world that the U.S. had regained its footing after a toxic campaign that unnerved foreign capitals. ""Now the president has the unenviable task of telling his counterparts and explaining what Europeans are now coining 'the Trump effect,'"" Conley said. For months, Obama lent credence to those concerns as he urged Americans to reject Trump. Standing alongside Singapore's prime minister in August, Obama said Trump was ""woefully unprepared"" because he lacked ""basic knowledge"" about critical issues in Europe, Asia and the Mideast. And during a visit to Japan, Obama said he wasn't the only world leader worried about Trump.  ""They're rattled by him, and for good reason,"" Obama said in May. ""Because a lot of the proposals that he's made display either ignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous, and what's required to keep the world on an even keel."" Now, Obama must pivot and reassure the U.S. and other countries that somehow, it will all be OK. Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said the president fully expects Trump's election to be a dominant theme of the trip, but would emphasize his plans to keep carrying out his approach until Trump takes over. He said Obama would argue that basic U.S. principles like honoring treaty commitments have historically survived even the most dramatic changes of administrations.  ""He'll want to use these conversations with leaders to express that view that given all the important issues that we face, no matter what our preferred choice may have been in the election, right now we as Americans have a stake in seeing this next administration succeed,"" Rhodes said. Obama departs Monday on the six-day trip, stopping first in Athens, where he'll tour the Parthenon, meet with the prime minister, and give a speech about democracy and globalization that will take on new relevance in light of Trump's election. He'll use his visit to Berlin to show gratitude to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, his closest foreign partner, and to meet with key European leaders. In Peru, he'll attend a major Asian economic summit in Lima, and also meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Australian Prime Minster Malcolm Turnbull. For the most part, foreign leaders have politely if cautiously congratulated Trump on his victory, in public statements and phone calls. A few have been more effusive, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose perceived sympathies for Trump became an election issue and who now says he wants to fully restore U.S. relations under President Trump. In Europe, where Obama has sought unity with allies to counter Russia's growing influence, NATO members are alarmed by Trump's suggestions that the U.S. might pull out of the alliance if other countries don't pay more. Many of the same nations are wrestling with whether last year's historic climate change deal can be salvaged after Trump's threats to pull the U.S. out. Conversely, Trump's ""America first"" motto has resonated deeply with nationalists and skeptics of globalization who see Trump as a kindred spirit. After all, it was Trump who dubbed himself ""Mr. Brexit"" after the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. America's Mideast allies are unsure what Trump's victory means for the nuclear deal with Iran, a foe of U.S. partners Saudi Arabia and Israel, considering Trump's repeated but vague pledges to renegotiate that deal. And misgivings about Trump will certainly follow Obama to Latin America, where Trump has turned off many with his hard-line immigration stance and description of Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. Asian leaders who painstakingly negotiated a landmark free trade deal with the U.S. are swallowing the reality that Congress will not approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership any time soon. Obama planned to meet with TPP country leaders Peru, but the White House acknowledged the deal is all but dead because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has ruled out a vote on it before Trump takes office. Trump is vehemently opposed to TPP and similar deals. That could benefit China, which is eager to fill any void in regional leadership left by a U.S. withdrawal and has its own competing free trade scheme. Yet Beijing has reason to be wary, too: Trump has threatened a trade war with China and vowed to go after the Asian powerhouse for what he deems currency manipulation. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP.

For starters, a battle for the soul of their party.	" Amid the wreckage of Hillary Clinton's loss, Democrats have started jockeying for control of the national party -- and vigorously debating a dramatic course correction in response to Donald Trump's election. The upcoming choice of a new Democratic National Committee chairman could become an early proxy fight between the establishment wing of the party, embodied by Clinton, and the party's more liberal members, many of them aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the party's runner-up in the Democratic primaries. Sanders and other liberal lawmakers and advocacy groups say the DNC needs to be reimagined as less of an insider's club focused on raising money and more of an advocate for the working-class voters won over Tuesday by the Republican president-elect. With Clinton's loss, the DNC chairman is certain to become a more visible face of the Democratic Party, and the contest to replace interim chairwoman Donna Brazile now appears to be a wide-open affair. Brazile stepped in for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who announced her resignation in July after the release of a trove of hacked emails that suggested that the DNC was aiding Clinton in preference to Sanders in the primaries. Had Clinton won Tuesday, she would have been expected to name a political ally to head the DNC.   Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) speaks during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)   [A series of strategic mistakes likely sealed Clinton's fate]  The candidate garnering the most early attention is Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a favorite of liberal advocacy groups and a Muslim -- a fact that his supporters argue would send a strong signal about the party's diversity during Trump's tenure. Support for Ellison has extended beyond his liberal base; already backed by Sanders, he won the endorsement Friday of Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is expected to be the next Senate minority leader. Ellison plans to announce his bid for the chairmanship Monday. Sanders said he thinks a DNC ""preoccupied"" with raising large sums of money from wealthy donors was partly responsible for Tuesday's loss. ""You can't tell working people you're on their side while at the same time you're raising money from Wall Street and the billionaire class,"" Sanders said. ""The Democratic Party has to be focused on grass-roots America and not wealthy people attending cocktail parties."" On a conference call Saturday between Clinton and her top donors, her finance director, Dennis Cheng, said Clinton's fundraising operation had raised $972 million for her campaign, the DNC and state parties. Of that amount, 56 percent was ""generated by the people on this call,"" Cheng said.   Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley participates in a Democratic presidential primary debate in Iowa in November 2015. (Charlie Neibergall/AP)  In total, the campaign held more than 1,500 fundraisers, of which Clinton attended nearly 400 herself, and more than 3 million people made donations, Cheng said. Sanders acknowledged the need for the party to continue its function as a fundraising vehicle but suggested a model akin to his presidential campaign, which raised much of its money from small-dollar donors. ""Millions of people are willing to put in 20 bucks, 30 bucks, 50 bucks if there's a party to believe in,"" he said. His views have been echoed by several liberal groups that are supportive of Ellison. ""The Democratic establishment had their chance with this election,"" said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ""It's time for new leadership of the Democratic Party -- younger, more diverse and more ideological -- that is hungry to do things differently, like leading a movement instead of dragging people to the polls."" Those more closely aligned with Clinton are cautioning against overreacting to an election in which she appears to have won the popular vote. Among at least eight hopefuls for chairman who have emerged, still others are billing themselves as unifiers between Clinton and Sanders supporters. Those include former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, who said Friday that he is taking a ""hard look"" at seeking the chairmanship. O'Malley, who ended his presidential bid after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, said he thinks he was the second choice of many Sanders supporters and that many Clinton supporters have encouraged him to seek the DNC role. ""That puts me in a unique position right now to bridge that divide,"" said O'Malley, who previously headed the Democratic Governors Association. ""We need to come together. We need to start acting like a party again."" At least four of those hoping to become party chairman are Latino, a sign of that demographic's growing clout within the party. During a conference call Thursday with members of the liberal advocacy group Democracy for America, Ellison said the party needs to become more of a presence in local communities across the country. He argued that television advertising and sophisticated data analysis of voter behavior is no substitute ""for getting Dems together around a pot of chili and getting to know them."" Already, Ellison has come under fire from some Democrats who argue that their party needs a full-time chairman and that his continuing to serve in Congress would make that impossible. Former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who served as DNC chairman a decade ago, announced plans to try to regain the position and made the case for a full-time role. ""Look, I like Keith Ellison a lot,"" Dean said during a Friday appearance on MSNBC. ""He's a very good guy. There's one problem: You cannot do this job and sit in a political office at the same time. It's not possible."" That view was echoed Friday by longtime Democratic operative Harold Ickes: ""I do think there's a very strong argument for a full-time DNC chair, especially for a party out of power."" Henry Munoz III, the DNC's national finance chairman who helped Clinton collect millions of dollars for her campaign, said Friday that he is considering a bid for party chairman but also is in touch with other Hispanic leaders about ensuring that the DNC more properly represents Latino concerns. ""The one thing that is abundantly clear is that the Latino community held up their end of the bargain,"" Munoz said. ""We did deliver on our promise."" Hispanics accounted for at least 11 percent of all voters on Election Day, according to national exit polls -- a one-percentage-point increase from the 2012 presidential election. Munoz said the participation of Latinos would have been even greater if the party had been more attuned to their concerns in the past four years. In addition to Munoz, outgoing Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) are said to be considering running for chairman. Munoz confirmed that he is in touch with all of them. On the basis of the wide interest, ""I expect our perspective will be presented up front in the talks about the DNC going forward,"" he said. ""I think we're a long way from making a pick,"" he added. Gallego, 36, a former U.S. Marine corporal who represents most of the Phoenix area, is popular with younger congressional Democrats and is seen as a rising figure in a new generation of Democratic leaders. Becerra, who was an avid campaigner for Clinton, is said to be considering the DNC job now that he will not have an opportunity to serve in a Clinton Cabinet, as he had expected. Another potential contender eyeing the race is Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Harrison said the next DNC chairman should focus far more on helping build the state Democratic parties, including his, across the country. ""There's no party-building that's taking place,"" he said. ""It becomes incredibly difficult to recruit candidates."" Jason Kander, who lost the Senate race in Missouri to Roy Blunt (R) on Tuesday, also is considering a run for chairman, according to people close to him. Some longtime Democrats say the race has probably begun prematurely -- particularly as the party is still mourning Clinton's loss. Former national chairman Don Fowler, a fixture in South Carolina, said, ""I think it's somewhat ill-advised for people to get in and try to do all of this during a funeral.""

The 52-page indictment accuses the once-rising Republican star, Aaron Schock, of brazen efforts to make money, such as buying World Series tickets with campaign funds and reselling them at a profit. When Schock risked missing a connecting flight for a European vacation, the indictment alleges, he paid a private aircraft company more than $8,000 out of his campaign account to fly him from Peoria to Washington. Schock spent $40,000 in government funds to redecorate his Washington office, including $5,000 on a chandelier, and asked the House to reimburse him for nearly $30,000 worth of camera equipment, prosecutors allege. The indictment says he ran up a $140,000 mileage tab over six years, reimbursements for 150,000 more miles than his vehicles actually traveled. The 35-year-old Republican from Peoria is charged in the 24-count indictment with nine counts of wire fraud, five of falsification of election commission filings, six of filing false federal income tax returns, two of making false statements and one each of mail fraud and theft of government funds. A conviction on just one count of wire fraud alone carries a maximum 20 year prison sentence. His arraignment is set for Nov. 21.  ""Mr. Schock held public office at the time of the alleged offenses, but public office does not exempt him or anyone else from accountability for alleged intentional misuse of public funds and campaign funds,"" the U.S. attorney in Springfield, Jim Lewis, said in a statement announcing the indictment. After the charges were announced, Schock's attorney, George Terwilliger, contended in a phone interview that many of the issues singled in the indictment were administrative ones that many members of Congress grapple with.  ""It's baffling to me that the government would think that it's a proper exercise of discretion to make criminal mountains out of these molehill issues,"" he said. ""It was evident to us from the first day they subpoenaed him that they had every intent to embarrass and humiliate him."" Terwilliger said in an earlier written statement that ""these charges are the culmination of an effort to find something, anything, to take down Aaron Schock."" Also a prodigious fundraiser for the GOP, Schock resigned in March 2015 amid intensifying scrutiny over real estate deals, extensive travel that he documented on his social media accounts and other spending documented by The Associated Press and other media outlets. The reports raised questions about improper mileage reimbursements, trips on donors' aircraft and more. The former congressman downplayed the allegations in June, saying any wrongdoing was ""honest mistakes."" In his own statement Thursday, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Schock said he never intentionally did anything wrong and that he was eager to defend his name and reputation.  ""As I have said before, we might have made errors among a few of the thousands and thousands of financial transactions we conducted, but they were honest mistakes -- no one intended to break any law,"" he said. The charges are the culmination of a 19-month investigation that included two grand juries that Schock said ""poked, prodded, and probed every aspect of my professional, political, and personal life.""  ""Like many Americans, I wanted to have faith in the integrity of our Justice Department,"" he said. ""But after this experience, I am forced to join millions of other Americans who have sadly concluded that our federal justice system is broken and too often driven by politics instead of facts."" According to the indictment, Schock also ran up a $140,000 mileage tab over six years, reimbursements for 150,000 more miles than his vehicles actually traveled. Another time, he asked the House to reimburse him for nearly $30,000 worth of camera equipment. In 2014, Schock bought four Super Bowl tickets for $10,025 paid for by one of his campaign funds, according to court documents. He then resold the tickets at a $1,975 profit and never reimbursed his campaign for the initial purchase price. Jeff Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who is now a Chicago-based managing director of investigations at Berkeley Research Group, said some of Schock's alleged schemes were bold and elaborate but resulted in relatively petty payouts compared to other high-profile corruption cases that have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars.  ""It's greed but on a comparatively small scale -- for Illinois,"" Cramer said. Schock's attorney said he was confident any future jurors would acquit Schock and would also be ""disgusted with what their own government has done."" Schock began his career as a successful 19-year-old write-in candidate for school board and became the youngest legislator ever elected to the Illinois General Assembly at 23. In Congress, he replaced Republican Ray LaHood, who became President Barack Obama's Transportation secretary. Ray LaHood's son, Republican Darrin LaHood, took Schock's congressional seat after a special election in September 2015, following Schock's resignation. If Schock is ultimately convicted, he could join an already lengthy list of Illinois politicians who ended up in prison in recent years. Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. was convicted for spending $750,000 in campaign money on fur capes, mounted elk heads, Hollywood memorabilia and other personal items. Two of the state's recent governors, Republican George Ryan and Democrat Rod Blagojevich, were convicted of wide-ranging corruption. And former House Speaker Dennis Hastert was convicted in a hush-money case. ___ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed from Washington. ___ Follow Michael Tarm on Twitter at http://twitter.com/mtarm Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Will he remain active now that she lost?	"   LeBron James, center, James Jones, left, and Tristan Thompson attend an event on the South Lawn where President Obama welcomed the Cleveland Cavaliers to the White House to honor their NBA Finals title. (Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency)  Less than a week after he stumped for Hillary Clinton in Cleveland, LeBron James was standing in front of the White House, dressed in a black turtleneck. Donald Trump won the election Tuesday, and now, events at 1600 Pennsylvania were supposed to go on as planned. Which meant just hours after the president-elect was in the Oval Office, the Cleveland Cavaliers were stopping by for a visit. All the usual pomp and circumstance that accompanies the championship-visit tradition played out: handshakes, photo shoots, light jabs and jokes from the basketball-loving president. But then, Obama made a point of praising James and his teammate Kevin Love for something entirely different than talent on the court. ""These Cavs exemplify a growing  generation of athletes that are using their platforms to speak out,"" Obama said. ""We've seen Kevin on combating campus sexual assault. LeBron on issues like gun violence and working with Michelle to help more kids go to school."" It's common for the president to praise athletes' charity work, but this compliment was different: Obama was giving kudos to players for speaking out about issues that are complicated and often controversial. Throughout his career, James has been extremely hesitant to play that role, despite his unparalleled level of influence. Endorsing Hillary Clinton, and mentioning violence against the African American community as a reason for doing so, was out of the ordinary. And although James waited until one of the last possible days to campaign with Clinton in Ohio, it was seen by many as a signal that the 31-year-old superstar might finally be more comfortable taking a stand. But then Clinton lost. And in Ohio, where James had so earnestly told voters she was the only candidate who ""understands the struggles of an Akron child born into poverty,""she earned only 44 percent of the vote. For a man whose reputation is centered on winning, what comes next? Does he double down on the issues that matter to him until he's won? Or does he retreat back to a his place of comfort, where basketball comes first and community involvement stays confined to issues everyone can clap for?    Democratic Nominee Hillary Clinton with LeBron James on Nov. 6, (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Perhaps Loretta Lynch knows the answer. Obama told the crowd that earlier in the day, James and his teammates met with the attorney general and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett to ""discuss steps they are taking to help build understanding between law enforcement and the Cleveland community."" The meeting took place behind closed doors, and Coach Tyronn Lue was vague when describing it to reporters after the ceremony. ""We just discussed some issues that have been happening in our communities and our environment,"" he said, ""and the guys had a lot of great things to say."" So it's unclear whether the meeting was merely a perfunctory get-together as part of the NBA's initiative ""to build stronger communities"" or a chance to assemble a real plan of action on an issue Cleveland is desperately struggling with.   [With legacy secure, LeBron James is free to dominate his way]   Of course, with President-elect Trump on his way to the Oval, any plans made by Jarrett and Lynch aren't for the long-term. Uncertainty of the coming Trump presidency was certainly in the air Thursday, as audience members discussed whether future championship teams will be invited -- or will agree to -- carry on the tradition of bringing the sitting president a jersey. Trump is known to be a sports fan, but the NBA took a far louder stand against him than other leagues. Along with many players, coaches including the Detroit Pistons' Stan Van Gundy and the Golden State Warriors' Steve Kerr openly criticized Trump before and after the election. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver donated to the Clinton campaign. And, as Lue pointed out to reporters while explaining why it was important the Cavs visit the White House while Obama was still in office, the majority of NBA players are minorities.   ['The message was loud and clear': In NBA and NFL, a struggle to accept Trump's election]   Late Wednesday, the Cavs'  Richard Jefferson posted on Snapchat: ""Words cannot express the honor I feel being the last team to visit the White House tomorrow."" But Lue said if Trump does carry on the tradition, he would happily return to meet him. ""I hope so. I think it's great,"" Lue said. ""We have a long season to play and if we were able to win, I would love to come back."" Such a feat is a long way off, and with an unpredictable president it's impossible to foretell what the political climate will be. But surely, LeBron would think twice about hob-knobbing with a man whose ""locker room talk"" he openly denounced.      Never thought in a million years I would stand in the front lawn of the White House! Beyond blessed with some of my woes!! #StriveForGreatness #RWTW #TheKidFromAkron A photo posted by LeBron James (@kingjames) on Nov 10, 2016 at 4:52pm PST    James's only public reaction to the election results didn't mention Trump by name; instead, he posted a surprisingly-uplifting message on Instagram. ""We will BE ALRIGHT!!"" he wrote. ""Parents and leaders of our children please let them know they can still change the world for the better! Don't lose a bit of faith!"" In a nod to his future plans, he wrote that he would continue to mold his children -- likely referencing his three kids and the children who benefit from his family foundation -- into ""the greatest model citizens they can become."" ""To all the youth out there I PROMISE I'll continue to lead u guys every single day without no hesitation!!"" he continued. There's no doubt that will entail being active in his charity, which has programs to support children of all ages and pays for more than 1,000 of them to attend the University of Akron. James serves not as a figurehead but as an active mentor to the students involved and regularly writes them encouraging notes signed from ""Mr. Lebron."" (""You going outside in the cold without a coat is like me showing up for a game without a jersey. That just won't work,"" he recently wrote to them.) President Obama clapped for these efforts but seemed to be calling on LeBron to do more, especially by mentioning gun violence. James has at times teetered on whether he has a duty to be the face of such a complex issue. Sometimes he's been on board; others, he's demurred. In July, James stood beside fellow NBA stars Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade and Chris Paul at the ESPY Awards to speak against gun violence and the shooting of black men by police officers. James's previous messages on the issue -- wearing an ""I Can't Breathe"" shirt in honor of Eric Garner, or a hoodie for Trayvon Martin -- had been in a similar fashion. He makes these statements with both his teammates and other NBA players, and usually not until there is a call to do so. After a grand jury declined to indict the white police officer who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Black Lives Matter organizers called upon James to boycott a game in protest. But all James said about the matter was, ""To be honest, I haven't really been on top of this issue, so it's hard for me to comment."" ""It's not just a responsibility of government, it takes all of us,"" Obama said after complimenting LeBron. ""Businesses, nonprofits, athletes, role models working together to achieve the progress that we seek.""      Just messing around with FLOTUS!! Really @realcfrye!?!? Come a long way from Akron man! So damn blessed and humbled. #StriveForGreatness #RWTW #TheKidFromAkron A photo posted by LeBron James (@kingjames) on Nov 10, 2016 at 12:44pm PST    Cavs General Manager David Griffin elaborated on the scrutiny someone with a profile like James's can face when it comes to social and political issues. ""LeBron is in a unique position because his opinion matters more than most,"" Griffin said after the White House visit. ""I would want him to continue to carry himself exactly like he does. He does a masterful job of wielding the influence he has."" The White House set up a microphone outside the West Wing so that Lue, Griffin and the players could speak to the press after meeting the president. A press release indicated that James, Love and point guard Kyrie Irving were likely to attend. The hoard of reporters waiting for them to appear debated what James would say. The moment was inherently political. Ohio Governor, and former Republican presidential candidate, John Kasich, who attended the ceremony, walked up to the press to give a message to Americans to ""come together."" Trump and his family had left the building just hours before. On Pennsylvania Avenue, protesters were chanting ""Not! My! President!"" The cameras were rolling, ready to give James his moment. But he never showed. There was a basketball game to prepare for, and he was already back on the team bus."

Voters chose a 48-year-old, urbane, liberal black man, then a 70-year-old, unrepentantly coarse white man who is conservative, or something. Ain't that America? Change comes in all forms and with wrenching lurches in a nation founded by bloody revolt and enervated through the generations by political and cultural revolution, sometimes to the edge of bloodshed or over. There's no getting a grip on this country. The U.S. serves up in-your-face cowboy culture, in-your-face counterculture, aggressively faith-based political movements, electric Bernie Sanders socialism and lots more chances to smoke pot legally, as well as workaday lives and pinstriped suits. Americans vote for shake-up artists, not every time but enough times to set the country apart from democracies where the ship of state turns more slowly and majestically.  ""The path that this country has taken has never been a straight line,"" Obama said Wednesday. ""We zig and we zag."" Obama, the zig, was a guy so cool in the eyes of much of the world that he got a Nobel Peace Prize before he'd had a chance to do much. (At the time, in his first year, the U.S. was fighting two wars.) Trump, the zag, is a hurler of insults, a raw orator you can't turn away from if you can bring yourself to tune in, a boor with women, a peddler of falsehoods that made millions of eyes roll but spoke to a larger truth in the eyes of supporters. Foreigners shake their heads at a country that over the years defines cool, then represents what crazy looks like. Trump won with the backing of a long-prized, but declining, segment of white voters, especially men, especially less educated ones. They were on top of the political world for ages, part of Richard Nixon's Silent Majority, Reagan's haul of blue-collar Democrats and Bill Clinton's bubbas. Now they fade in an increasingly diverse country. But Tuesday, everything old was new again and they said: Yes, we still can. Obama came to national attention with a speech of poetry and power that dreamed of red states and blue states joined spiritually as united states. It took the breath away of some Republicans as well as many Democrats. It was a pipe dream, he admitted years later. Divisions of red and blue, white and black, young and old, coastal and heartland, are epic now -- tribal. Though polar opposites in character, politics and experience, Obama and Trump have some commonality. They both seized on dissatisfaction and rode the revolutionary impulse to success. Though not a neophyte like Trump, Obama had to claw against the establishment -- personified in 2008 by primary rival Hillary Clinton -- and benefited from that underdog posture. This time Democrats served up the establishment, in Clinton, the candidate who told snickering donors about the ""irredeemable"" ''deplorables"" backing Trump, and woke up Wednesday to devastation, if they ever slept. Obama and Trump tapped their different political tribes on the way to the White House, but with some overlap. In Ohio's Belmont County, which Obama won in 2008, Trump swept almost 70 percent of the votes. In nearby Mahoning County, which Obama won by 28 points in 2012, Clinton edged Trump by only three points. In other words, some people in working-class America who voted for Obama before turned to Trump this time. So, now, a nation that is pretty upbeat about the job the cool black president is doing hands the reins to a man who spun conspiracy theories about Obama's country of birth. They will be together on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, peacefully handing over power. It is usually a moment of grace and probably, somehow, will be that once more. Then it's on with the zigzag, a time to be certain of nothing except that revolution, from some quarter at some point, will come again. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/294e824a-a1ff-11e6-8d63-3e0a660f1f04_story.html	Considering what Americaâ€™s choice of Donald Trump really means	"      Early on the morning of Nov. 9, Republican President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York, declaring victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   Eight years ago, unprecedented throngs of Americans rushed into the streets in the middle of the night. People cried, hugged strangers, kissed cops, shared champagne. The country had just elected its first black president, and it felt as if liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, were on the same team, if only for a rousing moment, and that team had just won the World Series. Of course, it quickly became clear that Barack Obama had won office in a divided nation hungry for change but also mistrustful of authority, suspicious of nearly everything. Donald Trump's victory Tuesday night seemed unlikely to provoke any such unifying surge of goodwill and pride.    Trump addresses supporters after winning the presidency early Wednesday. (Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post)  Americans on election night of 2016 had the blues -- anxious about the future, miffed about the lousy choices they faced, insecure about the nation's place in the world, bothered by each other. A presidential election is a reflection of the national culture and mood, and if the Obama election was a statement of optimism about the radical demographic, technological and social changes of recent decades, then what did Americans' choice of Trump really mean? It is, some voters said, an admission of exhaustion, a collective settling for the lesser of two evils in a country where people increasingly choose not to live near, associate with or listen to those who hold opposing political views. Not quite, other voters said. With or without Trump's extraordinary appeal, Americans were determined this year to send the politicians a message about the pain caused by a decades-long collapse of certainties about what America looks like, what constitutes a family and how we earn a living.    Police officers speak with a poll judge, third from the left, in the presence of an assistant district attorney, bottom, at a polling place at the Christy Recreation Center in West Philadelphia on Tuesday. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)  Through traditional news media and new social media, an unusually captivated audience saw this campaign as a disorienting kaleidoscope of bloodcurdling anger at raucous rallies, waves of investigation and suspicion, and torrents of insults traded by candidates and their supporters. Tuesday's vote left unresolved whether the ugly narrative of unprincipled demagogue vs. dishonest harridan really reflects a country that has fallen into coarse, raw hatred -- or if the 2016 campaign was instead a symptom of the newly pervasive power of Facebook, Twitter and other social media. The line between public and private blurred so thoroughly that nasty, hurtful comments that people once made only to their closest family members and friends were now broadcast to the world at large.   [How Donald Trump broke the old rules of politics -- and won the White House]   Trump is ""like that doctor with the horrible bedside manner,"" said Chris Love, 50, a Trump supporter and firearms academy owner who was voting in Davie, Fla.  ""He tells you 90 percent of your arteries are clogged. By being blunt, he's saving your life."" Across the ideological divide, some see this year's surly, sour campaign as a reflection of sentiments that have been plainly visible on the Internet for a long time but that just this year exploded into open expression. ""Fear and anger and misogyny and xenophobia don't change -- they were always out there, but now those people can find each other so much more easily,"" said Chip Franklin, a radio talk show host in San Francisco who built his career as a conservative, then shifted his politics to the left. ""This year's anger is the same as any year's anger, but what's different now is that there are 30 different ways to express that anger and share it with people who would never have seen it before. Then along came Donald Trump, willing to say whatever people wanted him to say."" Even if he had lost, this would have been the year of Trump, a wholesale rejection of politics as usual. The thin enthusiasm for Clinton, the revival of the 1990s narrative painting her as dishonest and arrogant, and the dramatically rougher language deployed against her combined with Trump's ability to give voice to the nation's id. The result was a cavalcade of insults, threats and unchecked assertions flying under the flag of anti-political correctness. The candidates took body blows from all sides, a level of vitriol that was commonplace in America's first century but had calmed considerably during the decades when the three major TV networks set the nation's political tone. This year, it was almost remarkable that no candidate got challenged to a duel. Congress, the news media and politicians overall -- the usual basement dwellers in any accounting of the nation's least-trusted institutions -- fell to new lows. But the biggest shift seemed to take place on the smallest stages. 'Devolving into tribes' As Jane Beard waited for her prescription at the Walgreens in Edgewater, Md., a baby in a stroller caught her eye. She played a quick bit of peek-a-boo, looked up and caught the boy's father's eye. He smiled and leaned in: ""Listen, I want to ask you something. Are you a Hillary voter? You look like a Hillary voter."" For an instant, Beard -- in yoga pants, a sweatshirt and little Ecco shoes -- thought the man had sensed a kindred spirit. ""You bet I am!"" she replied. Suddenly, the man unleashed a river of invective: ""It's c---s like you who are helping that c--- win. She's a murderer."" He went on, and it didn't get any nicer. Rattled, Beard asked: ""Why did you even come up to me? I never said a word to you. All I did was exist in the world in this store . . ."" ""You exist!"" the man hissed. ""B-----s like you exist and you're f---ing up the country -- our country."" Beard searched for the best retort. ""It's my country, too,"" she blurted. She quickly left the store, sat down in her car, caught her breath and posted about the incident on Facebook. Within minutes, a virtual community embraced Beard, a former actress who coaches executives on public speaking. They bemoaned the loss of civility in so many places. They told stories of angry confrontations launched from both sides of the divide. They said they'd refrained from putting out yard signs this year because people have gotten so riled up. ""Truly sadly, I feel just about the same way as this nut -- albeit in reverse,"" one of Beard's friends wrote. ""I hate that this election has brought out these feelings in me."" But one man assured Beard that ""you met an outlier. The vast majority of people are good and kind."" Another urged her to ""look at the support you have catalyzed with this post. Look at the love that holds you and everyone woven into this tapestry. That is what is real."" Beard, who lives in Churchton, Md., near the Chesapeake Bay, had already had three Hillary signs stolen from her yard. On Halloween, she took down her latest sign, just for the evening, ""because we didn't want people not to come to our house."" But in the week after the drugstore confrontation, Beard, 60, found support from neighbors, including Trump supporters, one of whom ran into her at the Baltimore airport, hugged her, and said, ""Oh my gosh, Jane, we can still be friends."" Still, she struggled with the meaning of her moment in Walgreens. ""People are scared,"" she concluded. ""That man is raising a kid that will hear that language and spout that language. Yet I was soothed by all the outpouring. What makes me sad is that we're devolving into tribes. I thought we were all the American tribe.""     Clinton holds a rally early Tuesday morning at N.C. State University in Raleigh. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)     Suporters cheer Trump in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Monday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)    'Why are we enemies?' Deep divisions and despairing dissatisfaction over politics and the nation's direction are nothing new. ""America never was America to me,"" Langston Hughes wrote in ""Let America Be America,"" his 1935 poem. ""I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart. I am the Negro bearing slavery's scars. . . . I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek -- and finding only the same old stupid plan of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak."" Hughes concluded that the people, not the politicians, could ""bring back our mighty dream again. . . . I swear this oath -- America will be!"" That essentially American optimism has not disappeared. Many Trump supporters, drawn by their candidate's dark vision of a lost and failing country that ""I alone can fix,"" thought of themselves as a movement to restore greatness. ""More than anything else, Trump picked up on a growing sense that elections don't have much impact on the direction of the country, that power is increasingly distant from the people,"" said Chris Buskirk, publisher of American Greatness, a pro-Trump blog. Buskirk saw Trump connecting with voters on messages that had more in common with Democrats Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren than with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.): border security, a ""pro-worker"" trade policy aimed at ""bringing Wall Street to heel"" and a foreign policy skeptical of military intervention. That message -- American jobs, America First, Fortress America -- hit home with millions of people who have felt disconnected from, and disdained by, the elites for decades. In 1996, James Dobson, the head of Focus on the Family, one of the country's largest and most influential evangelical Christian organizations, said: ""People inside the Beltway are not aware of the multiple millions of Americans out there who believe things differently than is perceived in Washington. They're very concerned about . . . a moral meltdown in this country. They're waiting for some political figure to articulate those views. And no one does."" Then came Trump. His unique blend of celebrity, ego and a mischievous delight in outraging the elites -- as well as his confidence that he would be judged by the lax standards applied to Hollywood and sports figures rather than the unforgiving rules that govern politicians -- enabled him to win over millions who heard in his message clear echoes of their late-night grumbles to friends on Facebook. Trump's rhetoric and character liberated some Americans to open an ugly vein of animosity. ""This year has revealed our underbelly, and a lot of people don't like what we see,"" said Jim Daly, Focus on the Family's current president. America, Daly said, has morphed into ""a post-Christian society,"" a ""depraved culture"" in which the more conservative party chose a nominee who boasted of his sexual assaults.    At the Grand Rapids Trump rally Monday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Clinton's decades in politics, her emotionally distanced and guarded presentation, and her legalistic language nearly smothered the revolutionary nature of her own candidacy -- oddly, the possibility of electing the first female president was rarely mentioned through most of the campaign. (When some in the campaign sought to go big with the historic nature of Clinton's candidacy, they were told by those in charge that many Americans just didn't want to hear it.)   [Trump's White House win promises to reshape U.S. political landscape]   Was the Trump victory a statement condoning sexism, boorish behavior and coarse aggression? Would President Obama still insist, as he did last summer, that ""America is not as divided as some have suggested""? In recent days, many Americans expressed a palpable desire to relieve the tension of division that is evident in the 56 percent of Americans who, according to The Washington Post-ABC poll, were anxious about Clinton becoming president and the 61 percent who felt that way about Trump winning. ""Everybody is against everybody. Why?"" Mary White asked in Des Moines last week after two police officers were shot and killed. She brought her son to a makeshift memorial, where she found a morsel of hope, and a question: ""Look how this community has come together, people who don't know each other. Why can't our nation come together? What happened between 9/11 and now? Why are we enemies?"" Every chapter in the American story so far has resolved into hope. The Civil War birthed Reconstruction. The riots and generational strife of the 1960s settled into sweeping social and cultural change. Before the vote, the University of Virginia's president, Teresa Sullivan, appealed to students to be civil to one another after the vote. She taught them about the bitter election of 1800, when a pro-John Adams newspaper warned that Thomas Jefferson would create a nation in which ""murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will openly be taught and practiced."" Jefferson won and set about trying to get people to ""unite with one heart and one mind,"" to restore ""that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things . . ."" Daly, the evangelical leader, said he intends to reach out to gay activists and abortion rights advocates ""to build bridges, just trying to create discussions and friendships. I don't know if it will work. When you try to do that, you get killed by the extremes on both sides. The uncorking of incivility makes it hard: Discussions that used to die among friends now become unbridled castigating of other people. I'm hopeful that this election is a blip. We're now at a point where we cannot say that civility is a shared value, and I don't see how we can keep our democracy together without being able to talk to each other.""           1 of 26       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                           Skip Ad   x           How the world is reacting to results of the U.S. election      View Photos   People around the globe watched as Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States.
