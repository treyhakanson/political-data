The San Antonio Express-News (http://bit.ly/2fKtkI1 ) reports the skit, titled ""The Assassination of Donald Trump,"" was performed last week at Marshall High School. One of the boys used a gunfire sound effect from a cellphone; the other boy, playing Trump, fell to the ground. Barry Perez, spokesman for the Northside Independent School District, said the ""appropriate action"" had been taken against the three, and that the teacher had apologized. Harold and Melinda Bean, parents of a student who viewed the skit, complained to district officials. They said they are dissatisfied with the district action and had hoped for harsher measures. ___ Information from: San Antonio Express-News, http://www.mysanantonio.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Charred bodies with their arms bound. Women who were gang-raped. Men who were spared death but arbitrarily detained. These are the tales of horror told in Yei, a formerly peaceful town surrounded by farms in southern South Sudan near its border with Uganda and Congo. Once a beacon of coexistence, Yei is now a center of the country's renewed civil war, gripped by a wave of killings among South Sudan's dozens of different ethnic groups. And things could get worse.  ""The signs are all there for the spread of this ethnic hatred and targeting of civilians that could evolve into genocide, if something is not done now to stop it,"" said Adama Dieng, the U.N.'s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, after visiting Yei last week. Civilians and local government officials in Yei told The Associated Press of army troops and, to a lesser extent, the rebels terrorizing the population and killing people based on their ethnicity.  ""Some leaders will not hide their (loyalty) to their ethnic groups. They cannot hide it. Genocide is not an event that one day comes. It builds and it builds up. The indicators are there,"" said Jacob Aligo, a minister in the Yei state government. At night, gunshots echo through the town and soldiers prowl the streets, looting and raping, according to more than a dozen residents and government officials interviewed by the AP. A woman who identified herself only by her first name of Betty for fear of reprisal said government soldiers knocked on her door one night in mid-October.  ""My husband pushed me and my two children under the bed and he opened the door. They demanded money, and he had none, and then they shot my husband,"" she recalled, saying he bled to death. She said she later visited a friend who had been gang-raped by armed men. When civil war spread across South Sudan in December 2013 -- more than two years after the country gained its independence from Sudan -- the town of Yei was spared the violence that arose elsewhere. The civil war, which killed tens of thousands and displaced more than 2 million people, grew out of a political split between President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Rick Machar. The conflict often pitted Kiir's Dinka tribe against Machar's Nuer community and other minority groups. In New York, the United States urged the U.N. Security Council on Thursday to impose an arms embargo and new sanctions on South Sudan, a proposal immediately rejected by Russia as premature and irresponsible. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told the council that an arms embargo can't prevent weapons getting into the conflict-wracked country, but it would be an important step toward curbing the violence. Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Petr Iliichev countered that an arms embargo ""would hardly be helpful in settling the conflict."" Yei became a refuge for all of the country's 64 tribes who wanted to avoid the fighting, and crime was almost nonexistent, residents said. The surrounding area produced food for the entire country and a nearby coffee plantation received support from actor and longtime South Sudan activist George Clooney. When a peace deal was signed in 2015, it seemed that Yei had avoided bloodshed. But last summer, after fresh fighting erupted in South Sudan's capital, Juba, between Kiir's army and the rebels under Machar, the renewed civil war came to Yei. Civilians in Yei began to suffer in August when the army came in to fight nearby rebels, said Gista, a resident who also refused to give her last name out of fear for her safety. She said government soldiers swarmed a village on Yei's outskirts, where her daughter and son-in-law lived. He apparently didn't hear the soldiers coming, and ""when he tried to run, the killers were already there,"" Gista said. They killed him and her daughter, as well as her 4-year-old granddaughter, and hacked a 4-month-old granddaughter with a machete, she said. The infant survived after being hospitalized, she added. The military, which residents and local government officials say are from the Dinka tribe, attacked other tribes who are natives of Yei and surrounding Equatoria state on suspicion they supported the rebels, the locals said. A militia called Mathiang Anyoor, which is allied to Kiir and Army Chief of Staff Paul Malong and is Dinka, also terrorized civilians, according to residents, local officials and U.N. officials. Residents are restricted from moving 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the center of town in all but one direction. Surrounding areas have been declared off limits by the military. When the AP traveled in a government convoy in those ""no-go"" areas, they were deserted, with fields lying fallow and empty houses and shops boarded up. Santo Domic Chol, a spokesman for the South Sudan army, or SPLA, said the allegations of soldiers targeting civilians were ""baseless,"" and part of a propaganda campaign influenced by the rebels. In early November, 11 people traveling from Yei were rounded up by unidentified individuals, placed in a thatched hut, and burned alive, local government officials said. Their charred corpses were still there in mid-November when AP counted seven bodies, some with their arms bound behind their backs.  ""We are living in crazy times,"" said Athanasio Yongule, minister for Local Government and Law Enforcement. Like other local officials, Yongule said South Sudan's army does not answer to them. Since July, hate speech has been on the rise in the region on social media, according to Stephen Ladu, the acting governor of Yei River State.  ""We can see that the boys in the bushes will be writing on the social media that they will come and attack this community,"" Ladu said. Letters sent to humanitarian groups and seen by the AP have threatened to kill civilians from Equatoria state who live elsewhere in South Sudan. Ladu and other local officials want U.N. to send peacekeepers to Yei to protect civilians. Nearly 150,000 people have fled to Uganda from the Yei region since July, and 120,000 have moved elsewhere in South Sudan, according to estimates from the South Sudan Protection Cluster. The U.N. refugee agency said in September that about 100,000 people are ""trapped"" in Yei by ""military operations,"" and it is distributing items like soap and blankets. Many civilians are gripped by hunger in a region that once was South Sudan's breadbasket. About 40 percent of the area's population faces food insecurity, according to internal U.N. estimates obtained by the AP. Because of the conflict, they don't have access to their farms, said Richard Ruati an assistant external relations officer for U.N. refugee agency in Yei.  ""Sometimes when they go to their farms, they are either accused by the government soldiers of harboring the rebels or the rebels and the armed groups accuse them of harboring government soldiers,"" he said. Civilians ""are bearing the brunt of both sides, and they don't know where to turn to,"" he said. Dieng, the U.N. adviser on genocide, painted a harrowing picture of his visit to Yei as he left South Sudan last week, recounting stories of ""targeted killings, assault, maiming, mutilation, rape, and the barbarous use of machetes to hack families to death."" He said: ""Yei is one urgent example among many."" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a stark warning about South Sudan this week.  ""There is a very real risk of mass atrocities being committed in South Sudan, in particular following the sharp rise in hate speech and ethnic incitement in recent weeks,"" Ban said in a report to the Security Council. But he added that U.N. peacekeeping operations don't have the ""appropriate reach, manpower or capabilities to stop mass atrocities."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

His first two books, "" 'A' is for Activist"" and ""Counting on Community"" were geared toward the 3-and-under crowd. His newest book, ""My Night in the Planetarium,"" targets an elementary school-age audience with a true story from Nagara's childhood in Indonesia. [Answers edited for length and clarity.]  Your books are unique in the world of children's literature. Can you tell me a bit about your work and what motivated you to start writing children's books? I live in a co-housing community with eight kids and nine adults. The first kid was born 16 years ago and so I've been reading books to children for the last 16 years at least. Six years ago, my own son was born and I was still reading the same books to him, and some of them were very boring and meaningless, but he really enjoyed them. I thought maybe I should do something that actually reflected my values and was fun to read for me. Initially, I was just going to do an A-Z book and ended up doing 'A' is for Activist. I was on a retreat with my co-workers and we sat down and wrote it from there. Because I'm a graphic designer, the illustration was what I knew how to do; it was the writing part that I had to learn. Your books take big ideas and attempt to make them accessible for children. It's a lofty goal and seems to give children a lot more credit than other books might. Children are usually way far ahead of where most adults think they need to be and should be. My philosophy is that it's important to actually have these conversations early on. There is an adult layer and a child's layer to both books. The goal is to have a book you are going to read over and over again be enjoyable for you, that has poetry and politics that adults who are reading to them can appreciate and enjoy, but also there is a kid layer. Your first two books were board books. My Night in the Planetarium targets an older audience. Can you tell me a bit about this newest book? I always wanted to do something about Indonesia ... but it had to be something that had universal themes, too. The main goal was of telling a story that is able to weave in all the themes that are important to me (the role of art in social change movements, an introduction to colonialism, an exposure to Indonesia, an understanding of how cycles of power corrupt, and the idea that we all have agency to make change), but I think beyond that there is also a particular perspective that I hope I bring to the storytelling. One that is meant to spur the child's imagination, not just feed them information, and to create openings for conversations. Kids who come from different places often have family and cultural histories that connect to the themes in Planetarium -- and this allows them to explore those themes in a way that is accessible. I studied zoology in college, so I'm kind of into animal stuff, and I got a bearded dragon for my kid's kindergarten and now first-grade classes, and do presentations about it. The questions that the kids have about the lizard, and the stories they have to tell about their own experiences with dragons, snakes and other animals are so much more sophisticated than many would give them credit for. At that age it's all over the place, but it's also really notable how hungry they are to understand the complexities of the world they live in. Similarly, a story about colonialism, dictatorship, and student revolt in far-off Indonesia is something that they immediately find ways to relate their own struggles, conflicts and emotions to. Tell me a bit about the childhood experiences that inspired My Night in the Planetarium. My father was a dissident poet/playwright. In the late 1970s there was a surge of people and student activism trying to push against the dictatorship [in Indonesia], and there were a lot of demonstrations. His play, which I was in, was the one we toured the country with and the one that came the closest to having him end up in jail. In Indonesia, historically there have been surges of democracy movements, and this was one of the early ones, post-1966, but it didn't succeed.  For me, as a 7-year-old, it all just felt exciting but the story itself for me now, looking back, is not just about that incident, but about colonialism, about art for social change, about the way that the cycle of power corrupts -- which was what the play was about. It was critical of the regime, but it was a play about a leader who came into power after overthrowing a bad leader and then becoming that same abuser of power again. For my dad, too, the story was always meant to be a more universal argument about the way in which power corrupts and cycles of abuse. What has the response to your work been among people who buy your books? 'A' is for Activist was a surprise. I was going to do some for my friends and people encouraged me to print, and so I did a run of 3,000 and took out some loans and had a plan for paying people back. It turned out it was popular and it got picked up by Seven Stories Press, and they sold 50,000 copies. I also did Counting on Community through them. I have never tried for any of this to be for everybody; it's a book for people who share the values in the book already. It's not trying to convince people of anything. The response has been, people who already share my values love it and people who don't, don't. What do you hope to accomplish with your books? My goal is to create these books that cover areas that are good children's books, fun for kids to read, that families enjoy, that have stories that are engaging, but are outside of the stuff you normally get, that have some depth around issues that matter. The common theme in my books is agency, the idea that you can make change, and I think that's an important message for kids. Seven Stories Press/Triangle Square is trying to do something with their children's books that my books are a part of building. They had 10,000 Dresses and What Makes a Baby on their roster. This year they have Julia Alvarez's new book about death. These all are books that address topics that are traditionally considered outside of the children's book genre. And of course there is this exciting movement for diversity in children's books that is thriving. I'm involved with a number of other writers and publishers (Zetta Elliott, Maya Gonzalez, Janine Macbeth, Robert Trujillo) who are on the progressive edge of this movement, trying to make sure diversity doesn't just mean the same books with a brown face on it (though that is needed too), but that we are also able to reflect an expanded perspective, cultural, political, and otherwise. Even though the events of your book take place several decades ago in another country, they feel relevant to the climate today in the United States. Trump's election just highlights the importance of having books that address real issues for young children. Families who endure war, discrimination and hardship have always had to find ways to talk to their children about difficult subjects from an early age. But there was always a demographic of families who had the privilege of sheltering their children from many realities. Yet now we all have to help them access an understanding of the coming times in a way that is true, but can also inspire and comfort rather than cause fear and despair. Some families who have read My Night in the Planetarium told me that while it's a story about a child under a repressive regime in another country in another time, it was a valuable reference in their conversation with their children about [the U.S. election]. That yes, just like things were difficult for many people in that story, the most important thing is that they found creative ways to take action, and change is possible. What else do you think I should know? I do a lot of field testing of my books. I spend a lot of time ensuring these stories are engaging to kids and understood by kids. I do surveys and I give out mock-ups of books with families who have kids in the right age range. I do often get people asking if the content is really appropriate for kids. I can say with confidence not every kid, not every circumstance, but for the families for whom these books speak to, they have been vetted.

The figure refers to the number of immigrants ordered deported that year. A corrected version of the story is below: A look at Trump's immigration plans by the numbers A look at Trump's immigration plans by the numbers By ALICIA A. CALDWELL Associated Press WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump made immigration a top issue in his campaign and now his promises from the campaign trail are about to be put to the test. A look at immigration by the numbers: ___ Immigrants in the country illegally: about 11 million. Criminal immigrants: As of 2012, the government estimated that 1.9 million immigrants were convicted criminals and could face deportation. Criminal immigrants in the country illegally: The Migration Policy Institute in Washington estimates that about 820,000 of the criminal immigrants are here illegally. Deportations under President Barack Obama: More than 2.5 million. Deportation costs: Each deportation costs an average of about $12,500, according to a 2011 government estimate. Immigration court backlog: More than 521,000 cases are pending in federal immigration court, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Immigrants ordered deported: 88,128 in 2015, according to Executive Office for Immigration Review at Justice Department. Young immigrants protected from deportation by Obama administration: More than 741,000 people have been approved for deferred action, which shields them from deportation and authorizes them to legally work. Border Fence: About 650 miles of fencing is already in place along the Mexican border in parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. Length of Mexican border: Roughly 2,000 miles. Border Patrol agents: 18,321 agents patrol the U.S. border with Mexico.

The protests -- held in big cities like New York and Chicago as well as smaller ones, such as Worcester, Massachusetts, and Iowa City, Iowa -- were largely peaceful Saturday. Protesters rallied at New York's Union Square before taking their cause up Fifth Avenue toward Trump Tower, where they were held back by police barricades. The Republican president-elect was holed up inside his tower apartment, working with aides on the transition to the White House. Among those railing against him was filmmaker Michael Moore, who tweeted a demand that Trump ""step aside."" ___ Campaign's disdain for civility could leave lasting damage When a South Carolina congressman shouted ""You lie!"" during a speech by President Barack Obama in 2009, House members rebuked him for violating norms of civility. After this year's presidential campaign, the idea that people were once troubled by the outburst seems almost quaint. Civility in politics has been declining for years, both a cause and symptom of a changing culture where anonymous verbal assaults are fired freely across the internet, and cable TV routinely broadcasts words once banned from the airwaves. But Donald Trump's presidential run took name-calling and mockery -- things that voters long said they detested in their candidates -- and normalized them into a winning political strategy. Now Trump, the president-elect, is calling for unity in words that draw attention precisely because they sound so unlike Trump, the candidate. But many question whether it is possible to reverse the campaign's damage to political discourse and its ripples out to the way Americans speak to and about each other.  ""There's plenty of blame to go around on this subject, but I think in this particular election that an embrace of Donald Trump was an embrace of incivility and vulgarity and insults and bullying, and unfortunately we saw very little public repudiation of that from any Trump supporters,"" said Mark DeMoss, an Atlanta public relations executive and conservative Republican whose clients are mostly Christian religious organizations. DeMoss, who abandoned a campaign called the Civility Project in early 2011 after only three members of Congress would sign a pledge to act respectfully, watched the degradation of political speech for years. Then Trump's campaign, he and other longtime observers say, stomped well past what was thought to be acceptable. ___ Trump, McConnell and Ryan: Unlikely new power trio for DC WASHINGTON -- Washington's new power trio consists of a bombastic billionaire, a telegenic policy wonk and a taciturn political tactician. How well they can get along will help determine what gets done over the next four years, and whether the new president's agenda flounders or succeeds. President-elect Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell make up an unlikely alliance, one defined in advance mostly by Trump's opposition to the Washington establishment that Ryan and McConnell exemplify. Trump and Ryan clashed throughout the campaign, with Trump taking offense when Ryan initially refused to endorse him and later distanced himself over the audio of Trump talking about groping women.  ""Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.,"" Trump groused over Twitter last month. But that was then, this is now, as Ryan, the GOP's 2012 vice presidential nominee, said Thursday after meeting with Trump at the Capitol. ___ Deadlocked jurors force mistrial in Ohio police shooting CINCINNATI -- Jurors failed to come up with a verdict against a white former police officer charged with murder in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorist and were leaning toward a lesser conviction, a prosecutor said Saturday after a mistrial was declared. The jury spent some 25 hours debating the outcome and indicated several times that they were deadlocked before a judge agreed. Prosecutors will decide within the next two weeks whether to retry former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing. He was fired after shooting 43-year-old Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing front license plate on July 19, 2015. Tensing, 26, testified he feared he was going to be killed. Prosecutors said repeatedly the evidence contradicted Tensing's story. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters said jurors were leaning toward a conviction of voluntary manslaughter and acquittal on the murder charge. He later told media outlets the vote was deadlocked at 8-4 in favor of the lesser charge. ___ Mass grave points to IS horrors to come in push for Mosul HAMAM AL-ALIL, Iraq -- For months, Islamic State group fighters drove thousands of civilians on forced marches across the Nineveh desert into the small town of Hamam al-Alil. Retreating ahead of methodical Iraqi advances on Mosul's southern approach, IS fighters converged here, rounding up men, women and children for use as human shields and killing dozens of others. When Iraqi forces began to close in on this cluster of villages along the Tigris River valley, most of the militants fled into Mosul, taking thousands of civilians with them. But before the retreat, IS fighters also led hundreds to a garbage dump past an old IS training camp and shot them dead, leaving the bodies among the piles of trash. A week after Hamam al-Alil was retaken from IS, and days after a delegation from the central government in Baghdad visited the site, about a dozen bodies remain strewn among piles of garbage on the western edge of the town. The bodies that remained were the ones family members were unable to identify. Some had been decapitated, other have their hands and feet bound. Iraqi officials at the scene said the men were killed for alleged spying in aid of the operation to retake Mosul or having links to the Iraqi government's security forces. No efforts to preserve the site were visible on a visit Friday and Iraqi officers reported that wild dogs were eating at the decaying corpses that lay on the edge of an old agriculture college later bombed by coalition aircraft after IS converted the sprawling compound into a training base.  ""These were men working with us,"" said Iraqi federal police Cpt. Muhannad Adnan. ___ John Kerry says he'll continue with global warming efforts WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday he will continue his efforts to implement the Paris Agreement on global warming until the day President Barack Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. Speaking in New Zealand following a trip to Antarctica, Kerry said his administration would continue to do everything possible to meet its responsibility to future generations. Kerry has long championed climate action but now his legacy is under threat. President-elect Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax and said he would ""cancel"" U.S. involvement in the landmark Paris deal. Under the deal, which came into force this month, countries have agreed to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Achieving the goal will require a major shift away from fossil fuels. Kerry said it would be up to the Trump administration to define itself on climate change. He said that sometimes there is a divide between what is said on the campaign trail and what is done in governance. ___ Successful real-estate firm built between grisly crimes WOODRUFF, S.C. -- As he built a successful real estate firm, Todd Kohlhepp's behavior struck some as odd: watching pornographic videos during work, making macabre jokes in marketing literature and openly discussing that he was a sex offender. But he was also an award-winning agent described as a hard worker and good boss. All the while, authorities say, he was hiding a grisly secret that included seven killings over 13 years. He gunned down four people at a motorcycle shop in 2003 and within the last year killed three more, authorities said. The crimes were uncovered earlier this month when investigators rescued a woman chained up in a 30-foot long storage container on his property.  ""He was the kind of Type Double A, hair-on-fire kind of guy. ... You felt that if he wanted to take you out, he could take you out easily,"" said Lawrence Shorts, a mortgage banker who worked on transactions with Kohlhepp. Kohlhepp made ominous comments about having trouble sleeping and how he would ""know where people live,"" Shorts said. A neighbor, Scott Waldrop, said Kohlhepp bragged about chasing people off his rural property with an arsenal including guns with silencers and night-vision equipment. ___ Colombia's government, rebels sign modified peace agreement HAVANA -- Colombia's government and its largest rebel group signed a new, modified peace accord in Havana on Saturday following the surprise rejection of an earlier deal by voters in a referendum. The latest agreement aims to address some of the concerns of opponents of the original accord, who said the deal was too lenient on a leftist rebel group that had kidnapped and committed war crimes.  ""The new deal is an opportunity to clear up doubts, but above all to unite us,"" said government negotiator Humberto de La Calle, who signed the accord along with rebel negotiator Ivan Marquez, moving to end a half-century-long conflict that has claimed more than 220,000 lives and driven almost 8 million people from their homes. De la Calle described the text of the modified accord as ""much better"" than the previous one, but didn't say if or how it would be submitted again to voters or to congress. President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia inked an initial peace deal on Sept. 26 amid international fanfare after more than four years of negotiations. But voters rejected it on Oct. 2 by just 55,000 votes, dealing a stunning setback to Santos who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end Colombia's conflict. ___ Death toll rises to 50 in IS-claimed blast in Pakistan QUETTA, Pakistan -- The death toll from a bomb blast at a Sufi shrine in southwest Pakistan Saturday has risen to 50 people with more than 100 wounded, officials said. The Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for the suicide attack at the shrine of Sufi saint Shah Bilal Noorani in the southwestern province of Baluchistan. Abdur Rasool, an official at the province's home ministry, said rescuers were transporting the wounded to hospitals and the dead to local morgues, but were struggling in the difficult mountainous terrain, some 350 kilometers (217 miles) south of the provincial capital, Quetta. The blast targeted worshippers as they were in the throes of their devotional ""dhamal"" dance, and the courtyard at the time was packed with families, women and children. The Islamic State group's statement on the IS-affiliated Aamaq news agency said the suicide attack had targeted ""Shiites."" The shrine is frequented by both Pakistan's Sunni Muslim majority and Shiite minority. IS considers all Shiite Muslims heretics. ___ Trump may revisit Trump Country during a victory tour NEW YORK -- Donald Trump may take a victory tour to states that elected him president, an aide said Saturday, as boisterous protests unfolded outside the tower where he holed up with members of his transition team and fielded calls congratulating him. While he's announced one decision -- putting Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge of the transition instead of Chris Christie -- Trump must identify other people for top White House jobs and Cabinet posts. The president-elect remained out of sight at Trump Tower, with streets outside swarming with thousands objecting to the results of Election Day. At one point, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, a liberal critic of Trump who nevertheless had predicted his victory, entered the tower lobby with a camera crew in tow and asked to see Trump. ""I just thought I'd see if I could get into Trump Tower and ride the famous escalator,"" said Moore, who did just that until he reached the fourth floor and the Secret Service told him he could go no higher. Kellyanne Conway, who was Trump's campaign manager and is almost surely in line for a prominent job in his presidency, told reporters in the tower lobby that Trump's choice of a chief of staff was ""imminent,"" though not coming Saturday. Whoever fills that post will set the tone for Trump's White House and be a main conduit to Capitol Hill and Cabinet agencies. Trump is said to be considering Steve Bannon, his campaign chairman and a conservative media executive, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus for the job. Neither has significant policy experience, though Priebus is well-liked in Washington and has ties with lawmakers. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

What could be more welcome in this cynical age than a collection of success stories proving that smart, pragmatic and farsighted leadership can solve the world's economic and political crises?  ""At a time when most of us have glumly concluded that our governments are broken and our domestic and international problems are insurmountable,"" Jonathan Tepperman writes, ""I aim to show how the right individuals can overcome the most intimidating obstacles -- if they follow the right strategies."" Tepperman, managing editor of Foreign Affairs, calls his book a ""data-driven case for optimism at a moment of gathering darkness.""  ""The Fix: How Nations Survive and Thrive in a World in Decline"" is organized around 10 case studies across the globe. Most fulfill the author's intention to write a ""good news book,"" but they often lack sufficient context or qualifications that would bring his optimism into better touch with reality. One of the most remarkable case studies is Rwanda's effort to mete out justice and reconciliation through local courts in 2 million cases in the wake of its horrific war between Hutus and Tutsis in the 1990s. No less dramatic is the author's account of the rise of Rwanda's president, Paul Kagame, the onetime rebel who led Tutsi forces to capture the capital, Kigali, and then years later set up a system to punish those guilty of genocide -- and reintegrate them into society. ""You can't do one at the expense of the other,"" Kagame tells Tepperman, who goes on to note Kagame's more recent authoritarian tendencies.  In another useful account, ""The Fix"" describes how President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico brought together three warring political parties to negotiate economic and political reforms, including the breakup of the failing state oil monopoly. All nations, Tepperman says, can ""follow Mexico's model -- one that involved quiet negotiation, painful compromise, political leaders willing to take risks and keep their word, and above all a recognition that zero-sum politics accomplishes nothing.""    ""The Fix: How Nations Survive and Thrive in a World in Decline,"" by Jonathan Tepperman (Tim Duggan Books)  But the book's main problem is precisely that its principal and oft-repeated point -- that the instances cited provide clear lessons for other countries and leaders -- is usually less than persuasive.  Canada, for instance, has surely achieved economic gains from luring immigrants and embracing a multicultural self-identity, surprising progress given that French Canadians were threatening to secede only a few decades ago. But Canadians do not have border issues like those in the United States and Europe, forcing them to cope with a flood of refugees and illegal immigrants. Canada's welcome mat, moreover, is rolled out only to foreigners with specific skill and education levels.  Indonesia has demonstrated some success in taming and co-opting Islamic extremists. But because the country is a diverse, secular and Pacific-oriented culture, it is not necessarily ""an invaluable object lesson"" for the Middle East, where fratricidal conflict among rival clerics, tribal groups, warlords and sects over the millennia has left a deep-rooted legacy of violence and hatred.  Tepperman rightly contends that South Korea deserves credit for its economic and political successes, including its progress in opening its formerly closed economy. But the book leaves the reader confused over whether the country has been helped or hurt by its history of brutal dictators, protectionism, currency manipulation, state intervention and favoritism shown to the giant industrial conglomerates known as chaebols.  Another chapter illuminates Brazil's success under then-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in establishing its Bolsa Familia program of income transfers, which Tepperman reports has raised incomes and quality of life for 55 million Brazilians and become ""one of the world's most ambitious antipoverty programs."" While Bolsa Familia has had a positive impact, as have other such programs in the United States and elsewhere, Tepperman skirts over the long-developing corruption scandal that has ensnared Lula and his successor, Dilma Rousseff, and the more salient factors that drove economic growth -- including Lula's overreliance on spiraling (and hidden) debts and on a boom in commodity exports to China that went bust last year. Closer to home, too, Tepperman tends to sugarcoat reality. He portrays former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg as a modern Pericles: ""Like the city he led, much about the man -- his wealth, his homes, his spending, and his policies -- now seem larger than life."" Bloomberg succeeded because he built on the accomplishments of his predecessors in creating open spaces, parks, infrastructure and higher-education opportunities, though the earlier groundwork on those efforts goes unmentioned in this book. Not to take anything away from Bloomberg's achievements in protecting New Yorkers, but he was hardly the first mayor to reform police intelligence practices, and Tepperman too casually dismisses the city's overreach in infiltrating mosques and ""suspected radical hangouts"" under Bloomberg, not to mention a stop-and-frisk program that was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge.   ""The Fix"" concludes with a list of verities that could be found in a high school civics textbook: Leaders should take risks, use unconventional approaches and take advantage of crises to initiate bold actions, but they should also reject ""maximalist"" demands that do not allow for compromise, respect checks and balances, and avoid ""costly"" mistakes.  In the end, for all its informative stories, ""The Fix"" falls short of the promised deep dive into what ails ""a world in decline,"" as the book's subtitle puts it. Tepperman seems to rely too heavily on a multitude of studies from think tanks, international organizations and scholars, in addition to self-serving interviews with heads of state. He remains convinced that the world's problems result from leaders not seizing on the fixes he identifies because they ""haven't yet found the wisdom and intestinal fortitude to do what's necessary."" It's hard to dispute that such qualities are in short supply, but equally hard to think that they alone can save the day.

(Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)  In the 16 months between launching his campaign by calling Mexicans rapists and closing it with an ad that recalled the ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,"" President-elect Donald Trump broke practically every rule of politics and rejected the norms of conventional wisdom at every turn. He insulted women, Gold Star families and war heroes. He mocked the disabled and traded barbs with the pope. He lied consistently about his record and claimed that the whole election was rigged against him. In most years, any one of those actions would disqualify candidates from office and ensure their defeat. Trump might not have been playing by the rules of politics, but he won the game. So how did he do it? Those looking to his career as a developer or reality TV host came up short in predicting Trump's survival and eventual victory, because those are only part of the story. The most important lessons Donald Trump ever learned were in a pro wrestling ring. Trump's decades-long relationship with the world of pro wrestling -- and its chief company, WWE, and chief mastermind, Vince McMahon -- has been well-documented. He sponsored two early WrestleManias, endorsed Jesse Ventura for president at one and headlined another (he didn't wrestle, but he did help ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin shave McMahon's head). In one storyline, he ""bought"" the WWE's flagship program, ""Monday Night Raw,"" causing the company's real-life stock to take a hit. He's even in the company's Hall of Fame. Trump's time in the squared circle wasn't simply a business venture: It was a chance to commune with McMahon, with whom he shares a nearly parallel biography. Born to leaders of regional industries, both men took over their fathers' businesses and turned them into national powerhouses. After ascending to the heights of American culture in the 1980s, they suffered setbacks -- legal, financial, personal -- in the '90s before roaring back to prominence at the turn of the new millennium, with the same ""You're fired!"" catchphrase, no less.   [I bought the website Trump.org. Then Donald Trump came after me.]   In pro wrestling, Trump found a world where his particular skills come in handy. Pro wrestling is a morality play where the hero (the ""babyface"" or simply ""face"") battles the villain (the ""heel""). The heel gets ""heat"" -- a negative reaction from the crowd -- by insulting his enemies and his audience, cheating at every turn and claiming that the game is rigged against him. The audience boos the heel and eagerly waits for the face to give him his comeuppance. Throughout this presidential campaign, Trump relished his role as a heel, and nearly every one of his positions, statements and actions had an analogue in the annals of pro wrestling. This week, political junkies who were also attuned to the rules of wrestling expected Trump to finally get his comeuppance by losing in dramatic fashion to Hillary Clinton. Obviously, that did not happen. So is the pro wrestling rulebook yet another one Trump has managed to rip up? Not quite. Heels do win. Arguably the best professional wrestler of all-time, Ric Flair, is a 16-time world champion who reigned for more than 3,000 days over his career, often for longer than a year at a time. Flair also dubbed himself the ""stylin', profilin', limousine-riding, jet-flying, kiss-stealing, wheelin' n' dealin' son of a gun,"" which the Donald would surely appreciate. Even today, the two top champions in the WWE are heels. Heels win championships because it's good storytelling to have a babyface chase after them. Eventually, a face will win and get the ""rub,"" or boost in stature within the WWE's hierarchy, that vanquishing a bastard heel provides. But not every face can climb that final mountain. If Donald Trump was the heel, then Hillary Clinton was the babyface (if a flawed one) in this campaign. She stayed cool, calm and collected, while Trump seemingly became more extreme as Election Day neared. Even though she played the face, though, a winning combination of voters never got behind her. Unlike the election, pro wrestling really is rigged, from top to bottom. The booker picks the faces and the heels, plots the storylines and determines the outcomes. If it is done well, the fans cheer the faces, boo the heels and buy tickets, merchandise and pay-per-views. But even the best booker misjudges his audience, from time to time. It even happened to McMahon, a billionaire who built a global entertainment brand. One of the biggest stars in the WWE today is Roman Reigns. He's a 31-year-old former football player with the physique of a Greek god, movie-star looks and a prestigious pedigree: he's a member of the Samoan Anoa'i family, which makes him a cousin of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. After he'd been wrestling for several years, it seemed as if Reigns had been chosen by McMahon to be the face of the company to succeed another star, John Cena, as Cena had followed The Rock and Stone Cold before him. Reigns won big matches, was thrust into the main event and was used as a PR spokesman, filming a PSA for the Ad Council's ""Fatherhood"" campaign and other promotional duties. Then the fans revolted. Even though everyone knows wrestling is rigged, McMahon's heavy-handed push of Reigns was a bridge too far. Most fans preferred Daniel Bryan, the scrappy, undersized vegan who up through the ranks of smaller, independent wrestling promotions before coming to WWE. Reigns is a prototypical babyface and the perfect candidate to carry the WWE into the next generation, but he can't get over with fans. From his look to his in-ring skill to his lineage, he's perfect on paper. Fans just refuse to root for him. Maybe what this week taught us is that Clinton is the Roman Reigns of presidential politics. Trump -- thanks to what he's learned from McMahon -- is Ric Flair. And with the conventional wisdom of politics in disrepair, perhaps we should be watching more WWE and less cable news to figure out what happens next."

Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   As I wrote Wednesday, presidents-elect deserve at least an initial benefit of the doubt. Toward that end, the hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts thought it would be useful to review the positive aspects of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Before that, a caveat: I am not claiming that these positives outweigh the negatives of Trump's campaign. The degree to which Trump's gaslighting and rhetoric turn American politics nasty and American public policy stupid remains to be seen. But just as some good things can be salvaged from a destructive war, there are some positives that can be salvaged from Trump's campaign. In the spirit of comity, let's focus on them for a few minutes. In no particular order: 1) The smashing of American political dynasties. Two years ago, most political pundits were expecting a Bush vs. Clinton general election race and feeling pretty depressed about it. The Bush and Clinton clans have dominated American politics for close to 30 years now. Some of that was merited -- George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton were above-average presidents. Despite their best efforts, however, neither Bush's children nor Clinton's spouse quite matched these accomplishments. The fact that the Bushes and Clintons were continually seen as front-runners in their party primaries was probably not healthy for American democracy in the long run. Donald Trump isn't exactly a hardscrabble bootstrapping tale of the American Dream, no matter how much untruthful hyperbole he tries to spread. But he is a relative newcomer to electoral politics, and managed to dispatch both a Bush and a Clinton this election cycle. That ain't beanbag. 2020 will be the first time in a while that a Clinton or a Bush will not be discussed at the top of a major party ticket. That's a good thing. 2) It's okay for Republicans to acknowledge the Iraq War was an unmitigated disaster. The only Republican running for president in 2004, 2008 or 2012 who thought the Iraq War was a mistake was Ron Paul. This stunted GOP foreign policy discourse for more than a decade. Trump supported the Iraq War, but his support was lukewarm and he turned against it by 2004. Having the GOP front-runner loudly declare it as a disaster -- and paying no political price for it in a Republican primary -- is no small political thing. Trump has half a point when he suggests that there needs to be some new foreign policy thinking in GOP circles. This is his best example. 3) Fiscal policy and infrastructure spending are live policy options. One of the few areas of policy consensus between Trump and Clinton was on infrastructure spending. With interest rates so low and America's infrastructure so dilapidated, government spending on this priority make eminent sense. House Speaker Paul Ryan might not like it, but leading Democrats like Chuck Schumer will. This might be an area where Trump gets his way. One last subversive point here for conservatives: The hard truth is that the only two Republicans to win the presidency in the post-Cold War era were pretty much stone-cold Keynesians when it comes to fiscal policy. 4) Republicans are focusing on the economically disadvantaged. I have expressed serious doubts about whether Trump's brand of economic populism will play as well as others think. I certainly don't think much of Trump's trade solutions to the perceived problem of economic stagnation. That said, in a country that is increasingly polarized, there is virtue in Trump's focus on citizens who have been hurt by globalization or automation or war. If nothing else, Trump's victory demonstrates the importance of those voters. As the Wall Street Journal editorialized, ""Mr. Trump is a walking rebuke to the general liberal indifference to economic stagnation, as if the status quo is the best this country can do."" As someone who has argued that after 2008 the system worked, this is worth some rumination. 5) Pointing out that political correctness has maybe run amok just a wee bit. My Post colleague Catherine Rampell covers this and covers it well; as a college professor, I just have to live it. I think some of these concerns have been vastly overblown, but I also can't deny that there are chilling effects when it becomes fashionable to label certain forms of speech as offensive and therefore completely out of bounds. This last point is the one that I am the most dubious about making. You don't need to be an emo college student to conclude that Trump's rhetoric has been racist and misogynistic at numerous intervals. But his victory does point out the ways that political correctness can also trigger political backlashes. A PC culture can ostracize people despite the professed aim of inclusion. Maybe some soul-searching on that front is in order."

A Hillary Clinton victory would have given a giant boost to top Democrats in Virginia. Running mate Tim Kaine was set to be the next vice president, longtime Clinton friend Gov. Terry McAuliffe was going to be the best-connected governor in the country, and many expected Rep. Bobby Scott to be Virginia's first black senator as Kaine's senate replacement. Clinton's victory in Virginia, the only one in a southern state, may bode well for future Democratic candidates, but for now it's largely a hollow win. Kaine and Scott will remain part of the minority in their respective chambers, and McAuliffe will spend his last year in office without a direct line to the White House. But the biggest turmoil from a Trump win may be within the state GOP, where gubernatorial candidates were already battling to claim Trump's supporters. Virginia's gubernatorial race, with a general election in November 2017, will test the power of Trump's popularity during the first months of his presidency. Next year's only other significant contests are races for New Jersey governor and New York City mayor. Trump supporter Flux Neo, an attorney in Virginia's deeply red southwest corner, said just how ""Trumpy"" Republicans were before Tuesday will be a key litmus test for future GOP contenders.  ""If you were anti-Trump, you're functionally dead to us as a candidate,"" said Neo. Even lukewarm support of Trump will be problematic, he added. Corey Stewart, one of Trump's earliest and most brash supporters in Virginia, said Tuesday's results have propelled him to the front of the GOP field for governor. He called it a high-risk, high-reward bet that is now paying off.  ""It was a Hail Mary pass. If this guy wins, I'm going to win. If he goes down in flames -- and there were several times when I thought that might happen -- I was going to go down in flames,"" said Stewart. Stewart, who is chairman of the Board of Supervisors in Prince William County, said he'll campaign on a promise of implementing Trump's policies in the state. He said that includes aggressive measures to deport undocumented immigrants. Complicating matters for Stewart is the fact that he was fired as chairman of the Trump campaign in Virginia during the final weeks of the election, after he organized an unauthorized pro-Trump protest outside the Republican National Committee's headquarters. But Stewart said he remains close to the Trump family, and his firing by political operatives won't diminish his support from the Trump faithful. Competing against Stewart for the GOP nomination is former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie, a polished political insider who endorsed Trump, but with muted enthusiasm. Gillespie has broad support from the party's establishment, but his style and background may make it difficult for him to connect with many of Trump's voters. For instance, Gillespie has been an outspoken advocate of expanding the GOP base to include more minorities, while Trump's hardline stance on immigration alienated many minority groups with his harsh rhetoric. On Wednesday, Gillespie's aides tried to play up his support for Trump's candidacy -- noting that Gillespie attended rallies with Trump running mate Mike Pence -- while attacking Stewart as an opportunistic ""career politician."" Conservative radio host John Fredericks, who succeeded Stewart as Trump's campaign chairman in Virginia, said both men will have to win over skeptical Trump supporters. He said Stewart tried to use his platform on the Trump campaign for self-promotion, and Gillespie made a ""calculated political decision"" to support Trump at arm's length.  ""It backfired on him,"" Fredericks said. Republicans Rep. Rob Wittman and state Sen. Frank Wagner also are running. Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam is the only Democratic candidate. Virginia governors are barred from serving consecutive terms. In the end, Northam may be best positioned to benefit from Trump's victory, as the Old Dominion's electorate typically votes against the president's party. Whether that history helps Northam now depends on the one of the most unpredictable political figures in modern history.  ""Historically, the people who lose the presidential election end up being the most motivated to win in Virginia a year later,"" said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. ""Everything will depend on how Trump does in his first year."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "
