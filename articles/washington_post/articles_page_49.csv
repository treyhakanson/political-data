Gen. Michael Flynn as they speak at a rally on Oct. 18 in Grand Junction, Colo. The president-elect has reportedly chosen Flynn to be his national security adviser. (George Frey/Getty Images)  As the incoming administration of Donald Trump assembles itself in the gold-plated suites atop Trump Tower, it's important to remember two components of his unlikely victory. The first is that Trump emerged from outside the Republican establishment structure. The second is that his campaign operated outside the party's normal rhetorical boundaries. Those two things were mutually reinforcing. Trump could say things like Mexican immigrants are rapists and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) isn't a hero because he wasn't bound by what the establishment thought was appropriate. And because he said those things, his campaign's earliest advocates were more likely to come from the party's fringes. On top of that we can layer one of Trump's personality traits: his demand for loyalty. Trump's transition team -- the group tasked with guiding him from election to inauguration -- is stocked with longtime allies who mostly climbed aboard the Trump Train while it was still building up speed. Trump's circles of trust are apparently few and tightly constrained: His children at the core, a few longtime allies a bit further out and his early political friends a bit further still. Trump clearly enjoys welcoming supplicants who once opposed him to Trump Tower, but for someone who values loyalty to the extent that Trump does, a bit of ring-kissing probably won't be enough. Within that context, Trump's first apparent administration picks make perfect sense. There's Michael Flynn, Trump's apparent pick for national security adviser. Flynn was ousted from his position at the helm of the Defense Intelligence Agency two years ago, kicking off an openly antagonistic relationship with the administration. His fervent support of Trump, including an aggressive speech at the Republican National Convention, was seen by his former colleagues as outside the norms of behavior for former generals. Flynn's advocacy for Trump stems from and overlaps with his attitudes about the fight against terrorism in the Middle East. On Twitter, Flynn has repeatedly offered questionable opinions. Earlier this year, he declared that it is ""rational"" to fear Muslims -- broadly, not just those who adhere to radical beliefs.   Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions... https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU -- General Flynn (@GenFlynn) February 27, 2016   Shortly before the election, he tweeted out a link to an obviously fake news story suggesting that the emails from Hillary Clinton being newly reviewed by the FBI showed evidence of serious, over-the-top crimes. In July, he retweeted an anti-Semitic tweet suggesting that Jewish people were trying to use the threat of Russian influence to distract from their own machinations. That tweet also reinforced another concern for Flynn: that he might be unusually sympathetic to Russia. Flynn was paid to give a speech for the Russian state-backed RT network in the country. At the event, he was seated at a table with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (One retired general told The Post that Flynn's colleagues ""thought it was so out of bounds, so unusual."") The same critique has been leveled against Trump, of course -- that he is seen as having a soft spot for the country and its leader. The pick of Flynn heightens that concern, as well as concerns about Trump's attitudes toward American Muslims.   Here's the internal DIA memo sent out under Flynn telling female employees to wear make up https://t.co/8f2k3C8Chj pic.twitter.com/wA0dC3IG9k -- Tierney Sneed (@Tierney_Megan) November 18, 2016   The apparent pick of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to serve as attorney general, meanwhile, sharply heightens concerns about Trump's attitudes toward the black community. Unlike Flynn, Sessions will need to be confirmed by the Senate, giving Republicans in that chamber ample opportunity to relitigate the concerns about race that sank Sessions's nomination to the federal bench three decades ago. During his confirmation hearing for the position in 1986, former colleagues of Sessions described racially inappropriate behavior, including alleged use of the n-word, calling a black colleague ""boy"" and joking about how he thought the Klan was okay until he heard that some members smoked marijuana. As attorney general, Sessions would oversee the government's civil rights enforcement mechanisms. Since winning his seat in the Senate, Sessions has been known for his hard-line position on immigration, which is largely how he and Trump found each other early in the campaign. He wasn't known as a leader in the Republican caucus, as we reported in July, but as a regular voice in the further-right conservative ecosystem. Then there's Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart head who was selected as a chief strategist to Trump, making him one of the two most senior aides to the president-elect. His counterpart? Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. The Bannon-Priebus pairing is the Trump tension in a nutshell, with Priebus as the straight-laced embodiment of the Republican establishment that's trying to figure out its new leader and Bannon as the outside agitator -- with his own serious baggage on issues of race and attitudes toward immigrants. (An effort to block Bannon from the White House has gained steam over the past week.) What Trump seems to be doing as he assembles his leadership team is the same thing that he did during the campaign. Encouraged to reach out and broaden the coalition of support he enjoyed, Trump instead doubled down on the charged rhetoric and hostility that earned him his core base of support in the first place. As it turns out, that was enough to flip enough states to win the electoral vote -- and Trump clearly thinks he has enough of a mandate to instantiate those positions in his leadership team. These picks are early ones and are largely going to people who have been closest to him over the course of the campaign. That may expand outward as more positions are identified; the apparent nod to Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) to head the CIA is one exception. But the Bannon-Flynn-Sessions triumvirate is a natural extension of the patterns that led Donald Trump to victory: People from outside the mainstream who reinforce and respond to Trump's more contentious political instincts. For those nervous about Trump's tenure -- inside and outside the GOP -- that combination has proven to be disconcerting."

"   Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump hold a rally in front of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, Calif., on Nov. 11. (BILL WECHTER/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  On Thursday evening, Donald Trump sent this inspiring pair of tweets, in which he perhaps unknowingly revealed exactly how he plans to make America great again:  Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016  I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016  Well, that sounds terrific! Here a Ford plant was all set to move to Mexico, and Donald Trump ""worked hard"" to keep it in Kentucky. I'll bet you know where the story goes from here, don't you? Yes, your suspicion was correct. Ford was never going to shut a plant in Kentucky and move it to Mexico. The company does have production in Mexico, and it has moved around which models are built where, but Trump hasn't saved any autoworkers' jobs (if you want to credit a president with saving autoworkers' jobs, you should thank the guy who's still in office for another two months). But I can promise you that in a very short time, millions of Trump supporters will be convinced that he saved thousands of jobs in Kentucky with just the force of his will. As Jesse Singal observed, within minutes of Trump sending his bogus tweet, the story was spreading in its fake version through the conservative media ecosystem. It's an inverse of the bitterly sarcastic ""Thanks, Obama"" meme, wherein the president's critics blamed him for everything that might go wrong in the country or their own lives, right down to whether their boss was a jerk. Trump's enthusiastic fans will find a way in their own minds to give him credit for anything, and they already are. Gallup recently reported that in the week before the election, just 16 percent of Republicans said the economy was improving; in the week after, that number shot up by 33 percentage points.      Donald Trump says the United States is too preoccupied with being politically correct. Here's how he bashes the idea of being too PC. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Trump is providing us a preview of what he'll do as president: He'll construct his own fake world for those who support him to inhabit, in which he's always right and deserves credit and praise for everything good that happens anywhere, whether he had anything to do with it or not. If there's positive news, he'll say it happened because of him. If there isn't any, he'll just make something up and take credit for that. We saw this fairly often during the campaign. In the first primary debate, Trump said, ""NATO is opening up a major terror division. ... I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO."" In fact, they weren't actually opening up a new terror division, and they'd been working on terrorism for years. When Iran released four American prisoners in January after months of delicate negotiations with the U.S. government, Trump said, ""I think I might have had something to do with it, if you want to know the truth."" In September he tweeted, ""Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies -- she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning."" That's despite the fact that presidential candidates have been holding rallies in front of airplanes pretty much since there were airplanes. Trump also took credit for Anheuser-Busch's decision to temporarily rename Budweiser ""America"" this summer. He was under the impression that before his campaign there were no deportations (""Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!""). And this isn't something he started doing when he ran for president; in 2014 he took credit for Apple's decision to make a large iPhone. As we go forward, you can expect Trump to regularly take credit for things that Obama did. Remember when he claimed that despite the fact that the official unemployment rate is below 5 percent, the ""real"" (i.e., imaginary) rate is more like 40 percent? Well, don't be surprised if after the January jobs report, Trump says, ""Unemployment is now under 5 percent! Everyone is saying it's because I'm making America great!"" He'll probably take credit for low inflation, the fact that we have the lowest proportion of uninsured Americans in history, and the opening weekend gross for ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."" Every president engages in an extended argument with his opponents about the state of the country, what its condition is, which indicators are important and relevant, and where responsibility lies for the things that go right and those that go wrong. Trump won't do this, at least not in the way we're used to. He'll create an entire alternate reality, one that has no relationship at all to the truth. Fortunately for him, his supporters already have plenty of practice convincing themselves that the actual facts are just something liberal elitists want to fool you into swallowing, and no phony story is too ludicrous to accept if it reinforces what you already believe. And you thought George W. Bush was the president of truthiness?

How can we avoid their charm?	"   (Washington Post illustration; iStock)  In June 2015, when Donald Trump descended the golden escalator in Trump Tower to launch his presidential campaign, something about his egotistical rhetoric felt uncomfortably familiar. A few weeks earlier, I had worked up the courage to walk out on a guy who had isolated me from my friends and chipped away my self-esteem. Sure, my ex's collections of Mason jars and Patsy Cline records appeared to have more in common with the Portland transplant cliche than the Manhattan real estate mogul. But after Trump's announcement, my failed relationship seemed tinged with the same exaggerated swagger. It took several sessions with a therapist for me to recognize that I had fallen prey to the charms of a narcissist. These days, you can hardly talk about narcissism without the president-elect coming up. In writing about the mind of Trump, psychologist Dan P. McAdams noted that a psychologist who specializes in manipulative personalities had even archived Trump footage to use in workshops, as he is a textbook example of narcissism. In this way, Trump has emerged as a caricature -- a pop-culture metaphor -- for the narcissists so many of us encounter in daily life. Because of that, I've found at least one way I can understand Trump voters: I know how such a character can intoxicate and dazzle you, especially in the early phases of a relationship. America and I have that in common. I also know how heartbroken you can feel when such a person inevitably lets you down. Now that the election is over, how can Americans avoid falling for narcissists in their personal lives? I spoke with McAdams and other psychologists to see if they could offer any clues. ""I think narcissism is not easily seen in what people do directly, but it's more about what they want,"" says McAdams, who chairs the department of psychology at Northwestern University. Narcissism may not be discernible in the way a person acts day to day, but it's generally present in their ""desires, goals and values,"" McAdams says. ""And when it comes to goals and values, narcissism is the goal to adore the self -- and love the self -- so much that you put it above everything and everyone else."" This personality trait was coined with the ancient Greek myth of Narcissus in mind. Narcissus, a proud and fit young hunter, saw his own reflection in water and fell in love with it -- unaware it was simply an image of himself. Does that sound like anyone you know? Simine Vazire, director of the Personality and Self-Knowledge Lab at the University of California at Davis, tells me that most people can identify certain ""subclinical"" narcissistic traits in others. ""After a few interactions, it should be pretty clear whether the person tends to be vain, condescending, brags a lot, feels entitled and so on,"" she says. ""How they react to others' misfortune is also pretty telling -- a lack of empathy is a key characteristic of narcissists."" But in today's social media era, ""narcissistic"" has become a catchall term for anyone who seems selfish or self-centered. That's why it's helpful to draw a distinction between people constantly snapping selfies and what clinical psychologists term ""narcissistic personality disorder,"" broadly defined as an inflated sense of grandiosity, a lack of empathy, a tendency to react angrily when things don't go their way and a need for constant admiration. All of this is often shrouded in an ultra-confident shell. It's against professional ethics, of course, for psychologists to diagnose people they haven't personally worked with, including celebrities, politicians like Trump and even that ex you've told your therapist about. All of the psychologists I spoke with refused to make such ad hoc diagnoses. Still, other insightful conclusions can be drawn. Joseph Burgo, a clinical psychologist and the author of ""The Narcissist You Know,"" describes narcissism as a spectrum, with most of us exhibiting some mildly narcissistic traits. In truth, you can't succeed at much of anything without some sense of self-agency and self-respect. Certainly, anyone who runs for president probably has a remarkable sense of self. But Burgo draws on research to suggest that roughly 1 in 20 people fall into a category he terms ""the extreme narcissist"" because of destructive behavior patterns. No surprise, he describes Trump in this way. ""The difference between everyday narcissists and extreme narcissists is that the latter build themselves up at the expense of other people. They inflate their own sense of self-importance by savaging the self-esteem of people around them,"" Burgo tells me. ""Examine your own unhealthy reasons for being in such a relationship and make an exit as soon as you can,"" he advises. Ouch. How can anyone fall in love with someone like that? ""People high in narcissism have a certain freewheeling, larger-than-life style,"" McAdams says. ""It's got to be extraordinarily compelling to be friends with, lovers with or even to be in the presence of someone who exudes that kind of self-confidence."" But he warns that once a narcissist stops dazzling, and when their false promises don't materialize, things can quickly sour -- often dramatically. ""Whether it's politics or relationships, it seems to me that narcissism is a really high-risk strategy,"" McAdams says. ""And there's nothing like the crash after a narcissistic person disappoints you."" Consider yourself warned.

Matteo Salvini has been one of the active ""no"" campaigners in the Dec. 4 constitutional referendum, on which Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has staked his political future. Renzi is calling for changes which would make it easier for the government to pass legislation. In an interview with Russian state TV broadcast Friday, Salvini voiced hope for Renzi's defeat, saying it would continue the anti-establishment trend of the British vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election. Salvini has sought to develop contacts in Russia. He has harshly criticized EU sanctions against Russia, saying that Italian businesses have lost $6 billion because of them.

White evangelicals voted for Trump in large numbers, while secular voters failed to turn out as strongly for Clinton. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  One question in the tumultuous 2016 presidential campaign was whether white evangelicals would ""come home"" to the GOP and vote for Donald Trump, given his history of divorce, crude language and lack of familiarity with the Bible. We now know from exit polls that they did -- in droves. As shown in the graph below, Trump did better among white evangelicals (81 percent) than Mitt Romney in 2012 (78 percent) or even George W. Bush in 2004 (78 percent), and far better than John McCain in 2008 (74 percent). This is a critical constituency, as white evangelicals made up 26 percent of the electorate in 2016. But perhaps an equally significant story line is the vote of nonreligious, or secular, Americans. In 2016, 15 percent of all voters did not identify with a religion, the so-called ""nones."" In the overall population, an even higher percentage -- one in five -- are nones, and their numbers are growing. Traditionally, this group leans Democratic. But Hillary Clinton's 68 percent among secular Americans was lower than Barack Obama's in 2012 (70 percent) and 2008 (75 percent). Her performance was similar to John Kerry's 67 percent in 2004.    Source: Exit polls  Why did Trump improve on past Republicans' support among evangelicals while Clinton lost ground among secular voters? One clue comes from voters' strength of commitment to their religious faith -- or lack thereof. Although we can't use the exit polls to examine how evangelicals' religious commitment affected support for Trump, we can draw on data from the 2016 American National Election Studies (ANES) Pilot Study. The survey was conducted during the primaries, but its questions about religious commitment, secular identity and feelings toward the candidates provide insight into how committed evangelicals and secularists reacted to Trump and Clinton. For evangelicals, their level of religious commitment can be measured by their frequency of church attendance. Evangelicals who report attending church regularly are more committed than those who rarely attend. Respondents to the pilot study were asked to rate Trump and his GOP competitors on a 100-point ""feeling thermometer."" Among Republican and independent evangelicals who rarely attend church, Trump was viewed more favorably than Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, himself an evangelical. But even among regular churchgoers, Trump trailed Cruz only by a tiny margin (62 to 66). Regardless of evangelicals' church attendance, they rated Clinton an extremely cold 15. Thus, Trump had solid support from evangelicals across the board even as early as the spring. Clinton, however, was strongly disliked. But Clinton's problem was not so much in failing to win over right-leaning evangelicals. After all, those were votes she was not expecting to win. Instead, she struggled among some secular voters. Clinton held a major advantage among secular Democrats and independents who called themselves atheist or agnostic, a group that might be described as having a stronger commitment to secularism. Her average rating was 56, while Trump's was 13. (This group gave Bernie Sanders a rating of 80.) But compared with Trump's strength among evangelicals, Clinton was relatively weak among the secular Democrats and independents who described their religion only as ""nothing in particular."" In the ANES pilot study, those respondents rated Clinton 53 on the feeling thermometer, with Trump trailing -- but not by much -- at 34. The consequences are evident in head-to-head matchups between Trump and Clinton. In the graph below, Trump had a large advantage over Clinton among evangelicals regardless of their religious commitment. While Clinton had strong support among atheists and agnostics, she lagged -- and Trump closed the gap -- among other secular voters.    Source: 2016 ANES Pilot Study  Trump's support among evangelicals is no doubt partly explained by the widespread antipathy toward Clinton (and Obama, whom evangelicals also dislike). Some were also likely voting for conservative Supreme Court justices, who Trump has promised to appoint. Despite concerns about Trump's moral character, evangelicals appear to be the base of the Republican Party, at least as long as the Democrats keep nominating candidates in the Obama-Clinton mold. For Democrats, the lesson may be that they can't take the nonreligious vote for granted. Seculars might become the bulwark of the Democratic electoral coalition someday, but they will have to find the right issues to mobilize them. One possibility is to appeal more strongly to seculars' staunch progressivism on economic, cultural and environmental issues. Democrats might also argue that seculars' values are under attack by the GOP, borrowing evangelicals' rhetoric of cultural embattlement. Whatever the specific message, seculars need to be courted and mobilized, as the Republicans have done with evangelicals. Clinton's performance raises questions about how well the Democrats have done that. Mark Brockway is a PhD student in political science at the University of Notre Dame. David Campbell and Geoffrey Layman are professors of political science at the University of Notre Dame."

(Warner Bros. Pictures)  Movie ticket sales surged 50 percent last weekend in North America, compared with the same time a year ago, and you can probably guess why: It was a long, painful week, and not just for the Hillary Clinton fans. The divisions in our country became starkly clear and, despite pleas from both sides of the aisle for the nation to come together, citizens seemed more entrenched and angry than ever. Luckily, we have movies -- the perfect escape.      As the highly-anticipated prequel to the ""Harry Potter"" series hits theaters, here are some of the nods ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" makes to its predecessor. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)   Except when they're not. Those looking to take a break from earthly fears might instinctively turn to the big sci-fi and fantasy offerings: ""Arrival"" is marketed as a movie about an alien invasion, and ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" seems like a whimsical return to the ""Harry Potter"" universe. But what viewers will actually find in both films is an incisive commentary on the current state of our country. Otherworldly movies have a history of getting political, of course. In everything from ""District 9"" to ""E.T.,"" we saw humans greet aliens with suspicion, if not full-fledged vitriol, much like some people approach immigrants. ""Avatar"" was an excuse to critique colonialism and the destruction of natural resources. ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" showed the hazards of totalitarianism.    Amy Adams plays a linguist communicating with aliens in ""Arrival."" (Jan Thijs/Paramount Pictures)  ""Arrival"" brought in $24 million last weekend, far exceeding most predictions, but there were probably quite a few people stunned to find out that it's not really a movie about aliens. (That might explain the relatively low Cinemascore of B from audiences, while the reviews were almost universally glowing.) ""Arrival"" is actually about the perils of miscommunication and false assumptions. It's a movie about how precarious a dire situation becomes when we stop talking to each other. Sound familiar?   [Sleek, sophisticated and thoughtful 'Arrival' joins a mini golden age of sci-fi films]   Directed by Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners,"" ""Sicario""), the movie follows a morose linguist, Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), who is recruited by the military to communicate with a couple of aliens that are hovering in a stunning ovoid above Montana. Banks is terrified at what might happen but dutifully agrees to help. (Warning: Some mild spoilers ahead.) After donning a Hazmat suit, she ascends into the vessel, where she is confronted by a couple of beasts that look like giant walking hands ambling around a foggy enclosure on the other side of a glass wall. They communicate with her using circular symbols that emanate like inky smoke from their starfish-like ""hands."" At one point, Banks takes off her protective gear and explains to her apoplectic handlers that she needs to let the aliens see her. She puts her hand against the glass to say hello. In response, one of the creatures sends its slimy starfish hurtling against the glass with a thwack. It's startling, and you can understand why any normal human might be afraid of these beings. And some people are. The spaceship above Montana is just one of a dozen around the globe. At first, each country beset by visitors collaborates. For a shining moment, the world is unified. But pretty soon, communication falters, and China prepares for war. Louise isn't so sure that's the right decision. Unfortunately, China -- which, you'll recall, Donald Trump cast as an enemy throughout his campaign -- has shut down the conversation about the visitors, and other nations quickly follow suit. So much for unity. Without giving away the ending, let's just say that the beautiful and profoundly emotional movie makes a case for a few things. The first is that foreign visitors do not necessarily mean to do us harm. The second is that we should probably listen to scientists rather than alarmist intuition. The third is that combative nationalism doesn't exactly make for a more peaceful world.    Redmayne as Newt, right, opposite Dan Fogler, in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."" (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures)  You'll find another argument against insularity in the biggest new release this week, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."" The movie follows wizards in 1920s New York who exist in the shadows, hiding from normal humans (or ""No-Majs""), for fear of persecution. The wizards, though, are not much better than the humans when it comes to open-mindedness. They see the fantastic beasts of the title as a threat. All manner of lovable monsters could either hurt people or blow a wizard's cover, the spell-casters reason. The beasts' ally is the protagonist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), who collects and studies them. ""We should be protecting them instead of killing them,"" Newt explains to the president of the Magical Congress (who, by the way, is a black woman, played by Carmen Ejogo). J.K. Rowling, who wrote the screenplay for this ""Harry Potter"" spinoff, is no stranger to politics. Her ""Potter"" series had plenty of pointed subtext about xenophobia and the dangers of authoritarian regimes. Likewise, ""Fantastic Beasts"" ""grew out of things that are very important to me in the world at the moment,"" she told the New York Times. Things like the Brexit vote, for example, which Rowling vocally opposed. ""Nationalism is on the march across the Western world, feeding upon the terrors it seeks to inflame,"" she wrote in an essay on her website, in which she drew a link between the isolationist ""leavers"" and the supporters of Trump. ""Every nationalist will tell you that their nationalism is different, a natural, benign response to their country's own particular needs and challenges, nothing to do with that nationalism of yore that ended up killing people, yet every academic study of nationalism has revealed the same key features."" It is not just supernatural movies that are (somewhat unwittingly) echoing our current predicaments. A year ago, after the Supreme Court's same-sex-marriage ruling, ""Loving"" might have come across as the hopeful story of the case that laid the groundwork for progress and equal rights. The intimate drama about the couple whose 1967 Supreme Court victory helped overturn the laws against interracial marriage would have seemed to be an example of how far we've come. But now, with the uptick in racist rhetoric and hate crimes, the Lovings' story does not seem so far away. Instead of a history lesson, it's an urgent reminder that people are people and that love is love.   [The postelection hate spike: How long will it last?]      In ""Loving,"" Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga star as Richard and Mildred Loving. (Ben Rothstein/Focus Features)  In another likely Oscar contender, ""Moonlight,"" the villains are bullies, and they target the movie's main character, a young black boy discovering his homosexuality, because he is different. Despite the film's heart-wrenching trajectory as the protagonist realizes the power of love to overcome so much pain, the reality is never far from our minds. Our president-elect shocked many by mocking a disabled reporter on camera much like, well, a bully. These movies don't offer escapism -- but that might not be what we really need. You can't walk out of ""Arrival"" or ""Moonlight"" without feeling some kind of emotional catharsis. And Newt Scamander of ""Fantastic Beasts"" is an inspiring and soft-spoken activist who refuses to be intimidated. He vows to protect the imperiled beings that can't defend themselves. None of that is going to help a viewer forget what is happening in the world, but maybe it can give them something better: an empathetic template for how to move forward."

Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners and a subsidiary asked the court on Tuesday to let them lay pipe under a Missouri River reservoir, a plan the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says threatens its drinking water and cultural sites. The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday it needs more time to study the impact of the plan. While President-elect Donald Trump, a pipeline supporter, likely would greenlight the project when he takes office in January, the company is trying to win federal approval -- or a court order -- to allow it to go forward sooner. The delay has already cost nearly $100 million, the company said in court documents, ""and further delay in the consideration of this case would add millions of dollars more each month in costs which cannot be recovered."" In a statement Tuesday, the company blamed the Obama administration for ""political interference"" in the pipeline review process. The Army Corps referred a request for comment to the Justice Department, which declined comment. Protests were being held Tuesday across the country, from California to Vermont. Activists called for demonstrations at Army Corps of Engineers offices and at banks financing the pipeline construction. More than two dozen people were arrested near Mandan, North Dakota, after a group of about 400 protesters put a truck and tree branches on BNSF Railway tracks near a pipeline work staging area and tried to set it on fire, Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller said.  ""They had a rope soaked with kerosene,"" he said. ""A (Highway Patrol) trooper with an extinguisher doused it so it wouldn't light."" Trains were delayed three hours, railroad spokeswoman Amy McBeth said. Officers in riot gear used pepper spray and in one instance a stun gun against protesters who refused to leave. Mandan is about 50 miles north of a camp where hundreds of protesters have gathered in recent months to oppose the pipeline. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental attorney and president of the New York-based Waterkeeper Alliance, which seeks to protect watersheds worldwide, visited the camp Tuesday, speaking out against the arrests of protesters and a project he says will benefit billionaires and not the American people.  ""What they are doing here is a crime, an environmental crime, and there are real victims,"" he said. In Columbus, Ohio, police reported an activist blocked traffic by handcuffing himself under a vehicle at a downtown intersection. In Montpelier, Vermont, more than 100 people gathered outside a bank, chanting, singing songs and holding signs saying ""Water is Life"" and ""Standing With Standing Rock.""  ""It may seem hopeless, like David against Goliath, but we believe that if we're persistent and we recruit, that this movement will grow and hopefully these kinds of projects will stop,"" said protester Lee Shen of Thetford Center, Vermont. The Corps on Monday called for more study and input from the Standing Rock Sioux before it decides whether to allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The 1,200-mile pipeline that's to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois is largely complete except for that stretch, which will skirt the tribe's reservation. Gov. Jack Dalrymple said Tuesday that an additional delay ""does nothing but prolong and intensify the public safety issues imposed on Morton County and the state of North Dakota since the beginning of August,"" when protests against the pipeline broke out. In his statement, Dalrymple said a decision on the project easement ""is long overdue"" and that the pipeline would be safe. The Corps in July granted Energy Transfer Partners the permits needed for the project, but it said in September that further analysis was warranted, given the tribe's concerns. Its announcement Monday came amid speculation that federal officials were on the brink of approving the crossing. ETP last week began preparing equipment to bore under the river. ETP disputes that the pipeline would endanger the tribe, and CEO Kelcy Warren noted earlier that Army Assistant Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy had informed company officials and Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault that the Corps' previous permit decisions ""comported with legal requirements."" ETP contends that the Corps has no legal justification for the delay. ___ Associated Press writer Dave Kolpack contributed to this story from Fargo, North Dakota.

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/for-ecb-and-fed-trump-complicates-decisions-on-rate-policy/2016/11/14/9a149f40-aa8e-11e6-8f19-21a1c65d2043_story.html	For ECB and Fed, Trump complicates decisions on rate policy	" FRANKFURT, Germany -- Donald Trump's surprise election victory has helped solidify expectations for an interest rate increase next month by the U.S. Federal Reserve -- but may have complicated a decision for the European Central Bank, which faces a difficult choice over more stimulus. For the ECB, the issue is what to do about its bond-buying program, which pumps new money into Europe's struggling economy each month to try to accelerate growth and inflation. The Fed and the ECB -- two of the world's most important central banks -- will be making its policy decisions before Trump is inaugurated Jan. 20, while still weighing what he might do as president. At its meeting Dec. 8, the ECB must decide whether to keep its money spigot open or slowly start closing it by reducing, or tapering, the bond purchases. Uncertainty about the policies Trump will pursue -- and whether, and by how much, they might help spur global growth -- has made the ECB's decision more difficult. Some analysts think the ECB will decide to extend its bond buying program by at least six months beyond its scheduled end in March. For the Fed, the question is whether to follow through on expectations that it will raise interest rates when its next policy meeting ends Dec. 14. It would be the Fed's first move since it raised its key short-term rate from a record low late last year, and it would reflect a strengthened U.S. economy that is able to absorb higher borrowing rates. At first, Trump's victory caught investors off guard and suddenly intensified uncertainty about how the Fed might respond. The still-unclear details of the president-elect's economic priorities added a new consideration for the Fed. But in part because of the calm that's prevailed in stock markets since the election, traders have put the likelihood of a rate hike next month at 81 percent, according to the CME Group. Most investors expect Trump's efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy to produce higher debt, higher inflation and higher rates -- all negatives for bonds. In response, they've been yanking money out of bonds, sending prices tumbling and wiping out months of gains. The prospect of higher inflation, in fact, is another reason the markets expect the Fed to follow through on raising rates in December. Some of Trump's ideas, such as spending $1 trillion on tunnels, bridges, roads and ports, and removing some regulations, could boost growth. Such prospects -- uncertain as they are -- have already lifted stock prices for companies that would benefit, such as construction equipment maker Caterpillar. And if the idea of infrastructure spending catches on in Europe, it could help the economy there too, particularly in the 19-country eurozone. Since the global financial crisis, the monetary union has focused largely on cutting spending. That helps reduce debt but also puts a brake on economic growth. Members of the euro face rules restricting debt and deficits. But the will to enforce the rules seems to have weakened even before the U.S. election, with the European Commission giving Portugal, for example, more time to bring its deficit into compliance. The ECB's stimulus has wide-ranging implications for investors, savers and companies. Ultra-low interest rates -- one product of the stimulus -- have reduced returns on savings, pushed investors into riskier markets like stocks and real estate, and increased pressure on pension programs. Low rates have also weakened the earnings of banks, making some more hesitant to issue loans, which are vital to economic growth. The ECB's decision was already complicated by having to weigh the benefits of more stimulus against those side effects. Economists Joerg Kraemer and Marco Wagner at Commerzbank are among those who think the ECB will be under pressure to extend the stimulus. Their reasoning: More and more voters in Europe, too, are turning against the political establishment. That means the ECB would be left with the burden of helping the economy through its stimulus programs and low rates, the two wrote in a research note. Others, like Ben May, an economist at Oxford Economics, argue that a steady improvement in the eurozone economy could lead the ECB to announce a tapering of its stimulus program or put off its decision for a month. The number of unemployed is steadily falling. Inflation has crept up to 0.5 percent in October, far from the ECB's goal of just under 2 percent, but better than the negative readings as recently as May. The calendar of political events, however, suggests the euro currency union could be in for more shocks. -- A referendum on constitutional changes in Italy on Dec. 4 -- four days before the ECB decision -- could, if rejected, topple the government. -- A repeat runoff election for president of Austria on the same day could bring right-wing populist Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party into office. -- British Prime Minister Theresa May wants to start by the end of March the official talks to bring the country out of the European Union. Britain is not in the euro, but is a major trade partner, and the talks on its exit could shake confidence. -- In France, two rounds of voting for president in April and May could see National Front leader Marine Le Pen make the second round. The National Front wants to leave the European Union and restrict immigration. All that uncertainty could depress business activity as people await the outcome of the votes, says IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer. He thinks the ECB will extend its 1.74 trillion euro ($1.9 trillion) bond-buying program by six months at the current rate of 80 billion euros a month:  ""It makes an already uncertain political landscape for the eurozone in 2017 look even more uncertain...that could lead to increasing business caution and make growth that little bit more difficult.""
