Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday that ""some Turkish officers working in the NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working."" Each country will assess the claims individually, Stoltenberg said in Brussels. He did not identify the countries or the numbers involved, or give reasons for the requests. German media have reported asylum claims in Germany by members of the Turkish military. Turkey has arrested thousands of members of its military following the July coup attempt, and Stoltenberg noted that Turkey has made ""numerous"" changes in its NATO personnel. Stoltenberg is traveling to Istanbul on Sunday. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

The paper is at the center of a controversy over a cartoon depicting Aborigines. (Rick Rycroft/AP)  SYDNEY -- Emboldened in part by the rise of right-wing populists like Donald Trump, Australia's conservatives are using an official investigation into a cartoon to pursue a long-cherished goal: They want to dismantle a law protecting minorities from abuse. Conservatives have expressed outrage at -- and skillfully exploited -- a decision by Australia's Human Rights Commission to investigate a cartoon published in a national newspaper controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch that was widely condemned as racist. The cartoon illustrated a police officer lifting up a teenager by his shirt collar. Speaking to an Aboriginal man holding an open car of beer, the policeman says: ""You'll have to sit down and talk to your son about personal responsibility."" The man replies, ""Yeah, righto -- what's his name then?"" After receiving a complaint from two Aboriginal men, the commission is considering if the cartoon, published in August, breaches a ban on insulting or humiliating anyone on the basis of race or national origin. Offenders can be sued but can't be sent to jail. The body that oversees newspaper standards launched its own an investigation after receiving 700 complaints from the public. The racial vilification law is bitterly opposed by conservatives, who have campaigned against it for years. By portraying the commission's investigation as a dangerous infringement of free speech and bureaucratic overreach, they built enough political momentum to convince the center-right Turnbull government this month to instruct a parliamentary committee to review the law, the first stage to abolishing or changing it. ""It's a bad, bad law but you've also got, frankly, a pretty crook [sick] organization, the Human Rights Commission, which is persecuting people based on this bad law,"" a former prime minister and leading conservative, Tony Abbott, said in a television interview on Nov. 11. The review began Nov. 8. In a rare moment of unity, Jewish and Muslim groups are trying to mobilize public support for the law, which they regard as an important protection against oral and written abuse that sometimes leads to violence. ""At a time when xenophobia in Australia is rising, this legal provision is essential to help maintain social cohesion,"" said Colin Rubenstein, the executive director of the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council, in an email. There are protections in the law for comments made in good faith, even if they offend minorities. The Human Rights Commission says it is obliged to consider all complaints it receives. Liberals say the agency is being unfairly portrayed as trying to police public speech and it offers important protections at a time when anti-Muslim politicians are gaining strength. The cartoonist at the center of the controversy, Bill Leak, has a history of pushing boundaries in the Australian, a nationally circulated right-wing newspaper. After publishing a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris last year he was urged by security agencies to move out of his Sydney home for his own safety. His new house in a sleepy coastal town has three emergency buttons to summon help and a reinforced panic room. He uses an alias online. ""You are talking to the Salman Rushdie of the Central Coast,"" he joked in a recent phone interview. ""What is going on? Why are people taking cartoons so f---ing seriously?"""

The scattered problems mostly involved the sort of glitches that arise in every election, including discrepancies in the voter rolls, with no immediate indication of a snag big enough to meaningfully alter the overall vote count.  ""The biggest surprise is how uneventful things have been with this large a turnout,"" said Illinois State Board of Elections spokesman Jim Tenuto. ""Everyone was expecting more problems than this -- and nothing."" In Texas, a computer malfunctioned at a polling place in suburban Houston, and voters were briefly sent to another site more than two miles away. In key battleground North Carolina, a computer problem in the Democratic stronghold of Durham County triggered long lines when election officials had to rely on a paper check-in process. Several precincts there extended their closing times up to an hour A computer glitch in Colorado forced in-person voters to cast provisional ballots, though there was no evidence the network was hit by hackers. Some people in North Carolina and Virginia complained they were not on the rolls despite registering through the motor vehicle departments. And in Dover, New Hampshire, polls were staying open for an extra hour because the city mistakenly sent an email to voters with the wrong closing time. Outside a Florida polling place, a woman campaigning for Donald Trump pepper-sprayed a Hillary Clinton voter. There were reports of voters waiting for hours to cast their ballots in such states as Missouri and Utah. Some polling places in the Phoenix metropolitan area had more than 100 voters lined up at 6 a.m. The voting unfolded amid repeated but unsubstantiated claims from Trump that the election would somehow be rigged. His exhortations to followers to watch for fraud at the polls gave rise to fears of vigilantism and harassment. There was also anxiety that hackers might attack voting systems.  ""Overall, the story that everyone was expecting -- mass reports of voter intimidation -- hasn't happened,"" said Wendy Weiser, head of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU's Law School. ""I've definitely seen an uptick in it ... but it's not the overriding story of the election, which certainly ought to be a relief to many."" Trump again suggested the election might not be on the up-and-up. His campaign said it was seeking an investigation in the battleground state of Nevada over reports that some voters were allowed to get in line after poll closing times. In an interview on Fox News, Trump would not say whether he would accept the outcome.  ""We're going to see how things play out today and hopefully they will play out well and hopefully we won't have to worry about it,"" he said. Later in the interview, he said, ""It's largely a rigged system."" Fears of voter intimidation and fraud led to a flurry of lawsuits in the run-up to Election Day, and new voter regulations in more than a dozen states also held the potential to sow confusion at polling places. In Philadelphia, one of the places Trump had suggested were ripe for fraud, District Attorney Seth Williams said that as of the afternoon, there were no substantiated reports of voter fraud or intimidation, and ""no walking apocalypse of zombies voting around town."" Meanwhile, state election officials were guarding against any attempt to breach their computer systems. Forty-eight states accepted ""cyber hygiene"" help from the Homeland Security Department to patch their networks and root out problems that could allow hackers in, and the remaining two states hired contractors to do the same, officials said. With voters casting ballots in 9,000 jurisdictions and more than 185,000 precincts, the decentralized nature of the U.S. voting system was seen as a major protector against a hacker having any sizeable effect on the vote. ___ Associated Press writers Diana Heidgerd in Dallas; Ron Todt in Philadelphia; Michael Tarm in Chicago, Desmond O.

Anthony’s grave with ‘I voted’ stickers as ‘Pantsuit Nation’ votes	"   Gloria A. Rodriguez, 53, wore all-white to cast her vote for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Austin Tuesday morning. (Eva Ruth Moravec)  Lisa Lindstrom, 47, a nurse practitioner and registered Democrat in D.C., picked out her Election Day outfit carefully: a pantsuit (the only one she owns) to signal her support for Hillary Clinton; a white ruffled blouse to evoke the suffragettes; a jacket she'd worn to the White House last year when she met President Obama; and a pearl necklace that had belonged to her grandmother, Harriett, who passed away in 1996. ""She would have killed to vote for Hillary today,"" Lindstrom said. ""I'm a lot more overcome with emotion than I expected to be. I didn't think this election was going to mean as much to me as it has."" ""Pantsuit Nation"" was out in force Tuesday. Women supporting Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, posted photos on social media, often with their young daughters in tow. Some wore ""Nasty Woman"" T-shirts, in reference to Donald Trump's growling insult  during the third presidential debate.      In Rochester, New York, voters line up for the chance to honor women's suffragist Susan B. Anthony by placing an ""I Voted"" sticker on her tombstone. News 8 WROC broadcasted a Facebook Live on Nov. 8 to show the scene near the tombstone at Mount Hope Cemetery. (News 8 WROC Rochester)   In Rochester, N.Y., women covered the gravestone of Susan B. Anthony with ""I voted"" stickers. Many wore white in honor of Anthony, who fought for women's suffrage, an effort that culminated with the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. Women have been on the national ballot before, but never as the presidential nominee for one of the two major parties. ""I never cried when I filled out my ballot before. But I realized my daughters -- and I have three of them -- have the right to vote for a woman. It made me cry,"" a woman named Jodi Atkin told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.   [Inside the huge, 'secret' Facebook group for Hillary Clinton's biggest fans]      (Courtesy of Bethany Usher)  Even though Clinton would be the first woman to serve as president after 43 men preceded her, the groundbreaking -- or ceiling-shattering -- nature of her candidacy was never the most dominant feature of the 2016 campaign. Clinton and her surrogates in recent weeks more eagerly embraced gender politics after her GOP rival became entangled in sexual assault allegations. On the eve of the election, at her rally in Philadelphia, Clinton repeated one of her favorite lines, saying that if Trump accused her of playing the woman card by advocating for equal pay for women, ""Deal me in!"" But for much of the past year, Trump's polarizing message and unpredictable campaign style soaked up most of the media attention. Clinton is such a familiar figure -- a former first lady, senator and secretary of state -- that the novelty of her White House bid may have been lost in the chaos of the campaign. On Election Day, though, many women pondered what a big deal this is for a country that's never had a female Chief Executive. In interviews, women who support Clinton described being caught off guard by the emotional resonance of their vote. Twitter users deployed the hashtag #DedicateYourVoteToAWoman to do just that, paying tribute to women who inspired them to vote for Clinton. Many women shared  stories and photos of their mothers, grandmothers, sisters, daughters and feminist icons. One website called IWaited96Years features women born before the 19th Amendment was ratified. The site began when family members posted online a photo 98-year-old Estelle L. Schultz casting an absentee ballot for Clinton, and now features photos and stories of 162 other women ranging from age 96 to 104. ""I had tears in my eyes as I was sitting there in our local community center filling out the ballot,"" said Bethany Usher, 46, a university administrator who lives in Springfield, Va. and is the mother of two teenage daughters. ""It is overdue,"" she said. ""She was bullied and degraded in public by a less qualified man. The fact that she was able to overcome that, and maintain her poise and her confidence. . . . Watching this has made it more inspiring, watching one more barrier get broken."" Half a continent away, in Austin, Gloria A. Rodriguez, 53, a paralegal, wore all-white, including a white hat, to cast her vote for Clinton at a grocery store. ""This is pretty exciting,"" she said, showing off an ""I voted"" sticker on the lapel of her button-down white shirt. ""It's historic and it means a lot to me to vote for a woman, and as a woman."" She added that Trump ""brought the Hispanics out to vote against him."" In Atlanta, Lonna Young, 47, an accountant, said she voted for Clinton not because she's a woman but because she was the most qualified candidate. But she recalled a day six years ago when she sat down with her 7-year-old daughter to talk about the history of the American presidency. Her daughter asked: ""Where are the women?"" ""I was like, 'You really don't even know how deep that question is',"" Young said. She said of her daughter, now 13, ""I'm hoping she can see the significance of this, if not at this moment then in a few years when she can vote.""   [Updates on the 2016 election: Voting and race results]   In southern California, Elizabeth Fitzsimons, 43, a vice president with the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, took her 12-year-old daughter Natalie with her to the polling precinct at an elementary school. She said she told Natalie: ""It wasn't very long ago that women weren't even allowed to vote. It hasn't been that long. This is amazing that we're voting for a woman to be president."" Fitzsimons then wrote a note to Natalie's first-period history teacher, asking forgiveness for being late to school, writing, ""I felt it was important for her to see me vote for our first woman president on this historic day.""

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/73239c86-a612-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	Exit Poll: Americans cast ballots while holding their noses	" WASHINGTON -- Americans emphatically declared their anger at government Tuesday as they elected a political outsider who failed to generate much excitement but offered the prospect of change. Exit polls recorded the simmering discontent of the American electorate. Four in 10 voters said they were hungry for change, and those voters overwhelmingly favored Republican Donald Trump. Smaller voting blocs who were seeking a candidate with good judgment, experience or who cared about them favored vanquished Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton. Nearly 7 in 10 voters said they were unhappy with the way the government is working, including a quarter who said they were outright angry, according to preliminary results of exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. Three-fourths of those angry voters backed Trump. Six in 10 voters said the country is on the wrong track. Other findings from the exit poll: TRUMP'S WORKING-CLASS WHITES TRUMP CLINTON'S COALITION Trump won by dominating among white voters, especially non-college-educated men, trumping Clinton's coalition of women, minorities and young people. Trump, who once famously declared that he loved the uneducated, got plenty of love back from white voters who never graduated from college: He got 7 in 10 votes from non-college-educated white men and 6 in 10 votes from non-college-educated white women. The advantage Trump had among whites without a college degree compared with whites who graduated from college was the largest seen in exit polls for a Republican since the surveys started in 1972. Clinton, meanwhile, got the support of less than a quarter of white men without a college degree; Barack Obama, by contrast, drew about a third of their votes four years ago. Clinton did make some inroads with college-educated white women. Just over half supported her, while four years ago just over half of that group had backed Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. TIMES TWO What kind of impact did third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein have on the race? They siphoned more votes from Clinton than from Trump. A quarter of Johnson and Stein voters said they would have backed Clinton if they had to pick between the two major-party candidates. About 15 percent would have backed Trump. But most Johnson and Stein voters said they would have just stayed home if their only choices were Clinton and Trump. RACIAL SPLIT Even with his tough talk about Mexican immigrants, Trump held on to roughly the same share of Hispanic voters as Romney had claimed four years ago. Likewise, he was drawing about the same levels of support from black voters as Romney won. The Republican was drawing about a quarter of Hispanic voters and about less than 1 in 10 black voters. Clinton did better with Hispanic voters who were naturalized citizens, getting about 8 in 10 of their votes. She got about 6 in 10 Hispanic voters who were born U.S. citizens. Trump was winning more than half of white voters, who made up 70 percent of the electorate. TO BE HONEST ... Neither Trump nor Clinton gets bragging rights when it comes to honesty. About 6 out of 10 voters said they don't view Trump as honest and about the same share felt the same way about Clinton. Opinions were more mixed on the question of temperament. Only about a third of Americans said Trump had the temperament to be president, while more than half felt Clinton did. THE GENDER GAP It was Trump's working-class white men who helped to produce a gender gap with a capital ""G'' for Clinton. Tuesday's election was on track to produce the largest gender gap since the exit poll began: The gender gap for Clinton -- the difference between the number of men who voted for her and the number of women who voted for her -- hit 13 percentage points. Clinton's support among women was roughly even with the support that women gave Obama in 2008 and 2012. The bigger factor in this year's wide gender gap: less-educated white men, who favored Trump far more heavily than they did Romney in 2012 or GOP nominee John McCain in 2008. The only presidential candidate that came close to Clinton's gender gap this year was Democrat Al Gore, who had a 12-point gender gap in 2000. MILLENNIALS VS. ELDERS Clinton largely managed to hang on to the millennials who were such a big part of Obama's winning coalition. Young people age 18-29 supported Clinton over Trump by nearly as strong a margin as their support of Obama over Romney in 2012. Those between 30 and 44 also were much more likely to support Clinton than Trump. Trump won the favor of those 45 and over. PESSIMISM AND ANGER There were grim strains woven into voter sentiments as they cast their ballots. Nearly 7 in 10 voters said they were unhappy with the way the government is working, including a quarter who were outright angry. Six in 10 voters said the country is seriously on the wrong track and about the same number said the economy was either not good or poor. Two-thirds saw their personal financial situation as either worse or the same as it was four years ago. One in three voters said they expect life to be worse for the next generation. HOLDING THEIR NOSES Americans held their noses as they picked between the candidates: More than half of voters cast their ballots with reservations about their candidate or because they disliked the others running. That was true both for those backing Trump and those supporting Clinton, the exit polls showed After a long, hard-fought campaign, just 4 out of 10 voters strongly favored their candidate. The prospect of a Trump victory was downright scary to plenty of voters: Seven in 10 Clinton voters said they'd feel scared by Trump victory. WOMEN'S ISSUES VS. EMAIL ISSUES After all of the sound and fury over Trump's treatment of women, it turned out the issue bothered half of all voters a lot -- and women were more concerned about it than men. About 6 in 10 women were bothered a lot, compared to about 4 in 10 men, the exit poll found. It turned out voters were somewhat less concerned about Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state. That issue mattered a lot to about four in 10 voters, including about 9 in 10 Trump voters. ___ The survey was conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research with 23,583 voters as they left their polling places at 350 randomly selected sites throughout the United States supplemented by 4,404 telephone interviews with mail, early and absentee voters. The results among all those voting have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. ___ Associated Press Writer Bill Barrow contributed to this report. ___ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/520073dc-a610-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	Preliminary exit polling data in Virginia: economy top worry	 RICHMOND, Va. -- Democrat Hillary Clinton won Virginia with solid backing from women and minority voters, but Republican Donald Trump kept that race unexpectedly close with the enthusiastic support of white voters who were critical nationwide to his presidential upset. Here's a look at some of the other results of exit polling conducted for The Associated Press and television networks in Virginia. ___ GENDER, RACE AND AGE Clinton was buoyed by robust support from women and minorities in Virginia, while Trump led among white voters. The vast majority of black voters and roughly two-thirds of Hispanic voters cast ballots for Clinton. Clinton won with more than half of women voters while Trump captured about six in 10 white voters. Clinton also had the advantage with young voters, winning in age groups 18 to 29 and 30 to 44. ___ EDUCATION Clinton was the favorite among the more educated voters, capturing 61 percent of the vote of those with a post-graduate degree and 51 percent of those with a college degree. About three-quarters of white voters without a college degree chose Trump. ___ ALL ABOUT THE ECONOMY Virginian voters had the economy on their minds. More than half of Virginia voters -- split between Trump and Clinton supporters -- said the economy was the most important issue in the country, outweighing foreign policy, immigration or terrorism. Among the fraction of voters who saw immigration as the key issue, 68 percent voted for Trump. Clinton had the advantage among voters who pointed to foreign policy as the most pressing concern, with 67 percent of those voters in her camp. Some 57 percent of voters said they believe they condition of the nation's economy is not so good or poor while about two-thirds said they believe the U.S. economy favors the wealthy. ___ OPTIMISM VS. PESSIMISM Trump was the favorite among voters who are pessimistic about the future of the country while Clinton carried those who are more optimistic. About six in 10 voters who said they believe life will be better for the next generation voted for Clinton. Roughly seven in 10 voters who said they believe life will be worse for the next generation voted for Trump. ___ CHANGE VS. EXPERIENCE Trump was strongly favored by those seeking a candidate they believe can bring about change, capturing 81 percent of those voters who saw that quality as the most important in a president. Of voters who cited experience as the most important quality in a leader, nearly 9 in 10 of those cast their ballots for Clinton. ___ WOMEN AND EMAILS Some 62 percent of voters said that Clinton's use of private email as secretary of state bothered them at least some. Nearly three-quarters said the same thing about Trump's treatment of women. ___ IMMIGRATION Clinton won among voters who say that immigrants working in the U.S. after coming to the country illegally should be offered a chance to apply for legal status. Meanwhile, 85 percent of those voters who said those immigrants should be deported voted for Trump. Similarly 80 percent of those who said that immigration hurts the country voted for Trump while about three-fourths of those who said that immigration helps the country voted for Clinton. ___ RELIGION AND GUNS Eight in 10 white voters who say they are evangelicals or born-again Christians voted for Trump. Clinton won among voters who say they never attend religious services. Meanwhile, almost six in 10 voters who said someone in their house owns a gun voted for Trump. Trump also won more than three-quarters of voters who said they oppose stricter gun-control measures. ___ The exit poll of 2,942 Virginia voters was conducted for AP and the television networks by Edison Research in a random sample of 50 precincts statewide. Results were subject to sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; it is higher for subgroups Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
