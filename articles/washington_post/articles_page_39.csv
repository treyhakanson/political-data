Julius Garvey is seeking a presidential pardon for his father, an extraordinary leader who received accolades throughout the world -- including titles, resolutions in his honor, schools, streets and parks inscribed with his name, and even currency bearing his image.  My grandfather, like Marcus Garvey, was an immigrant from the islands who moved to Harlem after the turn of the 20th century. I had always been told that he was an admirer of the trailblazing leader and owned stock in Garvey's Black Star Line.   So it is not only fitting but also personal for me for Garvey's name to be cleared and his legacy uplifted. President Clinton granted a posthumous pardon in 1999 to Henry O. Flipper, the first African American graduate of West Point, who was dishonorably discharged from the Army after being accused of embezzlement. President George W. Bush granted a posthumous pardon to Charles Winters  in 2008 for his violation of the Neutrality Act of 1939 by smuggling military planes to Israel when it was a new state.  President Obama must not leave office without granting a pardon to ""The Right Excellent"" Marcus Garvey as well. Such a pardon would correct a gross injustice, remove the stain of his racially and politically motivated conviction, and restore his legacy to not only his descendants but the global community as well.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is fighting back against a recent court ruling that found the structure of the agency is unconstitutional. Last month, a federal appeals court dealt a major blow to the agency by calling for the CFPB to be restructured so that the director could be removed by the president at will. The decision, if unchallenged, could have allowed Director Richard Cordray to be replaced by President-elect Donald Trump before the end of his term, which expires in 2018. The agency petitioned the ruling Friday on the grounds that the decision, if left to stand, would interfere with Congress's ability to create independent agencies run by a single director. In the petition, the agency said the ruling could also affect other independent agencies, pointing to the Social Security Administration, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Office of Special Counsel. When the CFPB was created, it was structured so that the director could be removed for only cause, shielding the role from some political shifts in Washington. The move was widely expected, but it provides further evidence that the CFPB is doing its best to continue with business as usual, despite having come into political crosshairs since the presidential election. Trump has not talked in detail about how he would like to reform the CFPB, but his transition team has said that he would like to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act that led to the creation of the agency. Previous efforts by some lawmakers to weaken the agency may become more plausible starting in January, when Republicans will have control of both chambers of Congress. The court case is related to an enforcement action the CFPB took against mortgage lender PHH for allegedly participating in an illegal kickback scheme. After PHH appealed the bureau's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a three-judge panel reversed the enforcement action and two judges ruled that the structure of the agency was unconstitutional. But the court also ruled against eliminating the CFPB, saying instead that the agency should be restructured. The CFPB is now asking for the case to be reheard by the full D.C. Circuit, a request that is rarely granted. If the panel agrees to rehear the case, the move could invalidate all or part of the October ruling. The bureau has shown few signs of slowing down since the presidential election. On Thursday, the agency launched an inquiry into the challenges consumers face when accessing their financial data through third-party websites and apps. The move, which is typically the first step in the agency's rulemaking process, shows that the CFPB is moving ahead with its regulatory agenda. The bureau could also announce more enforcement actions before the end of the year.

Michael Flynn, appointed national security adviser by President-elect Donald Trump, leaves Trump Tower in New York City on Friday. (Photo by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  ""The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all."" -       Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, April 4, 1949   Throughout the more than 60 years of its existence, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has only once invoked Article 5, the provision that calls for the signatories to defend one another - follow the proper consultations - if attacked. Only once. The date was Oct. 3, 2001, three weeks after 9/11. By then it had been determined that the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon had been ""directed from abroad,"" in the word of Lord Robertson, the NATO secretary general and a former British defense minister. He declared that the entire alliance would take collective active in response -- in defense of the United States. NATO duly created the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), one of the largest military coalitions in history. The force served in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014, and at its height it included 130,000 troops from four dozen nations. There were notably large British, Canadian, Dutch, Polish, German and French contingents, as well as contributions from NATO partners such as Georgia and Australia. More than 1,000 non-American soldiers died fighting for ISAF in Afghanistan, and hundreds more were wounded. For many European countries, the Afghan war was the first military conflict that they had fought in since the Second World War. Their sacrifice has never been widely described or acknowledged in the United States, most of whose citizens remain unaware that it ever took place. Yet they fought. Why? Out of loyalty to, and out of friendship for, the United States. Because European governments understood that al-Qaeda was threat to all of them. Because the North Atlantic Treaty was never just a military pact; it was a recognition of a common commitment to peace, security, the rule of law and freedom, as well as an acknowledgement of U.S. leadership, both political and military. Usually, I write my columns for the readers of The Washington Post. This one I am writing for the new administration, and especially for the man who may become the leader of the National Security Council, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.  He has complained - as has every single U.S. president for the past two decades - that not enough NATO countries were, as he put it, ""paying their bills."" But he went further: ""We continue to give, give, give and get nothing back in return."" He spoke of ""contracts"" and ""reciprocity"" -- as if NATO were a business transaction, not an alliance that has already sacrificed soldiers in the name of U.S. security. He did not mention NATO's role in Afghanistan. He did not acknowledge that for many Europeans, the experiences of that war as well as the war in Iraq - which, as a war of choice, did not lead to the invocation of Article 5, although many Europeans fought - were not positive. Those wars are remembered as poorly conceived, costly and worse: The Iraq War is now blamed for the Syrian war, which has led to the worst refugee crisis since 1945.  Flynn did not mention that although NATO expanded to include Central Europe in the 1990s, the United States did not hold any exercises in the region until 2013, now leaving it very vulnerable to a Russia that has rebuilt its military and uses it as a threat. Flynn was right about one thing: NATO needs a major overhaul. I once hoped, wistfully, that President Obama might use his last years in office to revitalize the alliance, even that he would browbeat recalcitrant members into investing more. But such a project can only succeed on the basis of mutual respect and commitment, and with the understanding that the United States also benefits - economically, politically and in other ways - from its transatlantic military leadership. Such a project cannot succeed if carried out with arrogance, by a man who does not seem to know the history of the alliance at all."

"       Regarding Petula Dvorak's Nov. 15 Metro column, ""Protest political parties, not democracy"": I was disturbed by Ms. Dvorak's assumption that people, such as myself, who say ""#notmypresident"" are raging against democracy or are unable to ""control all the wrong impulses."" For me, the phrase represents a refusal to identify with a president who has demonstrated that he is a bigoted misogynist. I want my large European family to know that Donald Trump's election does not mean we all have decided to simply give up and let him act on his proposals.  He is the duly elected president, and I accept that. But I will continue to donate to causes such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union and march in peaceful demonstrations. How do we know what things can be changed until we try?   Bernadette Carter, Chantilly                     I agree with Petula Dvorak that protests should always be peaceful, but I believe that the protesters are protesting policies, not democracy. When people say that this is not their president or not their country, I believe they are saying they reject President-elect Donald Trump's values as fundamentally anti-American. They are asking the president-elect to represent all Americans. I accept that Mr. Trump is our president-elect. I have voted in every election since the mid-1970s, and I respect our democratic process and the peaceful transition of power. While I may not have agreed with all of their policies, I knew that each previous president shared the underlying values on which our country was founded.  But this election is different, and protesting is not about being sore losers. The issue is that Mr. Trump's values, including bigotry, racism, misogyny and ethnic discrimination, do not represent our country. Our nation values diversity and is mostly made up of  immigrants and their descendants. Our nation is founded on equal treatment of all and the right of religious freedom. It is out of a profound respect for our nation, our country's underlying values and our democracy that many are speaking out.     Elizabeth Fribush, Oakton                             Before Nov. 14, when, from my office window, I watched the throng of high school students marching down University Boulevard, I might have been inclined to agree with Petula Dvorak that protesting Donald Trump's election is futile because it is not protesting ""something you can change."" However, Mr. Trump's behavior and campaign rhetoric of misogyny and bigotry didn't predicate an election edifying ""the beating heart of American democracy.""  More than half of Montgomery Blair High School's population is black, Hispanic or Latino. It is honorable that these and other local high school students raised their collective voice against stigmatization of ""the other."" Yes, violence undermines this message, but the high school protest was peaceful, without property damage or arrests. (Nonetheless, Ms. Dvorak did not differentiate it from violent actions in other areas.)  I was moved to tears by the sight of this fledgling movement of teens who will hopefully continue to ""fight complacency,"" but I hope they don't wait until adulthood, as Ms. Dvorak advised. An organized movement against offensive policies does not spring full-grown from the head of Zeus ready for battle, but starts with a group of young people in respectful dissent.  Linda Sapin, Takoma Park                   I applaud the students who marched out of their classrooms with signs reading ""#notmypresident."" I have been a Democrat since I was a 12-year-old rooting for John F. Kennedy to win the 1960 election. I have lived through the presidencies of Nixon, Ford, Reagan and the two Bushes. I have not liked all their policies, but I considered them legitimate.  I will never consider Donald Trump, a man who plans to destroy everything I hold dear, to be ""my president."" I can never call a man who disparages Hispanics, disabled people, women, Muslims, Gold Star parents, Jews (the list goes on and on) as ""my president."" And I say that proudly.  Marian Levine, Silver Spring                 I take great offense to the implication that anyone protesting is being undemocratic. Because I'm a Democrat from a strongly Republican state, my vote for president has never counted for much. Now, for the second time in 16 years, we will have a president owing his victory to the fact that our system doesn't count my vote or the votes of hundreds of thousands of other Americans -- that is, unless the electoral college has the courage to be more than symbolic. Contrary to what was written on our ballots, Americans elected the electoral college on Nov. 8. The electoral college will elect the president on Dec. 19.  Until its members cast their votes, I will continue to protest a Trump presidency and appeal to the electoral college to exercise its function as a safeguard by electing another candidate -- Republican, Democrat or independent -- with any peaceful means at my disposal.  In the meantime, step aside and don't tell me to be quiet.   Kristine Chateauneuf, Anderson, S.C.                   "

Van Hollen, currently a congressman from Montgomery County, will also chair the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the 2018 midterm election cycle, an important period for the party after losing the White House and failing to break Republican control of Congress this year. On appropriations, Van Hollen, 57, will replace retiring senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), who has served as the panel's top-ranking Democrat since 2012, including more than two years as chair. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) will be the ranking Democrat next year. Mikulski, who was the first woman to head the committee, called Van Hollen's appointment ""good news"" for Maryland and said her successor ""brings tremendous experience and skill to the job."" Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced Van Hollen's appointment to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on Friday. He is the first person tapped to lead the organization as a senator-elect. Schumer noted that the Maryland lawmaker headed the party's Congressional Campaign Committee from 2007 until 2011. ""Chris Van Hollen was our first choice for DSCC chairman because of his talents, his work ethic, and his experience,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""He has the confidence of our caucus and will do a great job for our candidates running in 2018. The map is tough for Democrats, but I have no doubt that Senator-elect Van Hollen is up to the task."" Van Hollen defeated state Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County) in the general election, winning more than 60 percent of the vote. He has served seven terms in the U.S. House and was the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee and a top lieutenant to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). "

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Friday called the 2-1 ruling last month ""dramatic and unprecedented."" It said the decision overrides Congress' goal to create an independent agency that protects consumers from harmful banking and lending practices. The law creating the agency after the 2008-09 financial crisis says its director can only be removed ""for cause,"" such as neglect of duty, and not over political differences. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that conflicts with the Constitution, which allows the president to remove executives for any reason.

Larry Hogan (R) and became a major bone of contention between the first-term Republican and Democratic lawmakers. The legislation required Maryland's Department of Transportation to create a scoring system to determine which projects should get priority for state funds.  Critics say the metrics used in the scoring favor transit proposals and projects in urban areas over those in more rural parts of the state. On Friday, members of the legislative committee in charge of reviewing the ranking system discussed whether Maryland should change its model to resemble one used in Virginia, which divides the state into regions where transportation needs are scored differently. Del. Samuel I. Rosenberg (D-Baltimore), who co-chairs the panel, asked transportation officials to determine whether Maryland could adopt a similar model under the existing law or whether the change would require new legislation. He said ""there appears to be a consensus that the Virginia law is a model worth considering."" State Transportation Secretary Pete K. Rahn suggested that the legislature should focus on repealing the law, which Hogan encouraged this summer at the Maryland Association of Counties' annual conference. There, many local officials complained that their projects would score poorly under the new system. ""We don't end with repeal,"" Rosenberg said. ""The goal of this group is to see how the Virginia statute could be enacted here with appropriate modifications for Maryland's situation."" The committee is not required to take action on the scoring system, but it has until Dec. 12 to recommend changes. Rosenberg asked the department to provide its answers by Dec. 8. Rahn has said that every local official he met with during back-to-back meetings at the conference expressed concerns about the scoring system and how it might interfere with local input. ""The law that we are working with does not result in all projects having an opportunity based on local input and cost of the projects,"" he said Friday. ""This is a very flawed law, and we are implementing it to the best of our ability."" Several Democrats on the committee said the transportation department misinterpreted the law and created guidelines that were too restrictive. Rahn said the guidelines closely follow the legislation. Supporters of the legislation contend that it adds transparency to the decision-making process. Also, local officials can still make their priorities known to MDOT through the department's usual process of meeting each year with transportation officials from each jurisdiction. Advocates have also noted that the administration could choose to fund lower-scoring projects over higher-scoring ones as long as MDOT provides an explanation. Republican lawmakers opposed the legislation and called it retaliation for Hogan's decision last year to cancel the long-planned Red Line light-rail project in Baltimore, which the governor said did not make fiscal sense. Under the law, the ranking system applies only to projects that are above $5 million. Scoring is based on nine factors ranging from environmental stewardship and cost-effectiveness to how the projects affect community vitality and equitable access to transportation. "

On Dec. 8, 1991, the leaders of the Soviet republics of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed a pact that broke up the U.S.S.R. Negotiations were held in secret in a government hunting lodge in Belarus, and the pact defeated the efforts of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to keep the country together. One of the signatories, Stanislav Shushkevich, then head of the Belarusian parliament, said the deal helped avoid civil wars and other calamities that could have resulted from the break-up of the world's largest country and one with a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons.  ""There was a nuclear power which was threatening the entire world with nuclear missiles and to say that it will cease to exist, one must be not just a philosopher, but a philosopher with a touch of heroism,"" Shushkevich said at an event at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. Gennady Burbulis, a close aide of the late Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who signed the document together with his boss, said the Soviet Union was a doomed totalitarian state.  ""Historically speaking ... the Soviet Union was an inviable entity from the get-go,"" Burbulis said. ""The repressions of the system were an anthropological catastrophe."" But while the Belovezha agreements, as they became known, led to the peaceful creation of 15 independent post-Soviet states, a number of ethnic conflicts and territorial disputes took place in the region, causing wars and devastation. And even though the dissolution of the Soviet Union gave hope to liberalization, only a few post-Soviet countries have emerged as true democracies.  ""A whole range of symbols of the old Soviet Union have been resurrected because the mentality of Soviet people has been preserved,"" Shushkevich told reporters before the event. Twenty-five years later, the region is again in turmoil. In 2014, after protesters toppled a pro-Russian government in Ukraine, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and threw its support behind separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Some 10,000 people have been killed. The United States and European Union have imposed economic sanctions on Russia in bid to pressure Moscow to stop supporting the separatists. Russia denies interfering in Ukraine. International negotiations to enforce a peace deal have all but reached a dead end. Former Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who also signed the Belovezha agreement, said it was important to continue talks, while also exerting economic pressure on Russia.  ""My position is the same as of those countries that imposed the sanctions,"" Kravchuk said. ""At the same time, I agree that you will not achieve order in the world only through sanctions."" But Burbulis, who served in Yeltsin's government, said Western sanctions and a harsh line against Moscow are ineffective. He called for a softer, more nuanced dialogue with the Kremlin.  ""There is no other way than consensus, but consensus implies a different understanding of politics, a different culture of relations, not guided by the principle, 'I am stronger and you are poorer.'"" Two and half decades later, the signatories of the treaty remembered the events differently and traded lively and often emotional remarks. Who takes credit for preparing the treaty? Who invited whom? Which leader got the first call warning that the treaty was about to be signed: Gorbachev or U.S. President George H. W. Bush? But the most heated exchange was over a different matter: Which of the signatories went hunting during the retreat? Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Saoud Al-Mohannadi ""did not cooperate with the investigatory chamber in the proceedings against a third party,"" FIFA ethics committee judges said in a statement. It also fined him 20,000 Swiss francs ($19,900). The ban blocks Al-Mohannadi, a vice president of the Qatar Football Association and Asian Football Confederation, from a Feb. 28 election to represent Asia on the strategy-setting FIFA Council. The vote was scheduled in September but delayed in an apparent protest by Asian members of FIFA against the ethics case. Al-Mohannadi was among four candidates for two vacant seats representing Asia on the expanded FIFA council, which replaced the scandal-tainted FIFA executive committee this year. The other candidates were from China, Iran, Singapore. The case against Al-Mohannadi was opened in July 2015, the FIFA ethics committee statement said. In April 2015, the Qatari official lost in his first attempt to win election to FIFA's ruling panel. The ethics committee said Al-Mohannadi breached his ""duty to collaborate as a witness in separate proceedings,"" though did not specify the case. It previously said the issue did not involve the 2022 World Cup bidding contest won by Qatar. In recent years, the ethics committee has imposed life bans on Qatari former AFC president Mohamed bin Hammam for financial mismanagement, and one of Bin Hammam's closest aides, Vernon Manilal Fernando of Sri Lanka, for bribery in Asian and FIFA elections. Al-Mohannadi can appeal the sanction to FIFA and later the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
