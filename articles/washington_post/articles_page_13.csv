Ami Bera won his bid for a third term to represent a Sacramento, California-area district that national Republican leaders had targeted. Bera faced a tough challenge from Republican Scott Jones, the Sacramento County sheriff who raised his profile by criticizing President Barack Obama's immigration policies. Election results updated Friday showed Bera widening his lead to more than 2 percentage points in California's 7th district, which has been one of the most closely matched in the nation in each election since the boundaries were drawn in 2012. Bera has eked out a narrow victory each time.  ""It's been my honor to serve this community, first as a doctor and for these past four years as a member of Congress,"" Bera said in a statement. Jones said in a statement that it's now nearly impossible for him to come from behind and he conceded to Bera.  ""Although there were difficult aspects of the race, I do not regret running and am extremely proud of the campaign that we ran,"" Jones said. Bera's father was sentenced to a year in prison in August for illegally funneling nearly $270,000 to his son's campaigns. Ami Bera wasn't charged and denied knowledge of his father's activities, but Jones tried to tarnish him through corruption allegations. Jones withdrew his endorsement of Donald Trump after a tape surfaced of the presidential candidate bragging about his advances on women. Bera attacked Jones over allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances toward a subordinate more than a decade ago. Jones denied the allegations. Bera's victory left just one congressional contest too close to call. Republican Darryl Issa holds a narrow lead in the 49th district north of San Diego. Issa, the wealthiest member of Congress and a top foe of President Barack Obama, faces a tough challenge from Doug Applegate, a personal injury attorney and retired Marine colonel seeking office for the first time. Issa led Applegate 51 percent to 49 percent Friday. In the Central Valley, Heath Flora defeated fellow Republican Ken Vogel for an open seat in the state Assembly. The contest was one of just four legislative races that featured two Republicans. Under California's election law, the top two finishers in the primary advance to the general election regardless of party. Two state legislative races remained too close to call, including a crucial Senate contest in Southern California that will determine whether Democrats have a two-thirds supermajority in the upper chamber. Democrat Josh Newman trailed Republican Ling Ling Chang by about 1,400 votes. He was 5,000 votes behind earlier in the week. Democrats already passed the two-thirds threshold in the Assembly. If they can get the same edge in the Senate, they can raise taxes and pass emergency legislation without Republican support. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Jeff Sessions for attorney general. Comments attributed to Trump's picks, also including Stephen Bannon as senior adviser and chief strategist and former Army Lt. Michael Flynn as national security adviser, serve to embolden everyday Americans to lash out at members of minority groups, they said. Sessions, a Republican, was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 after hearings in which he was accused of making racially charged remarks as a U.S. attorney. According to transcripts, Sessions was accused, among other things, of joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan ""was OK"" until he learned its members smoked marijuana and of calling a black assistant U.S. attorney ""boy."" During the hearing, Sessions denied making some of the comments and said others were jokes taken out of context. Black Lives Matter activist and Campaign Zero co-founder DeRay Mckesson said Sessions' ""documented racism and previous ineligibility for public office make him unfit to be the standard-bearer for the nation's justice system.""  ""If Sessions were to become the attorney general, the freedom and liberty of the historically marginalized would be severely threatened,"" said Mckesson, who has protested in several cities demanding police reform to address bias against communities of color. ""Sessions' nomination would also confirm that Trump plans to govern as he campaigned -- as a proponent of bigotry, racism and xenophobia."" Bannon led the Breitbart website, which has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. In a 2011 radio interview, Bannon said conservative women infuriated liberals because they ""would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children,"" contrasting that against a slur for lesbians. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has called the accusations against Bannon ""very unfair."" Lennie Gerber, an 80-year-old resident of High Point, North Carolina, who led the fight against her state's ban on same-sex marriage, said she worried Trump's appointments will further incite such sentiments among the public.  ""Saying that kind of thing incites the racism and the anti-gay feelings in everybody else and says you're free to express these things,"" Gerber said. ""These people who've been suppressed by the positive transformation that has gone on over the last few years are now feeling free to express themselves."" Civil rights leaders are calling on Trump to rescind Sessions' nomination or for the Senate to reject him. Sessions requires Senate confirmation as attorney general, as does Republican Kansas U.S. Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director, but Bannon and Flynn do not. In August, Flynn spoke at an event in Dallas for the anti-Islamist group Act for America, calling Islam, a religion with 1.6 billion adherents, ""a political ideology"" and ""a cancer."" Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said, ""Unfortunately, these very important picks in his administration send a troubling message indicating that the bigotry we saw expressed in the campaign will continue."" Aside from comments and actions attributed to the nominees, their lack of diversity worries civil rights leaders. Washington attorney A. Scott Bolden said Trump is ""0 for 4"" on diversity: All his picks are white men.  ""The scariest part of his potential administration will be how his political debts to the alt-right will manifest itself in his administration and policies,"" Bolden said. ""Jeff Sessions is one of those manifestations ... to be in control not only of justice in America, but really to bring injustice to America."" Trump had said he planned to reward loyalty, and he demonstrated such with his nomination of Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse him. Daniela Lapidous, a 22-year-old Jewish woman who works to fight climate change, called Bannon a ""misogynist and anti-Semite and an anti-climate extremist."" She said she never before felt the need to fight anti-Semitism but now thinks that she must.  ""I've been somewhat convinced that anti-Semitism isn't a thing in the United States anymore, but this past year, with Trump and Bannon, it's made me scared about that for the first time in my life,"" said Lapidous, who lives in San Francisco. The Rev. Jeffrey Brown, associate pastor of the Twelfth Baptist Church in Boston, said he's unhappy with Trump's choices, particularly Sessions.  ""I hear people complaining that we should give the Trump administration a chance,"" Brown said. ""It's very clear by his appointments that he's not going to give a lot of communities in the United States that same chance."" Elaine Walton, a black resident of New Orleans, said she had deep concerns. Her most visceral reaction to Trump's picks? ""Fear. How is he going to be the top watchdog for the country when he's so biased?""  ""I think those people cannot lead him, advise him on how to lead this country forward,"" she said. ""They are going to advise him on how to lead the country backwards."" ___ Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin in Richmond, Virginia; Rebecca Santana in New Orleans; Rachel Zoll in New York; and Denise Lavoie in Boston.

Bill Walker had the authority to reduce this year's Alaska Permanent Fund dividend, siding with the state in the politically charged case. Superior Court Judge William Morse's decision followed arguments presented by both sides in Anchorage on Thursday morning. Morse said he expected the issue ultimately to be decided by the Alaska Supreme Court. State Sen. Bill Wielechowski, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said he planned to appeal. The lawsuit, brought by the Anchorage Democrat and two former lawmakers, argued the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. was obligated by law to make available nearly $1.4 billion from the fund's earnings reserve for dividends, in spite of a Walker veto reducing that amount. The veto reduced the dividend to $1,022, roughly half of what it otherwise would have been. The plaintiffs wanted the rest restored. Attorneys for the state had pushed back on the argument that dividend payments are supposed to be automatic, saying that would remove control of spending state money from lawmakers and eliminate the governor's ability to limit spending. They said Walker properly exercised his veto authority. Morse frequently interrupted and picked at Wielechowski's arguments, at one point, incredulously stating: ""I mean, come on. You can't seriously say that."" In a ruling issued from the bench, Morse said the governor has tremendous power over spending in Alaska, noting it takes three-fourths of the Legislature to override a veto on a spending item. If there was any intent to eliminate or change a governor's role in spending permanent fund earnings that would have been expressed, he said. But it wasn't, he said. Dividends come from the earnings of the permanent fund, Alaska's oil wealth nest-egg, and are annually paid to most Alaskans. The fund's principal is constitutionally protected. Walker has defended his decision to cut this year's dividend as necessary as the state struggles with a multibillion-dollar deficit spurred by chronically low oil prices. He sees use of permanent fund earnings as critical to helping fill the gap. But the use of permanent fund earnings -- and any talk of capping the dividend -- remains a politically thorny issue. One Republican senator, Mike Dunleavy of Dunleavy, said last month that he intended to introduce legislation to restore the portion of the dividend vetoed by Walker. After the court hearing, Wielechowski said the case was always expected to go to the Supreme Court. ""We think the legislative history is clear, that it was the intent to allow for dedication of funds to do a dividend,"" he said. Attorney General Jahna Lindemuth said the state was confident in the advice it had given the governor and was pleased with Morse's decision. ""We look forward to seeing what the Supreme Court does with this case,"" she said. ___ Associated Press reporter Mark Thiessen contributed to this report from Anchorage, Alaska.

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in January 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fed policymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy is making progress toward the Fed's goals on employment and inflation. She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case for a rate increase ""had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon."" Analysts viewed Yellen's comments as an effort to put financial markets on notice that a rate hike is likely to occur at the Fed's last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased market uncertainty after Trump's election might be cause for a delay. Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen said that uncertainty surrounding Trump's proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending could well last for a good deal longer than one month.  ""Yellen's testimony before Congress ... further cemented in place expectations that the Fed will hike rates next month,"" said Michael Feroli, senior economist at JPMorgan. Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was ""fully my intention"" to remain as Fed chair until her four-year term ends in late January 2018. She said she could not imagine any circumstance that would cause her to leave early, addressing speculation that she might step down once Trump takes office, given his critical comments of her during the election campaign. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that it could raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S. economy went through a prolonged soft-patch. The rate has remained in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a record low near zero for seven years. Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point in December and then will boost rates two more times in 2017. Yellen stressed in her testimony that the slow recovery and absence of inflation pressures should allow the Fed to move gradually in raising its key rate, the federal funds rate.  ""Gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years,"" Yellen said, referring to the point where the funds rate is neither promoting economic growth nor slowing growth. As measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government has estimated, more than twice the rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level typical of a healthy economy, down from 10 percent in 2009. In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed before her term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bank regulation differ from Trump's. Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. After the country lived through a ""devastating financial crisis,"" Yellen said that ""I would not want to see the clock turned back on all the improvements we have made."" Trump and other Republicans have attacked Yellen and other federal bank regulators for imposing too-restrictive rules on banks, pledging that they will seek to repeal major parts of the 2010 law.

Trump's ethics plan would ban all executive-branch officials from lobbying for five years after leaving their government jobs -- one of several policies aimed at curbing the influence of lobbyists. His campaign released his plan about three weeks before Election Day, and ""drain the swamp"" quickly became a favorite rallying cry and social media hashtag. The ban also applies to the transition team members charged with helping to find, vet and hire for the incoming Republican administration, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said late Wednesday. Additionally, neither the transition advisers nor incoming officials are permitted to be registered federal or state lobbyists, Spicer said. He described the measures as helping to ensure people won't be able to use government service ""to enrich themselves."" The Trump team did not explain how the ban would be enforced. While the moves adhere to Trump's campaign pledge, some argue they are not without risk. The president-elect is racing to hire some 4,000 executive-branch employees, and his ethics plan could cause some job-seekers to look elsewhere because it limits how they can earn a living after they leave the administration.  ""This will have a chilling effect on his hiring, no doubt,"" said Paul Miller, who leads the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics. ""Most people who agree to government service want to go back into the private sector. We don't want career politicians, and that's what he could end up with."" But to those who have long advocated for breaking the ""Potomac fever"" that befalls those who come to Washington and never leave, Trump's ban is worth the risk of losing some potential administration employees.  ""Too many people go into government service as a way to punch their ticket and come out and make millions of dollars. That's both a concern and a reality,"" said Meredith McGehee, an executive at the government reform group Issue One. Trump's plan makes other bold assertions, some more doable than others. He can institute his executive-branch lobbying ban with the stroke of his pen, but measures involving Congress are trickier. Trump says he will ask Congress to institute a five-year lobbying ban for departing members and staff. That would take the approval of legislators who might be squeamish about tamping down their own future employment options. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell didn't directly answer when asked about Trump's proposed lobbying ban for those leaving the Hill. He said he wants legislators to ""address the real concerns of the American people"" rather than fixate on every utterance during the presidential contest. Trump also wants to ""expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisers when we all know they are lobbyists."" That's reasonable, McGehee said, but difficult. Increasingly, those employed by the influence industry call themselves ""consultants"" or ""strategists."" In fact, the number of registered lobbyists in Washington has dropped to fewer than 10,000 from 15,000 a decade ago, likely due to this rebranding effort. Miller and other lobbying advocates also agree registration should be more expansive. Yet 2011 legislation to do just that hasn't moved forward. That could be a heavy lift for Trump. If it's too onerous, he could pare back his goals and include a more expansive lobbying definition that would only apply to the administration. It's also unclear how many of the thousands of people Trump is about to hire would be subject to his ban. His proposal says ""all executive-branch officials,"" but in practice he may be referring only to Cabinet members and high-level White House officials. Washington insiders are getting mixed signals from Trump. His original transition team, assembled under New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, was packed with lobbyists and interest advocates. In recent days, Trump put Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge of transition, and he is changing some of the people who are involved. Pence is ""making good on President-elect Trump's promise that we're not going to have any lobbyists involved with the transition efforts,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Wednesday. ""And this is, when we talk about draining the swamp, this is one of the first steps. And so, the bottom line is, we're going to get the transition team where we need it to be."" In a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday, Trump said he'd had no choice but to initially rely on lobbyists in Washington because ""the whole place is one big lobbyist."" He vowed to ""phase that out."" His White House predecessors have made similar promises. On the campaign trail in 2007, Barack Obama frequently condemned the ""revolving door"" of Washington in terms strikingly similar to Trump. Obama made bold promises before his first election, yet government influencers remained entrenched. Still, he won re-election after a second campaign that included almost no talk about the revolving door.  ""Drain the swamp. Stop the revolving door. These are great things to say to get elected,"" said Howard Marlowe, president of Warwick Group Consultants, and a longtime advocate for fellow lobbyists. ""After you get elected, you find a way to quietly push it aside."" ___ Ken Thomas in New York and Erica Werner in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/Bykowicz Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Navalny was convicted in 2013 of embezzling timber worth $500,000 at the time from a state-owned company in the provincial city of Kirov in a trial which was largely perceived as a vendetta against the rising political star. Following unsuccessful appeals in Russia, Navalny, a trained lawyer, turned to the European Court of Human Rights which ruled in February that Russia violated Alexei Navalny's right to a fair trial, and has ordered the government to pay him legal costs and damages. Despite the fact that Russia passed a law last year claiming the right to disregard the European court's rulings if they conflict with the national constitution, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled to overturn the 2013 verdict and send Navalny's case for review to be heard in Kirov. Navalny's conviction in 2013 came two months before the Moscow mayoral election, in which he was a candidate. Navalny won more than a quarter of the vote, a notably strong performance amid pro-Kremlin parties' overwhelming grip on Russian politics. But when a higher court upheld his conviction later that year, Navalny was disqualified from further runs for office. Over the past five years Navalny has faced numerous probes and criminal cases against him. In 2014, Navalny along with his brother Oleg were convicted in a separate case of defrauding the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher. Navalny was given a suspended sentence while his brother was sentenced to 31/2 years in prison, a move that critics said resembled Soviet-era tactics of intimidating dissidents by imprisoning their relatives. Navalny's second conviction is not classified as a grave crime, which allows him to run for office again. The 40-year old opposition leader, however, was far from celebrating on Wednesday.  ""I have absolutely no desire to start traveling to Kirov again,"" he told Russian news agencies. ""The ruling is aimed to hamper my political activities."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

In a few more hours, Goldstein would get what she was waiting for, and she had no doubt that it would be worth it, particularly now: a few moments with Bernie Sanders, who was coming to Barnes & Noble to promote his new book. ""I think especially after this week, you know, people had a mental breakdown,"" said Goldstein, 39, who owns a mobile dog-grooming service. ""Seeing Bernie again gives us hope."" In the wake of Republican Donald Trump's stunning presidential victory, the book tour begun Monday night by Sanders, an unabashedly liberal senator from Vermont who lost the Democratic primary, has become something more. For 600 of his fans, some of whom waited in line for 12 hours here, it served as a catharsis.  [What's next for Democrats? For starters, a battle for the soul of their party.]  For nearly a week now, many of them have been reeling, wondering what will happen in Washington and what it will mean for the ""revolution"" Sanders pushed. On Monday, he urged his supporters to become more involved politically, not less. They were taken inside in groups, led up an escalator and steered past the cafe, where they waited in another line that led to a beige curtain blocking the view of store patrons. After a chance for a photo and a few words with Sanders behind the curtain, some emerged in tears. Goldstein, who described the senator as ""insanely gracious,"" said she was doing her best not to cry before leaving the store. Others expressed their emotions in different ways. ""I feel crazy, like I just took a hit of drugs or something!"" yelled one perhaps 30-something woman, who declined to be interviewed as she headed down the escalator. Some were wearing light-blue ""Bernie"" T-shirts from his upstart presidential campaign. One woman sported a button reading, ""Talk Bernie To Me."" A college student was clad in a ""Bernie onesie"" decorated with dozens of images of the senator's head. All, it seemed, were still trying to make sense of a general election somehow lost by Democrat Hillary Clinton -- one that many of them said they thought Sanders could have won if only he had been the party's nominee.  [Democrats begin period of soul searching, jockeying after Clinton loss]  ""I think it was a terrible mistake,"" said Josh Youngerman, 25, a political activist and actor from Brooklyn, who argued that Sanders would have been the stronger candidate against Trump. With his message of economic populism, Sanders connected better than Clinton in some of the Rust Belt states that she lost, including Michigan and Wisconsin, he said. Youngerman said he had volunteered for Sanders's campaign in five states and logged more than 400 hours working phone banks for him -- yet never met the senator before Monday night. ""It helps. It helps, for sure,"" he said, quickly changing his tone. ""But still, it's pretty devastating. We have a fascist for a president."" ""It is really emotional,"" Kayla Ichikawa of Queens said after she and her husband had their picture taken with Sanders behind the curtain. Before Sanders's primary bid, Ichikawa, 24, said she felt jaded by politics. Sanders gave her hope.  [Sanders says Democrats should 'pound away' on winning issues to regain favor with voters]  ""It was already hard when he lost the primary, and then Hillary lost, too,"" she said. A public school teacher in Brooklyn, Ichikawa said she's worried that Trump will seek to deport her students who are undocumented immigrants. Sanders, who during his campaign was more comfortable talking about policy than posing for pictures, said he feels ""an enormous sense of obligation"" to help his supporters get through this stretch. ""These are hard times,"" he said in an interview before posing for photos for two hours. ""The answer is not despair. The answer is not to give up. The answer is to become involved."" Trump's victory has changed both the tone of the book tour and Sanders's upcoming role in Washington. The book, titled ""Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In,"" is part campaign memoir but also very heavy on his policy prescriptions for the future. ""I like the book,"" Sanders said. ""Needless to say, I'm prejudiced. But I suspect . . . the reviews will not be great. There's no gossip in it. There's no juicy stuff in it. I know that. On the other hand, I think we need to take a very, very hard look at where we are as a country, where we have to go, and that's what the book does."" Anticipating a Clinton presidency, Sanders and other liberal lawmakers were preparing to push her to join with them on an array of initiatives, including tuition-free education at public colleges and universities. Now they're preparing to spend far more time playing defense. That has not diminished interest in what Sanders has to say. A representative of the publisher, St. Martin's Press, said there has been an uptick in demand for the book since the Nov. 8 election. There are 17 stops on the book tour, which includes a variety of events. Some are meet-and-greets, like the one here on Monday night, but some more substantive discussions are scheduled. In Washington on Wednesday, for example, Sanders is planning to talk about the future of the Democratic Party in a sold-out event at a 1,500-seat auditorium at George Washington University. ""A lot of the people who will be coming out are deeply worried about the future of this country,"" Sanders said. ""In some cases, they're literally worried about their own lives and what this might be for them and their families. It's very personal. So I think the seriousness of the moment has been intensified."" Without a Democratic president, Sanders's voice is likely to be among those amplified. That was evident Monday during a string of New York media appearances, including stops at ""The View"" and ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert."" Colbert asked Sanders if he saw overlap in the anger between the crowds he drew and those who supported Trump. Sanders allowed that there was some but said he can't imagine that many of his supporters voted for the Republican nominee, citing offensive things he had said about women, Latinos, Muslims and other groups. ""Above and beyond the incredible bigotry of the Trump campaign, what he did is he tapped into a lot of pain and anxiety and angst the American people are feeling, which is very rarely reported in the media or understood by the public,"" Sanders said. Before the show's taping began, Colbert visited with his audience and told them he thought Sanders was the perfect person to explain what had happened. ""I can't think of anybody I'd rather have on the show,"" he said. ""I think that's the leader of the opposition now, Bernie Sanders."" Whether that proves true or not, Monday night showed that the loyalty of many Sanders fans has not diminished. Tyler Brady began waiting in line at 4 a.m. for his chance to pose with Sanders for a photo. He was able to leave the scene long enough to attend an international politics lecture at New York University while others held his spot, he said, but otherwise he waited on the sidewalk all day. ""It's one of those meet-your-heroes moments,"" he said. Brady, 18, grew up in Scranton, Pa., the kind of town where blue-collar workers tipped the scales for Trump last week. But Brady's politics are different, partly as the result of the 75-year-old senator, whom the teenager said introduced him to the idea of democratic socialism. ""Hopefully he makes a 2020 run,"" Brady said. ""One can only hope."" "
7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/15/what-socrates-aristotle-and-leo-strauss-can-teach-us-about-donald-trump/	What Socrates, Aristotle and Leo Strauss can teach us about Donald Trump	"   The Death of Socrates (by Jacques-Louis David, 1787); Trump (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  The election of Donald Trump has revived parallels between the United States and the precarious condition of European democracies in the 1920s and early 1930s. Democratic leaders, including President Obama, have expressed hope for reconciliation. Other opponents of Trump have been less restrained. Early Wednesday morning, the filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted that ""The next wave of fascism will come not with cattle cars and camps. It will come with a friendly face."" There was no doubt whom Moore had in mind. Some scholars are skeptical that Trump can be described as a fascist, arguing instead that he represents populism. But fascism and populism are not the only concepts that might help us understand Trump. The concept of ""tyranny"" -- and how it was understood by the philosophers of ancient Greece -- is particularly helpful. Tyranny may sound like another partisan insult lobbed at Trump. But tyranny was not always a dirty word. Originally it referred to rulers who acquired power through extralegal means, often with the support of the rural poor. But it did not mean that the ruler was bad. For example, consider the Greek ruler Pisistratus. The Greek writer Herodotus describes how Pisistratus took power in Athens in the 6th century B.C.: He faked an assassination attempt, convinced the people that he needed bodyguards, and then used these bodyguards to seize power. Yet Herodotus reports that Pisistratus ""administered the state constitutionally and organized the state's affairs properly and well."" Pisistratus was a tyrant, but not a bad ruler. Plato offered a stronger critique of tyranny. He argued that tyranny was an evil form of government, but not primarily because tyrants took power in illegitimate ways. The problem was the tyrant's distorted soul. Rather than loving what really matters -- wisdom and justice -- the tyrant seeks public approval and physical pleasure. But because these forms of gratification are ephemeral, the tyrant is never satisfied. He pursues more and more until he descends into madness. The political theorist Mark Lilla points out that this way of thinking about politics has become unfamiliar to us. Modern political scientists tend to think about government in terms of institutional structures. For Plato, by contrast, tyranny is a psychological condition. (Indeed, the term psychology comes from psyche, the Greek word for soul.) In the ""Republic,"" Socrates argues that tyrannical souls tend to arise in democracies. They are especially common among the sons of prominent men who do not enjoy as much prestige as they think they deserve. Tyrants gain power when they win the allegiance of the poor, often turning against their own elite class in the process. The parallels to 2016 are obvious. Despite his criticism of tyrants as the unhappiest men and tyranny as the worst form of government, Plato seems to have wondered whether tyrannical rule could be harnessed for good purposes. He accepted an invitation to the Sicilian city of Syracuse to educate the tyrant Dionysius. But the experiment went poorly: According to the Roman historian Plutarch, Dionysius expelled Plato from Syracuse and arranged for him to be sold as a slave rather than be returned to Athens. Other Greek philosophers considered whether tyrants could be good rulers despite the risks. In the work known as ""Hiero, or Tyrannicus"" (""the skillful tyrant""), Plato's contemporary Xenophon presents a dialogue between the wise poet Simonides and the tyrant Hiero. When Hiero complains that he is miserable and lonely, Simonides argues that he could win the esteem he craves by practicing justice and ruling for the common good. This would satisfy the tyrant's desires and the community's needs simultaneously. Aristotle also offered suggestions for reforming tyranny. According to Aristotle, the tyrant ""ought to show himself to his subjects in the light, not of a tyrant, but of a steward and king."" Aristotle contended that the best way for a tyrant to rule is simply not to govern like a tyrant. If a tyrant were to do so, Aristotle noted, ""His power will be more last."" Aristotle realized that moral arguments wouldn't influence a tyrannical personality, so he appealed to the tyrant's overwhelming desire to be esteemed. Greek reflections on tyranny did not figure much in modern social science until a debate in the mid-20th century between the political theorists Leo Strauss and Alexander Kojeve. The dispute -- carried on in the decade following World War II and collected in the volume ""On Tyranny"" -- was not merely academic. Strauss and Kojeve were both refugees from modern tyrannies: Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, respectively. Chastened by German academics' collaboration with Hitler, Strauss argued that intellectuals should keep their distance from politics. Kojeve responded that an alliance between philosophers and tyrants was the best way to promote the rule of reason in politics. Despite his self-proclaimed affinity for Stalin, Kojeve worked for the French government and played a significant role in establishing the European Union. Given Strauss's warnings, it is ironic that some of Strauss's followers have been among the most significant intellectual supporters of Trump during the presidential campaign. These West Coast Straussians revere the Declaration of Independence, which protests against ""the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States."" But they also emphasize the importance of decisive leadership in periods of crisis. In this perspective, a bit of tyranny may sometimes be necessary to save democracy from itself. In the minds of many observers, American politics could see a reemergence of tyranny. This only revives the old dilemma: Can personal rule be the means to achieving righteous ends, or is it inherently corrupt -- and corrupting of those who participate in it? Although they recognized tyranny's appeal, the Greeks remind us that rulers with distorted souls are dangerous. Even though they crave the support of the people, tyrants care only about themselves. In the so-called ""Seventh Letter,"" written after his return from Syracuse, Plato argues that ""with regard to a State, whether it be under a single ruler or more than one, if, while the government is being carried on methodically and in a right course, it asks advice about any details of policy, it is the part of a wise man to advise such people."" But, Plato argued, wise men and good citizens should refuse to collaborate with rulers who flout law and justice.

As he explains, this election - far more than any other recent presidential campaign - pitted relatively more knowledgeable voters against ones with less knowledge. Moreover, Trump's two signature issues - immigration restrictions and opposition to free trade - are ones where the gap between informed opinion and people with low levels of political knowledge has always been unusually great.  Brennan correctly emphasizes that political ignorance is not a problem unique to this election, to Trump voters, or to Republicans. It is, unfortunately, a phenomenon common across the political spectrum - a problem I have tried to highlight for years. Liberal Democratic politicians - including President Obama - have sometimes exploited public ignorance, as well. The difference between Trump's exploitation of ignorance and similar actions by conventional politicians is as much one of degree as kind.  Obviously, ignorance was far from the only factor in Trump's success. Exit polls showed that many voters who disapproved of his character and nasty rhetoric, and may not have supported his specific politics, still voted for him because they hoped he would bring ""change."" But voting for ""change"" without carefully consider whether the change in question is likely to be for the better is itself a problematic information shortcut that voters often use to offset their relative ignorance. The wrong kind of change can easily make things worse, even if the status quo is already seriously flawed. Many analysts point to the role of racial and ethnic prejudice and xenophobia in Trump's victory. It is hard to deny that this was a significant factor. At the same time, Trump could not have won without the support of millions of people who are not racists, including even some who voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. And, as with voting for ""change,"" ethnic prejudice and hostility towards immigrants is often in substantial part the result of political ignorance. Intergroup hostility is often exacerbated by the misguided sense that there is a zero-sum game between different racial and ethnic groups, that the misfortunes of one must be caused by the gains of another. Historically, such fears are particularly prevalent in periods of relatively slow economic growth, like the one we are in now. Some argue that opposition to trade and immigration is actually driven by job competition. Even if - as economists across the political spectrum conclude - society as a whole is better off with free trade, some subsets of workers are left worse off. However, studies consistently show that there is little or no correlation between protectionist sentiment and exposure to job competition. The same is true for immigration. Rather, hostility to trade is correlated with suspicion of foreigners generally, and a sense that it is bad for the economy as a whole, not just your own personal job prospects.  Brennan correctly stresses that the harm caused by political ignorance goes well beyond the fact that it might lead voters to choose the worse of the two major-party candidates in an election. It also has a major impact on the choices put before us in the first place. Candidates and parties know that there is widespread political ignorance out there, and choose their strategies accordingly. With a better-informed electorate, we might well have ended up with a substantially better set of options in 2016 than we actually did.  Political ignorance is not the same thing as stupidity, and being a relatively ignorant voter does not mean you are a bad person generally. Most political ignorance is not a result of stupidity or bad character, but a rational response to the flawed incentives of the political process. Brennan puts the point well: Just why voters know so little is well-understood. It's not that people are stupid. Rather, it's that democracy creates bad incentives. Consider: If you go to buy a car, you do your research. After all, if you make a smart choice, you reap the rewards; if you make a bad choice, you suffer the consequences. Over time, most people learn to become better consumers. Not so with politics. How all of us vote, collectively, matters a great deal. But how any one of us votes does not. Imagine a college professor told her class of 210 million students, ""Three months from now, we'll have a final exam. You won't get your own personal grade. Instead, I'll average all of your grades together, and everyone will receive the same grade."" No one would bother to study, and the average grade would be an F.  Scholars have advanced a variety of possible solutions to the problem of political ignorance. Sadly, none of them is likely to overcome it easily and quickly. But we should at least become more aware of this danger, and look for ways to mitigate the harm it causes. It is long past time that we started taking the problem of political ignorance seriously."
