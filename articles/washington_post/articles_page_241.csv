The jurors deliberated for about a day before rejecting the case brought by the family of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. against White Plains Officer Anthony Carelli and the city, just north of New York City. Chamberlain's family insisted the shooting was racially motivated. Outside court, Chamberlain's son, Kenneth Chamberlain Jr., blasted the verdict, saying ""it's very clear that the judge gave the city of White Plains the license to kill with impunity.""  ""We will keep fighting, and I believe justice will be served,"" said Chamberlain Jr., who had earlier called his father a victim of ""systematic racism"" by law enforcement. The family's attorney, Randolph McLaughlin, said he planned to file a notice of appeal.  ""Mr. Chamberlain Sr.'s humanity has been ignored by every part of our legal system from the police to the (district attorney) and now the federal court,"" McLaughlin said in a statement. The deadly 2011 encounter at Chamberlain's apartment was a precursor to the national debate over use of force by police in communities of color and in response to calls involving emotionally disturbed people. The Chamberlain family's lawsuit went forward after a grand jury declined to indict the officer. Lawyers for Carelli and White Plains insisted the shooting was justified, saying the officer used deadly force only as a last resort. At the time of the shooting, Chamberlain was living alone and was suffering from bipolar disorder, arthritis and respiratory illness, conditions that prompted his family to give him a LifeAid medical alert device in case he needed help. On Nov. 19, 2011, Chamberlain, a former Marine Corps veteran, accidentally set off the alert, prompting police to go to his door. During a confrontation, authorities said, officers used a stun gun and a bean bag weapon to try to subdue him before shooting him. Carelli testified he ""had no other option"" but to shoot Chamberlain because he believed Chamberlain was about to harm a police sergeant. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The credit card companies wanted the justices to overturn a lower court ruling that said the antitrust case could move forward. The high court agreed to hear their appeal in June. But the justices dismissed the case Thursday, saying the companies are now making a different legal argument than the one the Supreme Court agreed to decide. The lawsuit filed by consumers and independent ATM operators claims the payment processors illegally coordinated with Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. to adopt anticompetitive fees.

Robinson received the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song amid multiple standing ovations from an audience filled with political dignitaries at DAR Constitution Hall, the Detroit Free Press (http://on.freep.com/2f4QBD2 ) reported.  ""This is such a wonderful, spectacular, incredible night in my life,"" said Robinson, 76. ""I've had many of them, and this is right at the top of the list."" Robinson said he had been raised in a north end Detroit home where the music of George and Ira Gershwin played alongside ""gutbucket blues,"" and that he had dreamed of being in show business since childhood. A band led by Detroit native Greg Phillinganes steered the evening's performances. Robinson also took the stage to perform his own ""Being With You"" and a rendition of the Gershwin's ""Love Is Here to Stay.""  ""Smokey was always a great poet who expressed ordinary themes in extraordinary ways,"" said Motown founder Berry Gordy. The Gershwin Prize, awarded by the Library of Congress each year, has become one of the leading honors recognizing popular-music songwriting. Previous recipients of the award are Paul Simon, Paul McCartney, Carole King, Billy Joel and Robinson's Motown colleague Stevie Wonder. ___ Information from: Detroit Free Press, http://www.freep.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

While Mr. Sisk's barber and others were holding forth about how they voted for Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, in hopes that he can return coal jobs to their area, Mr. Sisk politely spoke with wisdom: "" 'No, he can't. . . . You won't see those people working in the coal industry no more. Natural gas is too cheap. Any kind of market for coal anymore is very weak.' "" This common sense came from a man who worked in the coal industry for 30 years and who was fair enough to accurately state how President Obama got ""all the blame"" for the market drying up even though he was not responsible.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced the hiring of Art Acevedo, who had headed Austin's police force for nearly a decade, at a news conference Thursday afternoon. He fills a post vacated by the February retirement of Charles McClelland. Martha Montalvo had served as interim chief since then. Acevedo said his priorities as new chief will include meeting with members of his department along with local residents and community leaders to get their ideas on how to improve the agency.  ""I am very happy to be here in the city of Houston. The only person who needs to fear the police is the criminal,"" Acevedo said, briefly speaking in Spanish. Turner said he chose Acevedo for the job in part because the police chief values balancing law enforcement along with maintaining good community relations. Acevedo's tenure in Austin was marked by efforts to strengthen ties with community groups. He has been an active user of Twitter, tweeting about community events and his support of police officers.  ""Folks are quick to critique when officers fall short and they should, but we also need to lift up and acknowledge good policing,"" Acevedo tweeted on Nov. 12. But Acevedo has also faced recent criticism from some community leaders and police commanders over several use-of-force incidents, including the 2015 arrest of a black teacher who was thrown to the ground by a white officer and the February fatal shooting of an unarmed, naked 17-year-old. After the February fatal shooting, Acevedo was criticized by the police union after speaking about the shooting at a news conference while standing with groups such as Black Lives Matter. In a survey released earlier this year by the Austin Police Association , 52 percent of officers thought morale within the department was poor and 42 percent of officers said they didn't think Acevedo could effectively lead the department in the future. Acevedo will take over a police department -- with about 5,000 officers -- that has been criticized by some Houston community leaders and activists over the agency's recurring issues with use of deadly force. Nearly every officer-involved shooting in Houston for more than a decade has been deemed justified by the law enforcement agency.  ""We feel that the police department needs to be reviewed very carefully. We look forward to meeting the new chief and seeing what inroads we can make,"" said Johnny Mata, a longtime activist with the Greater Houston Coalition for Justice. Turner also announced on Thursday that Samuel Pena, the fire chief in El Paso, has been hired to lead the Houston Fire Department. ___ Follow Juan A.

Jeff Sessions is a likely pick for a top post in his administration. But when Sessions faced Senate confirmation for a job 30 years ago, it didn't go well. Nominated for a federal judgeship in 1986, Sessions, R-Ala., was dogged by racist comments he was accused of making while serving as U.S. attorney in Alabama. He was said to have called a black assistant U.S. attorney ""boy"" and the NAACP ""un-American"" and ""communist-inspired."" Sessions was the first senator to back Trump during the campaign and is an architect of Trump's immigration, counterterrorism and trade policies. His name has been floated for attorney general and secretary of defense. The Trump transition team released a statement Thursday saying the president-elect is ""unbelievably impressed"" with Sessions, citing his work as a U.S. attorney and state attorney general in Alabama. But confirmation for the four-term lawmaker, even in a Republican-controlled chamber, is not guaranteed. Sessions had been confirmed by a Republican-controlled Senate in 1981 to be the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. In 1986, however, his racially charged comments and record on civil rights as a U.S. attorney, which Sessions denied and defended, prevented his nomination as judge from going forward, even in a GOP-majority Senate. Sessions later withdrew from consideration, though he went on to become state attorney general and won election to the U.S. Senate in 1996.  ""Mr. Sessions is a throwback to a shameful era, which I know both black and white Americans thought was in our past,"" the late Massachusetts Democrat, Sen. Edward Kennedy, said during the 1986 confirmation hearing. ""It is inconceivable to me that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a U.S. attorney, let alone a U.S. federal judge."" During the hearing, a former assistant U.S. attorney, Thomas Figures, who is black, said Sessions referred to him as ""boy,"" and told him to be careful what he said to ""white folks."" Sessions said he never called Figures ""boy,"" but Kennedy produced a letter from an organization of black lawyers that said Figures made the allegation about Sessions to the organization's investigators at least twice. Sessions told the committee that he told Figures to be careful what he said to ""folks.""  ""I believe that the statements and actions of Mr. Sessions regarding race, and regarding civil rights, impact tremendously on whether he is decent,"" Figures told the committee. Figures died in 2015. Sessions was also criticized for joking in the presence of an attorney with the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division that the Ku Klux Klan was ""OK"" until he learned they smoked marijuana. During his confirmation hearing, he said his comment about the Klan ""was a silly comment, I guess you might say, that I made."" Sessions told the committee he made the joke while his office was investigating the 1981 murder of Michael Donald, a black man who was kidnapped, beaten and killed by two Klansmen who slit his throat and then hanged his body in a tree in Mobile, Alabama. The two men were later arrested and convicted. Sessions said he never meant the joke to suggest he supported the Klan. He said the joke was intended to convey that he thought it was ""bizarre"" that Klansmen had smoked marijuana after one of their meetings.  ""All of us understood that the Klan is a force for hatred and bigotry and it just could not have meant anything else than that under those circumstances,"" Sessions said, noting that he had been involved in the decision to try one of the killers in state court so he could face the death penalty. Sessions' spokesman said the senator was unavailable to be interviewed for this story. Barry Kowalski, a former Justice Department attorney who was in Mobile, working with Sessions on the Donald case, said he was there for the so-called joke about the Klan, and he did not interpret it as a racist comment. He said it was a joke. ""That was totally hospital room humor,"" Kowalski told the AP Thursday.  ""I can only speak from what I saw,"" Kowalski said. ""He couldn't have been more supportive of making sure we got convicted the murderers of the last black man who was lynched by the Klan."" Gerry Hebert, another former Justice Department attorney who had worked with Sessions in the early 1980s, told the Judiciary committee about racist comments Sessions made regarding the NAACP being un-American and said Sessions agreed with another person's comment that a prominent white civil rights lawyer was a disgrace to his race for trying voting rights cases.  ""I filed all these things away thinking, 'God, what a racist this guy is,'"" Hebert told The Associated Press. During Sessions' confirmation hearing, then-Sen. Joe Biden asked Hebert if he would be comfortable trying a voting rights case before Sessions as a judge or whether he would ask that Sessions be recused because of racist comments he had made. ""I would certainly raise the issue, absolutely,"" Hebert responded. Most of the senators who voted against Sessions in 1986 are no longer alive or in office. Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy is the only one who voted against him still in the Senate. Today, Sessions would face confirmation as a member of the chamber. Senators often are deferential to current and former members who are nominated for Cabinet posts. The last time the Senate rejected one of its own was in 1989 when then-Sen. John G. Tower, a Texas Republican, could not get confirmed as President George H. W. Bush's defense secretary amid reports of heavy drinking and womanizing. If Sessions is nominated for a position in the Trump Cabinet, his confirmation hearing could occur as early as January. The Republicans will have only a 52-48 advantage, assuming Republicans win an upcoming Senate election. That means Sessions couldn't afford to lose many votes from members of his own party. If there are Republicans upset by his comments -- not just years ago about race but also what he has said in recent years about immigration -- his confirmation could be a challenge. Sessions is an immigration hard-liner, not in step with mainstream Republicans. In the past year, he has supported mass deportations for immigrants in the country illegally, suggested that the administration quickly deport unaccompanied children and families who have been caught crossing the border illegally, linked terror attacks against the U.S. to Muslim immigrant families and complained that the Obama administration has increased the number of green cards issued to immigrants from ""Muslim-majority countries."" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would support a Sessions nomination.  ""I'd vote for him. I like Jeff. He was the early, only supporter for Donald Trump in the Senate,"" Graham said. ""And I believe Jeff Sessions has earned the right to serve President Trump in the highest levels, and I think he's a good, competent, capable man."" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, would also support Sessions, spokesman Conn Carroll said. ""Sen. Lee has worked closely with Sessions in the Senate and has the utmost respect for his abilities,"" Carroll said. Sessions was asked by reporters at Trump Tower Thursday whether he thought he would be confirmed by the Senate.  ""People have to make that decision. The actual senators will cast those votes on any confirmation,"" Sessions said. ___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Alicia A. Caldwell and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.

Trump tweeted to condemn ""professional protesters, incited by the media."" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   Demonstrations against the election of Donald Trump as president continued around the country early Friday, taking a decidedly violent turn in Portland, Ore., where police made several arrests after deeming the protests had turned into a ""riot"" punishable as a ""Class C Felony."" ""We reject the president-elect,"" many of the demonstrators chanted as they marched through the streets. Elsewhere, thousands of protesters surrounded Trump's buildings in New York and Chicago, clashing with supporters of the president-elect in some areas. The protests earned recriminations from Trump, who met with President Obama at the White House Thursday morning. ""Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!,"" Trump said on Twitter. It was his first comment about the protests and one of few statements he has made since claiming victory over Hillary Clinton early Wednesday morning. In 2012, after Obama was elected to a second term, Trump tweeted: ""We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!""   [Violence erupts in Portland 'riot' as anti-Trump protests continue in cities across the nation]   Early Friday morning, Trump took a different tone, tweeting this message: ""Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!"" Condemning Trump's litany of crude comments about women and his attacks on immigrants, demonstrators across the country marched along city streets, blocked intersections, burned effigies and, in some places, gathered outside buildings bearing Trump's name. ""Not my president,"" chanted some of the protesters, while others waved signs with the same message. While many demonstrations late Thursday were peaceful, the vandalism increased in Portland as the night wore on.      Police in Portland, Ore., said that protests against President-elect Donald Trump had turned into ""a riot,"" on Nov. 10, with some smashing windows and lighting fires in the streets. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   ""Due to extensive criminal and dangerous behavior, protest is now considered a riot. Crowd has been advised,"" Portland police officials said in a Twitter post late Thursday. The department earlier warned that some drivers were being attacked during the demonstrations and advised protesters to stop the use of ""illegal fire devices."" Police later said that they had arrested 26 people during the night, describing vandalism that occurred in numerous areas and describing those causing the damage as ""anarchists."" Teressa Raiford, a community organizer in Portland, said what began as a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest was transformed into something more insidious due to demonstrators not affiliated with the group. ""They're not coming to show solidarity, they're coming because they know there's going to be a big crowd,"" Raiford said. ""They don't respect our movement."" Portland police said on Twitter that some protesters trying to stop the property damage were being threatened by others. ""Many in crowd trying to get anarchist groups to stop destroying property, anarchists refusing,"" one tweet read. Another police tweet said: ""Police advising crowd there are gas and flares being prepared by protestors. Please leave for your own safety."" They also issued several orders to disperse for ""unlawful assembly.""   After several orders to disperse, police have used less lethal munitions to effect arrests and move the crowd. Ofcs still taking projectiles -- Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) November 11, 2016   Mike Bivins, a local freelance journalist, said the protest took a noticeable turn late Thursday as demonstrators passed a Northeast Portland car dealership, where some starting breaking car windows. A dumpster and a newsstand were set on fire. Bivins said a Black Lives Matter organizer at Pioneer Courthouse Square told demonstrators earlier in the day not to police ""anyone else's form of protest."" ""I guess he didn't think it would rise to this level,"" Bevins said. Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim U.S. Army soldier killed in Iraq and an outspoken critic of the president-elect, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that protests are ""indicative of how many people have been intimidated, how many people feel that their rights have not been fully guaranteed"" because of Trump's campaign rhetoric. ""We appeal to the surrogates of Donald Trump and to him, himself, that he needs to take the first step to make sure that the concerns that are being addressed,"" said Khan, who asserted that Trump supporters are ""attacking Muslims -- Muslim women, snatching their headscarves in New York, in Louisiana, in Los Angeles. Mosques are being attacked by people throwing things. And that needs to stop."" At least 100 people were arrested Wednesday night during the first wave of national protests, according to police officials, most of them at one in New York. While most of the demonstrations remained peaceful, police in Oakland, Calif., said a rally there turned violent when some in the massive crowd injured three police officers by throwing rocks and fireworks at them.     The unrest underscored the fractures in a country that awoke Wednesday to learn that Trump had pulled off an unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, and more were planned for the weekend. Demonstrations started early Wednesday in the biggest U.S. cities -- New York, Los Angeles and Chicago -- and flared in places from Portland and Seattle to Philadelphia and Richmond, along with cities in red states such as Atlanta, Dallas, Omaha and Kansas City, Mo. But they continued Thursday evening, spreading to Baltimore where police said about 600 ""anti-trump"" protesters marched to the downtown area and blocked streets. Two protesters, they said, were held but not charged. Most of the major demonstrations took place in urban centers in blue states Clinton won Tuesday, highlighting the demographic divide that shaped the election results. Clinton's apparent narrow victory in the popular vote, coupled with her loss in the electoral tally, spurred demonstrators in New York to chant, ""She got more votes!"" as thousands massed in front of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan Wednesday night. The crowd stretched several blocks down Fifth Avenue. Before that, protesters had marched from Union Square to Trump's building, chanting, ""Donald Trump, go away! Sexist, racist, anti-gay!""   Protesters refusing to move as NYPD advances. pic.twitter.com/6gzj7KjzGC -- Scott Bixby (@scottbix) November 10, 2016   At one point, demonstrators lit an American flag on fire. Later, amid a cacophony of loud chants, a glowing ""Love Trumps Hate"" banner was held aloft under the Trump Tower sign. The singer Cher mingled in the crowd, doling out hugs. Police in New York said about 65 people were arrested during the first night of protests, mostly for disorderly conduct or resisting arrest. People in Trump's circle said they were monitoring the unrest and had expected such activity after the election:   Trump World is watching the protests tonight. Most of them, especially the populist-types around him, expected this, now and next year. -- Robert Costa (@costareports) November 10, 2016   On Thursday, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) called the people protesting ""a bunch of spoiled crybabies."" ""We're bringing up a generation of spoiled crybabies,"" Giuliani, a Trump adviser who has been touted as a possible attorney general, said in an interview on Fox News. Apparently referencing protests happening around college campuses, Giuliani said: ""Most of the kids aren't crying. Most of the kids are going to class."" At one point Wednesday night, a protester in Los Angeles was interviewed on CNN and spoke about how ""there will be casualties on both sides,"" language that was condemned by Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's campaign manager.   Not cool. @POTUS or Hillary should address. 'People Have to Die': Anti-Trump Protester Calls For Violence on CNN https://t.co/NfEqhkrTvu -- Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 10, 2016   In Florida, Trump supporters spilled out of an Irish bar Thursday to confront the hundreds of protesters making their way through the brick-paved district of Ybor City, the historic epicenter of the Cuban community in Tampa. Some of the Trump supporters, still holding their beers, stood within inches of the protesters, shouting ""USA, USA."" Other hurled vulgarities at the crowd. Local police swarmed the area to separate the groups. Nearby, a retired Marine Corps corporal, Kyle Mullinax, stood at attention as protesters walked by. The protesters are ""stupid,"" he said. In Oakland, police said the crowd of demonstrators eventually grew to about 7,000 people Wednesday and began to splinter into smaller groups, some of which vandalized buildings. As things became more heated, police said, they used devices releasing tear gas several times. In addition to the three police officers who were injured, three police cars from nearby Pleasanton, Calif. -- one of many cities that sent officers to help respond -- were damaged, officials said. Authorities reported 16 cases of vandalism, including graffiti and looting, and said there were ""numerous trash fires in the streets."" (About 40 fires were extinguished by police and fire officials.) Police said they arrested 30 people and issued an additional 11 citations for vandalism, unlawful assembly and assault on an officer.   [What does Trump's victory say about the country?]   In Los Angeles, thousands of protesters filled the streets, including some who burned a giant papier-mache Trump head in front of City Hall and others who spray-painted profanity on the Los Angeles Times building and on vehicles used by news organizations. Hundreds of other protesters blocked two highways in the area, backing up traffic for miles.   Protest is now on the 101. CHP is starting to move in pic.twitter.com/njlaqRB3zJ -- James Queally (@JamesQueallyLAT) November 10, 2016   In Chicago, police said about 1,800 people has demonstrated outside of Trump Tower Wednesday. On Thursday, the protests started small, but grew to several hundred people, who marched through downtown streets, stopping traffic for more than two hours. Jessica Orman, 24, from Chicago, said she is dismayed by the people who voted for Trump and feels that her future is on the line. ""I see people differently now. I don't smile at people on the street anymore. Because you never know,"" she said. ""I'm so jaded, but we have to fight. We have to protest. I can vote because people protested. I can be on the pill because people protested. Gay people have rights because people protested,"" she said. Orman currently earns about the minimum wage and said she had hoped that if elected Hillary Clinton would raise the minimum wage. Now, she said, her financial prospects could get worse.  ""The economy could go belly up.""   [For Democrats, a power outage in Washington and an identity crisis]   MoveOn.org, a liberal group, had called on people to gather in cities nationwide. Ben Wikler, MoveOn's Washington director, said that people had registered to organize events in 275 cities and communities across the country, noting that many were candlelight vigils and group discussions rather than the sprawling marches seen in New York and Chicago. ""A lot of people reacted to the election results with a kind of plodding feeling, like they wanted to curl up under their desks or hide under their sheets,"" Wikler said Thursday. ""Just knowing that you're not alone in this country is a powerful salve. And knowing there are people that want to continue to fight for a more perfect union is a source of strength at a moment that can feel very scary."" Tensions ran particularly high on college campuses. At American University in Washington, students burned American flags, and some shouted, ""F--- white America!"" In Austin, students at the University of Texas led a march for hours through the city Wednesday afternoon. As hundreds of protesters wove into traffic, bus drivers high-fived the students. Some in their vehicles got out and hugged them, tears streaming down their faces. ""Seeing this is everything,"" said Jennifer Rowsey, 47, as the march passed by a coffee shop next to Austin City Hall, where she is the human resource manager. ""I felt so isolated,"" she said. ""I don't feel so alone now.""   [Trump maps out a new administration to bring a seismic shift to Washington]   Austin City Council member Greg Casar, the son of Mexican immigrants and a community organizer, joined the protesters when they passed him while he was giving an interview to local media. ""A lot of people are calling for healing,"" he said. ""I think we should reject that."" He said that now is the time to support protesters, strikers and those engaged in other forms of civil disobedience. Casar said that if Trump comes to Austin, he will refuse to shake his hand. ""If I have to go to jail"" for protesting, he said, ""I'll go to jail."" Many protesters who turned out said they were fearful that Trump would follow through with his pledge to deport undocumented immigrants. ""I just felt waking up today that I was waking up to a whole new world, to a nightmare for my parents and people I care about and love,"" said Tony, a 23-year-old line cook who declined to give his last name as he marched in Chicago, carrying his 6-year-old daughter on his shoulders. ""There's so much heartache,"" he said. ""It's a bad time to be a Muslim or an illegal citizen in this country."" In Santa Ana., Calif., Lucy Dominguez, 37, and her husband, Oliver Lopez, 33, had their arms around one another and held a sign reading, ""Peace."" ""I came to stand up with the people. To stand up with my people, the Latino community,"" she said. ""I chose the peace sign because we need peace in this moment."" During his victory speech early Wednesday, Trump spoke about reconciliation following the bitter campaign, saying that it was ""time for America to bind the wounds of division."" Later Wednesday, this tone was echoed by Clinton and President Obama, who said they were also disappointed after an Election Day that ended with Republicans in control of both the legislative and executive branches of government. Clinton said the campaign showed that ""our nation is more deeply divided that we thought,"" but she told her supporters: ""We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" But the anger and grief that continued Thursday evening suggested that many fear what Trump's election means going forward. In Philadelphia, an estimated 1,000 protesters filled the streets chanting slogans such as ""We reject the president-elect,"" and ""hands too small, can't build a wall."" Police on bicycles moved with the throngs, who remained peaceful as they choked the streets of Center City. ""I feel very dark about the future,"" said Janette Chien, 27, of Philadelphia, who voted for Hillary Clinton. Chien, a first-generation immigrant whose parents were born in China, said Trump's hostility toward immigrants troubled her.

And the consequences could be immense.	"   Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  The election is just five days away, and something truly frightening is happening, something with far-reaching implications for the immediate future of American politics. Republicans, led by Donald Trump but by no means limited to him, are engaging in kind of termite-level assault on American democracy, one that looks on the surface as though it's just aimed at Hillary Clinton, but in fact is undermining our entire system. I know, my conservative friends will say that this kind of talk is just fear-mongering and exaggeration. But there is something deeply troubling happening right now, and it goes beyond the ordinary trading of blows in a campaign season. Consider these recent developments:  There appears to be a war going on inside the FBI, and from what we can tell, a group of rogue agents, mostly in New York, may be in such a fervor to destroy Hillary Clinton that they may be aggressively leaking damaging innuendo to the press against her in the waning days of the campaign. They succeeded in their apparent goal of making FBI director James Comey a tool of their campaign -- and the basis for their investigation is an anti-Clinton book written under the auspices of an organization of which the CEO of the Trump campaign is co-founder and chairman. Pro-Trump FBI agents now seem to be coordinating with Trump surrogates to do maximal possible damage to Clinton.   Republicans continue to cheer the fact that the electronic systems of American political groups were illegally hacked, and then private communications were selectively released in order to do damage to one side in this election. The Republican nominee has explicitly asked a hostile foreign power to hack into his opponent's electronic systems. High-ranking Republican officeholders are now suggesting that they may impeach Clinton as soon as she takes office. These are not just backbench nutbars of the Louie Gohmert variety, but people with genuine power, including Ron Johnson, the senator from Wisconsin, Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, and veteran legislators like James Sensenbrenner and Peter King. The message is being echoed by top Trump surrogates like Rudy Giuliani. There is a growing movement among Republicans in the Senate to simply refuse to approve any nominee appointed by a Democratic president to the Supreme Court, leaving open any and all vacancies until a Republican can be elected to fill them. State and local Republican officials are engaged in widespread and systematic efforts to suppress the votes of African-Americans and other groups likely to vote disproportionately Democratic; in many cases officials have been ordered by courts to stop their suppression efforts and they have simply ignored the court orders.  Republican elected officials increasingly feel emboldened to openly suggest violence against Clinton should she be elected.    [The only way Trump can win]   It is important to understand that is not normal. This is not just bare-knuckle politics. Something extraordinary is happening.      The Post's Rosalind Helderman breaks down the latest developments of the controversies involving the FBI less than a week from Election Day. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Let's take the FBI case as just one example. You have a situation where a group of FBI agents is in direct conflict with prosecutors who believe the agents have a weak case in their attempt to find evidence of corruption that can be used against Clinton. The agents, in an atrocious violation of FBI policy against injecting the Bureau into an election, begin leaking dark innuendo to reporters. That convinces the FBI director that he has no choice but to go public with the fact that the Bureau is looking at some emails that might or might not have something to do with Clinton, though no one has actually read them. That news lands like a bombshell, despite its complete lack of substance.  And then it turns out that these agents are basing their investigation on a book called ""Clinton Cash"" by Peter Schweizer. Schweizer is the president of the Government Accountability Institute, an organization co-founded and chaired by Steve Bannon. Who is the CEO of the Trump campaign. While the ""imagine if the other side was doing this"" argument can sometimes sound trite, in this case it's more than apt. Imagine if a group of FBI agents were leaking damaging information on Donald Trump in violation of longstanding departmental policy, and it turned out that they were basing their innuendo on a book published by the Center for American Progress, which Clinton campaign chair John Podesta founded and used to run. Republicans would be crying bloody murder, and I'm pretty sure the entire news media would be backing them up every step of the way.      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump believes there's a global conspiracy to stop him from becoming president - but it's not the first time he's pushed unfounded theories. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)     [Former CIA chief: Trump is Russia's useful fool]   It's not that this kind of thing is completely unprecedented. When Bill Clinton was impeached, people talked about ""the criminalization of politics"" -- the idea that Republicans were trying to use the levers of the justice system as a means to prevail in what should be just ordinary political competition. George W. Bush's administration fired a group of U.S. Attorneys because they were unwilling to pursue bogus voter fraud cases against Democrats or were too willing to investigate genuine corruption among Republican officials. There are cases like the absurd prosecution of former Alabama governor Don Siegelman, who has been in jail for years because he reappointed to a state health care board a man who had donated money to a lottery initiative Siegelman favored. And there was this guy named J. Edgar Hoover. But as he has in so many ways, Donald Trump takes every ugly impulse Republicans have and turns it up to 11, and just about the entire party follows him down. So now they are making it very clear that from literally the day Hillary Clinton is inaugurated, they will wage total war on her. There will be no rule or norm or standard of decency they won't flout if it gets them a step closer to destroying her, no matter what the collateral damage.  It's important to understand that strong institutions are what separate strong democracies from weak ones. In a strong democracy, one party can't come into power and just lock up its opponents. It can't turn the country's law enforcement agencies into a partisan tool to destroy the other party. It can't say that the courts will function only at its pleasure. We have the world's most stable system not just because there aren't tanks in the streets on election day, but because we have institutions that are strong enough to restrain the venality of individual men and women. And now, Republicans are not even pretending that those institutions should be impartial and transcend partisanship. They're saying, if we can use them to destroy our opponents, we will. Something is seriously breaking down.   [Here's how you destroy a democratic republic]   And please, spare me any explanations for this phenomenon that rely on how ""divided"" Americans are. Are we divided? Sure. But there's only one party that is so vigorously undermining core democratic institutions in this way. You may not like what Democrats stand for, but they aren't engaging in widespread official vote suppression, chanting that should their candidate win her opponent should be tossed in jail, promising to prevent any Republican president from filling vacancies on the Supreme Court, suggesting that they'll try to impeach their opponent as soon as he takes office, cheering when a hostile foreign power hacks into American electronic systems, and trying to use the FBI to win the election.  Only one party is doing all of that. And we should all be very worried about what Republicans will do after November 8, whether they win or lose.          1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail      View Photos   The GOP presidential nominee is pressing his case ahead of Election Day.

(Anna Fifield, Yoonjung Seo, Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)   SEOUL -- South Korean President Park Geun-hye is fighting for her political life amid a burgeoning scandal over allegations that her close friend was acting as a kind of ""shadow president"" and making money from it. Park has apologized and replaced her closest aides, including the prime minister. Her friend Choi Soon-sil is in custody. This debacle is ""breathtaking"" even by the standards of South Korea, where political scandals are a dime a dozen, said Se-woong Koo, editor of the Korea Expose Web magazine.   [South Korean president says she's willing to be investigated in corruption scandal]   ""The revelations, about just how much influence this one woman with no official government position might have wielded over the government, point to a discomfiting possibility,"" he wrote in a post. ""Power in this country doesn't completely belong to a legitimately elected leader. Instead, the president is in thrall to a shadowy figure who pursues her private agenda."" This crisis isn't going away anytime soon. Here's what you need to know about it. Stick with me here -- this is a long and winding tale. How did this all start? It began several weeks ago when local media outlets started reporting that Choi had been advising the president in surprising ways. A television station said it had found a tablet computer that contained files of speeches the president had yet to give, among other documents. Since then more allegations have come out, suggesting Choi's influence extended from budget decisions to Park's wardrobe. But it all blew up last Sunday when Choi, who had been in Germany (where she owns a horse farm) for several months, returned to South Korea and showed up the following day for questioning at the prosecutor's office. The media scrum that greeted her made Justin Bieber fans look restrained. Choi has been detained, and the courts issued a warrant for her arrest Thursday night. Who is this Choi Soon-sil? Choi and Park have been friends for four decades. To explain their connection, we need to go back a long way. Bear with this. Park's father, Park Chung-hee, was an army general who seized control of South Korea in a military coup in 1961. He ruled for almost two decades, a period associated both with astonishingly fast economic development but also iron-fisted repression of dissent. In 1974, Park and his wife, Yook Young-soo, were at the national theater in Seoul when a North Korean sympathizer tried to assassinate the president. The bullet instead hit Yook, killing her. It was after this event that Choi Tae-min, the leader of a religious cult that borrowed from Christianity and Buddhism, sent a letter to the young Park Geun-hye, then 22 years old and suddenly first lady. Choi told Park that he could channel her dead mother, and he started ""passing messages"" to Park. Some kind of mentorship began. The fact that Choi, 40 years her senior, was becoming close to Park Geun-hye raised eyebrows at the time. Then, in 1979, Park's father was assassinated by his own intelligence chief. Recent news reports have suggested that the spy chief was motivated partly out of frustration over Choi's closeness to the young Park and the president's inability to do anything about it. Got it so far? Okay, still with you. What happened next? These years were clearly tough ones for Park. ""I was shocked, of course. It was very painful for me, but at the same time the order was too tall for me not to accept it,"" Park told me when, interviewing her in 2007, I asked how she coped with the loss of her mother and being thrust into such a public role at the same time. After her father died, Park disappeared into the wilderness for almost two decades. To this day, it is not entirely clear what she did during that period. But in recent weeks, local media have reported that Park became the leader of a group established by Choi Tae-min and that, even at that time, there were whispers that the Choi family was profiting off its relationship with Park. In 1994, Choi Tae-min died. Four years later, Park returned to the political scene, entering the national assembly. Less than a decade later, she was making her first bid for the presidency, running against former Seoul mayor Lee Myung-bak for the conservative party's nomination. (Lee won both the nomination and the presidency.) It was at this time that the U.S. Embassy in Seoul sent a cable back to Washington, noting the opposition's allegations of an improper relationship between Park Geun-hye and Choi Tae-min. The cable, released by WikiLeaks, described Choi Tae-min as ""a charismatic pastor"" and noted that he was characterized locally as a ""Korean Rasputin"" who controlled Park after her mother was assassinated. ""Rumors are rife that the late pastor had complete control over Park's body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result,"" read the cable. Park, who has never married, has strongly denied any improper relationship. Well, that's rather sensational, but how does that get us to a political scandal in 2016? After her mother was assassinated, Park became close not only to Choi Tae-min but also to one of his daughters, Choi Soon-sil, who is four years younger than Park. South Korean media are reporting that Choi Soon-sil ""inherited"" her father's ability to communicate with Park's mother, and that she took on the role of delivering messages from beyond the grave after the elder Choi died. (Of course, this is all speculation, and nothing has been confirmed.) Park last week said that Choi Soon-sil had helped her through ""difficult times."" But South Korean media have uncovered evidence that, they say, shows Choi was doing much more than that. So, what are the allegations here? First of all, there's the suspicion that Choi, who held no official position and has no security clearance, was involved in everything from editing speeches to doling out the culture ministry's $150 million budget. The JTBC cable television channel said it had found a tablet computer that contained files of speeches the president had yet to give, memos for cabinet meetings, messages traded with presidential aides and schedules. Choi denied the tablet was hers -- but hasn't explained how it came to hold a selfie of her. Park also apparently gave Choi a generous budget to buy clothes for her, but Choi is accused of ordering cheap outfits and pocketing the difference. A clip emerged showing Choi's staff smoking and eating fried chicken as a tailor was making a suit for Park, even touching the fabric with their greasy hands. Park wore the suit during a presidential visit with China's Xi Jinping. Second, there's the allegation that Choi used her position to enrich herself and benefit her family. She set up two foundations with about $70 million donated from the big business lobby in South Korea, which counts Samsung and Hyundai among its members. Choi is now accused of having siphoned off a lot of that money for her own personal use, and some of Park's since-fired aides are under investigation for pressuring the companies to donate. And there's the case of Choi's 19-year-old daughter, Chung Yoo-ra. An equestrian with hopes of participating in the 2020 Olympics dressage competition, Chung's grades apparently weren't good enough to get her admitted to Ewha Womans University, one of South Korea's most prestigious. So the university allegedly changed its admissions criteria to give credit to applicants with honors in equestrian sports. Yep, you couldn't make this up. The president of Ewha has resigned over the allegations. What's the reaction been? It has been loud and it has been long. Last weekend, thousands of people took to the streets of central Seoul to protest against Park, many of them calling for her resignation. Park's approval rating has fallen to just 9 percent, according to one poll. Another found that 70 percent of respondents wanted to her resign or be impeached. Members of the main opposition party and students are calling on her to resign. Even her own ministers are saying it's possible that Park will be investigated for wrongdoing. If you can handle one more twist, here's an added tale: Choi Soon-sil's ex-husband is Chung Yoon-hoi, who served as chief of staff to Park while she was a lawmaker. When the Sewol ferry sank in 2014, claiming more than 300 lives, many of them high school students, Park reportedly couldn't be contacted for seven hours. The Chosun Ilbo reported that she was with Chung during that time. When the Sankei Shimbun, the conservative Japanese newspaper, repeated the allegations, the reporter found himself sued for defamation and banned from leaving the country for 14 months. Wow. But South Koreans are not exactly unfamiliar with allegations of corruption at the highest levels. Why are they so exercised about this case? Well, apart from all the lurid suggestions of shamans and sex, this whole brouhaha taps into a widespread feeling that the president is too removed from the people. She is considered aloof; former aides to this president and her predecessor say she doesn't take advice even from her own staff. Now comes the allegation that she was secretly getting advice from someone with no government experience and questionable links to a cult. Plus, someone who apparently thought so little of the friendship that she was prepared to let the president wear cheap clothes pawed by greasy fingers to important international events. The idea that Choi's daughter received preferential treatment to be admitted to college has struck a particularly raw nerve at a time when many young Koreans are complaining about the difficulties in working their way up the ladder. Here's a story I wrote about the whole issue: ""Young South Koreans call their country 'hell' and look for ways out."" Every president since South Korea became democratic in 1987 has been tarnished with corruption allegations in some way, sometimes involving family members. So why has this corruption scandal caused such a firestorm? ""It is not because Korean people discovered that Park was corrupt; it is because they discovered Park was irrationally corrupt,"" a Virginia-based blogger known simply as ""the Korean"" wrote on his site, Ask a Korean. ""Why did Park Geun-hye, the president, even bother with Choi Soon-sil, a nobody?"" Aside from the deception, South Koreans find the fact that Park does not appear to have been acting for her own benefit most perplexing of all. ""Even though we would prefer that our politicians are not corrupt, at least we know how corrupt politicians behave. But not with Park Geun-hye. Her corruption was not self-interested at all. If anything, her corruption was self-sacrificing in favor of Choi Soon-sil,"" the Ask a Korean blogger wrote. ""Koreans may expect that the president would be corrupt, but they never could have expected that the president might be feeble in her mind,"" he said Is Park going to fall over this? Probably not. The opposition, which was already in disarray, has no incentive to take over the government for the year until the next presidential election. In reality, Park will probably lead the lamest of lame duck administrations until election in December 2017. She has already nominated a new prime minister, a former adviser to liberal president Roh Moo-hyun, and appointed a new chief of staff, a man who did the same job for Kim Dae-jung, the left-wing president of the late 1990s. Both moves are seen as an attempt to form a kind of unity government and placate the opposition. But buckle up, because the ride isn't over yet.
