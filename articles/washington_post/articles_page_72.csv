Organizers estimated that more than 20,000 people protested, carried placards, flew flags and chanted slogans as lawmakers deliberated the bill inside. Most were affiliated with conservative religious and social groups that chartered buses to bring protesters to the capital, Taipei. Some demanded an island-wide plebiscite with slogans such as ""Marriage and family, let all the people decide,"" while speakers argued that same-sex marriage would psychologically harm future generations. Backers of the bill, separated from the main group by a line of police, waved rainbow flags and chanted their support for gay rights. Both the ruling and major opposition parties support legalization of same-sex marriage, as do a majority of the public along with President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's first female head of state. The bill would change the legal definition of marriage from between ""male and female parties"" to between ""two parties."" Supporters hope to pass it by the end of the current session in December. Taiwan would join Canada, Colombia, Ireland, the United States and 16 other countries that have legalized same-sex marriage. But it would be a notable exception in Asia and the Middle East where many countries still ban gay sex. Gays and lesbians in Taiwan have formed an effective lobby in recent years, with an annual Gay Pride march in Taipei last month drawing tens of thousands. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

With many question marks around Trump's foreign policy plans, EU foreign ministers agreed at talks in Brussels on the need to strengthen Europe's role in world affairs until the future of trans-Atlantic relations becomes clearer. In a first concrete step a day after the anniversary of the deadly Paris attacks in which 130 people died last year, the ministers signed off on a sprawling new security and defense plan. But the plan is a far cry from the idea of an ""EU army"" with a military headquarters that was annoying some EU partners at NATO. It identifies Europe's main tasks as responding to external threats, building the security resilience of partners outside the EU and protecting the 28-nation bloc and its citizens.  ""This is a qualitative leap in the European Union's security and defense,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told reporters after the meeting. She said that work on taking it forward would begin within weeks. Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said, ""I think there is a realization this is a strategic moment for Europe right now. We are surrounded by autocratic, assertive or fragile countries. That means we have to take to take more our own responsibilities.""  ""We are in an uncertain world, and it has not started with the election of Mr. Trump,"" said French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. ""But Europe must not wait for others' decisions, it must defend its own interests -- that is to say the interest of Europeans -- and at the same time reaffirming its strategic role on the global level."" His Belgian counterpart, Didier Reynders, said Trump's election was ""a possibility for the EU to go further. We need to enhance our capacity in defense and security.""  ""The EU needs to find a way to have its voice heard in the search for political solutions ... and ensure that it's not simply a conversation between Washington and Moscow, so that we can have the EU really at the table,"" he said. In another move Monday, the ministers reaffirmed their support for the Iran nuclear agreement, which Trump has branded the ""worst deal in the world"" and vowed to renegotiate. They said ""the European Union reiterates its resolute commitment"" to the part of the action plan that EU heavyweights Britain, France and Germany agreed upon with Iran. The plan includes lifting ""nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions and engaging with the private sector and economic operators, especially banks, to promote growth in trade and investment."" While campaigning, Trump called the pact agreed last year a ""lopsided disgrace"" and railed against its time-limited restrictions on Iran's enrichment of uranium and other nuclear activity. Trump's exact plans are vague, though, and renegotiating a deal Iran and other partners are happy with would be difficult. But perhaps Europe's most pressing problem is to understand how Trump wants to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The EU has imposed sanctions on Russia over its 2014 annexation of Crimea and destabilizing role elsewhere in Ukraine. Any signal from Trump about a warming of U.S. relations with Russia is likely to embolden already-reluctant countries like Germany, Italy and others to push for an end to the sanctions regime. Trump and Putin spoke on Monday. In a statement issued after the call, the Kremlin said that Putin expressed readiness to establish a ""partner-like"" dialogue with Trump's incoming administration. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted Monday that Trump's presidency could be a ""moment of opportunity"" for Europe. Johnson, who championed Britain's exit from the EU and skipped Sunday night's foreign ministers meeting, said Trump ""is a dealmaker and I think that could be a good thing for Britain, but it can also a good thing for Europe. I think that's what we need to focus on today."" Other EU diplomats said they should focus instead on problems closer to home, such as the refugee emergency and economic issues. Speaking at a conference at Harvard University Pierre Moscovici, European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said Trump's win was a ""political wake-up call"" that demonstrates a decline of democratic values and a rise of populist ideas in both the U.S. and Europe.  ""I am a politician, as you recall, also a Social Democrat and I want to share with you my worries when I see democrats and our shared values losing ground on both sides of the Atlantic,"" Moscovici said. ___ Charlton reported from Paris.

That was her own. ""She wanted to keep it quiet,"" said CNN political analyst Gloria Borger moments ago. She was talking about Ifill's death, at 61, after a fight with cancer. At the time of her death, Ifill was co-host of PBS's ""NewsHour"" as well as moderator of ""Washington Week."" She had taken a medical leave last spring. ""I am very sad to tell you that our dear friend and beloved colleague Gwen Ifill passed away today in hospice care in Washington,"" WETA President and Chief Executive Sharon Percy Rockefeller wrote to colleagues Monday. ""I spent an hour with her this morning and she was resting comfortably, surrounded by loving family and friends. ... Earlier today, I conveyed to Gwen the devoted love and affection of all of us at WETA/NewsHour. Let us hold Gwen and her family even closer now in our hearts and prayers."" And in a statement, ""NewsHour"" executive producer Sara Just said, in part, ""Gwen was a standard bearer for courage, fairness and integrity in an industry going through seismic change. She was a mentor to so many across the industry and her professionalism was respected across the political spectrum. She was a journalist's journalist and set an example for all around her."" Allow the Erik Wemple Blog to second Just's assessment. An episodic consumer of the ""NewsHour,"" this blog enjoyed its depth, curiosity and reasonableness -- traits that came straight from Ifill. Even when the program's work veered a bit off track -- putting it under the prying eyes of this blog -- it did so while in pursuit of serious and lasting journalism. And in a world where TV anchors commonly hide behind PR types, Ifill simply answered the emails that we sent her. Done! Folks who watch cable news all day might have had trouble acclimating themselves to Ifill's markedly calm approach to distilling the news. ""Shouting is a good way to foment conflict, but it's not the best way to inform,"" she said in 1999. Perhaps she felt no need to shout because she knew stuff. Though lots of TV talent like to fancy themselves print journalists, that's what Ifill actually was at heart. She had worked at The Post, the New York Times and other outlets. As she progressed in her career, she became wiser and quite succinct. In 2008, before moderating the vice-presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin, Ifill engaged in this exchange in a Post chat: Motor Mouth: Have you interviewed Biden before? How in the world has he survived as a national politician for three decades without censoring his mouth? He seems to spurt out whatever he's thinking at the moment without filtering it in any manner. Has there ever been a politician like this on the national stage? Gwen Ifill: I have interviewed Sen. Biden, and I believe you overstate. Ifill also moderated a vice-presidential debate in 2004. One way to memorialize Ifill: Check the video at top, from her first night as moderator of ""Washington Week."" The discussion includes then-New York Times reporter Richard Berke, then-CBS News correspondent Gloria Borger, Linda Greenhouse of the New York Times and Michael Duffy of Time magazine. Not in attendance were paid political hacks and shallow discussion."

" NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump is promising restraint on Twitter but showing few signs of letting up on the tweetstorms that served as a pillar of his winning White House campaign, an approach to social media that could take presidential discourse into unchartered territory. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's ""Fireside Chats,"" it's not likely to be. Trump said in an interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes"" taped Friday and aired Sunday that he would be ""very restrained"" but credited social media sites like Twitter for helping him triumph over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.  ""I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won,"" Trump said. ""I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that."" But then he spent the weekend making several celebratory tweets about his win, criticizing the New York Times and advertising the ""60 Minutes"" interview. Trump's use of Twitter at all hours raises questions of whether he can still carry on that way once he's president. One of Clinton's repeated arguments against Trump was that he was a ""man who you could bait with a tweet."" GOP strategists, however, say Trump is unlikely to abandon the medium.  ""To take away Twitter from Donald Trump is to strip away part of who he is,"" said Hogan Gidley, a former adviser to Republican Mike Huckabee's presidential campaigns. ""His supporters, half of America, like who he is, voted for who he is and you don't want to hamstring the person."" Since his unlikely victory, Trump has taken to Twitter to celebrate his win, note his congratulatory calls and touch off fresh fights. Two days after Trump was elected, he was critical of ""professional protesters, incited by the media."" The following morning, he appeared to back track, tweeting, ""Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!"" Trump has also sparred with The New York Times on Twitter, criticizing the newspaper's coverage and falsely claiming it had lost subscribers and had sent an apologetic letter to readers. In fact, Executive Editor Dean Baquet thanked subscribers for their loyalty and vowed that the paper would ""hold power to account, impartially and unflinchingly."" Unvarnished and unfiltered, Trump utilized Twitter and social media throughout his presidential campaign, rallying support, settling scores with political and media adversaries and retweeting incendiary statements, including those from white supremacists. That could mean Trump will take presidential Twitter in directions that the first social media president, President Barack Obama, never did.  ""I would expect him to be a lot more engaged, especially at times when they think they need to change the narrative,"" said Bret Jacobson, a Republican digital strategist who was unaligned during the campaign. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of political communication at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication, said Trump's White House will need to decide whether to specify which tweets are coming from the president himself or his staff. She noted that an individual tweet from Trump could affect world events and be taken by foreign leaders as an indicator of U.S. policy.  ""The Trump campaign did not make those distinctions so you did not know which tweets were coming from him,"" she said. The presidential handle will be made available to Trump once he's inaugurated in January. Trump's transition team has not yet said whether he will use both his personal Twitter account and the presidential one. The White House said in October that the @POTUS account would maintain its more than 11 million followers but start the next administration without any tweets on the timeline. The National Archives has created a new account -- @POTUS44 -- which will contain all of Obama's presidential tweets and serve as an archives of his Twitter activity. Trump's advisers have also not yet indicated whether they will maintain the current ground rules for the @POTUS account. The Obama White House has automatically archived tweets from official White House accounts, direct messages sent to or from official White House accounts and mentions -- tweets from other users to official White House accounts. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told reporters at Trump Tower on Monday that she hadn't discussed with Trump whether he would use the @POTUS handle, saying only of his Twitter use: ""I'll leave that to him."" __ On Twitter, follow Ken Thomas at @kthomasDC.

5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/10/one-election-bright-spot-for-democrats-women-of-color/	One election bright spot for Democrats: Women of color	"    The Congress that voters cobbled together Tuesday is a mixed bag on the diversity front: Women held more or less even in their representation (about 20 percent of Congress), which is not a representative ratio. But the women who did get elected are more diverse than ever. Some results were still coming in as of late Wednesday, but it looked like the Senate will gain one new female senator and the House of Representatives will lose one female lawmaker. (The number of female governors will drop by one.) The story of 2016 is a pickup here for women, a drop-off there. All told, an election featuring the first female major-party presidential candidate didn't have much of an impact on the number of women in politics. ""For all of the talk of this being a change election, it was not a change election for women in politics,"" said Debbie Walsh, director of the nonpartisan Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. ""We just aren't seeing enough of them."" Tuesday did include some bright spots for women of color who ran for office. Come January, there will be a record number -- 38 -- women of color serving in Congress (35 Democrats, three Republicans). Democrats elected three new women of color to the Senate -- Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, Tammy Duckworth in Illinois and Kamala Harris in California. And several of these new members of Congress are notable firsts: Cortez Masto (D), who won the open Nevada Senate seat, will be the nation's first Latina senator. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D) will be the first African American woman to serve in Congress from Delaware. (She'll also be the first woman to serve in Congress from Delaware. For anyone counting, there are now just two states -- Mississippi and Vermont -- who have never sent a woman to Congress.) By winning California's open Senate race, Harris (D) will be the first Indian American to serve in the U.S. Senate and just the second African American woman to serve in it. Further down the ballot, one of House Democrats' biggest upsets came via a woman of color: Stephanie Murphy (D) will be the first Vietnamese-American female member of Congress after she knocked out 12-term GOP incumbent Rep. John L. Mica in Florida's 7th Congressional District. In Nevada -- a state that was a bright spot for Democrats at almost every level -- Democrats put up an all-female ballot in a suburb of Las Vegas, right down to county commissioner. And New Hampshire will once again be represented by an all-female congressional delegation. (Although with GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte's loss, Republican women take a hit, going from six to five female senators.) There were more victories for women of color even further down the ballot. Via a Minnesota state legislative race, Democrats elected the first Somali American lawmaker, Ilhan Omar. And in Kentucky, voters elected Democrat Attica Scott, the state's first black female legislator in 20 years. Voters also elected 40 Native American Democrats in state legislative races across the country. Indian American Pramila Jayapal (D) won an open congressional seat in Washington state. And Val Demings (D), the first African American woman to serve as police chief of Orlando, won her congressional race in Florida. The victories were a bright spot for Democrats in an otherwise dark election. ""The women we just elected will bring their diverse perspectives and strong voices to Congress at a time when we've never needed them more,"" said Jessica O'Connell, executive director of Emily's List, which worked with many of the Democratic winners.   [Republicans are about to reach the holy grail of governance]   House Republicans didn't add any women of color to their congressional roster, but they managed to help reelect Rep. Mia Love in Utah, who in 2014 became the first black female Republican in Congress. And Republicans' most senior woman in the House is Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.), who in 1989 became the first Latina elected to Congress. Rep. Jaime Lynn Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) also won reelection. Republicans have been making an effort at the state level to recruit and support more women of color, and on Tuesday they elected at least five new women of color across the country, including Affie Ellis who became the first Native American woman elected to the Wyoming Legislature. A lot for women of color to celebrate. But when you zoom out, there's less for women to cheer about. Women are still vastly underrepresented in politics -- as they have been for decades and will continue to be. In 2016, women make up half the U.S. population but just under 20 percent of Congress. To win more races, women need to run more, Walsh said. Research shows women win at the same rate as men. And for whatever reason, 2016 didn't have a record number of women running. Those women who did run were doing so in a bad election for Democrats, which generally translates to a bad election for female politicians, more of whom are Democratic than Republican. Women in politics must also consider the lasting effect of Hillary Clinton's loss. Walsh thinks it could discourage other women from jumping in on both sides of the aisle. Research shows women have to prove likability and qualifications more than men do. ""If Hillary Clinton could prevail, I thought it would send a message that she weathered all these attacks and got elected,"" Walsh said. ""And I thought we would have a president who would use her bully pulpit in part to talk about the importance of more women being engaged in the political process. ... But that's not what happened."" Change is just moving too slowly to be cast as real change. As Walsh told The Fix back in June: ""If the goal is political parity, doing it in increments of five is going to take a very long time."" In 2016, women didn't even make it that far. But the women who did win are more diverse than ever, so that's something. Correction: This post originally misidentified the state that elected the first Somali-American lawmaker. Ilhan Omar was elected in Minnesota. "

Despite Hillary Clinton and President Obama urging their backers to accept Trump's victory and support his transition into power, thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets decrying his crude comments about women and attacks on immigrants. Protests were reported in cities across the nation, from major metropolitan centers like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, to smaller cities, such as Richmond and Portland, Ore. Dozens of demonstrators were arrested. Even cities in red states, such as Atlanta, Dallas and Kansas City, Mo., saw demonstrations. In Oakland, Calif., two police officers were injured and two patrol cars burned as thousands of protesters took to the streets and chanted slogans against Trump, a police spokeswoman said. A few protesters threw objects at police dressed in riot gear, smashed windows and started small fires in the downtown area.         1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flared up across the country Wednesday evening as opponents of President-elect Donald Trump expressed dismay with the election results, underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting a fractured country.

Hundreds of others blocked two different highways, backing up traffic for miles. ""I'm disappointed, shocked, a little panicked for my friends and family -- for everything that will be unleashed, the hate that will be unleashed,"" said Marion Hill, 22, who joined thousands who amassed outside of the Trump Tower in downtown Chicago. Rainbow flags and signs bearing messages such as ""Time to Revolt"" waved above the crowd, as protesters filled Michigan Avenue, cheered on by drivers who honked their support. They then shut down Lake Shore Drive, the expressway along Lake Michigan.   [A year in Trump's America: Frustration, fury and fervor]  Most of the major demonstrations took place in urban centers in blue states Clinton won Tuesday -- highlighting the demographic divide that shaped the election results. The former secretary of state's narrow victory in the popular vote spurred demonstrators in New York to chant ""She got more votes!"" as thousands amassed in front of Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan. The crowd stretched several blocks down Fifth Avenue.     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted View Graphic     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted  Earlier, the protesters had marched from Union Square to Trump's building, chanting ""Donald Trump, go away! Sexist, racist, anti-gay!""  At one point, demonstrators lit an American flag on fire. Later, amid a cacophony of loud chants, a glowing ""Love Trumps Hate"" banner was held aloft under the Trump Tower sign. The singer Cher mingled in the crowd, doling out hugs. In Washington, a crowd of hundreds of mostly young protesters gathered outside the White House for a candlelight vigil before marching to the new Trump International Hotel a few blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue. ""I'm trying to not be angry and trying to find more positive way to express my reactions. I don't think anger will help,"" said Kate Lasso, 57, who joined the crowd. But for the wife of a Guatemalan immigrant, who has relatives in the country without proper documentation, restraining emotion was difficult. ""They have kids,"" she said. ""They have been living here. What is going to happen to them?""  [Undocumented immigrants fear what Trump will do as president]  Hundreds also marched through Philadelphia, with about 700 people heading north through Center City and blocking intersections as they made their way up Broad Street, police said. The protesters in these scattered cities -- some of them the same places that have seen heated demonstrations sparked by fatal police shootings in recent years -- could be seen in videos streaming across on cable news and social media, lit by flashing police lights and streetlights as they wound through metropolitan streets. Many who turned out said they were fearful that Trump would follow through with his pledge to deport undocumented immigrants. ""I just felt waking up today that I was waking up to a whole new world, to a nightmare for my parents and people I care about and love,"" said Tony, a 23-year-old line cook who declined to give his last name as he marched in Chicago, carrying his 6-year-old daughter on his shoulders. ""There's so much heartache,"" he said. ""It's a bad time to be a Muslim or an illegal citizen in this country."" In Santa Ana., Calif., Lucy Dominguez, 37, and her husband, Oliver Lopez, 33, had their arms around one another and held a sign reading, ""Peace."" ""I came to stand up with the people. To stand up with my people, the Latino community,"" she said. ""I chose the peace sign because we need peace in this moment."" Hours earlier, Trump struck magnanimous note of reconciliation as he claimed victory shortly before 3 a.m. ""Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division,"" he said. ""We have to get together. To all Republicans, Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people."" Trump's tone was echoed by Obama and Clinton, who told their supporters not to despair as Republicans rejoiced at the idea that they will control both the legislative and executive branches of government in two and-a-half months. ""I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it, too,"" Clinton said. ""This is painful, and it will be for a long time.""  [A speech Clinton never imagined giving]  Clinton, who was misty-eyed at times but composed throughout her remarks, said the long and bitter campaign against Trump showed that ""our nation is more deeply divided that we thought."" But she told her backers: ""We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" Minutes later, Obama addressed reporters in the Rose Garden with Vice President Biden by his side, as more than a hundred White House staffers stood off to the side. Several of the aides were visibly emotional, with at least one crying before he began speaking. ""Now, everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we're actually all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage,"" Obama said, vowing to work to ensure a smooth transition for the president-elect. But the displays of anger and grief on the streets Wednesday indicated the depth of the rupture in the country -- and the distrust with which many Americans view Trump. ""He's going to lead us to a very dark place for women,"" said Samantha Sylverne, a 19-year-old student, who marched in Chicago carrying a sign scrawled on a cardboard box that read, ""Amerikkka elected a rapist."" ""Along with how it affects our reproductive rights, the things Donald Trump spews about women shape how Americans think they can talk about women and other marginalized people,"" she said. In New York, where protesters walked in the streets, disrupting traffic, Brandon Ramos, 21, said the election result ""feels like a nightmare."" ""I'm Latino,"" he said. ""My entire family and neighborhood are depressed. I still haven't comprehended it.""  [What does Trump's win say about us as a nation?]  Tensions flared particularly high on college campuses. At American University in Washington, students burned American flags and some shouted ""F--- white America!"" In Austin, students at the University of Texas led a march for hours through the city Wednesday afternoon. As hundreds of protesters wove into traffic, bus drivers high-fived the students. Some in their vehicles got out and hugged them, tears streaming down their faces. ""Seeing this is everything,"" said Jennifer Rowsey, 47, as the march passed by a coffee shop next to Austin City Hall where she is the human resource manager. ""I felt so isolated,"" she said. ""I don't feel so alone now."" Austin City Council member Greg Casar, the son of Mexican immigrants and a community organizer, joined up with the protesters when they passed by an interview he was giving with local media. ""A lot of people are calling for healing,"" he said. ""I think we should reject that."" He said that now is the time to support protesters, strikers and other forms of civil disobedience. Casar said if Trump comes to Austin, he will refuse to shake his hand. ""If I have to go to jail,"" for protesting, he said, ""I'll go to jail."" The evening march in Washington converged in front of the Trump hotel, where one demonstrator pasted a sign of Trump's face marked with the word ""Hate"" on the side of the building. A few protesters attempted to rush through a crowd barrier in front of the hotel's side entrance before security officials quickly intervened and pushed them back. Other protesters jeered against the escalation, drowning out the momentary disruption with chants of ""When they go low, we go high."" Some in the crowd distributed fliers with plans for another protest -- on Inauguration Day. Bailey Walker, a 20-year-old George Mason University student, found herself grappling with how she could have been so confident of a Clinton victory. ""I created an echo chamber within my social media and friend groups, and I wasn't listening,"" said Walker, who said she knew only a few Trump supporters from the college public speaking circuit. ""I need to do a better job of connecting with them and engaging,"" she said. ""Meeting in person would be a big step.""  Lydersen reported from Chicago.

Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   Eight years ago, unprecedented throngs of Americans rushed into the streets in the middle of the night. People cried, hugged strangers, kissed cops, shared champagne. The country had just elected its first black president, and it felt as if liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, were on the same team, if only for a rousing moment, and that team had just won the World Series. Of course, it quickly became clear that Barack Obama had won office in a divided nation hungry for change but also mistrustful of authority, suspicious of nearly everything. Donald Trump's victory Tuesday night seemed unlikely to provoke any such unifying surge of goodwill and pride.    Trump addresses supporters after winning the presidency early Wednesday. (Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post)  Americans on election night of 2016 had the blues -- anxious about the future, miffed about the lousy choices they faced, insecure about the nation's place in the world, bothered by each other. A presidential election is a reflection of the national culture and mood, and if the Obama election was a statement of optimism about the radical demographic, technological and social changes of recent decades, then what did Americans' choice of Trump really mean? It is, some voters said, an admission of exhaustion, a collective settling for the lesser of two evils in a country where people increasingly choose not to live near, associate with or listen to those who hold opposing political views. Not quite, other voters said. With or without Trump's extraordinary appeal, Americans were determined this year to send the politicians a message about the pain caused by a decades-long collapse of certainties about what America looks like, what constitutes a family and how we earn a living.    Police officers speak with a poll judge, third from the left, in the presence of an assistant district attorney, bottom, at a polling place at the Christy Recreation Center in West Philadelphia on Tuesday. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)  Through traditional news media and new social media, an unusually captivated audience saw this campaign as a disorienting kaleidoscope of bloodcurdling anger at raucous rallies, waves of investigation and suspicion, and torrents of insults traded by candidates and their supporters. Tuesday's vote left unresolved whether the ugly narrative of unprincipled demagogue vs. dishonest harridan really reflects a country that has fallen into coarse, raw hatred -- or if the 2016 campaign was instead a symptom of the newly pervasive power of Facebook, Twitter and other social media. The line between public and private blurred so thoroughly that nasty, hurtful comments that people once made only to their closest family members and friends were now broadcast to the world at large.   [How Donald Trump broke the old rules of politics -- and won the White House]   Trump is ""like that doctor with the horrible bedside manner,"" said Chris Love, 50, a Trump supporter and firearms academy owner who was voting in Davie, Fla.  ""He tells you 90 percent of your arteries are clogged. By being blunt, he's saving your life."" Across the ideological divide, some see this year's surly, sour campaign as a reflection of sentiments that have been plainly visible on the Internet for a long time but that just this year exploded into open expression. ""Fear and anger and misogyny and xenophobia don't change -- they were always out there, but now those people can find each other so much more easily,"" said Chip Franklin, a radio talk show host in San Francisco who built his career as a conservative, then shifted his politics to the left. ""This year's anger is the same as any year's anger, but what's different now is that there are 30 different ways to express that anger and share it with people who would never have seen it before. Then along came Donald Trump, willing to say whatever people wanted him to say."" Even if he had lost, this would have been the year of Trump, a wholesale rejection of politics as usual. The thin enthusiasm for Clinton, the revival of the 1990s narrative painting her as dishonest and arrogant, and the dramatically rougher language deployed against her combined with Trump's ability to give voice to the nation's id. The result was a cavalcade of insults, threats and unchecked assertions flying under the flag of anti-political correctness. The candidates took body blows from all sides, a level of vitriol that was commonplace in America's first century but had calmed considerably during the decades when the three major TV networks set the nation's political tone. This year, it was almost remarkable that no candidate got challenged to a duel. Congress, the news media and politicians overall -- the usual basement dwellers in any accounting of the nation's least-trusted institutions -- fell to new lows. But the biggest shift seemed to take place on the smallest stages. 'Devolving into tribes' As Jane Beard waited for her prescription at the Walgreens in Edgewater, Md., a baby in a stroller caught her eye. She played a quick bit of peek-a-boo, looked up and caught the boy's father's eye. He smiled and leaned in: ""Listen, I want to ask you something. Are you a Hillary voter? You look like a Hillary voter."" For an instant, Beard -- in yoga pants, a sweatshirt and little Ecco shoes -- thought the man had sensed a kindred spirit. ""You bet I am!"" she replied. Suddenly, the man unleashed a river of invective: ""It's c---s like you who are helping that c--- win. She's a murderer."" He went on, and it didn't get any nicer. Rattled, Beard asked: ""Why did you even come up to me? I never said a word to you. All I did was exist in the world in this store . . ."" ""You exist!"" the man hissed. ""B-----s like you exist and you're f---ing up the country -- our country."" Beard searched for the best retort. ""It's my country, too,"" she blurted. She quickly left the store, sat down in her car, caught her breath and posted about the incident on Facebook. Within minutes, a virtual community embraced Beard, a former actress who coaches executives on public speaking. They bemoaned the loss of civility in so many places. They told stories of angry confrontations launched from both sides of the divide. They said they'd refrained from putting out yard signs this year because people have gotten so riled up. ""Truly sadly, I feel just about the same way as this nut -- albeit in reverse,"" one of Beard's friends wrote. ""I hate that this election has brought out these feelings in me."" But one man assured Beard that ""you met an outlier. The vast majority of people are good and kind."" Another urged her to ""look at the support you have catalyzed with this post. Look at the love that holds you and everyone woven into this tapestry. That is what is real."" Beard, who lives in Churchton, Md., near the Chesapeake Bay, had already had three Hillary signs stolen from her yard. On Halloween, she took down her latest sign, just for the evening, ""because we didn't want people not to come to our house."" But in the week after the drugstore confrontation, Beard, 60, found support from neighbors, including Trump supporters, one of whom ran into her at the Baltimore airport, hugged her, and said, ""Oh my gosh, Jane, we can still be friends."" Still, she struggled with the meaning of her moment in Walgreens. ""People are scared,"" she concluded. ""That man is raising a kid that will hear that language and spout that language. Yet I was soothed by all the outpouring. What makes me sad is that we're devolving into tribes. I thought we were all the American tribe.""     Clinton holds a rally early Tuesday morning at N.C. State University in Raleigh. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)     Suporters cheer Trump in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Monday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)    'Why are we enemies?' Deep divisions and despairing dissatisfaction over politics and the nation's direction are nothing new. ""America never was America to me,"" Langston Hughes wrote in ""Let America Be America,"" his 1935 poem. ""I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart. I am the Negro bearing slavery's scars. . . . I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek -- and finding only the same old stupid plan of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak."" Hughes concluded that the people, not the politicians, could ""bring back our mighty dream again. . . . I swear this oath -- America will be!"" That essentially American optimism has not disappeared. Many Trump supporters, drawn by their candidate's dark vision of a lost and failing country that ""I alone can fix,"" thought of themselves as a movement to restore greatness. ""More than anything else, Trump picked up on a growing sense that elections don't have much impact on the direction of the country, that power is increasingly distant from the people,"" said Chris Buskirk, publisher of American Greatness, a pro-Trump blog. Buskirk saw Trump connecting with voters on messages that had more in common with Democrats Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren than with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.): border security, a ""pro-worker"" trade policy aimed at ""bringing Wall Street to heel"" and a foreign policy skeptical of military intervention. That message -- American jobs, America First, Fortress America -- hit home with millions of people who have felt disconnected from, and disdained by, the elites for decades. In 1996, James Dobson, the head of Focus on the Family, one of the country's largest and most influential evangelical Christian organizations, said: ""People inside the Beltway are not aware of the multiple millions of Americans out there who believe things differently than is perceived in Washington. They're very concerned about . . . a moral meltdown in this country. They're waiting for some political figure to articulate those views. And no one does."" Then came Trump. His unique blend of celebrity, ego and a mischievous delight in outraging the elites -- as well as his confidence that he would be judged by the lax standards applied to Hollywood and sports figures rather than the unforgiving rules that govern politicians -- enabled him to win over millions who heard in his message clear echoes of their late-night grumbles to friends on Facebook. Trump's rhetoric and character liberated some Americans to open an ugly vein of animosity. ""This year has revealed our underbelly, and a lot of people don't like what we see,"" said Jim Daly, Focus on the Family's current president. America, Daly said, has morphed into ""a post-Christian society,"" a ""depraved culture"" in which the more conservative party chose a nominee who boasted of his sexual assaults.    At the Grand Rapids Trump rally Monday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Clinton's decades in politics, her emotionally distanced and guarded presentation, and her legalistic language nearly smothered the revolutionary nature of her own candidacy -- oddly, the possibility of electing the first female president was rarely mentioned through most of the campaign. (When some in the campaign sought to go big with the historic nature of Clinton's candidacy, they were told by those in charge that many Americans just didn't want to hear it.)   [Trump's White House win promises to reshape U.S. political landscape]   Was the Trump victory a statement condoning sexism, boorish behavior and coarse aggression? Would President Obama still insist, as he did last summer, that ""America is not as divided as some have suggested""? In recent days, many Americans expressed a palpable desire to relieve the tension of division that is evident in the 56 percent of Americans who, according to The Washington Post-ABC poll, were anxious about Clinton becoming president and the 61 percent who felt that way about Trump winning. ""Everybody is against everybody. Why?"" Mary White asked in Des Moines last week after two police officers were shot and killed. She brought her son to a makeshift memorial, where she found a morsel of hope, and a question: ""Look how this community has come together, people who don't know each other. Why can't our nation come together? What happened between 9/11 and now? Why are we enemies?"" Every chapter in the American story so far has resolved into hope. The Civil War birthed Reconstruction. The riots and generational strife of the 1960s settled into sweeping social and cultural change. Before the vote, the University of Virginia's president, Teresa Sullivan, appealed to students to be civil to one another after the vote. She taught them about the bitter election of 1800, when a pro-John Adams newspaper warned that Thomas Jefferson would create a nation in which ""murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will openly be taught and practiced."" Jefferson won and set about trying to get people to ""unite with one heart and one mind,"" to restore ""that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things . . ."" Daly, the evangelical leader, said he intends to reach out to gay activists and abortion rights advocates ""to build bridges, just trying to create discussions and friendships. I don't know if it will work. When you try to do that, you get killed by the extremes on both sides. The uncorking of incivility makes it hard: Discussions that used to die among friends now become unbridled castigating of other people. I'm hopeful that this election is a blip. We're now at a point where we cannot say that civility is a shared value, and I don't see how we can keep our democracy together without being able to talk to each other.""           1 of 26       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                           Skip Ad   x           How the world is reacting to results of the U.S. election      View Photos   People around the globe watched as Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States.

(Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: John McCain's final stops to close out the 2008 campaign were in New Mexico and Colorado. George W. Bush, garnering 44 percent of the Latino vote, had carried both in 2004. Barack Obama, meanwhile, visited Indiana on Election Day eight years ago, which he subsequently won. The Democratic nominee that year also spent time during the final stretch in Missouri, which he lost by fewer than 4,000 votes out of 2.9 million cast (that's 0.13 percent). If Donald Trump wins today, and he still could, his path to the presidency will go through the Midwest. In a reflection of how the political terrain has changed in just two presidential elections, the Republican nominee is almost certain to lose New Mexico and Colorado but win Indiana and Missouri with no real effort. The states likeliest to move into the Republican column are Iowa and Ohio. While McCain wrote off Michigan in September, and Mitt Romney never made a real play for his home state, Trump has devoted significant attention there lately. At 12:30 a.m., he took the stage in Grand Rapids for the final rally of his campaign. Tightening polls forced Hillary Clinton to travel twice to Michigan in the final four days, in addition to her husband and President Obama. Worried about lagging African American turnout in Detroit, the Democratic nominee tried to appeal to moderate whites in western Michigan by invoking Gerald Ford during an appearance in his old House district. ""I was privileged to know, as a college student, Gerald Ford,"" she said in Grand Rapids, a few hours before Trump arrived. ""In fact I had an internship with the House Republican Conference Committee, which he headed, after my junior year in college."" Working-class whites have also helped Trump close the gap in Wisconsin, which he visited last week, and they are why his team has (totally misguided) hope for an upset in Minnesota. -- Trump's center of gravity during the primaries was somewhere in the South. His base during the general has been the Rust Belt, where voters tend to be older and whiter than the country as a whole. Millions of folks in this sprawling region, buffeted by decades of deindustrialization, feel left behind. They have proven especially receptive to someone preaching the easy answers of nationalism, protectionism and isolationism.    Obama introduces HRC at Independence Mall in Philadelphia last night. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- The Clinton campaign recognized pretty early that Pennsylvania needed to be its firewall and behaved accordingly. The Keystone State has proven to be a siren song for Republicans since George H.W. Bush won in 1988. Bush 43 came very close in 2004. Romney made a quixotic, 11th-hour visit four years ago but basically invested no resources and lost by 5.4 points. It will probably be closer this year. This is why Clinton devoted time yesterday to the population centers of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. She held a huge rally in Philly last night with Bill and both Obamas. She is going to underperform in the western parts of the state but remains favored to ultimately prevail if African Americans show up in the City of Brotherly Love and moderates break her way in the collar counties, which are decidedly not part of the Rust Belt. -- Despite the shift in the battlegrounds over the last decade, it is completely conceivable that the electoral map tonight might wind up looking eerily like it did in 2012. In fact, Trump is likelier than not to end up with more electoral votes than Romney -- thanks to the Hawkeye State, as well as perhaps the Buckeye and Sunshine States. Because Mitt lost all three, North Carolina is really the only state which could turn blue.    There was a laser show at SNHU Arena as Trump came on stage in Manchester last night. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   -- In a testament to how polarized the country has become, there are not landslides anymore. Lyndon Johnson won 44 states in 1964 (everywhere outside the Deep South and Barry Goldwater's home state of Arizona). Richard Nixon won everywhere but Massachusetts in 1972. Ronald Reagan won everywhere but Minnesota in 1984. Bill Clinton carried 32 states in 1992 and 31 states in 1996. In the best case scenario for Hillary tonight, if she ""runs the table,"" she will win no more than 28 states. -- Assuming the election turns out as the polls and the models forecast, many Republican leaders will downplay the results. Party apparatchiks will blame Trump and the exogenous circumstances he created.  Indeed, this was a very winnable election: History was on their side. If anyone but Trump was the nominee, there would never have been any buzz about Utah being in play. Independent Evan McMullin would not have run. It stands to reason that future nominees will not do as poorly among college-educated white women again. Mitt Romney carried this group by six points, but the most recent polling has Trump -- who more than a dozen women have accused of sexual assault - trailing Clinton by 27 points. Trump's allies will say, if they lose, that the outcome might have been different had members of the establishment such as the Bushes, Romney and Ohio Gov. John Kasich stuck with him. RNC leaders insist that they will not produce another autopsy, as they did after 2012, because there is no need to. (The old report makes for good reading and still applies, considering how few of the 219 recommendations were followed.)    The crowd watches Clinton speak in September at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's annual gala in Washington. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- Just saying the overall map is static is overly simplistic analysis that misses some pretty profound changes happening under the surface. (It also misses the fact that an unchanged map from 2012 would mean permanent minority status for Republicans.) Until James Comey's bombshell October surprise, which brought recalcitrant Republicans home to Trump, Clinton was making a meaningful play to expand the map - namely with a major investment in Arizona. -- All evidence suggests that the Latino sleeping giant really is finally waking up. This will make it harder for Republicans to win in Western states that were strongholds not long ago.  Early voting numbers suggest that Nevada, which Bush 43 carried twice, has probably slipped away from Trump - and that will cost Republicans the chance to pick up Harry Reid's Senate seat. Colorado has not been a true toss up since the beginning of the general election phase of the campaign, and Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet is coasting to reelection. Of the eight states that have Hispanic populations larger than the national average, Trump is only certain to win Texas. Trump could still win Florida narrowly, but that's only because around two-thirds of the electorate is white. Less than one in 10 Republican voters in 2012 were non-white, and that number could actually be lower in 2016. There are still lots and lots of white people in America - enough, in fact, to win Trump this election - but their share of the electorate will only continue to decline:     Many hombres, as Trump derisively referred to Mexican immigrants at the last debate, are turning out for the first time. The University of Florida's Daniel Smith calculated that 36 percent of Hispanics who cast early ballots in 2016 did not vote in 2012. Democrats finished early voting with at least an 88,000-vote lead in Florida because of historic turnout in Miami-Dade and Broward. ""If Clinton wins Florida -- and therefore the presidential race -- it will be on the strength of these two urban counties,"" Politico's Marc Caputo notes. A Clinton strategist told me over the weekend that strong turnout from the burgeoning Latino population in North Carolina might actually offset some of the potential softness among African Americans. This is only going to become a bigger deal. The number of Hispanics eligible to vote is poised to rise from something like 25 million now to 40 million by 2030. Nine in 10 Hispanics under age 18 are born in the United States and will thus be legally eligible to vote. Keep an eye on Trump's margin of victory in the Lone Star State. It will certainly be less than the 16 points Romney won by.    At 3:38 a.m. this morning, Hillary and Bill Clinton got off the plane together in White Plains, New York. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- The upper South is also no longer reliably Republican. Obama was the first Democrat to win Virginia since LBJ. The growth of the D.C. suburbs in Northern Virginia has made that state harder for Republicans to win. The changing face of North Carolina is going to ensure that it remains a purple state going forward, even if Trump wins and despite the big GOP gains of the past three cycles. ""In 2008, a little more than half of the voters were born in-state and Obama was defeated among that group; he won by taking those that had moved to North Carolina,"" Al Hunt observes in a column for Bloomberg. ""This year, more than half of the electorate will be voters who've moved to the state, and a good percentage will be college-educated. Both characteristics advantage Democrats."" (Check out a cool breakdown of the Tar Heel State from our graphics team.) For a moment, it looked like Georgia might even come onto the map this year. It did not, but it may not be too far out of reach for Democrats, thanks to the changing face of the Atlanta suburbs and the large African American community. In the final poll of the state, Trump led by just three points.    Reince Priebus speaks during a rally for Trump on Friday in Hershey, Pennsylvania. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)   -- But, but, but: Reports of the Republican Party's death will be greatly exaggerated. Expect a flurry of obituaries in the coming days. The Sunday opinion sections of our nation's leading newspapers will probably be chock full of them. Unless they blow it yet again, though, 2018 is probably going to be a very good year for Republicans. Ditto with 2017 in Virginia. There will be backlash to a new president. The Senate map in the midterms is very favorable. The party has 31 governorships right now, and that number should stay steady after today's elections. The GOP will continue to control the House of Representatives and its losses might be capped around a dozen seats. One side of the impending GOP civil war will press heavily for the party to adapt and evolve. Some politicians are going to try to channel Trump to recreate his coalition and hope that someone without his baggage and temperament problems can expand on it. Others who aspire to lead will repudiate Trump and Trumpism while trying to expand the tent. That could happen as early as 2020.    Chuck Schumer, in New York City last month, is cruising to re-election in his home state today. (Gareth Smit/For The Washington Post)   -- Something else to consider: The Democratic Party is dominated more than ever before by coastal elites. Despite her Illinois upbringing and tenure as Arkansas first lady, Clinton is a full-fledged New Yorker with all of the sensibilities that entails. Nevadan Harry Reid, who succeeded South Dakotan Tom Daschle 12 years ago, will be replaced by New Yorker Chuck Schumer as the Democratic leader in the Senate. Patty Murray from Washington State could replace Dick Durbin from Illinois in the number two slot.

""The number and tenor of calls we've received about problems, the amount of litigation you already see, it all reflects the moment we're in,"" said Kristen Clarke, president of the nonpartisan Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. On Tuesday, Clarke's group will be running the nation's largest independent effort to field voter complaints, questions and problems. But the intensity of this year's election, Clarke said, has exhausted many of her lawyers and volunteers before Election Day has arrived."" -- The Justice Department will deploy more than 500 poll watchers from its Civil Rights Division to monitor voting in 67 jurisdictions in 28 states -- including at least three in each swing state with large minority populations-- to ensure that ""every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot."" -- Maine Gov.

And they listened to a French Jesuit priest's poem that ends this way: 'Accept the anxiety of feeling yourself in suspense and incomplete.'

A voter carries in her mail in ballot to her polling station early this morning. (Matt York/AP)   -- More than 40.7 million ballots were cast before the polls opened this morning. CNN tabulates that Democrats have cast the most early voting ballots in Florida, Iowa, North Carolina and Nevada. Meanwhile, Republicans recorded more ballots in Arizona, Colorado, Ohio and Utah. -- ""Florida may tell us a lot about whether we're going to have a long night or a short one,"" UVA political analyst Larry Sabato notes. ""About two-thirds of voters will likely have cast their ballots early, so the vote count should not take that long. If Clinton wins the state by two or three points and is declared the victor early on, it'll be hard to find a plausible path to Trump victory. If Trump captures the state, though, then we'll have to see if her firewall states, like the aforementioned states of Michigan, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania, as well as Colorado, Nevada, and Virginia, come through for her."" -- ""Can Trump win Florida today? Sure. Is it likely? Not really,"" writes Democratic strategist Steve Schale, who directed Obama's efforts in the state both times: ""What is interesting about Florida is that the margins in counties consistent over time. Outside of a handful of places, we have a decent sense of where it will land. For Trump to win, [this] basically has to happen: in 64 counties, he has to get the highest share of any Republican between 2000 and 2012, and he has to keep Clinton's margins in Osceola, Orange, and Dade in the low 20s. He has major problems with the former, namely semi-large places like Sarasota, Polk and Duval, which so no signs of being anywhere near their GOP highs. And with the latter, I don't see how Clinton doesn't stretch Obama's margins in all three of those counties. So with that, I think she wins. In fact, I am pretty confident."" -- Philip Bump traveled to Pennsylvania to inspect both side's ground games (in Scranton and Bucks County, which is in the Philly suburbs): ""On the one hand, Trump has a lot of supporters who are actively behind him -- but the campaign is making some simple mistakes that is keeping it from being as effective as it could be. Clinton's support is a bit less energetic ... but the campaign itself has a system locked in place."" -- In newly-competitive Michigan, The Detroit Free Press's Todd Spangler says Clinton still holds the upper hand: ""Clearly she's not a shoo-in. But the Democrats have the infrastructure to turn out voters and win in Michigan -- something they've done repeatedly in races far less competitive than this one. Presumably, they can do it again, with help from labor unions, black ministers in Detroit and other friends. She also has lots of money to spend if necessary. Given that support for Trump among institutional Republicans has been tepid at best, if he wins now it will be in spite of them."" -- The Fix's Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake say early voting in North Carolina is a mixed bag - reclassifying the state from ""lean Democratic"" to ""toss up:"" ""While more than 3 million votes have been cast early, black turnout is down from where it was in 2012, while white turnout has surged more than 300,000 as compared with the last election. That should be good news for Trump."" -- In Colorado, early voting numbers shifted in the GOP's favor, signaling potential signs of party organization and rising voter enthusiasm. The Denver Post reports that Republicans have cast 652,380 ballots compared to 645,020 cast by registered Democrats. The breakdown looks like this: 35.2 percent Republican, 34.8 percent Democrat and 28.5 percent unaffiliated.    Clinton speaks to a huge crowd in Philadelphia.

Bernie Sanders  was introduced to his last Iowa audience of the campaign, an Iowa State organizer named Kaleb Vanfosson stepped up to the microphone. He started talking about student loan debt and how 'full-time bigot Donald Trump' had no plan to alleviate it. Then he argued that Hillary Clinton had no plan, either. The moment, which went a little viral, was jarring not because it represented a trend; it was jarring because it didn't. After the most ideologically fraught Democratic primary since at least the 1980s, and after a convention that saw multiple walkouts by some Sanders delegates, Clinton appears to have less of a challenge on her left flank than Al Gore did in 2000; final polls show her enjoying party loyalty comparable to that of Barack Obama in his two campaigns."" -- Clinton's White House transition team is eyeing six top candidates to lead the Interior Department, including former Colorado Sen.

He, his wife and one of his five sons - accompanied by a detail of three security guys -- had a quiet, casual meal. Other patrons recognized them but said nothing, a tipster told Helena Andrews-Dyer. -- Making her first public comment on being cleared (again), Clinton said during a radio interview that she never expected him to do that. ""I was just a little befuddled by the whole process,"" she said. ""But it's behind us now."" -- Unfortunately for the Clinton campaign, the original Comey bombshell got far, far, far more attention than the subsequent ""never mind"" announcement. Our analytics partners at Zignal Labs show the degree to which the initial spike in social media mentions of Clinton and Comey surpassed what followed Sunday's news:     -- Clinton's lawyers sent cease-and-desist letters to broadcasters still airing ads pro-Trump ads that claim she is ""under investigation by the FBI."" ""These ads falsely claim Secretary Clinton is under investigation by the FBI,"" said the letter from Marc Elias, the campaign's general counsel. (CNN)    Trump, surrounded by his family and Mike Pence, speaks in New Hampshire. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   THE DAILY DONALD: -- Our Ben Terris recounts the months of gaslighting he faced from the Trump campaign after witnessing then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski physically yank reporter Michelle Fields in March: ""'I just want to make sure,' my editor asked me as he closed the door to his office. 'He definitely grabbed her?' It had to be the 50th time I'd heard this question, and each time it filled me with unspeakable anxiety. Yes, he grabbed her. It happened right in front of me. There was no question. But by the time my editor asked me about it three days later, doubt had started to creep in. Trump had suggested Fields was probably making it up, and nobody else had corroborated my account. If it had really happened, Trump and his surrogates maintained, why wasn't there any footage? ... The Trump team's response -- to claim it never happened at all -- would become a small preview of a strategy the campaign would return to again and again on a much larger scale this year: Bully, don't back down, do whatever you can to muddy up the facts. From an outside vantage point, it can be difficult to tell fact from fiction. From the inside, it's even more disorienting."" -- Who would run Trump's government? Three campaign advisers told NBC News that the transition team is thinking Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary. Reince Priebus, the current RNC chairman, is under consideration as Trump's chief of staff. ""They're thinking, 'We need to find that balance between someone who knows how Washington works and someone who shakes things up,'"" the senior campaign adviser said. ""Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, a loyal supporter, has taken a major role managing the transition effort, especially as the official transition chief, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, has drifted from the campaign,"" Katy Tur and Benjy Sarlin report. ""The conservative Heritage Foundation is also helping vet names, along with some veterans of Romney's run and the second Bush administration."" -- Trump claimed during a rally in Michigan that he was ""Michigan's Man of the Year"" five years ago. He apparently made up the honor. The Huffington Post can find no record of any such thing, and the Trump campaign won't say what he's talking about.

On each of his stops for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, he has been greeted by screaming crowds and a palpable nostalgia embodied by the same largely improvised exchange. 'I love you,' a voice from the crowd inevitably calls. 'Love you, too,' Obama always replies. The exchange captures one of the striking paradoxes of this election season: At a moment defined by anger at Washington, voter cynicism and two historically unpopular presidential candidates, Obama's approval rating is the highest it has been since his first days in office. It now stands at 56 percent ... For the first time in decades -- dating back to Ronald Reagan -- a lame-duck incumbent is in high demand on the campaign trail.""    Evan McMullin poses for a photograph with Derek Ball, 2, during a meet and greet at the One Man Band Diner yesterday in Lehi, Utah. (Rick Bowmer/AP)   -- ""Meet the man trying to keep Utah from going red or blue on Election Day,"" by Katie Zezima: ""The afternoon before Election Day, a slim 40-year-old in a suit strode into a diner here to explain how he thinks he can play the spoiler in this year's contentious presidential race. And Evan McMullin may do just that -- at least here in Utah. A former CIA officer, investment banker and, most recently, Capitol Hill staffer, McMullin has spent the past three months on a quixotic bid to become president. With McMullin on the ballot in only 11 states, his path to the White House is slim to the point of almost nonexistent -- and he and his staff know it. But McMullin, his staff and volunteers -- the campaign said there are 5,000 of them making calls nationwide -- believe they have created a new conservative movement, and only time will tell what shape it will take.""

Pat Toomey speaks to a small crowd of GOP loyalists in a Harrisburg hotel yesterday. The contest is the most expensive U.S. Senate race ever, and the outcome of the election may tip control of the chamber next year. (Marc Levy/AP)   -- ""Sometimes even the best Senate candidates can't win,"" by Paul Kane: ""It's a bipartisan axiom among campaign operatives that campaigns and candidates matter. But the other side of that principle is often a more painful reality: Sometimes you could also say political plate tectonics determine the outcome of a race. Ask any Republican who's run the best race of their Senate incumbents this year, and Sen. Pat Toomey's name emerges near the top of the list. Ask any Democrat -- and quite a few Republicans -- who has run the best Senate race, and almost universally they cite Jason Kander. Yet both Toomey (R-Pa.) and Kander (D-Mo.) head into Tuesday as 50-50 bets, and some of the same smart people who praise their campaigns wouldn't be surprised to see both lose. Taken together, these two Senate races will do more than just help determine which party claims the majority. They will also show whether it's possible, in this hyper-partisan era, for quality campaigns and candidates to overcome tough political geography. It's the political version of the head versus the heart.""    Four people visit Susan B. Anthony's grave at Mt. Hope Cemetery in Rochester, New York, yesterday. The cemetery will extend its hours on Election Day to give people more time to visit her grave. (Tina Macintyre-Yee/Democrat & Chronicle via AP)   -- ""Susan B. Anthony died without the right to vote. Now people are covering her tombstone in 'I voted' stickers,"" by Ben Guarino: ""A new tradition has sprung up around a famous headstone in Rochester, N.Y. In the days leading up to and following an election, the grave marker in Mount Hope Cemetery sprouts a fresh coat of 'I Voted' stickers. The grave marks the final resting place of one of the most famous suffragists in American history, Susan B. Anthony. Anthony died in March 1906. Fourteen years later, in August 1920, the 19th Amendment was ratified. Some 90 years later, the pilgrimage to Anthony's gravestone on Election Day began ... The idea struck a chord with voters as far away as Maryland. 'Ever since I first found out about people putting their 'I Voted' stickers on Susan B. Anthony's grave, it has been on my bucket list to do the same,' said Elissa Blattman ... [who] drove with her mother 350 miles from Rockville, Md., to New York."" -- ""Thousands of miles from the U.S., Afghans wonder how the vote will affect them,"" by Pamela Constable: ""Few countries have been as affected by the twists and turns of recent U.S. foreign policy as Afghanistan. Once supported by Washington as a Cold War proxy, it was abandoned to civil conflict, then liberated from Islamist repression and, under the Obama administration, flooded with troops and remolded as a modern Muslim democracy. Perhaps it should not come as a surprise, then, that Afghans -- like Americans -- appear to be divided into two camps on the U.S. presidential election. Some are hoping for a continuation of Washington's political and military involvement, but others are eager for a radical change. ...  In office corners, tea shops and commuter buses, people are puzzling over the faraway brawl between [Trump] and [Clinton], wondering how serious Trump is about banning Muslims from the U.S. and whether Clinton will keep U.S. troops in Afghanistan."" THE PUNDITS WEIGH IN: -- ""Trump's showing in the polls, though he will probably fall short on Election Day, confirms the deep fissure in the country and suggests that the next few years will not be any easier than the past few,"" our in-house handicapper Stuart Rothenberg writes. ""The political landscape was ripe this year for a credible Republican alternative to Democrat Hillary Clinton. But that never meant that merely any alternative would do. [Trump] failed to pass the smell test among general-election voters. Even if they had doubts about Clinton, they often had even greater doubts about Trump. Instead of making the election a referendum on his rival presidential nominee, Trump made it about himself. Instead of talking policy, he talked slogans and platitudes. Instead of offering a vision, he offered vulgarity ... The GOP's post-2012 election autopsy noted that the electorate is changing and the party needs to appeal to Latinos, Asian Americans and younger voters to remain competitive. I'm sure the autopsy's authors never thought that their party would have trouble with more-educated and more-affluent voters."" -- The Wall Street Journal's deputy editorial page editor Bret Stephens lambasts conservatives who capitulated to Trump: ""It's normal that elections make fierce partisans of many of us. It's normal that Mr. Trump would attract the usual right-wing buffoons to his banners. What isn't normal is the ease with which so many conservative leaders, political and intellectual, have prostrated themselves before Mr. Trump simply because he won. What all this shows is that most conservative intellectuals have proved incapable of self-examination or even simple observation. [Trump] is a demagogue. Period. The fervor of his crowds recalls Nasser's Egypt. His convictions are illiberal. His manners are disgusting. His temper is frightening. It ought to have been the job of thoughtful conservatives in this season to point this out, time and again. If they can't do that, what good are they? George Orwell said that 'to see what is in front of one's nose needs a constant struggle.' The Big Reveal of 2016 is that most conservatives failed the Orwell test. On Tuesday we'll learn if American voters can do better."" -- ""Anti-Semitism is no longer an undertone of Trump's campaign. It's the melody,"" writes Post columnist Dana Milbank. ""For more than a year, I have condemned Trump in the harshest terms I could conjure as he went after Latinos, Muslims, immigrants, African Americans, women and the disabled. This is both because it was wrong in its own right and because, from my culture's history, I know that when a demagogue begins to identify scapegoats, the Jews are never far behind. Trump himself has been raising the anti-Semitic ante: On Oct. 2, talking about the 'blood suckers' who back international trade and, on Oct. 13, the 'global power structure' secretly scheming ... When the election returns come in Tuesday night, it will be Nov. 9 in Germany -- the 78th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the ""Night of Broken Glass"" at the start of the Holocaust when Nazis vandalized synagogues and businesses. I pray that on this solemn anniversary, Americans tell Donald Trump and the world that we are never going back there."" -- Florida-based Republican operative and CNN talking head Ana Navarro said she's voting for Clinton ""out of civic duty to the country."" From her op-ed: ""I thought back to the 2000 election, which was decided by 537 votes in Florida. I thought about how I would feel if the same thing happened in 2016. Then I cast my vote for Hillary Clinton. Let me rephrase that. I cast my vote against [Trump]. I did it without joy or enthusiasm."" -- ""Here is the compliment I can pay [Trump], and I pay it with real gratitude: He never hid who he was,"" Vox's Ezra Klein writes. ""Perhaps he lacked the self-control, or the self-awareness. Whatever the reason, he never obscured his authoritarian tendencies, his will to power, his sexism, his greed, his dishonesty, his racism, his thirst for vengeance. And he is still only 1.8 points behind. It is likely, though not certain, that [Clinton] will win on Tuesday. But even if she does, here is what must be said of American politics in 2016: We came within inches of electing [Trump] president of the United States of America. We did this even knowing exactly what he stood for, exactly what he had threatened to do, exactly what kind of man he was. A narrow Trump loss is another way of saying a near Trump win. Perhaps, on Tuesday, we will dodge the bullet. But we will still need to understand how we came to be standing in front of a gun.""

He once described Clinton as 'a stereotypical [expletive]' and accused Obama of being a racist with a 'deep-seated hatred for white people.' That was the old Beck, he insists: 'I did a lot of freaking out about Barack Obama.' But, he said, 'Obama made me a better man.' He regrets calling the President a racist and counts himself a Black Lives Matter supporter. 'There are things unique to the African-American experience that I cannot relate to,' he said. 'I had to listen to them.' [Now], the alt-right sees him as a turncoat. He receives death threats. Some of them are his former followers, perhaps angry at him for disowning their beliefs ... 'These people scare the hell out of me,' he says.

'They're going to be looking for someone to blame.' Mr. Humphrey was speaking to Mr. Dole as a new inductee into an elite but hardly sought-after fraternity: candidates who have endured a failed national political campaign, an experience of loss that some have compared to a death in the family.

Early voting numbers among African-Americans are down by 8.5 percent from 2012, while early voting by white voters is up 22.5 percent ... The group seems to think this is an opportunity for its party to regain footing in the state.""     HOT ON THE RIGHT Georgia Sen. David Perdue criticized fellow Republicans for saying they will block whomever Clinton nominates to the Supreme Court, slamming the indefinite delay as a ""dereliction of duty."" ""I hear what's being said about that, but I think that's a dereliction of duty. We're called to advise and consent. We can say no, but that means you have a hearing,"" the Judiciary Committee member told reporters on Monday. ""I'm going to be one that says look, our oath of office says that we're going to govern. And that's what we should do."" (Politico)     DAYBOOK: Trump and Clinton both have their events in New York tonight. Obama has no public events scheduled, and he voted early in Illinois.
