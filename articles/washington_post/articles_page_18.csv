Alcantara/The Washington Post; iStock)  How much money can you bring in by making stuff up and putting it on the Internet? ""I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense,"" Paul Horner, a prolific, Facebook-focused fake-news writer told us this week. And among a growing group of Macedonian teenagers who see fake-news sites as a way to make easy money from American gullibility, the most successful can make about $5,000 a month, BuzzFeed reported. The money comes from ads, provided by the self-service ad technology of companies such as Google and Facebook. It is a business model that has changed little over the years, David Carroll, an associate professor of media design at the New School and an expert in advertising tech, told us. ""Anybody can make a site and put ads on it,"" he said. ""They can easily set up a business, create content, and once it is viral, it drives traffic to their site.""   [Facebook fake-news writer: 'I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me']   In 2016, the churn of fake news was a daily onslaught of fabricated or exceedingly misleading news stories designed to elevate or demonize presidential candidates, mixed into the flow of true or mostly true stories about the election. The stories were designed to be believed and shared. On Facebook, they were seeded into conservative and liberal filter bubbles through hyperpartisan media organizations with enormous numbers of Facebook followers. That alarming reach prompted critics to accuse Facebook, and to a much lesser extent Google, of influencing the elections by incentivizing fake political news -- a charge that Facebook has denied. The attention was enough for the two companies to announce Monday that they were going to crack down on fake-news purveyors who use their services to make ad money. If they are successful in stopping fake-news sites from profiting, Horner told us, the effect would be devastating for his revenue. But Horner seemed confident that he and others like him would be able to adapt to the changes. After all, he has been doing this for a long time.   [This is not an interview with Banksy]   There are a lot of variables that factor into exactly how much a viral hoax story can make for its creator. But if you take Facebook shares as an indirect indicator of how widely viewed some of these sites might be, you start to understand why, if optimized properly, fake-news sites targeting hyperpartisan audiences can be lucrative.      Consider these points before sharing a news article on Facebook. It could be fake. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   The fabricated story posted to a fictional Denver news outlet just before the election ""FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE"" got more than 500,000 shares on Facebook. ""Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President, Releases Statement"" is not remotely true, but one fake-news website reeled in more than 100,000 shares with it. A copycat version of the hoax on Ending the Fed was even more popular, shared more than 900,000 times on Facebook, according to Facebook's API. Although hoax sites vary in sophistication, a quick tour of the usual suspects makes it clear that you don't really have to put much thought into the design or functionality of the site -- in other words, they can be cheaply made. Horner's ABC News knockoff is much more rudimentary than the real thing, but looks roughly like a news site:    (Image of abcnews.com.co)  Others might be cluttered, filled with barely readable prose and, frankly, tough to look at. But a fake-news site does not need you to stay for long. They just need you to click, and they need a way to spread their work. Facebook has been a crucial vehicle for the spread of these fake stories. But it did not hurt that political personalities connected to the Trump campaign were also sharing those stories as if they were real, creating even more of an incentive for fake-news writers to target that audience. ""When political personalities have shared the fake-news story,"" Carroll said, it expands the reach of that story, and it ""validates the source"" in the eyes of its potential audience, because ""a prominent person has shared it.""   [What was fake on the Internet this election: Sean Hannity shares a fake story]   Carroll estimated that a fake-news share from within the Trump campaign could earn the lucky hoaxer as much as $10,000 in extra revenue, provided they have taken full advantage of the ad services available to them. That's a ""huge economic incentive to create stories that they want to distribute."" So why are Google and Facebook just taking action against this use of their ad services now? Well, for one thing, those companies profit off the viral sites -- legitimate or hoax -- that use their services, too. ""Google has more of an incentive to make information reliable,"" Carroll noted, because Google's business is based on providing accurate information to people who are looking for it. Facebook, though, ""is about attention, not so much intention."" It's generally good for Facebook's business when something goes viral on the site, even if it's not true.   [Why Facebook and Google are struggling to purge fake news]   In short, each company could ""lose revenue if it shuts down a huge number of fake sites,"" he said. The announced crackdown on fake-news sites using the companies' ad services, at least ""show an initial willingness to sacrifice some of their own revenue"" to address the growing problem of bad information in their networks. There is also the question of how Facebook and Google will determine what is and is not in violation of their rules. Facebook has shown some reluctance in becoming the arbiter of truth. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has said that the company is not a ""media company,"" and he regularly resisted acknowledging its increasing responsibility in the greater media ecosystem online, instead sticking to its longtime assertion that Facebook is just a neutral platform for connecting people to others. Given Facebook's resistance, Carroll's suggestion was this: a crowdsourced, open, list of fake-news sites, regularly updated and refined by consensus. If companies such as Google and Facebook agreed to abide by the list, it would provide a way for them to distinguish between ""real"" and ""fake"" sites -- and identify the many sites that publish a mix of both -- for the purposes of enforcing their own policies, without taking on the responsibility of deciding those categories for themselves. It would work similarly to the lists that drive some ad-blocking services. Of course, there's just one thing. ""It's uncharacteristic of them to adopt a crowdsourced model like this,"" Carroll said. And in the bigger picture, not all hoaxers are motivated by the money. Cutting off the revenue of those who make fake news to earn a living will not stop people from sharing stories that are untrue.

"   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Election Day 2016. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  After nearly 10 years, have House Democrats had enough of their leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)? It's complicated. There's near universal agreement among House Democrats that she's been a smart, capable, savvy leader who was handed a set of difficult political circumstances with redistricting and President Obama's unpopularity that ushered in the largest Republican majorities in the House of Representatives since the New Deal. As such, she's handily expected to win reelection to lead House Democrats in a secret-ballot election Nov. 30. But Pelosi is part of a generation of Democrats that some in the party feel haven't done enough to help lift up the next one and, frankly, help their party win. As Chris Cillizza has noted, Democratic losses this November underscore how the party ""lacks a ready-and-waiting next generation of leaders to step up and lead it forward -- whether at the national level or in Congress."" And that's probably the best explanation for why Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) announced Thursday that he's challenging the minority leader for House Democrats' top job. It's a long-shot bid, so it's really more a shot across the bow to Pelosi. Some Democrats feel their leadership should start listening to and making way for newer leaders who might have some fresh ideas about how to bring the caucus back from the political wilderness it has been in since 2010.    Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) in 2011. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)  ""What's wrong with your current leadership?"" NPR's Steve Inskeep asked Ryan in an interview that aired Friday morning. ""Well, they keep losing,"" Ryan replied. Ryan's challenge to Pelosi doesn't seem to be derived from personal or political animus toward her. ""I love Nancy Pelosi,"" Ryan said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Friday  ""... but we have to talk about how we move forward."" Facts are facts, he said. And the facts paint a stark picture for House Democrats under Pelosi's leadership. ""We've lost 68 House races since 2010,"" Ryan went on to say. ""We have the smallest majority since 1929 in our caucus. If you take state, federal officials, we have the smallest numbers since Reconstruction. If that's not a call for doing something differently, I don't know what is.""   VIDEO: @NancyPelosi Challenger Recounts Extent Of Democrat Losses Since 2010 https://t.co/rDnh6lczPc -- Joe Pounder (@PounderFile) November 18, 2016   In other words, House Democrats are having a generational and regional -- not ideological or personal -- struggle right now. The umbrella for all this is there's a sense of frustration among House Democrats that the status quo isn't working, after six years of being in the minority with no end in sight. And for some, the target is Pelosi. It's not clear what role, if any, Pelosi directly played in Democrats' electoral struggles. But what is clear is that as redistricting and polarization shrink the number of seats in play for Democrats, the party's leadership appears to be shrinking to older members on the coast. The Post's James Hohmann recently pointed out in his Daily 202 newsletter that two-thirds of congressional Democrats come from the coasts, including House Democrats' top three leaders, who are also all over 70. Hohmann: ""The top three Democrats in leadership are 76 (Pelosi), 77 (Steny Hoyer) and 76 (Jim Clyburn). The top three Republican leaders, in contrast, are 46 (Paul Ryan), 51 (Kevin McCarthy) and 51 (Steve Scalise)."" Enter Tim Ryan. In addition to being younger (43),  Ryan is also from a region that could be considered ground zero for Democrats' shrinking influence. As The Post's Paul Kane points out, the county anchoring his Youngstown-area district is an old steel manufacturing town that President Obama won in 2012 by 30,000 votes. Hillary Clinton won it in 2016 by 3,000 votes. But Democrats' struggles in Ohio may work against Ryan's leadership bid. Although Ryan won reelection overwhelmingly, if you tally up the vote totals of the counties in his district, it looks like they voted for Donald Trump by three points -- even though Ryan was a top Clinton surrogate charged with getting out the vote in Ohio. A top Democratic aide in the House points out Ryan hasn't even paid all of his committed dues to help Democrats over the past two cycles. That aide characterized the unrest among House Democrats as less focused on Pelosi and more focused on whether Democrats should institute term limits for committees, as House Republicans have. That's not something Pelosi can just wave her hand and fix. A handful of newer members say they are are agitating for broader change than committee chairs. In 2016, House Democrats were projected to pick up anywhere from half a dozen to 20 seats, in part because Republicans had done so well in recent elections that there was nowhere for them to go but down. Pelosi predicted 30, then downgraded to 20. They ended up netting six. ""We did worse than the lowest estimates for how many seats we would take back,"" lamented Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a younger, newer member leading the drive to challenge leadership, to the Boston Herald recently. ""The American people sent a very clear message that the status quo is unacceptable."" And to some newer House Democrats, the status quo starts with Pelosi, who's been leader for almost 10 years. From their perspective, it may not be entirely her fault they're in this situation, but Democrats are at such a low point, some don't see any other option but to kick out the old and try the new -- whatever that may be."

Aldrin Jr. walking on the surface of the moon near the leg of the Lunar Module. AFP PHOTO / NASA/Getty Images  NASA has struggled for decades with strategic uncertainty, and there's nothing like a partisan transition in the White House to discombobulate everyone. There will surely be a new administrator, and new ambitions, and disfavored programs, with associated budget cuts (Earth Science is a likely target). Right this minute, though, no one seems to know what's going to happen with America's civilian space agency. The chaotic Trump transition operation has yet to send a delegation to NASA headquarters. NASA's in-house transition team is standing by, and you can imagine that people are getting a bit jittery. There are deadlines to meet. Everything's in a holding pattern. In the spirit of promiscuous speculation, we will float this notion: The moon is back! With Donald Trump as president-elect, moon-colony-loving Newt Gingrich hovering close at hand, and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, NASA may soon be told to get ready to do what it already did back in the 1960s and '70s -- put people on the moon, this time to stay. There's a saying: The moon is a red destination, an asteroid is a blue destination.   [From the archive: Newt Gingrich on the stump lays out his vision of a moon colony]   ""It is very plausible to speculate that the new administration will insert a mission to the lunar surface, probably international in character, as a step on the way to Mars,"" John Logsdon, the dean of space policy analysts, told The Washington Post. ""Politically, most of the other countries of the world have identified the moon as an interesting destination, and they don't really have the capabilities to talk about sending people to Mars. If we want to assert international leadership, we would take a position in leading a coalition to return to the moon."" This is a competitive field. Europe, Japan, Russia and China have all expressed interest in crewed missions to the lunar surface sometime in the next two decades. One of the people mentioned in news reports as a potential NASA administrator is Rep. James Bridenstine, Republican from Oklahoma, who earlier this year drafted legislation he calls the American Space Renaissance Act. He's called for a return to the moon as part of sweeping reforms at NASA. Bridenstine has also been mentioned as a potential secretary of the Air Force. In a written statement released by his press office, Bridenstine said: ""At this point, it is speculation as far as I know."" Eric Berger at Ars Technica has more on the insider-outsider possibilities for the top NASA job. Keith Cowing at NASAWatch also weighs in with an online game to guess the next NASA chief. Bridenstine would be an outsider, but many Republicans might prefer Scott Pace, a former NASA political appointee under President George W. Bush. Pace succeeded Logsdon as director of George Washington University Space Policy Institute. In a radio interview on the Diane Rehm Show a while back, Pace advocated a return to the moon: [T]he reason for that is not simply because I have a fondness for lunar science but because I think it could meet an important international objective, which is bringing other countries along with us, particularly emerging space powers, such as India and -- I'll also say it -- China, that NASA can and should be a foreign policy tool of the United States. And I think a human return to the moon poses some opportunities for international outreach in ways that asteroid or Mars missions right now cannot. Some boilerplate background: During the Cold War space race, NASA's Apollo 11 mission in July 1969 succeeded in putting the first men on the moon. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and then 10 more American astronauts left boot prints in lunar regolith across six Apollo missions, the last in 1972. No human being has been beyond low Earth orbit since that final moonshot.   [Achenblog: Remembering Neil Armstrong]   NASA now says it is on a ""Journey to Mars,"" though this is more of a branding exercise for a suite of loosely connected enterprises than a fully integrated and funded program. The agency is building a new, heavy-lift rocket, called the Space Launch System (SLS), and a new crew capsule, Orion, both of which could be part of a Mars-mission architecture. President Obama in a recent op-ed reiterated NASA's stated goal of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. Agency officials envision an orbital mission first. (SpaceX has its own much more ambitious, but not overwhelmingly plausible, plans for a Mars colony.) Meanwhile, the moon is still right there, and many people find it still attractive as a target for exploration. George W. Bush vowed to go back to the moon, and his administration put together a program, Constellation, that foresaw another moon landing in 2020. Obama killed Constellation, saying been there, done that. Congress, however, kept elements of the Constellation package -- that big rocket, that new capsule -- and so billions of dollars are being spent on hardware that should be ready for launch in the next couple of years. Where to go? Obama's team decided that NASA should visit an asteroid in its natural orbit. That proved harder than expected, so the agency shifted gears, saying it would capture an asteroid and haul it back to lunar orbit. The latest plan is to wrench a boulder off a known asteroid. House Republicans hate the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) and have language in an appropriations bill that would prevent NASA from spending any money on such a mission. Jeff Foust on Spacenews.com reports that NASA officials continue to push for ARM funding as a necessary element of long-term Mars exploration. [Update: Casey Dreier of The Planetary Society writes of ARM, ""I predict this mission is almost certainly over."" See also Nadia Drake's take on all this at National Geographic.]   [My chat with Buzz Aldrin]   Here's the key factoid: Because Congress preserved elements of Constellation, it could be revived under a new administration. NASA has the SLS and the Orion, and to get to the surface of the moon it would just need a lunar lander, maybe paid for, at least partially, by international partners. And NASA has already been talking about missions in orbit around the moon in the 2020s. The veterans who run human spaceflight at NASA put themselves in a good position to re-pivot to the moon if that became politically mandated. NASA headquarters has been preparing for the transition for months, but the Trump team has gone through upheaval, with Chris Christie and his folks ousted. It appears Trump's NASA transition efforts are being led by Mark Albrecht, who was associated with the first President Bush's ill-fated Space Exploration Initiative of 1989 (fleets of spaceships, a moon base, Mars, the whole kit and kaboodle, shot down when rumors spread that it would cost a gazillion dollars). And then there's Gingrich. He's made a fortune since leaving elected office and isn't going to take a pay cut to be in the new administration, but he's got Trump's ear and is a stalwart moon guy. Recall that when he ran for president four years ago, and was riding high in the polls in advance of the Florida primary, he used his moment in the spotlight to make a stemwinder of a speech about the need to establish a permanent moon colony and explore the solar system. He mentioned one of his earliest ideas: That when at least 13,000 people live on the moon, they could petition to have statehood. (To which the people of the District of Columbia might well say: Get in line.)

The sentiment quickly drew scorn from conservative pundits in the United States who mused about her expensive overseas trips to Africa, Europe and India. But after nearly eight years, the first lady has been proven correct, at least by comparison to the two women who preceded her, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton. Although official statistics are hard to come by, figures compiled by the National Taxpayers Union show that Obama has traveled abroad less than half as often as Bush and Clinton. Obama has made 22 foreign trips and spent 116 days outside the country, according to the NTU analysis, compared to 46 trips and 212 days for Bush and 47 trips and 274 days for Clinton.    Clockwise from bottom left, first lady Michelle Obama; her mother, Marian Robinson; and daughters Malia and Sasha arrive in Beijing on March 20, 2014. (Wang Ye/Xinhua via Reuters)  East Wing aides and outside analysts suggested several reasons to explain the contrast, foremost among them the fact that she and the president have raised their two young daughters in the White House. ""Mrs. Obama said she didn't need to race away from home,"" said Anita McBride, Bush's former chief of staff who now runs a program on first ladies at American University. ""She was very protective of her schedule from day one."" Yet Obama also took a different approach to her policy work than did her predecessors, focusing more heavily on a domestic agenda. Her chief initiative, Let's Move!, was an effort to combat childhood obesity, and she also worked closely on the Joining Forces program to help military families. The first lady's office is part of the Executive Office of the President, with a staff and travel budget funded by taxpayers, but the official role of the president's spouse is not formally defined. Since 1901, when Ida McKinley popped across the U.S. border into Juarez, Mexico, to attend a brunch at a private residence, first ladies have taken trips to other countries -- for personal reasons but also as extensions of their husbands' diplomatic outreach.      How Obama tackled America's most divisive issues and what that means for the country's future View Graphic     How Obama tackled America's most divisive issues and what that means for the country's future  Until Clinton, Eleanor Roosevelt was the most well-traveled first lady, visiting Europe and the South Pacific during World War II as a representative of the American Red Cross. Clinton, who also raised a young daughter in the White House, revved up the engines of her Air Force jet for 141 stops around the globe, an itinerary that began in earnest during President Bill Clinton's second year in office. After a failed effort to help lead a health-care reform bill through Congress in the first year, Hillary Clinton turned her focus abroad. One of her first stops was a United Nations conference on social development in Copenhagen, where Clinton substituted for Vice President Al Gore. ""She was the superstar of the conference,"" recalled Lissa Muscatine, a former journalist who became Clinton's speechwriter and adviser. At the United Nations World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, her declaration that ""women's rights are human rights"" made headlines around the world. ""She realized she could have an impact,"" Muscatine said, ""and use the world stage to not only speak out on behalf of women's rights and human rights but galvanizing people to act on those things.""    Hillary Clinton meets U.S. soldiers at Camp Alicia in northern Bosnia on March 25, 1996. (Win McNamee/Reuters)  Laura Bush entered the White House when her twin daughters were in college. Unlike Clinton, she was not intimately involved in her husband's domestic governing agenda. But she took on an active role in foreign affairs in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that scrambled the Bush administration's engagement abroad. Bush traveled to Afghanistan three times to help promote education initiatives for girls after the U.S.-backed overthrow of the Taliban. She also took a personal interest in promoting social programs in Burma, then run by a repressive military junta. And she was a frequent companion with President George W. Bush to international summits, something Michelle Obama has shied away from. ""Her view was that it was valuable and important for the American first lady to be there,"" McBride said.    Laura Bush pays respect to Jews and other World War II prisoners who suffered at the Nazi concentration camp in Terezin, near Prague in the Czech Republic in 2002. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)  By contrast, Michelle Obama did not launch a foreign policy initiative until early 2015, when she announced the Let Girls Learn program. Since then, she has made seven trips abroad, many supporting the initiative; it has been her most sustained stretch of international travel since she took five trips overseas during President Obama's first year in office. The Obamas entered the White House during a global recession and at a time when Barack Obama had campaigned on ending the long U.S. military conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. So it made sense that the first lady focused more heavily on domestic issues, said MaryAnne Borrelli, a professor of government at Connecticut College who has studied the role of first ladies. Her focus ""is not to be understood as dismissing international affairs,"" Borrelli said. First ladies have at times blurred the line between personal and official visits. On several occasions, Obama has brought along her daughters, Malia and Sasha, and her mother, Marian Robinson, who lives in the White House. But she learned early on that the scrutiny of her travel would be intensive. In 2010, she was criticized by government watchdog groups over the cost of a vacation to a Mediterranean beach in Spain with her mother, children and two friends. A New York tabloid labeled her a ""modern-day Marie Antoinette."" Before leaving, Obama made a visit to the king and queen of Spain, transforming the trip into more of a diplomatic visit. ""She never made that mistake again,"" McBride said. ""It was just not worth it."" "

Korean lawmakers pass law on independent probe of Park	" SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's parliament on Thursday passed a law that would allow a special prosecutor to investigate a corruption scandal threatening the presidency of Park Geun-hye. The opposition-controlled National Assembly also voted for a parliamentary investigation into allegations that Park allowed a secretive confidante to manipulate power from the shadows and amass an illicit fortune. The bill on an independent investigation was passed by a vote of 196 to 10 with 14 abstentions in the 300-seat assembly. It came as state prosecutors prepared to indict Park's friend by Sunday. Prosecutors had sought to question Park this week, but her lawyer on Thursday asked for more time.  ""I will do my best to prepare my arguments as quickly as I can and cooperate so that the investigation of the president can happen next week,"" Yoo Yeong-ha, Park's lawyer, said in a statement. An independent investigation would increase the pressure on Park, who has been facing growing calls by opposition lawmakers to resign. Although emboldened by a wave of massive protests, opposition parties have yet to seriously push for Park's impeachment over fears of triggering a backlash from conservative voters and negatively impacting next year's presidential election. Park has 15 days to sign off on the law or use her constitutional right to reject it, although that's considered unlikely. Park has apologized for letting her friend Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a late cult leader who emerged as Park's mentor in the 1970s, edit some of her draft speeches and for the public anger caused by the scandal. But she has not commented on the most damning accusations that she let Choi manipulate important government decisions on policy and personnel. Under South Korea's Constitution, the president has immunity from prosecution except in cases of treason, but she can be investigated. The law passed on Thursday requires Park to select a special prosecutor among two candidates proposed by opposition parties to lead an investigation that would obviously be aimed at exposing her own wrongdoings. The special prosecutor can form a team of 60, including up to 20 state prosecutors, and will have 90 days to investigate and determine whether to pursue charges. The investigation period can be extended to 120 days, but only if Park approves. Opposition lawmakers have pushed for an independent investigation into the scandal over concerns that state prosecutors' close ties with presidential officials might inject bias into their probe. In a televised apology earlier this month, Park said she would accept a direct investigation into her actions, including one pushed by a special prosecutor. The launching of an investigation by a special prosecutor would automatically stop the probe by state prosecutors. The special prosecutor can pursue additional charges against suspects that weren't included in indictments by state prosecutors. Choi, who prosecutors arrested earlier this month, has been suspected of interfering with government decisions on policy and personnel despite holding no official government job, and exploiting her presidential ties to bully companies into donating tens of millions of dollars to organizations she controlled. The increasingly strange scandal surrounding Choi has inspired rumors and left her being accused of everything from influencing national security decisions to swaying the careers of pop singers to swinging construction deals for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Extending a series of massive protests in the capital, hundreds of thousands of South Koreans rallied in Seoul on Saturday calling for Park's resignation in what may have been the largest anti-government protest since the country shook off dictatorship three decades ago. Park's supporters have been staging smaller counter rallies in the city, shouting that she should keep her job. Park has 15 months left in her term. If she steps down before the end of it, an election must be held within 60 days. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   In fits and starts, the contours of the Trump administration will begin to take shape over the coming weeks. Like his campaign, the president-elect's transition is already shaping up to be a highly unconventional one: shortly after the election, Trump removed Chris Christie from a leadership post in his transition team. At the nonprofit Brookings Institution, Darrell West, director of the think tank's Governance Studies program, has gamed out four possible scenarios for what four years of Donald Trump might look like. The scenarios reflect a wide range of paths going forward, a testament to the president-elect's fundamental unpredictability. The ultimate trajectory of the Trump White House will be set, in part, by the choices his transition team makes in the weeks ahead. Scenario 1: The traditional Republican ""Administratively, he could turn policymaking details over to Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus,"" West writes. ""In this situation, Pence would be the de facto prime minister of the government. The trio surely would move Trump policies much closer to traditional GOP preferences on many issues."" In this scenario, a President Trump might seek to smooth over fissures with the party establishment that he opened during the campaign. He might emphasize ""the GOP orthodoxy of tax cuts, deregulation, and Obamacare,"" while ""downplaying his less conventional stances,"" West writes. The elevation of Reince Priebus to Trump's Chief of Staff would seem to be a nod toward governing in this fashion. House Speaker Paul Ryan seems to be keeping his fingers crossed for this approach, welcoming America today to ""the dawn of a new unified Republican government."" Scenario 2: The popular rogue Trump could also govern as what West calls a ""popular rogue,"" ""someone who breaks the conventional rules but performs effectively."" Trump would continue to rail against the party establishment and cast himself as a champion of the little guy, or the ""forgotten man,"" as Trump backer Sean Hannity sees it. This version of Trump could hand an olive branch to congressional Democrats by promising to protect popular programs like Medicare and Social Security, which the Ryan wing of the GOP has had its sights on for years. ""His relations with the GOP would be fraught with tension because some of these positions are anathema to it,"" West writes, ""but ordinary people would appreciate that he was fighting for them. Overtime, he might remake the Republican coalition and make his party less beholden to large interests."" There's no doubt that Trump sees himself as something of a reformer in this mold. In his victory speech on election night, Trump said that ""the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,"" and that ""every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential."" Skeptics will argue that Trump's business career was largely built on the backs of these same forgotten men and women. His history is riddled with allegations of unpaid bills, failed endeavors, numerous bankruptcies and vindictive crusades against ""little guys"" who crossed him. Scenario three: The failed president Trump's effort to be the champion of the common man could also be undone by scandal, corruption or even simple incompetence. In West's telling, the ""failed presidency"" narrative would start with the lack of a clear mandate from Trump's million-vote deficit in the popular vote last week. Trump's likely to walk into the White House with the lowest approval rating of any new president in history. ""In this situation, he likely will have no honeymoon and his popular support probably will fall during his term,"" West writes. All it could take is the whiff of scandal or impropriety -- a bad outcome in the Trump University lawsuit, an abuse of presidential power, or a general aura of incompetence, to name just a few -- to set Americans against their new president. ""Many ultra-rich leaders elected in other countries such as Silvio Berlusconi of Italy practice crony capitalism and see themselves as above the law, and ultimately suffer legal or political recriminations,"" West writes. Trump relished his rally appearances during the campaign, citing his large crowds as proof he was on the right track in spite of the various controversies he found himself tangled in, from abrasive comments to allegations of sexual assault. He's indicated he'd like to continue holding massive rallies as president, perhaps using them to counter criticism as he did during the campaign. Scenario 4: The authoritarian  That opens the door to West's final possibility for how the next four years might play out: we could get Trump the ""authoritarian leader."" ""Violent protests or urban riots could destabilize society and lead President Trump to militarize local police, crack down on the opposition, and make it easier to sue dissenting voices,"" West writes. ""Rather than have Twitter outbursts, he could use law enforcement to get tough on protesters or have his White House chief strategist Steve Bannon orchestrate smear campaigns against opponents."" Trump revealed an appreciation for strongman tactics during the campaign. He repeatedly promised to jail his opponent Hillary Clinton, which ""would violate long-established norms concerning peaceful transitions of power,"" West writes. On social media the president-elect seems disinterested in unifying messages and more concerned with re-litigating various disagreements and perceived slights. The naming of former Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon as Trump's chief strategist has been met with outrage from critics concerned by his embrace of the so-called ""alt-right"" and the often racist and anti-Semitic stances adopted by Breitbart news while Bannon was at the helm. Civil libertarians and criminal justice reformers are already concerned that Trump has surrounded himself with a coterie of ""tough-on-crime"" hard-liners throughout the campaign, including Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona and Sheriff David Clarke of Wisconsin. How any of this will actually play out is anybody's guess. Trump has proven himself nothing if not unpredictable.      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   "

(Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg News)  To some, it seems an open-and-shut case that a woman faces an insuperable double standard on the road to the White House. ""America was never ready for a woman president,"" one headline declared; Clinton's defeat ""is what misogyny looks like,"" a Guardian columnist lamented; her own running mate, after the loss, described the United States as a nation that ""has made it so uniquely difficult for a woman to make it into federal office."" No, America is not ready, not now and not in the foreseeable future. After all, Americans twice elected an African American president, but Hillary Clinton, an inordinately qualified woman, came up short. Only 41 percent of men voted for her. And just look at the sexism and misogyny of this election. But Clinton did not lose because of sexism, and future female candidates for president are unlikely to, either. Let's start with a basic fact: Clinton won the national popular vote, and but for the electoral college, America would have its first female president. It seems fair to conclude that groups voting for her by large margins view women as qualified to be president. According to exit polls, African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans -- notably, between six to eight out of 10 nonwhite men -- favored Clinton over Trump. In addition, Jews, people of other non-Christian faiths, those with no religion and Christians who are not evangelical or born again went for Clinton by margins of 25 to 47 points. Clinton mostly held the Obama coalition but failed to excite it; lower turnout for her played a role in her electoral-college defeat. For those who see Clinton's defeat as a sign that Americans are resistant to a female president, the relevant question is whether those who chose Trump over Clinton were motivated primarily by gender bias -- or something else.      Anti-Trump protests took place near some college campuses on election night. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   The first clue that sexism isn't the prime culprit is the fact that nationwide, 53 percent of white women favored Trump. Given some of Trump's statements and behaviors toward women, that seems shocking, until you consider the role partisanship plays in American politics. One, a majority of white women typically votes Republican, albeit by far smaller margins than white men do. Two, evangelical or born-again white Christians overwhelmingly identify and vote Republican. And this group includes 27 percent of all white American women. Nationally, 90 percent of Republicans and 81 percent of evangelical or born-again Christians voted for Trump, despite the speculation they would quietly cast their vote against the interloper. GOP women supported Trump at the same level as men. These reliably Republican voters weighed their reservations about Trump against the alternative -- a liberal, pro-choice Democrat whom they intensely dislike -- and stuck with the GOP standard-bearer. Party, ideology and policy overcame any gender solidarity. That's not a surprise. Make no mistake. At the end of the day, Republicans elected Trump. Without loyal support from Republicans and white Protestant evangelicals, Trump could not have pulled off his upset. Yet he needed more to win. Trump found his path to victory with the help of white working-class voters in blue states. Most dramatically, 72 percent of non-college-educated white men voted for the male candidate in this race. Of course, Obama lost them too in 2012, and Democrats have performed poorly with this demographic for decades. But Clinton lost them by a 49-point margin, far worse than Obama fared against Romney. But this, too, is no smoking gun that sexism decided this election. There is some evidence that gendered views influenced their vote. Two-thirds of Trump supporters and Republicans think American society ""has become too soft and feminine,"" according to surveys done by PRRI. Another pre-election analysis, by ABC, found that seeing too little influence for whites and men, and too much influence for minorities and women, predicted support for Trump. As this latter study suggests, a closer look reveals a much more complex portrait of anxieties about immigration, class, race and culture among Trump voters. Nearly two-thirds of Trump supporters, according to a PRRI poll taken during the primaries, said they were bothered when ""I come into contact with an immigrant who speaks little or no English."" A Pew survey found that 75 percent of white non-college Republicans and Republican-leaners favor building a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border. In exit polls, Trump voters rated the economy as poor and their own financial situation as worse today than a year ago. ""High levels of racial resentment,"" according to one study, correlated with support for Trump. Seventy-two percent of Trump supporters, in PRRI's American Values Survey say ""American society and way of life has changed for the worse since the 1950s."" Undoubtedly sexism is in the mix for some of the men in Trump's world; it was on bold display at his rallies. But this election was not primarily a referendum on whether America is ready to elect a woman to the presidency. Hillary Clinton brought unique talents and experience to this race, as well as distinct liabilities. Fatally, she was the all-too-familiar face of the establishment in a burn-the-house-down moment. The next potential female president will step into an arena in which her gender won't be irrelevant, but it won't be determinative. Recent research powerfully indicates that, today, women do not lose elections because of sexism. Political scientists are currently finding little evidence that gender bias significantly influences how we vote. Women win elections at the same rates as men. The research shows that partisanship trumps gender -- as it did in the 2016 presidential race. Granted, the presidency is the highest hurdle to surmount and hard to compare with any other election. Still, there's good cause to doubt the conventional wisdom that it's harder for women to win an executive than a legislative election because of gendered stereotypes about power. In a large-scale survey by the Pew Research Center, when asked whether women were better at legislative or executive roles, more than 8 in 10 respondents saw no difference between how capable women were in the two types of office. Nor did they see any difference in how capable men were in these different roles. What about the double bind -- the walk on the tightrope of likability and strength -- that many pointed to as a key source of Clinton's low approval rating? Political scientist Deborah Jordan Brooks, in award-winning research, found that voters did not view female candidates who demonstrated toughness to be uncaring or unlikable. Nor did they penalize them for being tough. Indeed, acting tough outside the bounds of conventional femininity boosted women's favorability ratings, and tough women were viewed as more likely to be effective presidents. Let me be clear. Certainly female candidates are subjected to sexist attacks, and politics is a gendered arena. But for the future of feminism, and for young girls particularly, it's equally important that we do not learn the wrong lesson from Clinton's defeat. Now is the time to pass the baton, not throw in the towel. More women have to step up to run for office. They should do so with confidence that sexism will not mow them down."

Boiko Borisov's move comes after official results show Socialist-backed candidate Rumen Radev, a former non-partisan air force chief, winning the presidential election.  ""We accept the will of the people and we congratulate those who have the support of the majority of the voters,"" said Borisov, whose party had previously triumphed in all national elections over the last decade. Halfway into its four-year term, Borisov's coalition government has managed to restore political stability after months of anti-corruption protests. But its popularity has faded because of the slow pace of reforms to eliminate graft and poverty, and overhaul the judicial system. Radev called the result ""a negative vote for the government that leads to a new political situation."" Bulgaria's presidency is primarily a ceremonial position. Although the head of state has no executive powers, and all major policies must be approved by parliament, the popular election gives the post more influence and authority. The president leads the armed forces and can veto legislation and sign international treaties. The president also names ambassadors and the heads of the intelligence and security services. Borisov's resignation would likely lead to months of difficult coalition talks among several political groupings and an early election as soon as April. The Central Election Commission said that with 99.3 percent of the ballots counted, Radev won 59.4 percent of the vote in Sunday's runoff, compared with 36.2 percent for the candidate of the ruling center-right party, Tsetska Tsacheva. Radev, who will take office for a five-year term on Jan. 22, will face a possible rise in migrants from neighboring Turkey and growing tensions between Russia and the West. A political novice, Radev attracted many Bulgarians who are fed up with corrupt politicians. The former NATO fighter pilot, who once studied at the U.S. Air War College in Alabama, has pledged to maintain Bulgaria's place in NATO but also says ""being pro-European doesn't mean being anti-Russian.""  ""During his election campaign, the U.S. president-elect said categorically that he is going to have a deeper dialogue with Russia,"" Radev said after the vote and added that ""it gives strong hope for a peaceful solution of the conflicts in Syria and in Ukraine, and reducing confrontation."" In nearby Moldova, a pro-Russia candidate declared victory in the country's presidential election, also on Sunday. Igor Dodon has pledged to restore trade and political relations with Moscow, which cooled after Moldova signed a trade association agreement with the European Union. Political analyst Dimitar Bechev said after the vote in Bulgaria that ""there will be no shortage of drama in Bulgaria over the coming months, to be sure, but it will be driven by local forces, not the geopolitical contest between Russia and the West.""

Yet the Republican National Committee chairman would come to earn the trust and confidence of President-elect Donald Trump, who on Sunday named Priebus as his chief of staff, along with flame-throwing media executive Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist. The position puts Priebus at the power center of the new Trump administration. The 44-year-old Wisconsin political operative will help guard access to the president-elect, guide policy and political decisions, and if past practice holds true, will often be, along with Bannon, the last person Trump consults before making major decisions. Priebus has no governing experience in Washington. Yet his extraordinary ability to build and maintain relationships with his party's power brokers and grassroots sets him apart from other prospective chiefs of staff. The affable and slow-talking Priebus maintains a particularly close relationship with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is also from Wisconsin. At the same time, Priebus may have been almost as popular among the Republican National Committee's 168 members, who represent many different factions of the GOP and come from every state in the nation. Trump's new chief of staff and the House speaker met in the late 1990s when Priebus was a party activist in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, and Ryan was running for Congress. Priebus eventually became the party chairman of Kenosha County, the First District (the speaker's district) and then Wisconsin party chairman. He's been a friend and adviser to Ryan all these many years. Priebus was already the longest serving chairman in party history, having worked in that role since January 2011, but he easily could have been re-elected early next year had he wanted to seek another term. More than anything, he served as the chief fundraiser for the Republican National Committee, a job he did very well. He used the tens of millions of dollars he helped raise to create a nationwide voter outreach operation that fueled Trump's stunning victory. Still, his status as a party insider caught the attention of Trump supporters such as tea party leader Jenny Beth Martin. She warned on Saturday that, ""No Washington insider, regardless of who it is, should serve as President Trump's chief of staff.""  ""It's time to drain the swamp -- not promote insiders beholden to the Washington establishment who helped create it,"" she said. Priebus' ability to earn Trump's trust and confidence ultimately outweighed any political concerns. He was perhaps the only major establishment leader to stand with Trump over the campaign's final weeks as much of the political world predicted the Republican nominee would lose the election. Priebus became Trump's regular traveling companion and confidant. He was optimistic until the very end.  ""I don't buy this conventional wisdom that somehow or other, things are bad. I think things are going well,"" he told The Associated Press a few days before the election. Priebus, a big Green Bay Packers fan, likes to talk sports, he plays the piano and is quick to poke fun at himself. His easygoing personality, self-deprecating humor and lack of knowledge of the legislative process, mark a particularly sharp contrast with President Barack Obama's first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. He married his high school sweetheart, Sally. They have two school-age children. Priebus ""gets along with pretty much everybody,"" said Lanhee Chen, a former top adviser to the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Chen called the pick ""a terrific decision."" ''I think it reflects an understanding that, first of all, you have to have someone who understands the politics of Washington,"" he said. Priebus has long favored a ""big-tent"" political philosophy that encourages the GOP to adopt a more welcoming and inclusive tone. Back in December, he condemned Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigrants in December.  ""I think it's the party for everybody. It's for everyone,"" Priebus told the AP days before Trump's victory. ""That the message that we're trying to get out across the country, which is it doesn't matter what the color of your skin is, what your faith is, what gender you are, or what age you are. This is a party of freedom, opportunity and equality. That's what our party is."" ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
