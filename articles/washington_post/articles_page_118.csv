On a conference call with supporters late Monday, President Obama congratulated Clinton on a ""history-making"" race, but he called on his party to assess what went wrong and retool at a grass-roots level. ""We have better ideas, but they have to be heard for us to actually translate those ideas into votes and ultimately into action,"" Obama said. Meanwhile, Clinton addressed congressional lawmakers on a separate conference call, acknowledging the impact of her loss. ""No one is sorrier than me,"" Clinton said, according to a Democrat on the call. ""Heartbreaks don't heal overnight, and this one won't."" Clinton noted that the election is one that should be studied, and she urged lawmakers to fight for the party's values harder than ever. She said she is ""grateful"" that ""in the end our vision for America earned more votes."" Yet, Democrats this week are beginning to strategize about how to regroup in the new Trump era, which has left them locked out of the White House and out of power in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Calls for new leadership and ideas have prompted several Democrats to put their names forward to lead the party. On Monday, the country's first Muslim lawmaker and a prominent liberal voice in the House, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), announced that he would run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee.  [Keith Ellison makes DNC bid official, rolls out 40 endorsements]  In a show of strength, Ellison rolled out 40 endorsements, including Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) and Reid's expected successor, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.). Also endorsing Ellison on Monday were Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.), Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (Ariz.) and Rep. G.K. Butterfield (N.C.). ""Democrats win when we harness the power of everyday people and fight for the issues they care about,"" Ellison said in a statement. ""It is not enough for Democrats to ask for voters' support every two years. We must be with them through every lost paycheck, every tuition hike, and every time they are the victim of a hate crime. When voters know what Democrats stand for, we can improve the lives of all Americans."" Ellison was one of the first and few sitting lawmakers who endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over Clinton in the Democratic primary. And he was also one of the Democrats who recognized early on that Donald Trump posed a potentially formidable challenge in this election. Trump showed unexpected strength in industrial Midwestern states, where he lost by fewer than two percentage points to Clinton. That represented a sea change and a narrow miss for Democrats, especially when compared with Mitt Romney's nearly eight-point loss to Obama in the 2012 presidential election. ""We must champion the challenges of working families and give voters a reason to show up at the polls in 2018 and beyond,"" Ellison said. In a news conference on Monday, Obama also acknowledged that Clinton's loss marked the erosion of Democratic support in parts of the country that he had won, in part because her campaign believed that the path to victory would not go through predominantly white and working-class corners of the electoral map that helped win Trump the White House.  [Meeting the press for first time since Trump's win, Obama says new president-elect is committed to NATO]  Obama named Iowa as a state he won not ""because the demographics dictated"" it but because he spent time campaigning in small towns and counties where he was the underdog. ""There's some counties maybe I won, that people didn't expect, because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for,"" Obama said. Several other Democrats have put their names forward to lead the party, including former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison and the DNC's national finance chairman, Henry R. Munoz III, and former DNC chair and Vermont governor Howard Dean. On Monday morning during an appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Dean emphasized that the job is one that should require a full-time commitment, a long-standing criticism of the last full-time DNC chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), who served in the position while also holding a congressional seat. ""You cannot do this job if it's not full-time. Period,"" Dean said.  "

Despite Hillary Clinton and President Obama urging their backers to accept Trump's victory and support his transition into power, thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets decrying his crude comments about women and attacks on immigrants. Protests were reported in cities across the nation, from major metropolitan centers like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, to smaller cities, such as Richmond and Portland, Ore. Dozens of demonstrators were arrested. Even cities in red states, such as Atlanta, Dallas and Kansas City, Mo., saw demonstrations. In Oakland, Calif., two police officers were injured and two patrol cars burned as thousands of protesters took to the streets and chanted slogans against Trump, a police spokeswoman said. A few protesters threw objects at police dressed in riot gear, smashed windows and started small fires in the downtown area.         1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flared up across the country Wednesday evening as opponents of President-elect Donald Trump expressed dismay with the election results, underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting a fractured country.

Hundreds of others blocked two different highways, backing up traffic for miles. ""I'm disappointed, shocked, a little panicked for my friends and family -- for everything that will be unleashed, the hate that will be unleashed,"" said Marion Hill, 22, who joined thousands who amassed outside of the Trump Tower in downtown Chicago. Rainbow flags and signs bearing messages such as ""Time to Revolt"" waved above the crowd, as protesters filled Michigan Avenue, cheered on by drivers who honked their support. They then shut down Lake Shore Drive, the expressway along Lake Michigan.   [A year in Trump's America: Frustration, fury and fervor]  Most of the major demonstrations took place in urban centers in blue states Clinton won Tuesday -- highlighting the demographic divide that shaped the election results. The former secretary of state's narrow victory in the popular vote spurred demonstrators in New York to chant ""She got more votes!"" as thousands amassed in front of Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan. The crowd stretched several blocks down Fifth Avenue.     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted View Graphic     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted  Earlier, the protesters had marched from Union Square to Trump's building, chanting ""Donald Trump, go away! Sexist, racist, anti-gay!""  At one point, demonstrators lit an American flag on fire. Later, amid a cacophony of loud chants, a glowing ""Love Trumps Hate"" banner was held aloft under the Trump Tower sign. The singer Cher mingled in the crowd, doling out hugs. In Washington, a crowd of hundreds of mostly young protesters gathered outside the White House for a candlelight vigil before marching to the new Trump International Hotel a few blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue. ""I'm trying to not be angry and trying to find more positive way to express my reactions. I don't think anger will help,"" said Kate Lasso, 57, who joined the crowd. But for the wife of a Guatemalan immigrant, who has relatives in the country without proper documentation, restraining emotion was difficult. ""They have kids,"" she said. ""They have been living here. What is going to happen to them?""  [Undocumented immigrants fear what Trump will do as president]  Hundreds also marched through Philadelphia, with about 700 people heading north through Center City and blocking intersections as they made their way up Broad Street, police said. The protesters in these scattered cities -- some of them the same places that have seen heated demonstrations sparked by fatal police shootings in recent years -- could be seen in videos streaming across on cable news and social media, lit by flashing police lights and streetlights as they wound through metropolitan streets. Many who turned out said they were fearful that Trump would follow through with his pledge to deport undocumented immigrants. ""I just felt waking up today that I was waking up to a whole new world, to a nightmare for my parents and people I care about and love,"" said Tony, a 23-year-old line cook who declined to give his last name as he marched in Chicago, carrying his 6-year-old daughter on his shoulders. ""There's so much heartache,"" he said. ""It's a bad time to be a Muslim or an illegal citizen in this country."" In Santa Ana., Calif., Lucy Dominguez, 37, and her husband, Oliver Lopez, 33, had their arms around one another and held a sign reading, ""Peace."" ""I came to stand up with the people. To stand up with my people, the Latino community,"" she said. ""I chose the peace sign because we need peace in this moment."" Hours earlier, Trump struck magnanimous note of reconciliation as he claimed victory shortly before 3 a.m. ""Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division,"" he said. ""We have to get together. To all Republicans, Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people."" Trump's tone was echoed by Obama and Clinton, who told their supporters not to despair as Republicans rejoiced at the idea that they will control both the legislative and executive branches of government in two and-a-half months. ""I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it, too,"" Clinton said. ""This is painful, and it will be for a long time.""  [A speech Clinton never imagined giving]  Clinton, who was misty-eyed at times but composed throughout her remarks, said the long and bitter campaign against Trump showed that ""our nation is more deeply divided that we thought."" But she told her backers: ""We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" Minutes later, Obama addressed reporters in the Rose Garden with Vice President Biden by his side, as more than a hundred White House staffers stood off to the side. Several of the aides were visibly emotional, with at least one crying before he began speaking. ""Now, everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we're actually all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage,"" Obama said, vowing to work to ensure a smooth transition for the president-elect. But the displays of anger and grief on the streets Wednesday indicated the depth of the rupture in the country -- and the distrust with which many Americans view Trump. ""He's going to lead us to a very dark place for women,"" said Samantha Sylverne, a 19-year-old student, who marched in Chicago carrying a sign scrawled on a cardboard box that read, ""Amerikkka elected a rapist."" ""Along with how it affects our reproductive rights, the things Donald Trump spews about women shape how Americans think they can talk about women and other marginalized people,"" she said. In New York, where protesters walked in the streets, disrupting traffic, Brandon Ramos, 21, said the election result ""feels like a nightmare."" ""I'm Latino,"" he said. ""My entire family and neighborhood are depressed. I still haven't comprehended it.""  [What does Trump's win say about us as a nation?]  Tensions flared particularly high on college campuses. At American University in Washington, students burned American flags and some shouted ""F--- white America!"" In Austin, students at the University of Texas led a march for hours through the city Wednesday afternoon. As hundreds of protesters wove into traffic, bus drivers high-fived the students. Some in their vehicles got out and hugged them, tears streaming down their faces. ""Seeing this is everything,"" said Jennifer Rowsey, 47, as the march passed by a coffee shop next to Austin City Hall where she is the human resource manager. ""I felt so isolated,"" she said. ""I don't feel so alone now."" Austin City Council member Greg Casar, the son of Mexican immigrants and a community organizer, joined up with the protesters when they passed by an interview he was giving with local media. ""A lot of people are calling for healing,"" he said. ""I think we should reject that."" He said that now is the time to support protesters, strikers and other forms of civil disobedience. Casar said if Trump comes to Austin, he will refuse to shake his hand. ""If I have to go to jail,"" for protesting, he said, ""I'll go to jail."" The evening march in Washington converged in front of the Trump hotel, where one demonstrator pasted a sign of Trump's face marked with the word ""Hate"" on the side of the building. A few protesters attempted to rush through a crowd barrier in front of the hotel's side entrance before security officials quickly intervened and pushed them back. Other protesters jeered against the escalation, drowning out the momentary disruption with chants of ""When they go low, we go high."" Some in the crowd distributed fliers with plans for another protest -- on Inauguration Day. Bailey Walker, a 20-year-old George Mason University student, found herself grappling with how she could have been so confident of a Clinton victory. ""I created an echo chamber within my social media and friend groups, and I wasn't listening,"" said Walker, who said she knew only a few Trump supporters from the college public speaking circuit. ""I need to do a better job of connecting with them and engaging,"" she said. ""Meeting in person would be a big step.""  Lydersen reported from Chicago. Eva Ruth Moravec in Austin; Katie Zezima in Santa Ana, Calif.; Philip Bump, Ryan Carey-Mahoney, Kayla Epstein and Anne Gearan in New York; and Juliet Eilperin and Mark Berman in Washington contributed to this report.

An unexpected Republican nominee, Trump rode a wave of support from voters seeking change and willing to accept a candidate loose with facts and accused of sexual misconduct. In a victory that rattled financial markets worldwide, he upset Democrat Hillary Clinton, who would have become the first woman to serve in the Oval Office. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Eight years after losing a hard-fought Democratic gubernatorial primary to current Gov. Jack Markell, U.S. Rep. John Carney Jr. was elected governor, a victory he described as both ""humbling"" and ""uplifting.""  ""We've got a lot of work to do,"" said Carney, who will have little time to celebrate before forming a cabinet and putting together a financial team to balance the state's budget for next year.  ""That's going be job No. 1,"" he said. ""I'm going to walk in with a 200- to 300-million-dollar deficit."" During the campaign, Carney called for a ""complete budget reset,"" taking a hard look at both spending and revenue.  ""We've become too reliant on certain revenues that are not sustainable in the future,"" he said. Carney will be replaced in Washington by former state Labor Secretary Lisa Blunt Rochester, who will become the first African-American and first woman to represent the state in Congress.  ""This is more Delaware making history than me as one individual,"" Rochester told The Associated Press. ""I'm so excited I can't even begin to tell you."" Rochester traced her decision to run for Congress to a moment at a grocery store, where she watched a father with three kids try to buy a bag of grapes.  ""He had to put them back because they were $9,"" she recalled. ""That totally changed me. And I listened to the negativity that I was hearing across the country at the federal level, and instead of sitting back I just said, 'I want to step up.' And so I did, even though I had never run for office before, and here we are."" Rochester said she hopes to work with fellow Democrats and Republicans to build alliances to tackle issues such as safeguarding Social Security, protecting the Affordable Care Act, and working to improve the nation's infrastructure.  ""That's what I've built my career on, and that's what I want to take to Washington, D.C., bringing people together, common ground, working on tough issues,"" she said. In other races, Democratic state Sen. Bethany Hall-Long won the contest to fill Delaware's vacant lieutenant governor's seat, and New Castle County Sheriff Trinidad Navarro was elected insurance commissioner. Democrats also elected a new mayor in Wilmington and a new chief executive in New Castle County, the state's two largest local governments. Republicans failed to regain control of the state Senate but did score a stunning upset over Democratic President Pro Tem Sen. Patricia Blevins of Elsmere, the only incumbent member of the legislature to lose Tuesday. The final balance of power in the Senate will hinge on a special election, likely held early next year, to fill the seat being vacated by Hall-Long. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

In the final hours before the vote, Americans remain bullish about their prospects. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  At long last, Americans get to decide. More than usual, most people don't like their choices. More than usual, many Americans believe that people who don't agree with them are not only wrong but are also best avoided. On the eve of the election, America is afraid. People talk about buying guns to protect themselves from troubles to come. They talk about places they steer clear of and people they don't talk to anymore. Casual conversations have blown up into hurtful arguments. Friends vanish from Facebook feeds. People who used to put up yard signs don't for fear of what their neighbors might do. And people who thought things were improving, in their own lives and in their communities, wonder whether they missed the real story, a darker tale of division and despair. But America is also what it's always been, a green field of possibility, a place where people relish rogues and truth-tellers, and a place where being appalled by politicians is part of the deal, something that can even bring people together. Only eight years after millions of Americans poured into the streets in spontaneous, joyful celebration of the election of the nation's first black president, optimism seems to have been sucked out of the country's marrow, replaced by a heavy anxiety, a sense that things aren't right and can't easily be fixed. The candidates for president have made it harder to be optimistic, many Americans say. One candidate said things were so bad that only he could make America great again. The other asked people to consider that the country would be stronger together. But neither captured the hearts or hopes of any broad cross-section of the people. Neither offered any grand idea for a more secure, happier future. There was no New Deal, no Great Society, no Thousand Points of Light. Yet in the final hours before the vote, Americans remain bullish about their prospects, eager to keep plugging, for themselves and their children. In interviews across the country, whether they're voting for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, anyone but them or no one at all, Americans almost uniformly say that the politicians are clueless but that the people will eventually do what needs getting done.     ***     On the eve of the election, America is deeply polarized, heavy with anxiety and distrustful of the other side. And although many are appalled by today's dark politics, they are taking comfort in a bedrock of American exceptionalism: its people. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Melinda Powers opens the heavy door of the industrial oven and carefully removes a fragrant, steaming apple crisp. She inspects it meticulously. At 19, she dreams of opening a bakery. She worries that this election is her obstacle. To get from the culinary studies program at Newbury College in Brookline, Mass., to a business of her own, Powers expects she'll need her parents' help. But they're fighting over politics right now, and it's bad enough that Powers could see them breaking up, which would probably nix her bakery plan. Powers's parents met at Winchester Repeating Arms -- an Irish American guy who produced gun parts and an immigrant woman from Cape Verde who inspected guns. They fell in love on the shop floor. But the election has driven a wedge between them. He's for Trump; she's for Clinton. ""My dad jokingly brings it up all the time,"" Powers said, ""but my mom doesn't think it's funny at all. Trump offends everything she's ever worked for."" Powers's mother is so disturbed by the racism and anti-immigrant sentiment she's seen this year that she sometimes threatens to move back to Cape Verde if Trump wins. ""My dad obviously doesn't want to leave his Harley-Davidson buddies behind and move to a foreign country where he doesn't speak the language,"" his daughter said. The campaign has also divided Powers from her old friends from Blue Hill Regional Technical High School in Randolph. Most of those friends are white, and all but one support Trump. ""My white friends think they can say racial stuff more than they used to,"" Powers said. ""They use the n-word a lot more now. . . . There is more hate directed toward other races and toward immigrants."" Powers is still an optimist; no matter who wins, she will work hard to achieve her dreams. She says she still believes America is the greatest country. But she'd thought the battles over racism ""were fought for me long ago,"" and now she sees a hate that masquerades as humor. ""We can be driving somewhere,"" she said, ""and they'll be like, 'Melinda, sit in the back.' Then they'll laugh. After a while, you do feel slightly left out, because at the end of the day, we are not all the same. I am the different one.""    ***     In interviews across the country, Americans almost uniformly say the politicians are clueless but the people will eventually do what needs to be done. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Optimism, perhaps the most exceptional of American traits, is down. A Washington Post-ABC News poll found earlier in the fall campaign that 42 percent of Americans were bullish about the next year, the lowest number since 2004, the first national election after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Yet here was Sheila Rushing, 67, knocking on doors, even on doors of houses that looked empty, with boards slanting over the windows. Rushing had avoided politics for years, a job requirement: The work that got her through divorce, at the Detroit museum of African American history, was a nonprofit, limiting her political activity. But when she retired, she canvassed for the first black president and now for Hillary Clinton. ""I'm doing great,"" she said. ""Glad and blessed. Glad that the Lord woke me up."" Rushing, like many Detroiters, was offended when Trump declared that black Americans were living in ""hell."" The past eight years were no hell. She had raised her grandson, Armando, after his father died when the boy was 14. He turned 26 on Halloween, and Rushing had helped him through high school and on to Wayne State University to get his degree in criminal justice. And now he's working. Rushing took pride in her own ability to pay off her home note, and she thanked Obama for the bigger Pell grants that got Armando through school. Rushing learned this fall not to broach the subject of politics with some friends. It was too raw. Still, she knocked on another door. The home was empty but not abandoned. She left a flier with a picture of Clinton and Obama deep in conversation in the Oval Office. ""Protect his legacy,"" it read.  ***     Passions are running sky high in this high-stakes election. Friendships have been lost. Marriages have been tested. Facebook friends unfriended. Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton has captured the hearts or hopes of any broad cross-section of the people. Neither offered any grand idea for a more secure, happier future. There was no New Deal, no Great Society, no Thousand Points of Light. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  Nearly half of Americans -- 45 percent in a Post-ABC poll in September -- believe the United States is ""less great"" than it has been in the past; 37 percent said it is about the same; and 16 percent said it is greater. The idea that the country has grown less great is much more common among Trump supporters (77 percent) than among Clinton backers (21 percent). Through the years, pessimism about the country's direction has been stronger among supporters of the party that's out of power. In 2008, as the economy weakened and the war in Iraq dragged on, an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found that 77 percent of Obama supporters said the nation was in a ""state of decline,"" compared with 57 percent of those backing the Republican, John McCain. Tony Kadlcek first came to the United States from Czechoslovakia in 1990, soon after the revolution against his country's communist regime. His uncle invited him to visit, and while in Chicago, Kadlcek met the woman who would become his wife. The next year, Kadlcek legally migrated to the United States to be with her. He got a job with the commercial HVAC business that his wife's family owned. He still works there. But 12 years ago, the couple moved farther from Chicago, to Lisle, a suburb to the city's southwest, because of corruption and crime, he said. Now he drives through Chicago, sees dilapidated buildings and worries about crime. ""There were 17 murders"" over one October weekend, he said. ""Obama promised to be a uniter, but it seems like he divided us. People hate cops; blacks and whites seem more separate now."" Kadlcek, 47, likes his life; he has four kids, makes a good living and owns his own home as well as a six-apartment building that he rents out. But the building's value has not recovered since the economic crisis, and he partly blames Obama. He and his wife, a legal secretary, are fed up with high taxes, debt, corruption and illegal immigration. When their kids go to college, they might move to Wisconsin or Indiana. Frustrated about what's happened to the country, he worries about a crackdown on guns; he recently bought an ""expensive rifle, so that if Hillary wins I'll be grandfathered in."" He likes Trump's slogan, Make America Great Again, because it admits the country has gone downhill. But Kadlcek isn't advertising his support for Trump. In years past, he put bumper stickers on his Cutlass Supreme, going back to Dole-Kemp in 1996. Not this time: ""People are afraid if you have a Trump sticker on your car or a Hillary sticker, someone will key it.""   ***      Food carts can be seen in every part of New York City. The mobile carts are a common way that some new immigrants get their start in business in the United States. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)     Most folks put aside their differences of race attitudes and political leanings to root for the home team during the Friday night football games. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)    Mae and Daniel Harrison are riveted to the campaign news -- well, she is. He can take only so much. Both of them have seen the campaign eat away at relationships. They've argued with fellow shoppers in grocery lines. They avoid Trump supporters. And for the first time in many years, they've felt unwelcome in some places.  ""We are fearful of going too far away from home because of what we see,"" Mae said. The campaign is all the 74-year-old retired United Methodist pastor talks about these days. When her girlfriends call, she can't help but get into the emails. After a pastor friend from Texas phoned and declared she'd be voting for Trump, Harrison held her tongue. She hasn't called back. Not until after the election. The Harrisons, who live in Fort Washington in Prince George's County, Md., read the paper, then have the TV on much of the day, CNN and MSNBC mostly. It's Trump and Clinton, and Trump, and Trump. Mae listens as she flits about the house. Daniel sometimes rebels. ""Cut that off, Mae,"" he tells his wife. ""I don't like the sound of his voice."" Watch Netflix instead, he says. Sometimes, she does. But come 6 p.m., the temptation is too much, and she puts the news back on. Daniel gives up and goes upstairs to the computer or to watch a game show. Daniel, 78, a retired microbiologist, grew up in Louisiana. Mae, a former teacher, came from North Carolina. For two accomplished African Americans from the South, Trump has unearthed a past they thought they had left behind when they moved to a prosperous, majority-black county in the shadow of Washington. Now, the name-calling and bullying of the campaign has them wondering whether the old hatreds had only gone dormant. At a restaurant in Virginia, a group of bikers stared them down. At the supermarket, Daniel argued with a man who couldn't see how Trump was bringing out hatred. At a church event, Mae sat well away from a black woman who said supportive things about Trump. She can't stop thinking, even if Clinton wins, what will the backlash look like? How long does this last? When does the healing begin?   ***     A crowd in Ohio listens to Hillary Clinton in Columbus, Ohio, in late July. In interviews across the country, underneath all our divisiveness lies a dogged faith in the unique excellence of the American people, which -- despite our disappointment in politics -- nourishes hope for the healing to come. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Healing is normally the last thing Brent Beaupre thinks about around the family campfire in Kennebunk, Maine. On sweet summer nights, with three generations gathered, all should be copacetic. But one night this summer, Beaupre's grandmother turned to him and asked, ""You're not going to vote for her, are you?"" ""Oh, but I am,"" Beaupre said. He tried to explain himself. And then his grandmother turned to him again and said, ""But you're not going to vote for her, are you?"" They went at it. ""Can't you see how crazy he is?"" Beaupre said. ""Yeah, but she's the biggest criminal ever,"" his grandmother replied. ""It's like talking to a wall,"" Beaupre said. ""I love these people to death, but there's nothing that permeates."" He's 21, and this will be his first vote, and what he sees is utter alienation of each side from the other. ""With the Romney-Obama cycle, you had two incredible intellects who very much knew their subjects,"" he said. ""It was about the defense of our country. It was about the national deficit -- real topics. I feel in this election cycle it's about sensationalism, whatever grabs the media."" With his stylish leather shoes and blue Oxford shirt, Beaupre moves with professional efficiency through the sea of denim and sweatshirts on the campus of Suffolk University in Boston. An honors student with a major in finance and a minor in big data, he has been offered a job upon graduation with a major bank. ""I'm a gay man who wants to work in financial services who comes from a conservative household and now lives in a very liberal city,"" he said. ""It's a constant back and forth."" The first in his family to attend college, he's nonetheless worried about the future. ""My friends entering the industry have been told point-blank that we should be wary of the economic situation we're in,"" Beaupre said. ""If the economy doesn't do well, our jobs are going to disappear. Everybody's waiting for this election; everything is on hold.""   ***      A coal train runs parallel to the road in the heart of coal country.

Williamson/The Washington Post)     A sign in front of a local bar reminds people to vote or give up the right to complain. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)    Business is good for Ryan Snyder. Life is good, too, even if good does mean 12-hour workdays, seven days a week. Snyder, 33, puts those hours into a little country breakfast-and-lunch spot in Goochland, Va. He bought Satterwhite's Restaurant from his father in January. The place sits at a rural crossroads that's unlikely to stay rural. Four miles away, the Richmond suburbs stretch out -- a Whole Foods, a glitzy mall, and, if electric car guru Elon Musk gets his way with state officials, soon a showroom for six-figure Teslas. For now, Satterwhite's sticks to what it has always been. The menu sticks to old favorites, such as salt herring with biscuits or toast for $7.85. Snyder thinks about adding a few items. Nothing fancy. ""If it's not broke,"" he figures, ""don't fix it."" He does think Washington is broken. Congress can't get anything done, and the federal government ""gets too involved in a lot of things."" And now this unacceptable choice. ""I don't think I've heard anyone say, 'I like Hillary' or 'I like Trump,' "" Snyder said. He ""can't stand Hillary. I think she's a liar,"" he said. ""And Trump is Trump. You can't go to world leaders and just run your mouth."" He won't vote for Clinton. Maybe Trump or Gary Johnson, though he knows the Libertarian Party nominee has no chance. Snyder and his wife have stopped talking about the election; Brittany thinks Trump is a misogynist. Ryan doesn't disagree; he just mistrusts Clinton more. He expects little from whoever wins. But he remains upbeat about his own prospects. He and Brittany expect their first child in February. In September, they bought their first house, a brick rancher near a big dairy farm, 10 minutes from work. Things look good outside the restaurant, too. New shopping centers, office parks and housing have gobbled up farmland and attracted more diverse residents. A Hindu cultural center and temple popped up about a mile away. Some Satterwhite's regulars grumble about the new development, but Snyder likes it fine: ""It'll do nothing but increase my business."" New development means new people, some of them new to America. Snyder is concerned about terrorists, but he doesn't think it makes sense morally or economically to turn everyone away.   He figures the people at the new Hindu center are ""educated and ready to work,"" he said. ""How do you turn that away? We're all immigrants in this country, so you can't shut the borders down.""   ***     For many Americans, this election is about our very way of life and who we are as a people. Many Clinton supporters are disturbed by what they see as racism and anti-immigrant sentiment from Trump, and many Trump supporters view Clinton as ""criminal"" and ""conniving."" Nearly half of Americans -- 45 percent in a Washington Post poll in September -- believe the United States is ""less great"" than it's been in the past. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  For many immigrants, there is a special urgency to this election, because of Trump's harsh rhetoric about keeping out Mexicans and Muslims, and because there have been so many deportations, with the prospect of many more. As the sun set Wednesday night, Rosa Rosales walked the bridge from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso eating from a cup of corn and chilis. She paid her 50 cents to reenter the United States, and she was home, where she is a citizen. She had gone across the border to get her medicine. The politicians fight forever about immigration, and Rosales walks the bridge. They fight forever about health care, and Rosales walks the bridge. A home care nurse, she has no use for Trump or Clinton. She voted early, writing in her senator, Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), mostly because he agreed with her that Obamacare is no good. Too expensive, and it's wrong to punish people who lack insurance, she said. She supported Obama eight years ago, but when she needs simple care, she crosses the border. If she has something big, like the kidney stone that bedeviled her a few years back, she stays in Texas. She fears Trump. ""He's a racist; he's rude,"" Rosales said. ""He has a lack of respect for women. I'm a Mexican, and I think he will do something against Mexican people."" Rosales crossed the marker between the United States and Mexico and let out a little cheer. She had her dinner and her medicine, and she was okay. Halfway across the southern edge of the country, Rafael Marin is secretly obsessed with the election. Patrons come into his downtown Miami shop, Richard's Fruit Center, for fresh fruit and smoothies. Marin, 59, plays '80s pop on the radio -- no political talk shows. He likes to keep the vibe cheerful and positive. In the city's busy working-class hub, people hang out drinking Cuban coffee, arguing about the election. But in Marin's shop, he tries to keep things peaceful. He hears ""Ugh, those emails?"" and he pivots to ""Can I get you anything else?"" The rest of the country could learn a lot from downtown Miami, he said: ""We all live together, and our language is a mixed language -- Spanish, English, all used together . . . a beautiful thing."" Son of a Puerto Rican father and a Jewish mother, Marin lives in a city where nearly everyone is an immigrant of some sort, coming here from somewhere else. So Marin doesn't get Trump, doesn't want America to be seen as unwelcoming. Marin likes Clinton, marvels at her ability to withstand attacks and investigations. Whatever happens, he said: ""America will be fine; it rises and it falls like the waves. We owe some money, so what? Our credit is good, and we get to live here, in America."" A customer asks in Spanish whether raspberries, pineapple and ginger make a good smoothie. Marin nods in approval. Any blend is a good blend. A thousand miles to the north, in Barstow, Va., Lynda Trinh Frank recalled the night four decades ago when her family left Saigon and piled into a lifeboat. Frank's mother lined up her six kids and told them they could each take one bag. Frank packed her toothbrush, pajamas and Smurf comic books. Six years later, after time in a refugee camp in Arkansas, her family was naturalized and living in Richmond, and Frank renamed herself after Lynda Carter, TV's ""Wonder Woman.""  Now 50, Frank wonders whether her five half-Vietnamese, half-Caucasian children ""will have the same country that we hoped to live in when we came here."" She left her job as a telecom consultant with a six-figure salary to be a full-time mom. ""I'm here,"" she said. ""I help shape my children."" Her kitchen is decorated with children's artwork, Bible verses, and portraits of saints and Jesus. Frank has instilled antiabortion values in her children from early on. Her youngest daughter, staying home from parochial school with a broken arm, whines; her arm itches and she's bored. ""Could you offer your suffering for the babies?"" Frank asks. ""So they won't get killed, Mom?"" the 7-year-old replies. ""Exactly,"" Frank says. She wants leaders who will reject abortion and lower taxes. She has helped put up Trump-Pence signs. She likes Trump's hard stance against illegal immigration and applauds his evolution into antiabortion beliefs. She worries that America no longer reflects her family's values. ""The last eight years, instead of empowering people, it's 'gimme, gimme, gimme,' "" she said. ""Everything is a race issue. Look, I'm an Asian. I'm ethnic. I'm a minority. I don't say, 'You need to give me a job because I'm Asian and a woman.' No.""                     ***     A barber ship displays a sign in support of Donald Trump. Some Americans worry that the country no longer reflects their values. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Carol Blaser sits in her Ford Mustang in the lot outside the hair salon where she works in Ann Arbor, Mich. She downs a McDonald's cheeseburger, worrying not about the election, but about her son, about his illness -- one that, as she said, ""nobody runs a 5k for.""  Her adult son is mentally ill, in and out of the justice system, 31 now, doing better with good medication. But she frets about him when her clients go on like the talking heads on cable news, yammering about ""low-information voters"" and ""the Paul Ryan effect."" Earlier that day, while cutting the hair of a homebound customer at his townhouse, the man's wife came into the living room to demonstrate their lifelong Democratic support by showing off a vintage 1990s T-shirt that read, ""Support Hillary's Husband."" ""I wish I was that sure,"" Blaser, 58, said later. ""One day I wake up and think I'm going to vote one way; one day I wake up and think I'm going to vote another."" Blaser hasn't spent the past year glued to the TV and Facebook following the twists and turns. She's been too busy with life. Two of her kids got married. Her daughter came out as a lesbian. Her 30-year-old's three kids had birthdays in October. And she's leaving Delia's Salon, where she has rented a chair for 16 years, because Delia raised the rent by $30, to $230 a week. Her neighborhood is dotted with Trump-Pence yard signs, and she considers herself conservative, but she voted for Obama twice after going for Republicans Bob Dole and George W. Bush. From what she can glean, Trump is an ""idiot about a lot of things,"" but Clinton is ""a conniving little b---h."" ""I'm leaning towards Hillary just because she's the least evil, but I don't know if she's evil or not,"" she said. ""I don't know! Do any of us really know what goes on, what they go through?"" Her absentee ballot sits on her counter, ""and I keep walking by it and looking at it. I want to fill it out and get it away from me, but I don't know what to do. This damn election.""

"   Heidi N. Moore is a digital-media strategy consultant based in New York and a former editor, columnist and reporter for publications including The Guardian U.S. and The Wall Street Journal.    Let's get one thing out of the way: Yes, Donald Trump makes a cameo appearance in Lucas Graves's new book on the importance of fact-checking, and no, it's not flattering. In this timely book, ""Deciding What's True: The Rise of Political Fact-Checking in American Journalism,"" Graves inevitably addresses Trump and his truthfulness. He notes that PolitiFact's judgments on the 2016 race found that only 5 percent of Trump's statements ranked more than ""Half-True"" by mid-2015, a far lower rate than any of his opponents. (His truthfulness hasn't changed much since then.)  Graves drily concludes that ""fact-checking appears to do a good job of catching out those politicians who exhibit a flagrant disregard for truth."" But he shies away from branding any politician a liar, noting that fact-checkers never use the term. ""This would require knowing someone's heart,"" he writes. He casts aspersions on very few people, and that civility offers a balm to the weary political soul this year.   As Graves traces the rise of fact-checking, he also illustrates the decline of political discourse into a steady drip of misinformation. Politicians are attached to their narratives, on which their careers depend. The traditional gatekeepers -- daily political journalists -- are, in his description, frequently hemmed in by their attachment to objectivity. These journalistic customs may be why Hillary Clinton, in each debate, referred viewers to live fact checks of her opponent run by her own staff. But the impact of fact-checking may be limited anyway because of the partisanship of readers who often prefer their Facebook feeds for news because they affirm their preexisting political opinions. In the 1980s, journalists fact-checked Ronald Reagan, ""who came to the White House with a well-established reputation for error and exaggeration,"" in Graves's words. Newspapers, particularly The Washington Post, truth-squadded every one of Reagan's news conferences until readers demonstrated so little concern that the paper backed off, according to former Post reporter Walter Pincus: ""It's up to the Democrats to catch people, not us. We would quote both sides.""    ""Deciding What's True: The Rise of Political Fact-Checking in American Journalism,"" by Lucas Graves (Columbia Univ.)  In 1992, however, the impulse came back: Major networks and newspapers launched teams to fact-check advertising in the presidential race between George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. By 2004, a George W. Bush administration official mocked a reporter for being part of the ""reality-based community,"" which he said was divorced from the political power of ""history's actors,"" who create their own realities. In 2012, Nobel Prize laureate Paul Krugman talked about the ""post-truth"" era of politics.  Some of the strongest opponents of political fact-checking are top editors and reporters who were trained in a determinedly objective practice of journalism, reporting both sides of an issue but taking neither. (The academic Jay Rosen has derided this as the ""view from nowhere."") Graves points out that then-New York Times editor Jill Abramson argued that fact-checking in a straight news article would cause readers to see the paper as a combatant, not an arbiter, in political battles. Graves acknowledges the uneasiness that journalists and fact-checkers alike have. Fact-checking was not intended ""to clean up politics,"" a goal that those involved in the process saw ""as obviously futile and possibily inappropriate,"" Graves writes.  But there's still an urge to free reporters of studious objectivity, Graves suggests. Journalism risks becoming less relevant the more it sticks to an unrealistic bird's-eye view that doesn't mediate events or interpret for the reader. ""Ultimately, the most lasting impact of the fact-checking movement may be in giving political reporters new license to embrace the muckraking, reformist impulse that is both so vital and so tenuous in professional journalism,"" Graves concludes.  One of the most important reasons for the news media to embrace some rabble-rousing is this: While journalists agonize over objectivity, who is left to bear witness? History needs a record of truth, though it doesn't really matter who provides it. ""No permanence, no perseverance in existence, can even be conceived of without men willing to testify to what is,"" Hannah Arendt wrote in her essay ""Truth and Politics."" In Graves's view, fact-checkers are the ones to police the political process. He focuses on the history of three outlets -- PolitiFact, FactCheck.org and The Post's Fact Checker -- but also includes nearly every other news outlet in his anecdotes. Fact-checkers work parallel to newsrooms: to keep both politicians and political journalists accountable, in Graves's view. He says that at the first fact-checking summit in 2014, many attendees ""saw themselves as political reformers."" But, interestingly, any organization demonstrating a clear political preference -- from Media Matters to Fox News -- is excluded from gatherings of fact-checkers, who regard themselves as nonpartisan. In some cases, fact-checker organizations and newspapers that maintain fact-checking editors and reporters forbid their staffers from any political involvement.  It's hard to envy the fact-checkers their work. Correcting the facts of history happens only with considerable discomfort on all sides: To his credit, Graves never pretends in this fairly brief book that fact-checking is easy. It's time-consuming; it encounters resistance from politicians, readers and journalists alike; and oh, by the way, no one can quite agree on what a fact is. ""Facts can be subjective,"" The Post's fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, tells Graves. The discussion of what constitutes a fact forms a big chunk of the book, and deservedly so: Nuance is the hardest part of fact-checking work. Another major problem with fact-checking that the book sidesteps is the burden on the reader. Google announced recently that it had created an algorithm to favor fact-checking pieces, but even so, readers not only have to read the news but then seek out fact checks of what they just read. It's a lot of work -- more than most people are willing to put in.  Another core problem is the power -- or lack of power -- of facts themselves. Since facts are subjective, their ability to change minds may be more limited than we think, particularly in elections like this one where fact checks -- fine, immaculate work by well-trained professionals -- have taken a back seat to the rush of emotion. Political campaigns rely on intangibles: charisma, credibility, communication style. As far as politics go, facts can't fix us.  Graves's book will appeal to those who are interested in politics and journalism and the intersection of the two, which is to say, the entirety of the Internet commenter class. For those looking for context and a sense of how we got here, it is a foundational work.
