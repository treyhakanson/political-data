The push into Nimrud was the most significant gain in several days for government forces, potentially opening up the area for teams to assess the damage done to the famed ruins just outside the town. Troops are converging from several fronts on Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and the biggest urban area under IS control, as part of an offensive launched last month. The special forces have advanced the farthest so far, and hold a handful of districts on the city's eastern edge, but their progress has slowed in the face of fierce resistance in dense urban neighborhoods full of civilians. The operation's commander said troops took Nimrud, some 19 miles (30 kilometers) south of Mosul, after heavy fighting. It was unclear if they had liberated the nearby 13th-century B.C. archaeological site, which IS destroyed with explosives according to videos they released.  ""The 9th division of the Iraqi army has liberated the town of Nimrud completely and raised the Iraqi flag over its buildings after the enemy suffered heavy casualties,"" Lt. Gen. Abdul-Amir Raheed Yar Allah said in a statement. The late 1980s discovery of treasures in Nimrud's royal tombs was one of the 20th century's most significant archaeological finds. The government said militants, who captured the site in June 2014, destroyed it the following year using heavy military vehicles. Video footage released by the jihadis at the time showed bearded men hammering, bulldozing and ultimately blowing up parts of the ancient Iraqi treasure, ripping down huge alabaster reliefs depicting Assyrian kings and deities. They claim the artefacts promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S.-led forces operating the air campaign assisting the operation against IS, said few airstrikes were used near Nimrud, and the advancing Iraqi troops had moved in carefully.  ""It's an important gain,"" he said, but warned that IS often leaves behind some combatants. ""As Iraqi forces get closer to Mosul, everything becomes more difficult as they like to leave behind a few fighters to spoil the advance."" In Mosul itself, the special forces said they have cleared the Qadisiya and Zahra neighborhoods, and are planning to advance farther in the coming hours. Over the past week they have inched forward slowly, trying to avoid casualties among their troops and civilians as suicide bombers in armor-plated vehicles charge at them from hideouts in densely populated areas.  ""The only weapons they have left are car bombs and explosives,"" said Iraqi special forces Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi as he radioed with commanders in the field. ""There are so many civilian cars and any one of them could be a bomb,"" he said. Troops were building berms and road blocks to prevent car bombs from breaching the front lines. Since last week's quick advance into Mosul proper, they have struggled to hold territory under heavy IS counterattacks. Several suicide car bombers attacked the advancing special forces on Saturday, wounding around a dozen troops, three civilians, and killing a child, officers said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to brief reporters. The Iraqi armed forces do not release official casualty figures, but field medics have noted dozens of killed and wounded since the operation to liberate the city began on Oct. 17. Civilians are paying a heavy toll in the battle for Mosul, with nearly 50,000 forced from their homes, most living in displaced persons camps. The Norwegian Refugee Council said Sunday that conditions were worsening for non-combatants, especially over the past week.  ""Civilians have told us of horrific stories from inside Mosul,"" said Wolfgang Gressmann, the group's Iraq director. ""They have given terrifying accounts of IS moving them from neighborhood to neighborhood, and from house to house, in tactics identical with being used as human shields."" Meanwhile, a leading U.S.-based rights group released a report alleging that security forces of Iraq's regional Kurdish government had routinely destroyed Arab homes and even some whole villages in areas retaken from the Islamic State group over the past two years. The Human Rights Watch report said that between September 2014 and May 2016, Kurdish forces advancing against IS destroyed Arab homes in disputed areas of Kirkuk and Ninevah provinces, while Kurdish homes were left intact. It says the demolitions took place in disputed areas in northern Iraq which the Kurds want to incorporate into their autonomous region over the objections of the central government. Sunni Arab politicians have previously accused the Kurds of seeking to recast the demographics of mixed areas in northern Iraq. The struggle is particularly intense in the oil-rich Kirkuk region.  ""In village after village in Kirkuk and Ninevah, (Kurdish Regional Government) security forces destroyed Arab homes -- but not those belonging to Kurds -- for no legitimate military purpose,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""KRG leaders' political goals don't justify demolishing homes illegally."" All sides fighting in the battle for Mosul have been accused of human rights abuses, with the worst allegations attributed to IS. Kurdish forces have been accused of destroying Arab homes before, with a report last year by Amnesty International alleging that the peshmerga carried out the attacks in retaliation for what they said was the Arab communities' support for IS. Kurdish authorities say they abide by human rights laws and deny having any strategy to destroy homes. But they say some villages in which the population fought alongside IS have suffered extensive destruction because of the ferocity of the battles.  ""There was a large presence of IEDs placed in these areas,"" said Kurdish official Dindar Zebari, referring to Sunday's report. ""I have to say this was a huge cause of the destruction following the liberation process."" Also Sunday, a wave of attacks in and around Baghdad killed at least 23 people and wounded 70 others, inflaming already combustive sectarian tensions in the country. Police and health officials said many of the attacks struck Shiites on their way to an annual pilgrimage, with the deadliest bombing taking place in Baghdad's northern Shaab neighborhood. There, an explosives-laden car parked near a checkpoint killed a policeman and two civilians, and wounded 12 others. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information. The capital has seen near-daily bombings since the Mosul operation began, but no large-scale attacks. Militants frequently target security forces and the Shiite majority as part of its campaign to destabilize the country. ___ Rohan reported from Baghdad.

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)  Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) picked up another high-profile supporter on Sunday in his expected bid to become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee: outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). ""My friend Keith Ellison is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things done,"" Reid said in a statement. ""Now is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the DNC. Now is the time for Keith."" Ellison is a favorite for the position among liberal advocacy groups and lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the runner-up in this year's Democratic presidential primaries. Reid's backing is the latest sign that support for Ellison is broad. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Reid's likely successor, endorsed Ellison for the job on Friday.   [What's next for Democrats? For starters, a battle for the soul of their party.]   The next chairman is scheduled to picked next year by DNC members across the country, who may or may not take their cue from elected officials. Besides Ellison, several other names have emerged as possible successors to interim chairwoman Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic operative who stepped in after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) announced her resignation in July. Among them is Howard Dean, a former Vermont governor, who is seeking to return to the job. He has argued that the party needs a full-time chairman with President-elect Donald Trump about to step into the White House. On Sunday, Ellison sidestepped a question about whether he would be willing to give up his post in Congress to better serve the party. ""The most important criteria for the DNC chair is going to be vision,"" Ellison said during an appearance on ABC News's ""This Week"" when asked whether he would resign his position in Congress. ""It's not about one person. It's about millions of people all working together to protect and advance the interests of working Americans."" Wasserman Schultz, who continued to serve in Congress during her DNC tenure, was driven from the position after a trove of hacked emails showed favoritism among DNC staff for Clinton over Sanders (Vt.) during the Democratic primaries. During the interview, Ellison also said the DNC needs to be more focused on building enthusiasm at the grass-roots level than on catering to the party's big donors. ""I love the donors, and we thank them, but it has to be the guys in the barbershop, the lady at the diner, the folks who are worried about whether that plant is going to close, they've got to be our focus,"" he said. ""That's how we come back.""   [Schumer throws his support behind Keith Ellison for DNC chairman]   Ellison is expected to make his bid official as early as Monday. Others who have said they are considering bids include former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison and Henry Munoz III, the DNC's national finance chairman. Another name being floated is Ilyse Hogue, a liberal activist who serves as president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, a reproductive rights advocacy organization. Several liberal groups have already started mobilizing behind Ellison. Sanders has started an online petition drive aimed at members of the DNC to show how much support there is for Ellison among the senator's backers.   [The decimation of the Democratic Party, visualized]   And Sunday, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a Clinton supporter during the primaries, announced that she is backing Ellison and sent a letter to members of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grass-roots group. In an interview Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he believes the next DNC chairman needs to be ""a committed progressive, somebody who's going to help get our message out."" Asked about Ellison, Booker said his ""is one of the names that's being bandied about that gives me hope and excitement."" But he added, ""There's going to be a process."" During his ABC interview, Ellison was also asked whether he thought the decision by FBI Director James B. Comey to make public additional scrutiny of Clinton's emails had cost her the election. ""I think that did not help,"" Ellison said. ""It certainly . . . changed the conversation."" ""The conversation should have been about middle-class people,"" he said. ""The conversation should have been about how to raise the minimum wage, strengthen Social Security, but then we start talking about this whole email stuff again."""

(Ethan Hyman/Raleigh News & Observer via AP)  Evangelist Franklin Graham said that prayer -- and God's answer to it -- helped Donald Trump and Mike Pence pull off ""the biggest political upset of our lifetime."" Graham, president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan's Purse, said he has traveled across the United States this year, holding prayer meetings at each state capitol. ""I could sense going across the country that God was going to do something this year,"" Graham told The Washington Post. ""And I believe that at this election, God showed up."" On Thursday, a day after Trump was elected to become the nation's 45th president, Graham said God had answered their prayers. ""Did God show up?"" he wrote on Facebook. ""In watching the news after the election, the secular media kept asking 'How did this happen?' 'What went wrong?' 'How did we miss this?' Some are in shock. Political pundits are stunned. Many thought the Trump/Pence ticket didn't have a chance. None of them understand the God-factor.""   [White evangelicals voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, exit polls show]   As The Washington Post's Sarah Pulliam Bailey reported: Exit polls show white evangelical voters voted in high numbers for Donald Trump, 81-16 percent, according to exit poll results. That's the most they have voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 2004, when they overwhelmingly chose President George W. Bush by a margin of 78-21 percent. Their support for Trump will likely be seen as part of the reason the GOP candidate performed unexpectedly well in Tuesday's election, according to Five Thirty Eight. Evangelical leaders from the religious right -- including Pat Robertson, Tony Perkins and Ralph Reed -- stood by Trump during a heated election season.

Back then, the scars of the Great Recession were still fresh. Joblessness was near 8 percent. Pay was flat. Europe faced a grave debt crisis that threatened to spread across the Atlantic. Now? The job market, with steady hiring and just 4.9 percent unemployment, has proved durable. Pay is finally accelerating. Auto sales are near a record pace. Housing is stronger. Europe's financial plight has stabilized. Yet the Americans who elected Trump are longing not just for change but for a reversal of the Obama era -- one that will ignite growth, slash taxes, restore lost factory jobs and curb most federal regulations. Problem is, the economy's most vexing problems -- from an aging workforce to listless productivity to weak corporate spending -- defy quick fixes. Trump has pledged an economic renaissance yet has avoided the broad policy prescriptions widely seen as necessary for managing a government. Well before the election, Trump's supporters came to distrust government data that pointed to a recovery and to question the interventions by the Federal Reserve to sustain growth. The economy's long-standing shift toward workers with college degrees left people without them stuck with dimmer job opportunities and stagnant wages -- a trend for which Trump blamed trade deals that he said led manufacturers to move overseas. Given his extravagant economic promises, the hotelier, real estate developer and TV celebrity faces an uphill challenge.  ""His lack of governing experience, potential difficulties building relationships with congressional leaders and inconsistent policy pronouncements during the race make it hard to predict his policy initiatives or his effectiveness in driving them through Congress,"" Mark Haefele and Thomas McLoughlin of UBS wrote in a note to investors. On the positive side, economists say they see no signs of the financial excesses or stalled consumer spending that often tip economies into recession. Yet with interest rates still near record lows, the Fed has little ammunition left to help should the economy weaken. If things sour, Trump's ""policy options will be constrained, perhaps historically so,"" said Patrick O'Keefe, director of economic research at the consulting firm CohnReznick. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, growth has averaged a subpar 2.2 percent a year. Yet at 89 months old, this is the fourth-longest of 33 recoveries from recession dating to 1858, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The Fed has signaled it's confident enough in the economy to resume raising short-term rates at its next meeting in mid-December. Late last year, the Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate from a record low after having kept it there for seven years to help rejuvenate the economy after the recession. It had been expected to follow this year with several more rate increases. But trouble overseas -- especially panic over a sharp slowdown in China, the world's No. 2 economy -- and a slump in U.S. growth put the central bank on hold. The economy has also been slowed by a strong dollar, which has made U.S. goods costlier overseas. Tepid business investment, partly resulting from cuts in the energy industry in response to low oil prices, has hurt, too. In the meantime, by historical standards, borrowing rates remain extraordinarily low. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.57 percent this week, not much above the record low of 3.31 percent. Many economists think super-low rates will remain in place for years, which is why they fret that there will be little room for the Fed to cut rates further to deliver stimulus in case of a recession. J.P. Morgan pegs the probability of a recession within the next three years at 66 percent.  ""The tools that in the past have been used to combat a recession or try to enhance a decelerating economy are already exhausted,"" O'Keefe says. It's possible, of course, that Trump and Congress will agree on some initiative that might help energize the economy -- on infrastructure spending, for example, or tax reform. For years, the economy has been hobbled by an older and slower-growing workforce and by lackluster gains in the productivity of its workers. The percentage of adults who either have a job or are looking for one has dropped from 66 percent when the Great Recession hit in December 2007 to 62.8 percent. Retirements by the vast generation of baby boomers are part of the reason. But another factor is that many working-age Americans have been forced to the sidelines as blue-collar factory jobs have vanished. Many other people have left the workforce to go on disability. Productivity -- output per hour of work -- fell for three straight quarters (for the first time since 1979) before rebounding in the July-September quarter. Rising productivity is vital to raising Americans' living standards because it allows businesses to pay employees more without having to raise prices. The productivity drought is a puzzle to economists. Most had expected technology to speed efficiency. One explanation is that the heart of the economy has been shifting from manufacturing, where automation has produced big productivity gains -- to services, where it hasn't. Another view is that America's deteriorating roads, ports and bridges are slowing shipping and commuting times and making the economy less efficient.  ""The economic cost is huge to having all those people sitting in cars and airplane tarmacs doing nothing,"" says Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For now, assuming that hiring remains solid with unemployment around historically normal levels, even tepid economic growth should manage to keep raising worker pay over the next couple of years, Harris says. Just don't expect the economy to strengthen. Growth won't likely rise much from its current listless pace of 1.5 percent to 2 percent a year, Harris says.  ""There will still be a sense of disappointment in the economy for the average person, because growth isn't going to get any better,"" he says. ""We've got to accept that 2 percent is good growth, not bad growth. That's the norm now."" ___ AP Economics Writer Josh Boak contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Chamberlain believes Trump is her savior, sent by God to save America from ruin. She owns a women's clothing store in this modest town; her husband runs a construction company. They have two children and barely get by on $44,000 a year, living paycheck to paycheck. In his victory speech, Trump called people like Chamberlain and her family America's ""forgotten men and women"" -- the blue-collar workers in the manufacturing towns of the Rust Belt and the hollowing coalfields of Appalachia who propelled him to an improbable victory. They felt left behind by progress, laughed at by the elite, and so put their faith in the billionaire businessman with a sharp tongue and short temper who promised to Make America Great Again. When Trump first ran, Chamberlain thought to herself: ""That's the man everybody has been praying for."" And she now feels vindicated by his victory.  ""This is a movement,"" she said. ""This isn't a candidate anymore. This is a movement."" Not all of Trump's support came from the blue-collar downtrodden. But the Republican's overwhelming backing among whites with less than a college education is at least partly a reflection of how little the economic recovery since the Great Recession has benefited them. Their job opportunities have dwindled and their incomes have fallen, even as broader measures of the nation's job market show improvement. But they also turned to him to hold back the tide of social change: same-sex marriage, transgender rights, a society growing more racially diverse. The white working class, long ignored, found an unlikely spokesman in Trump. He promised to build the wall to keep out immigrants. He promised to tear up trade deals that have ushered American factory jobs overseas. He promised to put blue-collar America back to work and restore the country to a time when white workers felt appreciated and fulfilled.  ""I feel like, not just most, but all Trump supporters are true patriots,"" said 59-year-old Ginger Austin, who owns a graphics company in a tiny town in Jones County, one of the poorest places in North Carolina. ""They love this country. But they're taking our country away, and they're changing it. They're just changing everything. All our rights are just slowly being dwindled away."" She's angry at the Republican Party she has supported all her life. She is angry at Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act. She is angry that America is changing, and worried that her grandchildren are growing up in a world too liberal and too politically correct. The nation awoke Wednesday morning to learn just how starkly divided it has grown: Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by less than 200,000 ballots. But Trump won battleground states that had voted for Obama twice. Thousands of registered Democrats, including many former union workers from the mines and factories, crossed party lines and sided with Trump. For example, in Dunn County, where Shay Chamberlin lives, Obama beat Mitt Romney 53 percent to 46 percent in 2012, and John McCain 57 percent to 42 percent four years earlier. But it flipped to back Donald Trump, 52 percent to 41 percent, over Clinton. Scott Hiltgen, a 66-year-old small business owner in Wisconsin, called Washington a ""cesspool"" of career politicians, aware of and indifferent to the plight of the American worker.  ""We are considered flyover country, as you well know, and they don't care about us,"" he said. ""And I think it was the silent majority that finally said, 'Enough's enough. We want a change. We don't like the way things are going.'"" Middle-aged white men with only high school degrees -- the core of Trump's support -- saw their inflation-adjusted incomes plummet 9 percent from 1996 through 2014, according to Sentier Research, a data analytics firm founded by former Census Bureau officials. White male college graduates in the same age bracket, by contrast, saw their incomes jump 23 percent. The Great Recession wiped out millions of middle-income jobs in manufacturing, office administrative work and construction, and those jobs haven't returned, even as the nation now has 6.5 million more jobs than it did before the recession began. In many parts of the country, they have been replaced with lower-income work in restaurants, hotels, and in home health care. This ""hollowing out"" of the nation's economy has left many Americans with high school degrees feeling shut out of the middle class. Jerry Blackburn, a retired county official in rural Virginia, said he feels like people from someplace else took all they could from him and his neighbors and then left them with nothing.  ""They took our coal out of here and everybody got rich on it. And what did we get?"" he asked. ""We got black lung. We don't have good water to drink, we don't have roads, we don't have anything except a bunch of broken down old coal miners that's forgotten. But everybody else got rich on us."" On Wednesday morning, miners streamed into a convenience store on a highway between one struggling, West Virginia coal town and another. From behind the counter, manager Mary Jones recognized something she hadn't heard in years: hope. They talked about jobs returning to this broken-down county. They talked about a chance at a brighter future. They talked about Donald Trump.  ""I think we sent a message to Washington that we're tired of them sitting up there doing nothing to help the working-class people,"" said Jones, a native of Wyoming County, where the collapse of the coal industry has left behind a string of tumbledown houses and a quarter of families in poverty. Coal trucks used to barrel by all day and the parking lot stayed full. No trucks come by anymore. The store is for sale. She's not sure she'll have a job much longer and is certain she won't find another. They struggle to make enough money to pay the bills and write the paychecks. She considers the ballot she cast for Trump as a protest against Clinton and every other member of the political elite.  ""Working-class people built this country and now the working class people have been forgotten,"" she said. ""It's about time they paid attention."" But in West Virginia, Jones worries that the working class is too far gone to be saved.  ""There's some things you can do as a president. And there's something you can't. They all make promises, I just don't know how he can keep all those promises,"" she said. ""I feel more hopeful today than I have in a long time. But I'm still scared for the future."" ____ AP Economics Reporter Chris Rugaber contributed from Little Rock, Arkansas, Alex Sanz from Maysville, North Carolina, Pauline Arrillaga from Phoenix and Claire Galofaro from Pineville, West Virginia.

6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/10/when-the-white-house-changes-hands-its-a-dangerous-time-in-foreign-policy/	When the White House changes hands, it is a dangerous time in foreign policy	"   The presidential seal is placed on a podium. (Charles Dharapak/AP)  As President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump meet today to discuss the upcoming changing of the guard, it's a good moment to note that presidential transitions are precarious moments for U.S. foreign policy. Outgoing, lame-duck presidents tend to channel their remaining energies into ambitious (and sometimes ill-advised) foreign policy agendas. New administrations, however, are ""ugly ducklings"" lacking the experience to manage the fallout -- even when the new president has already been intimately involved in foreign policy, as we'll show below. That combination has repeatedly caused problems. At best, allies and adversaries can be unnerved and disoriented by the resulting U.S. policy inconsistencies. At worst, lives can be lost in foreign policy crises. Lame ducks, constrained at home, throw themselves into ambitious foreign policy agendas The Obama administration has been on a foreign policy tear. In the past year alone, Obama has signed the Iran disarmament deal, reached the climate change accord, signed the Kigali Amendment phasing out hydrofluorocarbon emissions (HFCs) and finalized a free-trade agreement in East Asia. While some commentators have decried these actions as overreach, such late flurries of foreign policy activity are actually typical of administrations preparing to leave office. New research by one of the author's of this post shows that presidents in their last year are far more likely to engage personally in diplomatic initiatives, sign international agreements and use force abroad, than in years prior. In other words, unilateral foreign policy is straight out of the lame duck playbook. This happens for a few reasons. As an administration's remaining time in office wanes, the opposition's incentives to wait it out increase and even the president's co-partisans in Congress tend to become less loyal. The president's policy clout get more and more constrained, which can be seen in how rarely the his positions on legislation prevail. Consider what's happened -- or hasn't -- since the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Obama still had a about year in office when Scalia's seat was vacated. He nominated Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. appeals court for the District of Columbia, to fill it almost eight months before the election. The Republican-dominated Senate has refused to consider the appointment on the grounds that Obama is a lame duck. There is essentially nothing that he can do about it. What then is an ambitious president to do? Naturally, administrations try to leave a strong legacy and bind their successors' hands where they still have some influence: abroad. This comes at a cost. Decision-making gets rushed. Outgoing presidents often launch complex and risky foreign policy initiatives that they don't have time to see through. For instance, Bill Clinton started an 11th hour effort on the Arab-Israeli peace process at the July 2000 Camp David Summit. Similarly, in the short time between losing the election and leaving office, George H.W. Bush committed thousands of ground troops in Somalia. Gen. Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that Americans would be ""clear of this operation in a few months,"" a prediction which did not hold true. Ugly ducklings -- even the most experienced ones -- aren't fully ready to manage U.S. relationships with the rest of the world  For their part, new presidents tend to be poorly positioned to clean up the messes that lame ducks leave behind -- this was certainly true for the incoming Clinton administration, which struggled and then withdrew from Somalia. They have campaign promises to fulfill, a brand new administration to manage, and prefer to work on domestic policy early in their term. Consider, for instance, what Obama did with his early electoral mandate. He poured his energy into Obamacare, often at the expense of lofty foreign policy expectations. As a result, most work only sporadically and ineffectively on foreign policy. Research by Phil Potter suggests that new administrations suffer for their inexperience. Early-term presidential administrations get into far more foreign policy crises than they do later on. The combination of reckless lame ducks and unprepared ugly ducklings can have serious consequences. For instance, President John F. Kennedy's early troubles in Cuba really started when his predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, reluctantly authorized the CIA to plan an invasion -- but on the way out the door failed to inform Kennedy of his own ambivalence about the operation. The result was a debacle at the Bay of Pigs, which arguably emboldened the Soviet actions and contributed to the Cuban missile crisis. Campaign promises and rhetoric can also lead a new administration into trouble as it tries to shift into handling the realities of the U.S.'s strategic positions. For instance, it's a time-honored American tradition to demonize China on the campaign trail, only to cooperate once in office. The historical record suggests that Trump's personal foreign policy inexperience will be compounded by the disorganization and inconsistencies that come from starting up a new administration. He will need to contend with missing appointees and undeveloped management structures. Consider that George H.W. Bush, the man with the ""golden resume"" that included time as vice president and a stint running the CIA, failed to deftly handle his first foreign policy crisis, in which a disorganized Bush White House failed to oust Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega. As Bush's national security adviser Brent Scowcroft said in a Miller Center interview, ""We did not act very decisively. This was our first crisis. We didn't do particularly well."" How then could the U.S. better manage these hazardous transitions? One possibility would be to change the way appointments work for key national security positions. Kennedy once said that during ""the next major change of administration ... secretaries of state ... should be nominated first and should work for two months ... in between, next to the man they're succeeding. Otherwise, you have this dangerous interim gap for three months."" Overlap of this sort would help preserve institutional knowledge and make policy continuity possible. We've seen variants of this approach. The incoming Obama administration, for example, kept Robert Gates as defense secretary, which considerably eased the wartime transition in 2009. Second, steps could be taken to increase the pace and decrease the politicization of political appointments. Foreign policy teams need to be assembled expeditiously. Recent administrations have gone increasingly long periods of time with many unfilled appointments, especially at lower levels that are outside public scrutiny but must still be approved by Congress. This strips the foreign policy team of vitality and leadership at precisely the moment it can least afford it. The corollary, of course, is that these men and women also need to be properly vetted experts rather than politically connected fundraisers. Third, new presidents can use the inaugural address, the first speech to a joint session of Congress and early travels abroad to make foreign policy positions clear. This would help reduce foreign leaders' confusion as they try to understand which U.S. policies will continue and which will change. All democracies are built on regular transitions of power. These transitions present particular challenges for foreign policy. Given what we know, we can assume that the next several months may be a bumpy ride.

Jenny Daley, of South Kingstown, tells The Westerly Sun (http://bit.ly/2eNHRUL ) that she woke up Wednesday and needed a hug and figured a lot of other people did, too. So the 31-year-old restaurant worker headed to downtown Westerly with a sign that said, ""Need a hug today? They are free. Just ask."" Daley says she did not want to ""spend the whole day in fear"" so she decided to show love to as many people as she could. Daley gave out hugs to several people, including some who told her stories about their lives, and one woman who stopped and gave her an umbrella after it began to drizzle. ___ Information from: The Westerly Sun, http://www.thewesterlysun.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Roughly 160,000 people had cast ballots as of about noon Tuesday, according to state elections commissioner Elaine Manlove. That's in addition to about 24,000 Delawareans who voted earlier by absentee ballot. The combined totals represent more than a fourth of the roughly 675,600 registered voters in Delaware, a solidly blue state where almost half of registered voters are Democrats. Regardless of the winners, the election will significantly alter Delaware's political landscape, with voters electing a new congressional representative, governor and lieutenant governor, as well as new leaders of the state's two largest local governments. Balloting in state House and Senate races also will define the balance of power in the General Assembly, where Republicans are hoping to end years of Democratic rule and regain control of the Senate. But the presidential race between Republican Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was foremost in the minds of many voters. Michelle Koam, 51, who is registered as unaffiliated, said she didn't know much about the statewide races but voted for Clinton because she is concerned about how immigrants would fare under a Trump administration.  ""We don't know what's going to happen,"" said Koam, a Korean immigrant who owns a supermarket with a substantial Hispanic clientele Abigmael Torres, 39, of Houston. Torres, a stay-at-home dad with two daughters, voted for Trump as part of a straight Republican ticket.  ""I think he's going to do an awesome job being president,"" said Torres, who served as a Marine. ""He's a little loudmouthed, yes. ... I'm looking for a president that's gonna make America great, like he says he is. We need somebody to make use strong again. No other countries respect us anymore."" Unlike the presidential contest, the election campaigns in Delaware have been mostly civil.  ""This is the way it's supposed to work,"" Democratic congressman John Carney Jr. said during a recent gubernatorial debate with Republican state Sen. Colin Bonini, who described Carney as a friend and ""a smart guy."" Carney, a former state finance secretary and lieutenant governor, was making a second run for governor, having lost a 2008 Democratic primary to then-treasurer Jack Markell. Carney went on to be elected as Delaware's lone representative in the U.S. House in 2010. But after the death of former Attorney General Beau Biden, whom Carney had planned to support in the 2016 governor's race, Carney decided to give up the congressional seat and run himself. Bonini, meanwhile, was making a second bid for statewide office, having narrowly lost the state treasurer's race in 2010. Former state labor secretary Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Democrat, was poised to make history in her congressional race against Republican Hans Reigle, an aviation instructor and former military pilot who served as a small-town councilman and mayor in Kent County. With a victory Tuesday, Rochester would become the first black and first woman to serve in Delaware's congressional delegation. In another statewide race, Democratic state Sen. Bethany Hall-Long of Middletown faced Republican businessman La Mar Gunn of Dover, president of the Central Delaware branch of the NAACP, in a contest to fill the vacant lieutenant governor's seat. Tuesday's other statewide contest was the insurance commissioner's race, which pitted Democrat Trinidad Navarro, currently the New Castle County sheriff, against Republican businessman Jeff Cragg, who lost the 2012 gubernatorial race to Markell. All 41 state House seats and 11 of 21 Senate seats were on the ballot, although many incumbent lawmakers, most of them Democrats, face no opposition. Voters also were choosing a new mayor in Wilmington and new chief executive of New Castle County, both Democratic strongholds where incumbents were defeated in September primaries.
