Not even having his team knocked out of the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division race could ruin his day. Dobbs threw three touchdown passes and ran for two more scores -- including a career-long 70-yarder -- as Tennessee won a 63-37 shootout with Missouri on Saturday.  ""I definitely had a blast,"" Dobbs said. ""It's not really an end. We obviously still have a couple of games left, but it's an enjoyable opportunity and I definitely enjoyed it tonight."" Tennessee's hopes of reaching the SEC championship game vanished when No. 21 Florida upset No. 16 LSU 16-10 earlier Saturday to clinch its second straight SEC East title.  ""There's still a lot to play for,"" Dobbs said. ""Our legacy's on the line, how we want to leave Tennessee."" Dobbs was 15 of 22 for 223 yards Saturday with two touchdown passes to Jauan Jennings and one to Josh Malone. He rushed for a career-high 190 yards on just 10 carries. He even helped lead Tennessee's Pride of the Southland band after the game. It was an impressive farewell to Neyland Stadium for a guy who has served as the face of Tennessee's program while balancing his quarterback responsibilities with his academic demands as an aerospace engineering major.  ""I'm not very political, but he could be the president of the United States if he wanted to,"" Tennessee coach Butch Jones said. The Vols (8-3, 4-3 SEC) won despite allowing 740 yards in total offense, the highest single-game total ever by a Tennessee opponent. Troy gained 721 yards in a 55-48 loss to Tennessee in 2012. Damarea Crockett rushed for 225 yards and Ish Witter gained 163 yards to lead a 420-yard rushing attack for Missouri (3-8, 1-6). The Tigers gained 600-plus total yards for the fourth time this season.  ""Offensively that's a pretty good day,"" Missouri coach Barry Odom said. ""I didn't have enough answers defensively to put us there to win it."" Crockett had the second-highest single-game rushing total ever by a Tennessee opponent. Mississippi's Dexter McCluster rushed for 282 yards against Tennessee in 2009. Tennessee's John Kelly rushed for 101 yards and a touchdown. Alvin Kamara ran for 55 yards and two scores. The Vols were clinging to a 35-30 lead when Dobbs made a move around Missouri's Thomas Wilson at the line of scrimmage and raced for a 70-yard touchdown with 13:20 remaining. Tennessee took command from there. THE TAKEAWAY Missouri: The Tigers' season-long kicking woes hurt them again Saturday. Missouri missed an extra-point attempt for the sixth time this season at the end of the Tigers' first series. Missouri also had gone 5 of 12 on field-goal attempts this season before Saturday. The Tigers' kicking game has struggled so much that they decided to go for it rather than attempting a field goal while facing fourth-and-12 from the Tennessee 20 early in the second quarter. After Missouri was penalized for a false start, the Tigers still kept their offense on the field to try converting the first down on fourth-and-17 from the 25. The drive ended with an incomplete pass. Tennessee: The Vols' defense remains extremely vulnerable, particularly against the run. Missouri put up huge numbers against Tennessee one week after the Vols allowed 443 yards rushing in a 49-36 victory over Kentucky. Tennessee also gave up 353 yards rushing to Texas A&M and 409 to Alabama this season.  POLL IMPLICATIONS  This win could help Tennessee get back into the Top 25. The Vols, who have been ranked as high as ninth this year, fell out of the rankings after an Oct. 29 loss at South Carolina. Tennessee was fourth in the ""also receiving votes"" section of the AP poll this week but was 19th in the College Football Playoff rankings. KEY STATS Tennessee has won three straight games and has scored over 40 points in all of them. This marks the first time since 1995 that the Volunteers have scored 40-plus points in three consecutive games. ... Crockett now has rushed for 1,062 yards this season, the most ever by a Missouri freshman. UP NEXT Missouri hosts Arkansas on Friday. Tennessee is at Vanderbilt on Saturday. ___ More AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 ___ Follow Steve Megargee at www.twitter.com/stevemegargee Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   One out of every 40 people in America lives in New York City. The area's population is 8.4 million, more than in 39 other states. For every vote cast for Donald Trump in the city last Tuesday, more than four were cast for Hillary Clinton; she earned 79 percent of the vote. In the wake of Trump's victory, thousands of protesters crowded the streets of Manhattan (where Trump got fewer votes than he did on Staten Island, where the population is a third smaller) outside Trump Tower. It's hard to know how many were there, but let's assume it was 5,000 people. That would mean that a fraction of a percent of the city took time to ride the train in and make their voices heard, assuming no one came in from anywhere else. Protests of thousands of people in New York really aren't that uncommon, which could have been a reasonable thing to point out if you wanted to brush the event away. That's not the angle that Trump and his supporters took. Instead, the president-elect and his backers decided to dismiss the protests in New York and other cities -- cities that contain hundreds of thousands of people who mostly voted against Trump -- as being the work of ""paid protesters."" In a tweet, Trump decided that the ""professional protesters,"" in his formulation, were also ""incited by the media,"" which doesn't make much sense.      Nationwide protests have gripped many cities for days following the presidential election as thousands march against Donald Trump's victory. Trump tweeted to condemn ""professional protesters, incited by the media."" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)     [A complicated past lies behind Portland's violent protests]   Before we debunk the sketchy rumors about anti-Trump protesters being paid, let's be up front about why this is a useful argument for Trump and his supporters to make. Donald Trump will enter the White House with very few checks on his power. He has a Congress controlled by members of his own party, save for a clutch of Democrats in the Senate who can use the filibuster to stand in his way -- unless the filibuster is eliminated. The executive branch has gobbled up more power for itself over the past decade and a half, and Trump will find little disincentive to maintain and expand that process. Unless Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) suddenly feels stunningly magnanimous toward the outgoing administration, Trump will get to appoint a Supreme Court justice in the first few months of his presidency, reestablishing a conservative majority on the bench that will, in most cases, presumably side with Trump's political philosophy. The main obstacles to Trump are twofold. The first is the plurality of voters who opposed his candidacy and view him skeptically. The second is a news media that reports accurately on the conflicts between what he says and reality. And that's why Trump wants to undercut them.   [Kellyanne Conway: It's up to Clinton, Obama to calm anti-Trump protesters]   In his interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes"" broadcast Sunday, Trump dismissed the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by insisting that his victory was a cakewalk, that he ""won it easily. I mean I won easily. That was big, big."" That same day, he tweeted repeatedly about how badly the New York Times was losing subscribers because of its ""BAD coverage"" of him. (In reality, the Times gained subscribers at a rapid clip.) But let's return to the protests. The idea that the protesters were paid has been a recurring theme among Trump backers, pointing to various, nebulous reports as proof. RT.com, the outlet founded by Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary, cites a news release from the liberal political activist group MoveOn as proof of a link back to billionaire George Soros (who has funded the group). Others have pointed to Craigslist ads suggesting jobs to ""STOP TRUMP."" A story at the pro-Trump site ZeroHedge that was picked up by the Drudge Report shows a video recording a line of buses in Chicago, suggesting that the buses were used to bring people in from Wisconsin to protest Trump. Think about that. Trump won Wisconsin. Someone needed to bus people in from Milwaukee (population: 600,000) to protest in Chicago (population: 2.7 million)? There's no evidence offered that the line of buses has anything to do with the protests, mind you. And a quick glance at Google Street View, captured in October, reveals that there's always a line of buses in that same place.     There was one report from last spring suggesting that people from MoveOn were behind a protest in Chicago and that protesters had been paid $16 an hour to attend. That unsubstantiated report came from longtime Trump ally Roger Stone, who has been known to share misinformation in the past. There are clearly progressive organizations that are hoping to use Trump's election as a tool for organizing. Advocacy groups often hire staff to help organize activities around elections, which appears to be what those Craigslist ads are for. The phone number on several that were passed around link back to the Community Outreach Group, which was mostly hiring for campaign work. MoveOn is certainly hoping to leverage the current moment to its advantage, which includes trying to raise funds from Trump's win, as its main webpage suggests. Yes, it supports the protests and encourages its members to participate; that's organizing. That said, the idea that money pours into progressive groups so that they can hire folks to dispatch around the country lacks any grounding in reality. But it has captured the imagination of the right, bolstered by websites friendly to the president-elect. Trump benefited over the course of the campaign from the idea that the mainstream media wasn't trustworthy and that conspiracy theories articulated by friendly websites and distributed by the Drudge Report reflected reality. It has been enormously helpful to him, increasing people's uncertainty about what is and isn't true -- helpful for a politician who doesn't always embrace accuracy.   Trump: ""we have to crush the biased media."" [Elevates former head of media outlet that went 100% in tank for him.] -- (((Popehat))) (@Popehat) November 14, 2016   There's simply no credible evidence that the opposition to Trump is spurred by anything other than legitimate concern about what his presidency might entail. Such concern could and does stem from accurate reporting by objective media outlets. Trump has a choice: He could accept that a large chunk of the country -- including his own hometown -- is frustrated at the prospect of his presidency, and work to build their trust and respect. Or he could wave it all away as being contrived and part of a grand conspiracy against him. Which path he chooses moving forward will define what sort of leader he hopes to be."

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)  President Obama will hold a news conference Monday afternoon to take measure of last week's election results, before holding a conference call with congressional Democrats who are still reeling from Donald Trump's White House win. The two events come just a few hours before Obama departs for his last trip as president to Europe, where he will visit Greece and Germany before going to Peru for this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference. Trump's victory is sure to dominate Obama's interactions with reporters and foreign leaders in the coming week. On Tuesday the president will meet with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, before departing Wednesday for Berlin. During his stop in Germany, he will meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. At the end of the week Obama will head to Lima, Peru, where he will attend meetings with heads of state from Asia and Latin America. The president will cover a variety of topics during his travels, including the global economy, counterterrorism, the sanctions Western nations have imposed against Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, and instability in the Mideast and the refugee crisis that has emerged in its wake.   [On his last European trip, Obama confronts the refugee crisis that has embroiled the continent]   ""Look, we certainly expect that the election will be the primary topic on people's minds everywhere we go,"" said White House deputy security adviser Ben Rhodes in a call with reporters Friday, adding that ""we have one president at a time, and so President Obama, of course, will be running through the tape on January 20th"" on his top international and domestic priorities. ""We will run through the tape with the implementation of those policies, and then the new team will make their own determinations,"" Rhodes said. ""And we respect that every administration will make its own judgment.""

EU foreign ministers made the move at talks in Brussels Monday against those ""responsible for the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria, benefiting from or supporting the regime, and/or being associated with such persons."" The list includes 13 cabinet members and four ministers of state. It brings to 234 the total number of people subject to a travel ban and an asset freeze for repression against civilians in Syria. __ 2:35 p.m. European Union foreign ministers have given the green light to draw up a new agreement on closer ties with the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. At talks in Brussels Monday, the ministers adopted a mandate for the European Commission and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to negotiate the pact. The agreement would replace a partnership accord between the two dating from 1996 and ""should better take account of the shared objectives and challenges"" they now face, a statement said. The aim is to ""provide a solid basis for long-term relations"" with oil and gas-rich Azerbaijan, which lies on the Caspian Sea and neighbors Georgia, Russia, Armenia and Iran. ___ 2:05 p.m. European Union foreign ministers have reaffirmed their support for the Iran nuclear agreement, which U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has branded the ""worst deal in the world"" and vowed to renegotiate. The ministers say Monday that ""the European Union reiterates its resolute commitment"" to the plan that EU heavyweights Britain, France and Germany, along with the U.S., China and Russia, agreed upon with Iran. It includes lifting ""nuclear related economic and financial sanctions and engaging with the private sector and economic operators, especially banks, to promote growth in trade and investment."" While campaigning, Trump called the pact agreed last year a ""lopsided disgrace"" and railed against its time-limited restrictions on Iran's enrichment of uranium and other nuclear activity. But Trump's exact plans are vague, and renegotiating a deal Iran is already happy with would be difficult. ___ 11:45 a.m. Poland's foreign minister says U.S. President-elect Donald Trump doesn't add to the European Union's existing problems. Witold Waszczykowski spoke following informal dinner talks that EU foreign ministers held Sunday in Brussels to discuss prospects for trans-Atlantic ties under Trump. He said that ""regardless of whether we see Donald Trump as a person who is not an angel, he isn't a child with special needs either that would require special relations, special discussions."" Members of Poland's conservative ruling Law and Justice party believe bilateral ties will strengthen under Trump's presidency. Waszczykowski said it was a ""bit exaggerated"" for the EU to be having discussions about relations with the U.S. under Trump. He said that ""Europe has many problems, but definitely not with America."" ___ 11:25 a.m. Britain's foreign secretary says Donald Trump's U.S. presidency could be a ""moment of opportunity"" for Europe, even as other EU diplomats worry about Trump's isolationist, protectionist promises. Boris Johnson spoke Monday before EU foreign ministers' talks in Brussels. The top diplomats held a special meeting Sunday night about the U.S. election, and they hope to boost Europe's role in world affairs until Trump's plans become clearer. Johnson, who championed Britain's exit from the EU, said Trump ""is a deal maker and I think that could be a good thing for Britain, but it can also a good thing for Europe. I think that's what we need to focus on today."" Other foreign ministers said Europe should focus on boosting its own defense, tensions with Turkey and war in Syria. ___ 9:55 a.m. European Union foreign ministers are trying to reach a common stance on Turkey over the government crackdown on political opponents and the media. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said she and the ministers would strive Monday for ""a common, united position on developments in Turkey."" Turkey and the EU have been locked in a war of words over Ankara's commitment to democracy and rule of law in the wake of the failed coup in the country in July. The crackdown has raised questions about Turkey's EU membership prospects. EU officials say it's time for Ankara to say whether it really wants to join, but Mogherini said the future of membership wouldn't be on the table at Monday's talks in Brussels.

Well, I will certainly agree that the rights of people can be distinguished in many ways from the rights of states. Humans have human rights directly, for instance; organizations of humans (whether states or corporations or churches or newspapers or advocacy groups) would have similar rights only derivatively of the humans' rights. But if you're speaking of the English word ""right,"" it has long been used to refer to legal or moral entitlements of states (and nations) -- as well as of government branches -- and not just of individuals. Federalist No. 46 refers to ""the rights of the individual States."" Federalist No. 43: ""Whenever the States may choose to substitute other republican forms, they have a right to do so."" No. 43 also speaks of the federal government's power with respect to states: ""Insurrections in a State will rarely induce a federal interposition, unless the number concerned in them bear some proportion to the friends of government.... The existence of a right to interpose, will generally prevent the necessity of exerting it."" Federalist No. 51 discusses the rights of branches of government; so does Federalist No. 77.  Early Supreme Court cases likewise speak of the rights of nations and of states. In M'Culloch v. Maryland (1819), for instance, Justice Marshall says, among other things, ""The Government which has a right to do an act and has imposed on it the duty of performing that act must, according to the dictates of reason, be allowed to select the means."" ""The Government which has a right to do an act and has imposed on it the duty of performing that act must, according to the dictates of reason, be allowed to select the means."" ""The people of a State, therefore, give to their Government a right of taxing themselves and their property."" ""[T]he means employed by the Government of the Union have no such security, nor is the right of a State to tax [those means] sustained by the same theory."" ""We have a principle which is safe for the States and safe for the Union. We are relieved, as we ought to be, from clashing sovereignty; from interfering powers; from a repugnancy between a right in one Government to pull down what there is an acknowledged right in another to build up; from the incompatibility of a right in one Government to destroy what there is a right in another to preserve."" I could offer many more examples. [UPDATE: I added the M'Culloch quotes, just to illustrate my assertion about early Supreme Court cases.] Might it be better if English speakers drew sharper distinctions among categories of legal or moral entitlements? Maybe. Maybe it would be better if we didn't use the same word (""right"") for the rights of individuals, the rights of nongovernmental private organizations and the rights of governments. Maybe it would be better if we didn't use it both for positive rights (entitlements to affirmative help) as for negative rights (entitlements not to be restricted). Maybe it would be better if we didn't use it both for legal and moral rights, or both for rights against the government and rights against other citizens. Yet today, the word ""right,"" as an English word, does often refer to all such things, including in sophisticated legal and political writing; and it has done so for centuries. You can talk about the difference between how we should treat individuals' and states' claims of entitlement. But I see no basis for claiming that, as a linguistic or logical matter, Madison, Hamilton and lots of other people were wrong in how they used the English language on this score."

6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/11/there-is-basically-no-hope-for-bipartisanship-under-president-trump/	There is basically no hope for unity under President Trump	"   President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on Thursday. (Michael Reynolds/EPA)  After a false start, Donald Trump went presidential Friday. Hours after lashing out at ""professional protesters"" on Twitter on Thursday night, he changed course. The nation was headed for unity, he said: ""We will all come together and be proud!"" The sentiment echoed the expressed wishes of both President Obama and Hillary Clinton in recent days. Both issued calls for working together. To which I present: A wet blanket. It's just not at all likely to happen -- and especially not with Trump. Some of this unity talk is perfunctory, of course. The losers of presidential races are supposed to be gracious, as are the winners. So far, both have been, generally speaking -- at least, when speaking publicly to or about each other. Both sides express a desire to do what the American people say they want, which is for lawmakers to get along, work together and accomplish things. The issue, of course, is: That's not what the American people want. Not really. If the last decade-plus has shown us anything, it's that we live in an increasingly polarized country in which there is little incentive -- and generally much more disincentive -- to work across the aisle. This has been driven home especially during the Obama presidency. Now-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in 2010 that the GOP's No. 1 goal was to make Obama a one-term president. The party appeared to make a calculated decision that it would stand resolutely in the way of most everything Obama did. And in retrospect, it looks like sound political strategy. No, the GOP didn't unseat Obama in 2012, but it did make big gains in the 2010 and 2014 midterms, registering unprecedented power over American politics at every level beneath president. And then the GOP won the presidency and a record number of governorships in 2016. Mission accomplished. Or, at the very least, that's the message they'll take away from all of it. Enter Donald Trump. For all that Hillary Clinton and other Democrats express the desire to give him a chance, it's just not in the cards. Trump has proposed some of the most far-right policies put forward by a Republican candidate in history, and now he has a chance to implement them with a fully Republican-controlled Congress. There will certainly be some discussions about exactly what Republicans want to pursue in a Trump presidency -- and perhaps some disagreements among Republicans themselves -- but Democrats are now in the position of being a full-on opposition party. Their only saving grace is the filibuster in the Senate, which effectively requires 60 votes to pass something, even as Republicans stand at 52 seats. But this is a campaign in which Democrats have regularly accused Trump of appealing to bigotry, racism, sexism and Islamophobia -- and even being each of those adjectives himself. How can they now support him in basically anything? The moment he proposes a hard-line plan to deal with illegal immigration, Democrats will be incensed. The moment he proposes admitting no refugees from Syria, they'll be incensed. The moment he moves to repeal Obamacare, they'll accuse him of opposing popular proposals like covering pre-existing conditions and of wanting to take away people's health-care coverage. It'll be very hard to create unity after all of that -- especially given Trump has little incentive to moderate now. And indeed, there are already Democrats who aren't even putting up the veneer of giving him a chance. Here's the blistering statement outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) just put out: If this is going to be a time of healing, we must first put the responsibility for healing where it belongs: at the feet of Donald Trump, a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate. Winning the electoral college does not absolve Trump of the grave sins he committed against millions of Americans. Donald Trump may not possess the capacity to assuage those fears, but he owes it to this nation to try. If Trump wants to roll back tide of hate he unleashed, he has a tremendous amount of work to do and he must begin immediately. And here's Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the potential next chairman of the Democratic National Committee who is both black and a Muslim:   1st, take Trump at his hate-filled word; 2nd, if his campaign hate was just hype, then that alone is despicable. I wouldn't bet on #2. -- Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) November 10, 2016   Should Trump pursue anything like the plan he has outlined on the campaign trail, there is no way that any Democratic voters will countenance their members of Congress supporting him on much of anything. We'll again have a situation in which the opposition party holds up the president as the bogeyman whose ouster must be Priority No. 1. And the opposition party's supporters will eat it up. As with Republicans for the last eight years, any members who run afoul of party orthodoxy could find themselves targeted in primaries. The few in competitive districts in the general election might want to make it work, but they are few. As for Trump's actual plans and whether Republicans in Congress will go along with them: The 2016 election also has the effect of undermining the GOP establishment's claims that moderation is the best course -- particularly on issues such as immigration. If you're a GOP congressman looking at these results in your moderately safe conservative district, what is there to tell you that you should support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants or that you should really do anything to make nice with the other side of the aisle? And for Democrats, they've got an opposing president who won an election but lost the popular vote and who well more than half the country already dislikes. There will be little political pressure on them to join hands with him. Things might be accomplished in Washington over the next four years. They'll likely be things only one side of the aisle likes and with very little support from the other side."

Market whiplash. A glass ceiling not quite shattered. Calls to ""lick our wounds."" Donald Trump's first day as president-elect was marked with conciliatory remarks from Democrats who joined him in a call for national unity and urged America's vindicated and despondent voters alike to ensure a peaceful and successful transition. Meanwhile, Republicans maintained their grip on both the Senate and House, but acknowledged there is much work to be done. A look at some of the moving parts the day after Election Day. ___ AND NOW, THE HARD PART Trump is set to become America's 45th president. And now, the hard part. The celebrity businessman and political novice, who capitalized on voters' economic anxieties, took advantage of racial tensions and overcame a string of sexual assault allegations on his way to the White House, claimed victory early Wednesday. He urged Americans to ""come together as one united people."" As of midday Wednesday, the president-elect was nowhere to be seen and the typically buzzing lobby of Trump's residence and campaign headquarters was closed to the general public (although a clothed impersonator of the famous ""Naked Cowboy"" was at one point seen strolling through). Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, lamented that the nation proved to be ""more divided than we thought"" but told supporters, ""We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead."" Standing before a crowd of crestfallen campaign aides and backers, Clinton said, ""This is painful and it will be for a long time."" She acknowledged that America has not ""shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling"" with her failed bid, but she assured that ""someday, somebody will."" ___  'LICK OUR WOUNDS' President Barack Obama hailed Trump's call for unity and said, ""we are now all rooting for his success."" Obama spoke to reporters in the Rose Garden of the White House in a post-election ritual meant to signal the peaceful transition of power from one president to the next. He vowed to do all he could to ensure a smooth transition and tried to buck up Democrats still reeling with disappointment and shock.  ""Everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after, we have to remember we are actually all on one team,"" Obama said.  ""And then if we lose, we learn from our mistakes, we do some reflection, we lick our wounds, we brush ourselves off, we get back in the arena,"" he added. ""But the point, though, is that we all go forward with the presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens."" ___ TRUMP'S AMERICA Trump's victory was concocted in the alchemy of a muscular performance by working-class whites so potent that it overwhelmed the national trend toward a more diverse population that traditionally favors Democrats. That dynamic was amplified by the peculiar mathematics of the Electoral College, which gave an outsized voice to less educated voters in the Midwest. ___ MAKING THE SUPREME COURT ODD AGAIN Trump will enter the Oval Office with the ability to re-establish the Supreme Court's conservative tilt and the chance to cement it for the long term. Trump is expected to act quickly to fill one court vacancy and could choose the successor for up to three justices who will be in their 80s by the time his term ends. The court has been short-handed since conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, and Trump has said he would seek someone in Scalia's mold from a list of 21 people, mainly conservative state and federal judges in their 50s. Trump's victory was a vindication for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's strategy of refusing all year even to consider Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland and end the potential for an even split in the court. ___ RED HILL Republicans held onto their slim Senate majority, a stinging blow to Democrats in a night full of them. Democrats had been nearly certain of retaking control but saw their hopes fizzle as endangered GOP incumbents won in Missouri, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and even Democrat-friendly Wisconsin. Republicans will also command the House for two more years as Trump's astounding White House triumph helped them keep their record-sized majority nearly intact.  ""He just earned a mandate,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday. He will now have to work with a president with whom he had a turbulent relationship during the campaign. ___ GLASS CEILING INTACT For many of Clinton's diehard female supporters, the loss was twofold. Some were disappointed that Clinton fell short of becoming the first female president. Others expressed revulsion that the president-elect is someone who has denigrated women, mocked a beauty pageant contestant for her weight, spoken about grabbing women by the genitals, and been accused of multiple instances of sexual assault. But in the end, it wasn't the blowout some had predicted, with Trump earning about 42 percent of the votes cast by women -- the overwhelming majority of them white. ___ GLOBAL MARKETS: THEY LOVE HIM, THEY LOVE HIM NOT Trump's promise to put America first helped propel him to the U.S. presidency, but it also unleashed uncertainty on the global economy -- skewering major trading partners and offering few specifics that might calm allies, businesses and investors. Financial markets reacted quickly and negatively to the unknowns of a Trump stewardship of the world's largest economy. Stocks stabilized Wednesday morning, while U.S. Treasury notes lost value, pushing up interest rates. ___ GO TO POT? The marijuana legalization movement scored its biggest victory yet Tuesday as voters in California, Massachusetts and Nevada approved recreational pot, making the drug fully legal in the nation's most populous state and giving it a toehold in the densely populated Northeast. Voters in Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas approved medical marijuana measures. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Fikret Abdic was released in 2012 after serving his 15-year sentence in Croatia. The 76-year-old Abdic was called up first during a ceremony in Sarajevo at which the mayors chosen during Oct. 2 local elections were certified. Mayors of towns around Velika Kladusa walked in to receive their certificates only after Abdic received his. During the 1992-95 Bosnian war, Abdic formed the province of Western Bosnia which fought against fellow Muslim Bosniaks loyal to Sarajevo. For war crimes committed back then, he was tried and served in neighboring Croatia. Asked after the ceremony how he thinks he will be cooperating with mayors of neighboring towns who chose to ignore him, Abdic told reporters that all his life he was successful in every job he did.  ""Now I can promise that I can be even better,"" he said. Among others sworn in is Mladen Grujicic, the mayor of Srebrenica and the first ethnic Serb elected in this Bosnian town whose name is synonymous with a slaughter carried out by Serbs. His election is a source of anxiety and anger to the town's Muslim Bosniaks, because Grujicic doesn't acknowledge that what happened in Srebrenica was ""genocide,"" as international courts have defined it. Grujicic said he will work for the benefit of all citizens of Srebrenica and form a multiethnic team in his municipality.  ""By forming such a team, we intend to improve the life of all in Srebrenica,"" he said. ""I think this is the essence of the work in Srebrenica, that both Bosniaks and Serbs unite together,"" Grujicic said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
