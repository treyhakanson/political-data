A primer on the Electoral College and the roles of electors: WHAT IS THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE? It's the 538 Americans who actually elect the president. The number corresponds to the seats a state has in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, plus the three electoral votes allotted to Washington, D.C. The magic number is 270, the bare majority required to win the presidency. Electors meet in their state capitals to cast their ballots; this year, that will be on Dec. 19. HOW CAN A CANDIDATE WIN THE POPULAR VOTE AND NOT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE? The national popular vote simply doesn't matter. Electoral votes are instead awarded based on state-by-state results. Essentially, the U.S. holds 50 separate popular votes that determine an Electoral College vote count. HOW MANY TIMES HAS A CANDIDATE WON THE POPULAR VOTE BUT LOST THE ELECTION? Hillary Clinton would be the fifth candidate in the nation's history to fall into this dubious category. The others, according to the U.S. House: Andrew Jackson in 1824; Samuel Tilden in 1876; Grover Cleveland in 1888; and Al Gore in 2000. HOW DID THE COLLEGE ORIGINATE? The Electoral College is an original feature of the Constitution. Some framers wanted popular election of the commander in chief. Many others didn't trust the masses. The Electoral College was a compromise. Pegging a state's electoral vote count to the size of its congressional delegation was a negotiated design, giving small states more influence proportionally than large states. The same urban vs. rural, small state vs. large state battle is what explains the makeup of the U.S. Senate, where every state has two members. DO ELECTORS HAVE TO VOTE THE WAY THEIR STATE VOTED? The Constitution is silent on this point, which suggests electors can go their own way. This is certainly the thinking behind petitions and a handful of Clinton electors urging Republican electors to abandon Trump. In 29 states, there are either statutes or party rules that theoretically bind electors to honor state results. But the penalty for becoming a ""faithless elector"" is typically a fine measured in the hundreds of dollars. The U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled explicitly on those state laws and party rules, and some constitutional scholars say such state restrictions would be struck down were they ever challenged. HAVE THERE BEEN ""FAITHLESS ELECTORS"" BEFORE? The National Archives says that throughout the nation's history more than 99 percent of electors have voted as pledged. According to research by FairVote.org, a nonprofit group that advocates national popular vote elections for president, there have been just 157 ""faithless electors."" That represents less than 1 percent of the total electoral votes cast in the nation's history. Only a handful of those have been in the modern era. The last publicly identified faithless elector was Barbara Lett-Simmons of Washington, D.C., in 2000. A Gore elector, Lett-Simmons abstained as a public protest for her home city having no voting representation in Congress. According to news reporters, Lett-Simmons sought, and received, Gore's permission for her act of defiance. WHAT HAPPENS IF NO CANDIDATE RECEIVES THE 270-VOTE MAJORITY? Under the Constitution, the House of Representatives decides, with each state delegation casting a single vote for one of the top three vote-getters. Republicans control a majority of state delegations, so this route still benefits Trump. The House has decided a presidential election only twice, in 1800 and 1824. ___ Kimberlee Kruesi contributed from Boise, Idaho. ___ Follow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP ___ This story has been corrected to show the House decided the presidential election in 1800, not 1810.

The Saturday report says Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, has appointed Gen. Kiumars Heidari to the post. The 52-year-old Heidari was formerly the acting commander of the ground forces. He is a veteran of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war that cost both sides over a million people. Separately, Khamenei also appointed the former chief of ground forces Gen. Ahmad Reza Pourdastan to the post of acting commander of the army. Pourdastan has served seven years in the post. Both the national army and the elite Revolutionary Guard have their own separate air, naval and ground forces. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Pence was booed by some audience members when he first walked in. (Twitter/Hamilton via Storyful)   ""The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!"" -- President-elect Donald Trump   The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016   I'm not sure what kind of ""safe and special"" theater the president-elect is alluding to in his tweet on Saturday, following the imbroglio involving Vice President-elect Mike Pence at the Friday night performance of Broadway's ""Hamilton."" Maybe by ""safe and special"" he means the theater is supposed to be docile, an innocuous landscape filled exclusively with chorus girls and holiday pageants. But let's be clear: ""Safe"" theater is dead theater. Conflict is what drives drama, and sometimes, emotions in that public space become intense and things get messy. Some of that exuberance spilled over into the peanut galleries Friday night: As he returned to his orchestra seat after intermission, Pence was greeted with applause -- and boos. Broadway protocol would dictate that an incoming vice president go backstage after a performance and greet the cast. In this case, though, Pence reportedly was being ushered out of the theater as Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor portraying Aaron Burr in the acclaimed musical about the life of Alexander Hamilton, began his curtain-call remarks. According to media reports, Pence stood just outside the auditorium door, listening to the full speech. It is rare indeed for a company of actors -- and especially those in what amounts to one of the biggest hits in Broadway history -- to address a single public official at the end of a performance.   [Trump demands apology from 'Hamilton' after cast's message to Pence.]   ""Thank you so much for joining us tonight,"" Dixon said, on behalf of the production. ""You know, we had a guest in the audience this evening. And Vice President-elect Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you will hear us just a few more moments. There's nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen. There's nothing to boo here. We're all here, sharing a story of love. We have a message for you, sir, and we hope that you will hear us out. And I encourage everybody to pull out your phones and tweet and post, because this message needs to be spread far and wide, okay? Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you and we truly thank you for joining us at 'Hamilton: An American Musical.' We really do. We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values, and work on behalf of all of us. All of us. Again, we truly thank you for sharing this show, this wonderful American story, told by a diverse group of men, women, of different colors, creeds and orientations."" Some observers on social media see Trump's tweet as an attempt to grab hold of a minor culture-war issue and deflect attention from objections being lodged against several of his initial appointments. Indeed, he seems to be trying to make the case here that it's not the incoming administration that poses the greatest threat; it's the dissenters who are threatening him. Still, the challenging words by the ""Hamilton"" cast and the contretemps surrounding them portend a contentious relationship between the Republican-led government and an arts community that may be preparing to take it on publicly. In the context of a musical about a revolution, the events of Friday night look like life imitating art.  "

We can’t afford to flunk it.	" What really makes America great? It's the meaning of 45 words found in the Bill of Rights. Here they are, the entire First Amendment: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."" Everything we have -- everything that makes us unlike any other nation -- flows from those words and the protections they offer for free expression. Donald Trump's presidency is very likely to threaten those First Amendment rights.  If they are damaged or removed, we'll be like a lot of unenviable places. ""Freedom of speech is a rare thing, after all. It's one of the big differences between the United States and a place like Cuba,"" wrote John Daniel Davidson last March in the Federalist. ""Cuba has no freedom of the press -- or rule of law. Libel is whatever the regime says it is."" These are rights that allow us to march in the streets, to worship freely, to publish tough stories about the government. First Amendment rights are not just for journalists but for everyone -- they are so core to our democracy, so much a part of everyday America, that we take them for granted. Trump has made it clear that he has no intention of protecting or defending those rights. He has said repeatedly that he wants to change the laws that allow the press to publish news -- however imperfectly -- without fear of punishment. He has called journalists ""scum"" and encouraged his followers to abuse and hate them. He would like to see his political opponent locked up. Nothing but campaign rhetoric? Clean slate time? No way. ""Believe the autocrat,"" Masha Gessen, a Moscow-born journalist, wrote last week in the New York Review of Books. Americans should not depend on their institutions to protect them -- they crumble fast: ""The national press is likely to be among the first institutional victims of Trumpism.""         1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

Trump barred reporters from his first official act as president-elect -- his visit to the White House. Then, in a tweet, he blamed the media for ""inciting"" street protests, when there was no evidence of that. Meanwhile, Corey Lewandowski, who carried out Trump's press blacklist and reportedly roughed up a female reporter, was preparing for a possible role in the Trump administration. And Steve Bannon, chairman of the alt-right Breitbart News, was named chief strategist on Sunday. ""We're facing a moment that threatens equal protection, due process, free expression, democracy -- not just press freedom,"" wrote Brian Beutler in the New Republic. ""It's not a drill."" What can positive action look like? The American Civil Liberties Union moved quickly to dominate its website with a Trump photo and the words ""See you in court,"" with a prominent ""donate"" widget. Others urged an intensive awareness campaign for citizens. ""Our only hope is to devote our efforts to educating the public as to why independent press coverage is important to them (not us),"" said Mickey Osterreicher, a lawyer who represents the National Press Photographers Association. Americans should be confronted, he said, with whether they ""really want a state-controlled Ministry of Information under the thinly veiled guise of a Pravda-like press."" Indeed, in countries where the government controls the press, and which lack other speech protections, journalists are jailed, even killed, as they try to do their work. Citizens are afraid to express their views publicly or to assemble. Until now, the United States has been a beacon for them. ""The voice, power and influence of the United States has been a boon to the men and women reporting from the front lines of wars and the back streets of autocracies,"" wrote Alex Howard of the Sunlight Foundation, a free-speech organization.  Isn't it pointless to fight back? Antonio Gramsci, the Italian political writer jailed by Mussolini's Fascist regime, believed in ""pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will."" In other words, you can know your clapboard house is on fire, and you're a long way from civilization. But you have to call 911, get out your garden hose and bucket, and keep acting as if the firetrucks are on the way. Although things didn't work out too well for Gramsci, who died at 46 shortly after he was released from prison, his formula offers a path forward. Look the situation in the eye; know how bad it is. That's the pessimism of the intellect. As for the optimism-of-the-will part? For journalists, it's writing and reporting aggressively and fearlessly, and being willing to fight for access. For citizens, it's being well-informed, including subscribing to newspapers and supporting the best journalism. It's helping to debunk and call out fake news. It's donating to, or getting involved with, civil rights and media rights organizations. And it's backing public officials committed to protecting free expression. Americans certainly shouldn't move to Canada, but they should heed the words of the Canadian songwriter Joni Mitchell: ""Don't it always seem to go, that you don't know what you've got till it's gone?"" We've still got our precious First Amendment rights. Now it's time -- high time -- to protect them from the fire.  For more by Margaret Sullivan, visit wapo.st/sullivan  "

Longshot exit bid gets boost	" SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Donald Trump's election as president is giving a big social-media boost to an unlikely effort in the nation's most populous state: a plan to vote on seceding from the union. The Yes California Independence Campaign hopes to put a question on the November 2018 ballot that would authorize a statewide independence vote for spring 2019. The effort drew little attention until Tuesday's election, which also kept Trump's fellow Republicans in charge of Congress and raised the possibility of a conservative shift on the U.S. Supreme Court. A look at what's happening: ___ THE TRUMP VICTORY Campaign President Louis J. Marinelli said the election results offer further proof that California is more progressive than the nation as a whole. Voters endorsed ballot measures that included recreational marijuana and increased taxes on the rich. Many Californians were offended by Trump's statements on immigration and other issues.  ""People are starting to come to the realization ... 'Wait a minute, this is not the type of country we want to live in,'"" said Marinelli, who lost a primary bid for the state Assembly this year. ___ THE REACTION As election results rolled in, the group's Facebook contacts grew from about 11,000 to about 15,000, and its email account received about 3,000 messages. Marinelli said he couldn't keep up with the Twitter messages. The next day, the group set up a tent outside the state Capitol in Sacramento. About a dozen supporters wearing YesCalifornia.org T-shirts talked to passers-by.  ""It would frankly be better off if we were our own nation,"" said the group's vice president, Marcus Ruiz Evans, calling Trump's election further evidence that America is a sinking ship. ""Our ship can sail on its own."" Skeptics, like Steve Angel of Sacramento, criticized what he said is an effort to ""balkanize"" the United States by breaking it into pieces. To the north, in Portland, Oregon, two residents filed a separate petition for a 2018 ballot initiative for Oregon to secede. ___ THE PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS Any effort to get an issue on the ballot requires the gathering of hundreds of thousands of signatures. Marinelli tried unsuccessfully to put several initiatives on the ballot this year, including a proposal to declare California a separate nation, to rename the governor the ""president"" of California and to fly the California state flag atop the United States flag. Those signature-gathering efforts fizzled. Repeated attempts to create a 51st state in Northern California, named the State of Jefferson, have also failed. That movement generally draws more conservative supporters who are dissatisfied with California's dominance by Democrats. The Yes California Independence Campaign tries to appeal across the political spectrum but holds a generally progressive ideology, Marinelli said. ___ BREXIT = CALEXIT? Marinelli equates the movement's longshot chances to the recent decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.  ""People said Brexit wouldn't happen, and then they said Trump wouldn't happen ... Things that you don't expect to happen are happening, so why not this?"" he said. Supporters of the initiative note that California, with its 39 million residents, is often compared to other nations, not other states. Data from the World Bank show its economy was equivalent to the sixth-largest in the world last year. ___ THE HISTORY Threats to secede from the United States have been a part of American politics almost since the nation was founded. The most serious attempt came before and during the Civil War, when 11 Southern states left to form the Confederacy. The movement ended with the defeat of Confederate forces. Chapman University law professor Ronald Rotunda said the Constitution does not provide for state secession, so the only way to do it legally would be to change the Constitution -- an act that requires the approval of Congress and 38 states.  ""It's not going to happen. You're not going to find 38 states,"" he said. ""The theory of our Constitution for over 200 years is we sink or swim together."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Next year's tiny Social Security cost-of-living increase means that about 70 percent of Medicare recipients will be protected from rising medical costs. For this group, the average premium will be about $109 a month. That's about 4 percent more than the $104.90 they paid this year. Medicare's Part B covers outpatient services such as office visits. For the remaining beneficiaries, the average 2017 premium will be $134, or 10 percent higher. On top of the basic premium, individual retirees making more than $85,000 and married couples with incomes above $170,000 pay an extra surcharge. Those range to nearly $300 at the highest income levels. The Part B deductible will be $183. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

As polls closed in many eastern states, Clinton and her Republican opponent Donald Trump each claimed a handful of states and their electoral votes. But the critical states that will determine the outcome of the election, including Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, remained way too close to call. Earlier in the day, Clinton voted at an elementary school near her suburban New York home with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. By Tuesday evening there was little left for her to do but watch, wait, and play with her grandchildren. The Clintons also stepped away at one point to work on her remarks later in the night. Clinton's campaign picked a symbolic location for her election night party -- the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, which, in a nod to the historic moment, offers a glass ceiling. A number of New York politicians and top campaign surrogates were expected to speak, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, singer Katy Perry and Khizr Khan, the father of a slain Muslim-American solider whose indictment of Trump at the Democratic National Convention was an emotional high point for Clinton's campaign. Her subdued Election Day was a stark contrast from Clinton's hectic final days on the campaign trail. The former secretary of state and New York senator dashed through battleground states, encouraged get-out-the-vote efforts and campaigned with a star-studded cast of celebrities. The eve of the election included appearances with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, Jon Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga. After the divisive rhetoric of the campaign against Trump, Clinton sought to offer a positive closing message on Monday. She told supporters in Pittsburgh they ""can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, bighearted America."" In a buoyant mood, she also greeted voters who cried out ""we love you,"" smiling back: ""I love you all, too ... absolutely."" Some good news boosted Clinton's spirits in the final moments of the campaign. On Sunday, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress, informing lawmakers the bureau had found no evidence in its hurried review of newly discovered emails to warrant criminal charges against Clinton. The late October announcement of a fresh email review rocked the race just as Clinton appeared to be pulling away from Trump in several battleground states. The update from the FBI may have come too late for some: In the nine days between Comey's initial statement until his ""all clear"" announcement on Sunday, nearly 24 million people cast early ballots. That's about 18 percent of the expected total votes for president. But campaign aides projected confidence. They said they felt good about Nevada, where they said support for Clinton in early voting was strong. They were encouraged by the strong Latino turnout in Florida and felt they took a strong lead in Michigan and Pennsylvania into Election Day, when the bulk of votes are cast in those states. ___ Follow Lisa Lerer and Catherine Lucey on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer and http://twitter.com/catherine_lucey Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Anchors David Muir and Lester Holt are in the midst of a spirited competition for first place in television's evening news ratings. After several years in second, ABC's ""World News Tonight"" with Muir has lately pulled even with NBC's ""Nightly News"" and some weeks a relative handful of viewers separate the shows. Morning may be where the money is for broadcast news divisions, but the evening newscasts have long been an important measure of strength. Even while some regard them as relics of a different media age, the ABC, NBC and CBS evening newscasts are durable institutions that collectively reach around 24 million viewers each weeknight. Since the season began in late September, the ABC telecast has averaged 8.25 million viewers a night to NBC's 8.12 million, the Nielsen company said. That essentially reverses the numbers from a year ago. NBC won during most weeks this calendar year until September, when the winds have favored Muir. NBC counters that its lead among viewers aged 25-to-54, the demographic measurement used most often to sell news advertising, has essentially doubled since last fall. In other words, NBC says Muir's rally is built upon older, less valuable viewers. ABC says its rise has been slow and steady since Muir replaced Diane Sawyer as chief anchor in September 2014.  ""It's how David performs, how the show looks and what we put on the air,"" said Almin Karamehmedovic, executive producer of the ABC telecast. ""Viewers have responded, and we're truly grateful for the people who have tuned in every night."" Muir has traveled to Guantanamo Bay and near the Syrian border during the last few months for stories and viewers seem to appreciate that he's still reporting, Karamehmedovic said. Holt had managed to maintain NBC's viewership for more than a year following his tumultuous ascension to the anchor's role, replacing Brian Williams after Williams was found to have lied about his role covering some news stories.  ""We're just beginning a new season,"" said Sam Singal, executive producer of ""Nightly News."" ''We need to look at it on a much broader scale."" Oddly, NBC's viewership has declined relative to last year during a presidential election campaign that has rewarded cable news outlets with huge audiences as they cover politics wall-to-wall. NBC's sister network, MSNBC, recorded its most-watched month in the network's 20-year history during October. There's some thought that the cable news outlets have captured the political junkies while more casual viewers were growing sick of the campaign.  ""When there's a really big news story people are tuning in, but there's so much churn every day that it's hard to keep that excitement,"" Singal said. Muir's recent rise also coincided with Holt's most attention-grabbing assignment, as the moderator for the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Holt generally drew positive reviews, although not as strong as Anderson Cooper, Martha Raddatz and Chris Wallace received in subsequent debates. Prior to the debate, Holt won 29 individual weeks in the ratings to ABC's 10, Nielsen said. ABC won four of the first five weeks after the debate.  ""I look at it more as a missed opportunity to gain stature,"" said Andrew Tyndall, a consultant who monitors the content of evening newscasts. Singal said that ""we thought it was a great evening for him and for us."" The ratings bring added intrigue to election night coverage. Presidential election nights are like the Super Bowl for news divisions, and winning the night in the ratings is a major bragging point. Election night viewership in the past has roughly corresponded with evening news ratings, since the evening news anchor usually leads the coverage. That's not the case this year, though. George Stephanopoulos is the top anchor for ABC's election night coverage, with Muir in a supporting role. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Shiite militant group and predominantly Shiite Iran are close allies. Speaking alongside his Lebanese counterpart, Zarif said recent political developments in Lebanon can be the key to breaking the deadlock in wars in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Aoun's appointment by Lebanon's parliament broke a 29-month impasse that saw the country's two main political blocs, one backed by Saudi Arabia and the other by its regional rival Iran, sabotaging 45 successive attempts to select a president. Iran's local allies are arrayed against Saudi Arabia's allies in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq.  ""We believe that this unique Lebanese experience can be the key to break the political deadlock in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, in conjunction with the fight against terrorism,"" said Zarif. Aoun also received Syrian state minister Mansour Azzam on Monday. Hezbollah is fighting alongside Syrian president Bashar Assad's forces in the neighboring country's civil war. Zarif is accompanied on his visit by an economic delegation as Lebanon and Iran hope to broaden their markets together. Iran is emerging from international economic sanctions regime after a landmark nuclear agreement with world powers was reached in 2015, while Lebanon is looking to revitalize its own lagging economy following two and a half years of political crisis. Zarif meets with Saudi-backed Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri Tuesday. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
