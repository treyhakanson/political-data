Earlier this month, Jakarta was rocked by a massive protest by conservative Muslims against the governor. One person died and dozens were injured in rioting. Hard-liners have threatened more protests if Ahok isn't arrested. Police announced at a news conference that the popular governor, Basuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaja Purnama, cannot leave the country while the investigation is underway. However, they said he is not being detained because investigators and religious experts were sharply divided over whether the comments at issue were blasphemous.  ""After long discussions, we reached a decision that the case should be tried in an open court,"" said National Police chief detective Ari Dono. The accusation of blasphemy against Ahok, an ethnic Chinese and Christian who is an ally of President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo, has galvanized Jokowi's political opponents in the nation of 250 million where about 90 percent of people are Muslims, but five other religions are also recognized by the state. Jokowi canceled an official visit to Australia because of the rioting and has spent the past two weeks rallying the political, religious and security establishments behind him. It has also been a gift to politicians vying against Ahok, who is seeking a second term as Jakarta governor in elections in February. Among them is the son of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a former president. Yudhoyono courted controversy by calling for Ahok's arrest and saying he supported the Nov. 4 protest. The Islamic Defenders Front, a vigilante group that wants to impose Shariah law, began demanding Ahok's arrest after a video circulated online in which he joked to an audience about a passage in the Quran that could be interpreted as prohibiting Muslims from accepting non-Muslims as leaders. The governor has apologized for the comment. Munarman, a spokesman for the Front who goes by one name, said the group is still demanding Ahok's arrest because he could flee or destroy evidence. ""The offense has caused unrest across the country,"" he said. ""We will continue to stage protests until he is arrested."" National Police chief Tito Karnavian said that barring Ahok from leaving the country is the appropriate ""maximum"" step to take at present.  ""If there are pressures for his arrest, we need to question if that is because of other motivations,"" he said. ""Once again, there should be no parties who pressure for his arrest. Let's think rationally and logically."" Sumarno, chief of Jakarta's Election Commission, said Ahok is not barred from competing in the gubernatorial election. Ahok is first Christian governor of Jakarta in half a century and the first ethnic Chinese to run the sprawling chaotic city that is one of the world's 10 largest urban areas. He is popular with the city's middle class, but has made enemies from a tough stance against corruption and an urban program that has evicted thousands of the city's poorest from slums. Ahok thanked police for dealing with the case in a professional manner.  ""We still have chance to take part in the election, therefore, for our supporters, please come to polling stations and cast ballots for our victory in the first round,"" he told reporters at his campaign center. ""That is what we hope to show, a good democratic process for our nation."" The anti-Ahok movement, which has attracted moderates as well as hard-line elements as the city election approached, has also overflowed with slurs based on race. The vulnerability of Indonesia's tiny Chinese minority remains a raw issue in the country. In the chaos that engulfed Indonesia in May 1998 amid the Asian financial crisis, mobs in Jakarta and other cities targeted Chinese businesses and individuals, killing many. Blasphemy is a criminal offense in Indonesia. Amnesty International documented 106 convictions between 2004 and 2014 with some individuals imprisoned for up to five years. ___ Associated Press writer Ali Kotarumalos contributed to this report.

While liberal-leaning urban areas helped Hillary Clinton secure Maryland's 10 electoral votes and Democratic candidates won all but one U.S. House seat Tuesday, the state's liberal base didn't perform according to expectations. Donald Trump received a higher percentage of votes than Mitt Romney in 15 of the 18 Maryland counties that voted Republican in 2012, while Clinton failed to expand on President Barack Obama's coalition from 2012. Of the six counties that voted Democratic four years ago, only two counties -- Howard and Montgomery -- supported Clinton at higher rates than they supported Obama. Maryland counties voted the same way in 2016 as in 2012, except two that flipped allegiances. Unlike the last presidential election, Anne Arundel County voted Democratic by a small margin, yet Somerset County voted Republican by a significantly larger margin. Maryland House Speaker Mike Busch, D-Anne Arundel, attributed the change in his county to the Republican candidate.  ""Citizens were turned off by the rhetoric and bigotry of Donald Trump and they voted for Hillary,"" Busch said. And while Somerset County has ""always been Republican,"" said Matt Adams, chairman of the Somerset County Republicans, the county shifted nine points to the Republican side since 2012. In the past, the county has appeared Democratic because of the presence of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, in Princess Anne, Adams said.  ""(The students) don't live here,"" he said. ""They came from somewhere, (where) they truly live, and they should vote absentee in our opinion from the county in which they lived in prior to going to college."" In the last weeks of voter registration in the state of Maryland, employees at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore -- a historically black college -- arranged for voting registration officials to visit campus, where about 200 students were able to register, said William Robinson, the director of public relations at the university. On Election Day, about 150 students took a campus shuttle bus to the nearest polling places, and about 125 other students used their own transportation, Robinson said. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Cockeysville, was re-elected as the representative for Maryland's 1st Congressional District, which includes Somerset County, and will remain the only Republican representative from the state.  ""The whole first congressional district has been gerrymandered to be the Republican district in the state of Maryland, so Andy always does well here,"" Adams said. Harris's conservative views have mobilized Republicans, he said. In his victory speech at the Maryland Republican headquarters, Harris said he looked forward to bringing ""Maryland back to the red column.""  ""In one of my precincts up in Baltimore County -- Catonsville -- there was a line around the corner at 10 p.m. at night because people can hardly wait to get out and vote for Donald Trump and drain the swamp in Washington,"" he said Tuesday night. A 2014 Washington Post article identified both Maryland and North Carolina as tied for the title of most-gerrymandered state.  ""How the districts are drawn really gives the impression that Republicans live in certain places and Democrats live in other places, and while there seems to be some trends in that respect -- Montgomery County for example is very heavily Democratic -- I think it distorts our perception somewhat,"" said Carin Robinson, an associate professor of political science at Hood College in Frederick. While the numbers signal a stark polarization in Maryland between political parties, it may not be an accurate representation, she said. ""There is polarization, but redistricting and how the congressional lines are drawn accentuates it and over-emphasizes it in a way that probably doesn't highlight the fact that we still have diversity within the state,"" Robinson said. Gerrymandering has eradicated battleground districts in the state, which works in favor of Democrats, said Delegate Herbert McMillan, R-Anne Arundel.  ""Basically, I see gerrymandering is contributing a lot to politics in Maryland,"" he said. ""It's really sad. What happens is in the primary, there is no middle left."" Councilman Michael Peroutka, R-Anne Arundel, said he thinks voters had their own agendas and motives for the county's blue vote.  ""I would just speculate that there are so many people in our county who work directly for, or work as, a contractor for the federal government,"" Peroutka said. ""I think they vote Democrat because they are voting for a big spigot of federal spending that would stay on."" Other factors, such as shifting demographics in gerrymandered districts, may also contribute to some counties in Maryland becoming more liberal while other counties are growing more conservative, said Gregory Kline, co-founder of Red Maryland, a conservative news outlet.  ""That realignment has taken hold over the last couple of decades,"" he said. ""In more conservative counties...there's more locally elected Republican officials. It just kind of feeds on itself."" Maryland state Sen. James Mathias Jr., D-Somerset, said his job will not change just because counties are becoming more stratified.  ""The most important person is the constituents,"" he said. ""(I will) stay true to constituents, stay true to my beliefs, but adapt to the environment and circumstances."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Trump tweets: ""Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!"" Thousands have been gathering in cities from New York to Dallas to San Francisco to voice opposition to Trump's election.   Protesters gather in downtown Chicago as they protest the election of President-elect Donald Trump, Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016. Two days after Trump's election as president, the divisions he exposed only showed signs of widening as many thousands of protesters flooded streets across the country to condemn him. (Nam Y. Huh/Associated Press)  Trump's complaint Thursday about the media echoes the rhetoric of his campaign, when he railed against the press as ""disgusting"" and ""dishonest."" A few minutes earlier, Trump was more positive about his trip to Washington, tweeting: ""A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!"" ___ 9:40 p.m. Billionaire conservative donor Charles Koch (kohk) says the election shows America is ""more deeply divided than at any point in my lifetime."" Koch and his brother, David, oversaw policy and politics groups that spent about $250 million in the two years ahead of the election, much of it on a successful drive to keep the Senate in Republican hands. However, the brothers did not support Donald Trump and withheld their money from the presidential race. In an email Thursday to his groups' donors and employees, obtained by AP, Koch does not specifically mention Trump but says his group would work to find common ground with any elected official. Koch says the election ""made clear that Americans are angry about a rigged economy and political system that's driving our country toward a two-tiered society,"" he wrote. ___ 7:37 p.m. Donald Trump has won Arizona's presidential contest and its 11 electoral votes. The Republican president-elect had a solid lead over Hillary Clinton on election night, but a winner wasn't declared because there were so many uncounted votes. The latest batch of returns tabulated Thursday made him the clear winner. It extends a 20-year winning streak for Republican presidential candidates in Arizona. Bill Clinton was the last Democrat to take the state, winning in 1996. Hillary Clinton was closer to gaining Arizona than Barack Obama, who lost by more than 9 percentage points during his two runs for president. She is losing by 4 points. Arizona was one of three races that had yet to be determined from the Tuesday election. Michigan and New Hampshire remain too close to call. ___ 7:16 p.m. Several hundred well-wishers and a high school band greeted Vice President-elect Mike Pence when he landed in Indiana for the first time since Tuesday's election. Fire trucks sprayed streams of water in the air over the Republican governor's plane Thursday night and the marching band played, ""My Indiana Home."" Pence told the crowd he was humbled to be Donald Trump's vice president. And he choked up when he said that his heart will always be in the state no matter where his new duties take him. Pence also asked the crowd to support President-elect Donald Trump and to pray that the starkly divided country to be reunified. He said he was grateful for Republican majorities in Congress and looks forward to getting the country back on track. ___ 6:38 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton has spoken to President-elect Donald Trump by phone. That's according to a spokesman for the former president and husband of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The spokesman says the former president congratulated Trump during the brief call on Thursday and wished him well. ___ 6:17 p.m. The White House says Vice President Joe Biden talked to Mike Pence Thursday about the key duties of vice president and well as specific policy portfolios he has worked on, including the NATO alliance, eastern Europe and expanding access to the middle class. The White House says in describing the meeting that the two men spoke in the vice president's office in the West Wing and that they reminisced about their friendship dating back to when they served in Congress. The White House says Biden offered his full support to the vice president-elect to ensure a seamless transition to power and that he invited the Pence family to join him and his wife for dinner on the grounds of the Naval Observatory, which is where the vice president traditionally resides. ___ 5:13 p.m. Donald Trump has picked a longtime friend and private equity executive to lead his inauguration efforts. Tom Barrack, who founded California-based firm Colony Capital, has been selected to serve as chairman of the President-elect's inaugural committee. That's according to two sources with direct knowledge of the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions. Barrack has been an aggressive public supporter of Trump throughout the campaign. He was among the primetime speakers at Trump's nominating convention this summer. The inaugural chairman is responsible for raising millions of dollars to fund the inauguration, which includes several major parties and an extensive entertainment program. Barrack's office declined a request for comment. He told CBS ""This Morning"" on Thursday that Trump was like an ultimate fighter during the campaign who used ""whatever tools necessary to convey a really disruptive message."" He said America would see ""a softer, kinder"" Trump now that he's won the presidency. -- By Steve Peoples and Julie Bykowicz ___ 5:12 p.m. The president of the United Auto Workers says the union's views on trade align with Donald Trump's, and he'd like a meeting with the president-elect to talk about it. Dennis Williams says he agrees with Trump's call for scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has sent auto jobs to Mexico. He also backs Trump's proposal for a 35 percent tariff on vehicles imported from Mexico. The UAW has historically supported Democratic candidates and endorsed Hillary Clinton this year. But Michigan, which has the most auto workers of any state, narrowly voted for Trump in unofficial results. Internal polling of union members prior to the election showed 28 percent going for Trump with 6 percent undecided. Williams says Trump's total may actually have been slightly higher than the 31 percent who voted for Mitt Romney and 33 percent who went for John McCain. ___ 5 p.m. As President-elect Donald Trump puts together his White House, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and top campaign aide Kellyanne Conway are emerging as possible picks for chief of staff. That's according to two people familiar with the transition planning. Conway, a prominent Republican pollster, served as Trump's third campaign chief of staff and developed a strong rapport with the candidate. Priebus embraced Trump after his nomination, despite concerns among other Republicans, and worked his way into his inner circle. A third person with knowledge of the transition process says conservative media executive Steve Bannon is also in the mix for chief of staff. However, others insist Bannon would not have a White House role. Those involved in the process insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly. A decision on chief of staff is expected in the coming days. -- By Julie Pace, Julie Bykowicz and Steve Peoples ___ 3:35 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump says his top three priorities are immigration, health care and jobs.  ""Big-league jobs,"" he says. Trump spoke briefly with reporters Thursday after meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol. Trump is wrapping up his first trip to Washington since winning Tuesday's election. He's been meeting with President Barack Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan. When a reporter asked if he would ask Congress to ban Muslims, Trump said ""Thank you everybody,"" and walked away. ___ 2:29 p.m. More than 100 protesters are holding a sit-in outside Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue as the president-elect meets with Republican leaders a few blocks away on Capitol Hill. The mostly student protesters are holding signs that say #stillwithher and Love Trumps Hate, a phrase that Hillary Clinton often used during her campaign against Trump. The demonstrators sat on the sidewalk outside Trump's new hotel, chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Stronger Together,"" a slogan of Clinton's campaign. Trump met earlier with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office near the hotel. ___ 2:15 p.m. House Speaker Paul Ryan says he and President-elect Donald Trump had a ""fantastic, productive meeting"" at the Capitol. Trump called the meeting ""an honor."" He added that, ""I think we're going to do some absolutely spectacular things for the American people."" Trump may have signaled early agenda items where the Republicans agree. He said: ""We can't get started fast enough, whether it's health care or immigration."" Ryan then took Trump, Melania Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence out onto his balcony overlooking the Mall. Ryan pointed to where the inaugural platform being is built. That's where Trump will be sworn in. Trump at one point gestured toward the tower of his new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol. ___ 2:10 p.m. First lady Michelle Obama and incoming first lady Melania Trump have spoken about the challenges of raising children in the White House. Mrs. Trump's 10-year-old son Barron Trump will become a teenager during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says that's ""a rather unique childhood."" He pointed out that Mrs. Obama and President Barack Obama also had the experience of raising children in the White House. Earnest said Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Trump spoke about the experience of being a good parent under those unique circumstances. He said the two women then walked to the Oval Office to visit with the president and the president-elect. ___ 2:05 p.m. Federal officials have imposed temporary flight restrictions over Vice President-elect Mike Pence's current home at the Indiana governor's residence. A Federal Aviation Administration notice dated Wednesday prohibits most aircraft from flying below 1,500 feet within a one-mile radius of the governor's residence in Indianapolis. It says military aircraft supporting the Secret Service are exempt, along with police and emergency aircraft. The FAA generally issues temporary restrictions when there's a special event or hazardous condition. Similar limits have been issued for around Trump Tower in New York City. The notice says the Indianapolis air space restrictions are needed because of ""VIP movement."" They expire Jan. 21, the day after Pence becomes vice president. ___ 1:50 p.m. Donald Trump's first wife, Ivana, says she voted for her ex. She says he'll ""make big changes"" in the United States. Ivana Trump offered the comment when reached by phone by her fourth husband, Rossano Rubicondi, while he appeared on an Italian TV talk show. Ivana Trump is the mother of the president-elect's three oldest children. She married Rubicondi in 2008 and legally separated from him later that year. According to a news release from the ""Maurizio Costanzo Show,"" Ivana Trump said: ""Naturally I voted for Donald. He's a businessman who will make big changes."" The show is scheduled to air Sunday. ___ 1:10 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has spoken with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, her former House colleague. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said that Pelosi congratulated Pence on his win in their conversation Thursday. Hammill said: ""The two agreed on the need to find common ground and that they would meet in person in the weeks ahead."" Pence served in the House of Representatives before becoming governor of Indiana. ___ 1 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump has left the White House after his first meeting with President Barack Obama. Trump says it was the first time the two had ever met. For almost 90 minutes, they discussed the coming changeover of government. Trump said they had planned to meet for a much shorter period of time. While in Washington, Trump also plans to meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. As Trump and Obama met in the Oval Office, first lady Michelle Obama welcomed Trump's wife, Melania, to the White House residence. ___ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)  Mike Adams, a conservative Texas blogger, greeted President-elect Donald Trump's victory with this post: ""The evil, demonic, mass murdering Hillary Clinton has been defeated. This is VICTORY for all Americans, even the uninformed, ignorant morons who voted for Hillary."" But a few hours later, as the news sank in, Adams posted again with a more hopeful tone: ""Today I declare 'LOVE WINS' because it is love for America that inspired us to collectively achieve this great victory."" He said he was going to send Trump a video with his suggestions about how to reform health care. Adams and thousands of others on the furious far-right of American political discourse, who have railed for years against the ""criminal"" and ""treasonous"" excesses of the federal government under President Obama, woke up Wednesday to find themselves in the odd position of being, essentially, insiders.  ['I'm not paranoid.' These Americans are doing more than just stockpiling food and ammunition]  Members of the so-called ""alt-right,"" who reject establishment conservatism and spread their far-right ideology online, were eagerly courted by candidate Trump. Now this vocal constituency feels emboldened by its new ally in the White House, presenting Trump with a major challenge to satisfy its pent-up demands while trying to unite a deeply divided nation. Adams, who blogs about health, wellness and politics on a Facebook page that has 2 million ""likes,"" said he sees the Trump election as a long-awaited chance to be heard by the White House. In addition to sending Trump his health-care ideas, he is urging him to fight abortion and nominate Supreme Court justices who will protect his right to own a gun.      The alternative right has come under fire from Hillary Clinton and establishment Republicans, but it has been seeping into American politics for years as a far-right option for conservatives. Here's what you need to know about the alt-right movement. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   ""My message is going to be: Let's move forward, let's contribute,"" Adams said in an interview. ""It's like JFK: Ask what you can do for your country. We're at that kind of moment. Myself, and I hope many others, are going to do our best to try to contribute to solutions."" Trump's election has sent hopes flying among a broad array of Americans angry at the federal government for what they see as unconstitutional overreach into their lives. They often describe themselves as part of the patriot or liberty movements, and many belong to well-armed militia groups such as the Oath Keepers or the 3 Percenters, whose membership has soared into the hundreds of thousands since Obama took office in 2008.  [Meet the woman who spends 260 days a year preaching the constitution]  Many people in those movements backed Trump's candidacy with full-throated gusto on the Internet and social media. However, others have been skeptical of his conservative credentials, and some are now vowing to pressure him to make good on his campaign rhetoric on issues such as abortion, immigration and putting ""America first.""  ""It is now up to us to keep the heat on Congress and Trump, to fulfill the promises that were made by Mr. Trump,"" said Shorty Dawkins, writing on the Oath Keepers website. ""We have won a battle, but not the war against globalism. We cannot rest.""  KrisAnne Hall, a radio host who tours the nation preaching against federal overreach of the Constitution, said she wanted voters to ""make a list of things they wanted changed that motivated them to vote and hang that list on their refrigerator.""  ""Then I want them to review that list in two years and again in four years and see if those things actually changed for the better,"" she said. ""Perhaps then we can see where the changes need to be made and who has or doesn't have the power to make those changes."" Trump's victory has also energized white supremacists, who believe that Trump, with his calls to deport immigrants and ban Muslims, could bring their racist and anti-Semitic views into the mainstream in a way no politician has for decades.    A supporter for the Ku Klux Klan and the Confederate flag yells at African American demonstrators during a rally at the statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina on July 18, 2015. (Chris Keane/Reuters)  ""The people in our movement are really excited with the possibility of a Donald Trump presidency, what it can do for us,"" said William Daniel Johnson of the American Freedom Party, a prominent white nationalist in Los Angeles who has called for a whites-only United States and the deportation of other races and ethnicities.  [The rise of black nationalist groups: 'Apparently hate makes AmeriKKKa great']  ""In the past, presidents have reached out to all peoples, except those whites who are proud of their heritage and want to preserve Western civilization,"" Johnson said. ""Our hope is that his large tent will include us who have really been despised for generations."" During the campaign, Trump retweeted messages from white nationalist groups and often seemed reluctant to distance himself from those groups. He was endorsed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. After the election, the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, based in North Carolina, posted a large photo of Trump on its website with the message ""TRUMP=TRUMP'S RACE UNITED MY PEOPLE."" The group says it has scheduled a ""victory parade"" on Dec. 3 in North Carolina. The group did not return a telephone message seeking comment and more details.         Two months after Trump announced his candidacy last year, a South Florida tattoo artist named Lonny Morgan latched on to Trump's crusade against ""political correctness"" and started a website called ""Outlaw Morgan,"" devoted to promoting Trump and trashing Clinton and Obama. The Democrat-turned-Republican, who now earns his living selling T-shirts and other merchandise on his Facebook site, has more than 260,000 ""likes."" ""I couldn't take it anymore; I got to a point where I was tired of oversensitive people claiming that everything is bigotry and everything is racist,"" said Morgan, 41, who doesn't count himself among the white supremacists.   ['They don't need the baggage': White supremacist resigns as Trump delegate]  Morgan said many Trump supporters were ""pretty much talking 1776-style revolution"" if Clinton had won. But with Trump in the White House, they now see a chance for their beliefs and ideas to be taken seriously at the highest levels of government. For example, Morgan said he hoped Trump would select Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who led a congressional inquiry into Clinton's role in the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, to replace Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. He said he and others who felt completely alienated by the government view Trump's victory as a ""torch of hope for people to carry."" ""You can feel the hope in your chest. You wake up this morning and you're like, 'Hell yeah,'"" he said. ""I woke up today and the tension in my shoulders was lifted. I feel calm. I have a Harley-Davidson that I love to ride. I bought a '91 Jeep Cherokee that I'm going to put a lift kit on and take out in the woods. I feel like I can finally get back to my life."" Morgan said he planned to keep his website going to support Trump and to make sure that he keeps his campaign promises.   [The white flight of Derek Black]  ""It's up to us to monitor everything and make sure he stays true to his word,"" Morgan said. ""The American people are going to hold him accountable."" Since the election, Johnson, the white supremacist, who has said U.S. citizenship should be limited to white people with ""no ascertainable trace of Negro blood,"" has been emailing and calling Trump campaign officials, and people at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to promote himself and allies for positions in the Trump administration. He said they could be a ""conscience"" pressuring Trump ""to live up to some of his pro-white, pro-nationalist, pro-populist political campaign promises.""

He said he wants to ""get rid of this entitlement mentality that we have in this country. It needs to be adjusted and reduced.""  [These photos show what it's like inside an American militia]  He said he has asked his British friend Nigel Farage, of the far-right, anti-immigrant United Kingdom Independence Party, which was a key driver of this year's Brexit vote for Britain to leave the European Union, to recommend him to Trump officials. Farage appeared with Trump at a few rallies over the summer.  Johnson was briefly included on the Trump campaign's list of delegates to the Republican National Convention in July. But after media reports, campaign officials removed him, saying he had been inadvertently included through a ""database error.""  He's had no better luck this time. Despite his hopeful pleadings to be part of the Trump administration, he said so far he's had no response from anyone in the Trump camp. Jared Taylor, a prominent white nationalist known for his opposition to multiculturalism, said he does not believe Trump is a white supremacist. ""Donald Trump has stumbled onto certain policies that are congruent with a racialist view of the world, but he's got completely different motives,"" Taylor said.  But he said there is hope that Trump's thinking may evolve, opening the door to contact with Taylor. If so, he said, he will certainly take advantage of the opportunity to influence the new administration.  ""The possibility of that happening is greater than ever before,"" he said. ""Here is a guy who has broken the mold for how we talk about race. The fact that he was nominated at all was a huge step forward.   Taylor said that if he is contacted by members of the Trump administration, he's unlikely to publicize it any time soon. ""As an earthly assistant of the devil, boldly writing about my plans to meet the Trump entourage -- how could that possibly do to the president-elect any good?"" he said.

Let the books, and the rehashing of the election, begin. Publishing executives say that few campaign-related book proposals had circulated prior to Tuesday's seismic results -- but that changed quickly. The election created a new narrative, a fresh set of victors, and a scramble to understand an outcome that few media elites -- and seemingly no polls -- had predicted. ""There's going to be a cascade. An awful lot of people want to weigh in,"" says veteran editor Peter Osnos, founder of the imprint PublicAffairs, who has worked on books with Donald Trump, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Campaign-trail accounts have long been a staple of publishing, and many have become classics of the genre, including Theodore White's ""The Making of the President 1960,"" Joe McGinnis's ""The Selling of the President 1968,"" and Richard Ben Cramer's ""What It Takes,"" a history of the 1988 campaign. Given this year's saturation coverage of the race, Hillary Clinton's penchant for privacy, Donald Trump's banishment of some reporters, and the dominance of social media, editors say that the challenge will be to offer fresh information, extraordinary insights or a new way of recounting recent history.  Several publishing executives mentioned wanting a prescriptive interpretation, akin to J.D. Vance's best-selling ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" about rural Rust Belt Ohio, a region that voted enthusiastically for Trump.   [Everybody is reading books trying to explain Trump voters]  ""Everyone wants to read a supersmart voice on how we fix the social mobility problem,"" says one editor of multiple political books who, like many publishing officials, was unwilling to speak on the record. Publishing is a competitive and secretive business; houses don't want to tip their hand as to whom they're hoping to sign.  Editors expect journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, who wrote ""Game Change"" and ""Double Down,"" juicy accounts of the 2008 and 2012 elections, to write a third volume. (The first book was the rare campaign book made into an Emmy-winning television drama.) The Bloomberg Politics managing editors declined to comment on their plans.  Trump insiders have become highly valuable commodities, although the president-elect's penchant for strict non-disclosure agreements has already led to the reported jettisoning in June of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski's $1.2 million book deal.  Kellyanne Conway, the first woman to helm a winning presidential campaign, is now a valuable prospect, and she's one Trump insider who may be permitted to publish her story.      Corey Lewandowski's earlier plan to write a memoir of the Trump campaign has reportedly been scuttled. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)     But Kellyanne Conway, who went on to manage the campaign, is likely to emerge with her own book deal. (Chris Goodney/Bloomberg)    ""He owes her big time. She will write a book,"" says Osnos, who believes that campaign chairman Steve Bannon may write one, too. ""Donald Trump will find it irresistible to have his victory enshrined in books,"" Osnos says. ""He will not want his historic victory to go unremarked. Books have always been a big way to tell his story."" Indeed, Trump is his own veritable library, having published 16 titles, most of the you-too-can-get-rich variety. An editor at his current imprint declined to discuss future publishing plans.  The election results could weigh heavily on the outcome of forthcoming titles. Bernie Sanders's ""Our Revolution,"" to be published Tuesday, may be received differently in the wake of Hillary Clinton's defeat. Fox News host Megyn Kelly's memoir, ""Settle for More,"" which is to be released that same day and which reportedly sold for $6 million, may also be affected by Trump's success and, by extension, that of Kelly's former boss, Roger Ailes. Kelly alleges that Ailes, who advised Trump after leaving Fox, sexually harassed her when he was running the network. Barack and Michelle Obama will write books. Of that, publishers are certain.  Obama, already a best-selling author with ""Dreams From My Father"" (1995) and ""The Audacity of Hope"" (2006), is expected to command $15 million for his presidential memoir, publishing executives say. This is the same amount that Bill Clinton earned for his 2004 doorstop, ""My Life."" (Given the drastic changes in the book industry over the past dozen years -- the bankruptcy of Borders, the rising popularity of e-books vs. print, multiple mergers of imprints -- publishers don't anticipate the price spiking much higher.)   Obama will stick with Crown, insiders believe, which published his last book and is owed another volume under contract.     Meanwhile, President Obama's next book just got a whole lot more interesting. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)  His next book will now have to address Trump and what this election's results mean for the Obama legacy. Washington power lawyer Robert Barnett, who represents Obama and so many other major political players, declined to comment.  The first lady, a star in the campaign who has an even higher approval rating than her husband, will be in great demand. ""I could see her signing a multiple-book deal,"" one publishing executive says, ""a memoir, a book on food or health and fitness."" Basically, anything. And everyone wants a bit of Biden, who combines the common touch with a lengthy career and the extraordinary loss of his first wife, daughter and son.  To the vanquished go fewer spoils. Although, there is one Clinton insider whom many editors would love to sign: Huma Abedin. But ""less her role as Hillary's aide,"" one editor says, ""and more as wife and mother.""  In 2018, Random House plans to publish former attorney general Eric Holder's ""Pursuing Justice,"" written with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Douglas Blackmon, which reportedly sold for seven figures. Other former Obama Cabinet members are shopping books, but editors wonder whether the demand is there.  Editors are looking for breakout stylists to make sense of the election. ""Someone like Hunter Thompson, although this campaign is way too Hunter Thompsonesque and beyond what he could do,"" says Macmillan's John Sterling, who has edited Elizabeth Warren, Al Gore and Jimmy Carter. ""The real story is what happens to these two parties"" now that the election is over.  A bit of distance and perspective helps. ""This is not a traditional trajectory. Because it's such a stunning result, it's going to take a bit of time,"" Osnos says. The ""American intelligentsia is in a state of advanced shock, while the great American masses have just exercised their prerogative."" What so many missed, he says, is that those masses ""were already signaling"" what was coming with books.  ""During the last six to eight months of the campaign, what was really striking was the consistency of profoundly anti-Hillary books by Dick Morris, Dinesh D'Souza and Ann Coulter at the top of the bestseller list,"" he says. ""Those books represented a kind of plebiscite, while books critical of Trump had astonishingly little impact.""  "

Does he try to serve out the remaining seven years of his term under a president who has publicly questioned the FBI's integrity? Or does he stay on as a safeguard against executive power and a guide for a novice president on complex national security matters? The term of the FBI director is set at 10 years as an affirmation of the bureau's political independence, and some other chiefs, including Robert Mueller, Comey's predecessor, have served presidents of both parties. But Comey would be in the delicate position of working with a president who lobbed occasional criticisms from the campaign trail against the nation's premier law enforcement agency. Though attention had centered on whether Comey could have co-existed with a Hillary Clinton presidency, given the FBI's investigation into her email practices and his own public statements about the probe, that question applies at least equally to a Trump administration. As recently as Sunday, Trump complained that Clinton was ""protected by a rigged system"" after Comey renewed his decision not to recommend charges for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Trump repeated his assertion that Clinton was ""guilty"" and that the FBI ""knows it,"" the bureau's own public statement notwithstanding. Earlier, Trump appeared disrespectful of the Justice Department's independent decision-making power when he said he'd ask his attorney general to name a special prosecutor to take another look at Clinton. That stance went hand-in-hand with ""lock her up"" chants from some supporters. Trump's past rhetoric on the terrorism threat, including warnings that ""radical Islam is coming to our shores,"" is out of step with Comey's more measured assessments. And his stated desire to have an improved relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin comes even as federal intelligence officials have publicly accused the Russians of meddling through hacking in the American electoral process. FBI officials did not respond to a message about Comey's plans, but James McJunkin, a former FBI assistant director, said he doubted Comey was fazed by Trump's campaign trail statements. He said Comey knew when he was appointed in 2013 by President Barack Obama that his 10-year term would carry over at least two presidential administrations that might differ sharply.  ""I can't imagine he would think this is anything more than politics as usual,"" McJunkin said. ""I think politicians say whatever they think they can in order to seize the moment, and I think that once Trump settles into office, he'll realize the value of the independence that Comey displayed."" In three years as FBI chief Comey has been notable for speaking his mind, breaking with White House talking points on matters of race and policing and speaking more forcefully than others in the administration about his concerns about encryption. That independent-minded streak predates his FBI career, famously surfacing in 2004 when, as deputy attorney general in the Bush administration, he had a dramatic standoff with White House officials in the hospital room of then-Attorney General John Ashcroft over the authorization of a government surveillance program. Though the White House has not always endorsed his positions and Obama last week appeared to frown on Comey's public statements on the Clinton email matter, there have been no overt signs of the personal animus that's sometimes marred the relationships between other presidents and FBI directors. But one clear point of division in a Trump administration would come if Trump followed through on the appointment of a special prosecutor. Such a decision rests entirely with the attorney general and does not require the cooperation of the FBI or its director. So despite Comey's decision not to seek charges against Clinton over her email practices, a Trump-appointed attorney general could name an outside prosecutor to reopen the matter. It's not clear what his plans are, and Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday the matter hadn't been discussed.  ""Director Comey is a subordinate of the attorney general, and this is not his bailiwick,"" said Robert Bittman, who served as deputy independent counsel under Ken Starr. It's clear from his public statements that Comey would bristle at such an appointment. He has said the FBI's investigation was thorough and that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would have brought a case. Such conflicts over major cases, including the 1993 Waco siege and now the Clinton email matter, are ""not new to us,"" said Robert Anderson, a retired FBI executive assistant director. Comey understood when he took the FBI job ""that it wasn't going to be smooth sailing at every minute,"" McJunkin said. ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/11/10/conservatives-and-evangelicals-are-at-the-core-of-trumps-support/	‘Conservatives’ and evangelicals are at the core of Trump’s support	"   Donald Trump, right, shakes hands with Jerry Falwell Jr. during a campaign event at the Orpheum Theatre in Sioux City, Iowa, in January. (Dave Kaup/Reuters)  Exit polls reveal some disturbing information about those who have held themselves out as the most principled voices on the right. President-elect Donald Trump got 81 percent of the ""conservative"" vote. He got the same percentage of self-identified evangelicals. If you are aghast that ""America"" could elect Trump, it's important to see these voters for what they are. For decades now, conservative evangelical voters -- the ""values voters"" -- have preached to us about their fidelity to conservative ideals and their defense of Christian and American values. That's a crock, to be blunt. They elected someone who rejects conservatism as the defining ideology, who preaches fiscal recklessness, who would undermine free markets (e.g. free trade) and who repudiates the spirit of Lincoln and the party's fidelity to constitutional liberties. Evangelical leaders have lined up behind the most un-Christian person to win the White House, someone who embodies behaviors and an outlook they claim to oppose. He's a world-class narcissist, misogynist, racist and sexual philanderer. He is defined by his greed, cruelty, crudeness, vindictiveness and selfishness. Either ""conservatives"" and ""values voters"" are complete hypocrites, voting overwhelmingly for someone who repudiates their views, or those terms have become content-free. In either case, if conservatism is now Trumpism and ""values"" are now Trump values, count me and millions of others out. Perhaps the populists have absconded with the label ""conservative"" and charlatans have snatched the moniker of the ""religious right,"" but if so, the people who genuinely embrace center-right politics and whose values include civility, empathy, equality before the law, etc., need a new movement and a new way of identifying themselves. And what do the estranged people, who look upon themselves as the center-right in politics, believe? They are internationalist in foreign policy (i.e. believers in U.S. international leadership). These are the believers in federalism (for expressly this situation -- a federal government under the sway of a nut) and constitutional government (the entire Constitution, including the 14th Amendment). These are the people who do not hate government, but think the welfare state needs some serious updating. They do not repudiate science, modernity or globalism. They are defenders of legal immigration (rejecting economic illiteracy that says immigrants hurt America) and of personal freedom. They resist collectivism and believe in the inherent value and dignity of every person. There is no name for this grouping, and it defies existing partisan labels. Call them Reformers or Lincoln-ites or small ""l"" liberals (the 19th-century version). (If liberals now want to call themselves ""progressives,"" perhaps we can reclaim the term ""liberal."") Maybe they are ""Arthur Brooks conservatives."" Brooks, author of the ""The Conservative Heart: How to Build a Fairer, Happier, and More Prosperous America"" and chief of the American Enterprise Institute, has done more to promote the Reform Conservative movement than anyone else. He writes: For decades, progressives have emphasized the ""income gap"" separating rich and poor. Their cries have only grown louder since the financial crisis. They contended that income inequality would ignite a new class struggle, causing unprecedented political turmoil. This was half right. There is indeed a gap in this country, and it has now led to a political revolution, a significant realignment in American politics. But the relevant gap wasn't income. It was dignity. Too many Americans have lost pride in themselves. We sense dignity by creating value with our lives, through families, communities, and especially work. That is why American leaders so frequently talk about dignity in the context of labor. As Martin Luther King Jr. taught, ""All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence."" Conversely, nothing destroys dignity more than idleness and a sense of superfluousness--the feeling that one is simply not needed. Restoring dignity means, in part, investing in human capital and applying a holistic approach to fighting poverty. We know a rising tide lifts some boats, but not all. And it is the ones who don't automatically rise, the ones simply adrift -- be they in the inner city of Baltimore or the empty steel towns in coal country -- with whom we must concern ourselves. ""Conservatives"" and ""values voters"" have redefined themselves as Trumpkins. The center-right -- the Reformers, advocates of an opportunity party, #NeverTrumpers -- now has to define itself. The millennials who overwhelmingly rejected Trump, have grown up in a globalized economy, embrace science and praise tolerance are the perfect foot soldiers and leaders for such a movement. Now, when conservatism has mortgaged itself to Trump and the Democratic Party is in disarray, is the perfect time for them to organize."

Donald Trump scored a stunning upset over Hillary Clinton, clinching an electoral vote majority in the wee hours Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Republicans kept control of the House and were on track to do so in the Senate, meaning a unified government was likely after a head-spinning turn of events that devastated the hopes of Democrats -- and fed their worst fears. This, in a nation of gaping division and a powerful sense of pessimism, laid bare in exit polls that found voters casting their ballots without much enthusiasm for their choices. ___ A NOVEMBER SURPRISE Underestimated from start to finish, Trump the provocateur, political neophyte and flinger of insults scored major victories in Florida, Ohio and North Carolina on Tuesday, building steam against all expectations in a contest that raged across battlegrounds and turned on hair's breadth margins. Clinton pocketed Virginia -- a squeaker like Florida -- and both candidates rolled up victories in their predictable strongholds. But nothing else was predictable as the man who faced a daunting climb to the presidency inched closer to it. Trump flipped Iowa, a state that twice voted for Democrat Barack Obama. He won Utah, a slam-dunk for most Republicans but a state where many die-hard Republicans were said to find him intolerable. And he carried Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that hadn't voted for a GOP presidential candidate since the 1980s. Both candidates left multitudes of Americans dissatisfied with their choices. The struggle over whom to support was voiced by two voters in Independence, Missouri, after casting their ballots.  ""I had such a hard time, harder than I've ever had,"" said Joyce Dayhill, 59, a school bus driver who ""reluctantly"" voted for Trump. ""I just prayed on it as hard as I could and felt this was the right decision."" Said Clinton voter Richard Clevenger, 58: ""I think Trump's not stable. But I can't say there was really anything Hillary's shown me that made me feel like voting for her. But Trump just doesn't know what the hell he's doing, and he's surrounded by the Mickey Mouse Club."" ___ VOTERS SAY... The nation's fractures were reflected in surveys of voters as they left polling stations. Women nationwide supported Clinton by a double-digit margin, while men were significantly more likely to back Trump. More than half of white voters backed the Republican, while nearly 9 in 10 blacks and two-thirds of Hispanics voted for the Democrat. And people were markedly unhappy with the choice in front of them, the exit polls found. More than half of voters for each candidate cast their ballots with reservations about the one they voted for or because they disliked the alternative. Only 4 in 10 voters strongly favored their candidate. In contrast, about two-thirds of voters in 2012 strongly favored the candidate they chose. ___ CLINTON vs. TRUMP The two New Yorkers pounded each other relentlessly in the campaign's final stage, each preaching that the other is wholly unqualified, as the race tightened in the final days after a persistent if elastic lead for Clinton in preference polling. The Obamas piled on. Many Republicans agreed with Democrats that Trump would be thumped. Some in Washington ran away from him. __ SENATE SUSPENSE The night's second big mystery was which party will control the Senate, now Republican-dominated. Democrats needed to gain five seats to take an outright majority. If they gained only four -- and if Clinton were elected -- her vice president would be able to break 50-50 Senate ties. Democrats blew two of their chances, as Republican Rep. Todd Young thwarted a comeback by Evan Bayh, a former Democratic senator and governor, in Indiana; and as Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida held his Florida seat against a challenge from Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy. But Democrat Tammy Duckworth toppled Sen. Mark Kirk in Illinois, and with undecided races elsewhere, Senate control remained in play for hours. Republicans, though, held on to other key seats -- Wisconsin and North Carolina -- leaving Democrats with little chance for a turnover. ___ HOUSE HUNTING To no one's surprise, Republicans kept control of the House, if with thinned ranks. They came into the election populating that chamber in numbers not seen since the 1930s. The breakdown going into Tuesday: 247-188 for the GOP, with three vacancies. They won at least 218 House seats Tuesday night. ___ SHE-NANIGANS/HE-NANIGANS? Trump pronounced in advance that the election is rigged, in what sounded like a hedge should he lose. He warned without evidence that Clinton partisans would commit fraud and prodded his supporters to watch for misdeeds at polling stations. The prospect of vigilante election monitoring and the anger seething behind that impulse raised concerns about confrontations Tuesday, especially if the result was close. But there were no early reports of large-scale fraud, intimidation or hacking -- just long lines, an assortment of voting-machine glitches and some frayed nerves. ___ BALLOT BONANZA California, the first state to approve medical marijuana two decades ago, gave a big boost to the campaign to end the drug's national prohibition when voters passed a ballot measure to legalize the recreational use of pot. Voters in Massachusetts did the same. Arizona, Maine and Nevada also weighed whether to take that step. Florida, one of three states deciding whether to permit marijuana for medical purposes, approved the idea. Montana voted on whether to ease restrictions on an existing medical marijuana law. Arizona, Colorado and Maine were deciding whether to raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020; Washington state is considering $13.50. The federal minimum is $7.25. Voters in several states may tighten controls on guns and ammunition. ___ SOME POLITICS IS LOCAL Of a dozen races for governor, at least seven appeared competitive and most of those had Democrats on the hook. Republicans went into the campaign with 31 governorships, just one short of their historic high. And Republicans control more than two-thirds of statehouse chambers. In a key legislative battle, Republicans won control of the Kentucky House -- the lone remaining Democratic-held chamber in the South. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

We already know the prize: A big, ugly wound in the heart of American politics. Nearly two years of relentless campaigning and racially loaded rhetoric has exposed a country that is deeply fractured along lines that are hardening and raw. Race, gender and class appear to be ever more reliable predictors of whether Americans cast their ballots for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. And as Americans have retreated further into their corners, politicians have seen little motivation to understand the other side. The dynamic just played out, while America (and the world) cringed. This campaign often looked like a noisy and incoherent conversation taking place in parallel worlds, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton shouting across a daunting gulf between them. It may have been a race filled with unpredictable moments, but its near certainties are just as notable. As she heads into Election Day, Clinton is on track to win solid, and in some cases overwhelming majorities, of black, Hispanic and college-educated voters. Polls show Clinton, running to be the first female president, may also hit new levels of support among women. Trump, meanwhile, has been propelled by support from white, working-class voters, a group that according to polls may reject Clinton more decisively than any of her recent Democratic predecessors. These splits between whites and minorities, between men and women, between those with college degrees and those without, did not begin in 2016. Clinton's coalition is likely to look much like the one President Barack Obama assembled in 2008 and 2012, and has its roots much deeper. But 2016 will be the year when the gaps widened, the lines hardened and the conversation, in turn, became more painful. It will be remembered as the time when a Republican candidate could call American cities ""warzones"" without apparent worry about the feelings of the people who call them home. It will be remembered as the election in which Clinton described half of Trump's supporters as a ""basket of deplorables,"" and apologized only for her measurement. It will be remembered as a moment when Trump's closing argument was that ""everything's wrong,"" while Clinton asked ""since when do we become pessimistic?"" It's hard not to blame Trump's button-pushing candidacy for much of this strangeness. The Republican nominee's bid made a mockery of party elders' ""autopsy"" of the 2012 defeat of Mitt Romney, which bemoaned that the GOP ""offends too many people unnecessarily."" But the party's base nominated a man who questioned the legitimacy of the first black president. They chose a candidate who declared that Mexico was sending ""rapists"" across the border. They chose a 70-year-old reality-TV star who spent years making sexist remarks. The interviews should have given hints about Trump's attitudes toward women, even before the tape in which he brags about grabbing women's genitals. Trump's fate now rests in the hands of the very people he's offended. If blacks, Hispanics, young people and women turn out in large numbers, it becomes exceedingly difficult to find enough of his voters to win the day. Roughly 45 percent of the electorate are non-college educated white, the core of Trump's base, noted Brookings Institution demographer William Frey. And that share is shrinking. They made up 50 percent in 2008, he said, and 57 percent in 2000. But Trump's willingness to risk saying the thing others would not has no doubt connected with a substantial share of America's voters. The New York businessman saw the opportunity to run against his party and those wanting to restore America to a lost moment.  ""I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, ""What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job,"" he said from the lobby of his Trump Tower high rise, when he announced his campaign. If Trump wins, it will be because he understood the depths of white anxiety. It will be because he galvanized the alienated and the angry, in corners of the country where people have felt ignored through eight years of the Obama administration. Democrats acknowledge they may have left Trump this opening. For much of her campaign, Clinton had all but given up talking to white, working class men. That was for surrogates like her husband, Bill Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden, both masters of communicating to ""Bubba"" voters -- and even Obama. On Monday, Clinton began to acknowledge the work she had ahead of her.  ""Anger is not a plan, my friends,"" she said. ""If we're going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems, then we need to start talking to each other again."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
