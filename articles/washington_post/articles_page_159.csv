(Dado Ruvic/Reuters)  A week after trying to reassure the public that it was ""extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election,"" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg outlined several ways the company might try to stop the spread of fake news on the platform in the future. ""We've been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously. We've made significant progress, but there is more work to be done,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a Friday night post on his own Facebook page. He then named seven approaches the company was considering to address the issue, including warning labels on false stories, easier user reporting methods and the integration of third-party verification.   [Facebook fake-news writer: 'I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me']   ""The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,"" he cautioned, repeating the company's long-standing aversion to becoming the ""arbiters of truth"" -- instead preferring to rely on third parties and users to make those distinctions. ""We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content,"" he said. While none of the listed ideas are particularly specific, Zuckerberg's post does provide more details on the company's thinking about the problem of fake news. Facebook's concern with fake news predates the 2016 elections. Hoaxes have long plagued the site's algorithms, which incentivize the creation of content that its users would like to share, true or not. But fake news -- and specifically, Facebook's role in spreading it -- became a story of wide interest just after the elections, when critics accused the platform of influencing voters by allowing political hoaxes to regularly go viral -- particularly those favorable to President-elect Donald Trump. Zuckerberg has strongly denied that this was true, saying last week that the idea that Facebook influenced the elections in this way is ""pretty crazy,"" and that fake news ""surely had no impact"" on the outcome. Zuckerberg did not contradict this denial Friday, but his post reflects Facebook's growing acknowledgment that it's going to have to do a lot more about the plague of hoaxes and fake stories on the platform. On Monday, Facebook announced it was going to crack down on fake news sites that use its ad services to profit off hoaxes.   [Why Facebook and Google are struggling to purge fake news]   One of the ideas Zuckerberg presented Friday indicates that the company wants to go further in ""disrupting fake news economics,"" and is considering more policies like the one it just announced, along with stronger ""ad farm detection."" Another promises stronger detection of misleading content. ""This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves,"" Zuckerberg wrote. News Feed can already make some guesses about whether a post is authentic based on the user behavior around it. On Friday, Zuckerberg specified that Facebook currently watches for things like ""people sharing links to myth-busting sites such as Snopes"" to determine whether a post might be misleading or false. Zuckerberg didn't go into specifics about what more Facebook might be looking to do on this front.   [This is how Facebook's fake-news writers make money]   Facebook also indicated that it's trying to find ways to rely more on users and third parties to help flag and classify fake stories. Zuckerberg listed ""easy reporting"" methods for users, and listening more to ""third party verification"" services like fact checking sites. Zuckerberg also said Facebook was considering how to use third-party and user reports of fake news as a source for displaying warnings on fake or misleading content. The site would also improve the quality of articles that appear in ""related articles"" under news stories that are posted to Facebook. And, Zuckerberg said, Facebook would ""continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry"" on the issue. While Facebook has attracted the majority of scrutiny this week, the platform is hardly the only company struggling to address the spread of fake news on the Internet. On Monday, the top Google hit for the search ""final election count"" was a site falsely reporting that Trump had won the popular vote. Like Facebook, Google has also taken steps this week to try to stop fake news writers from using their ad services to make money.

Trump: ‘Apologize!’	"      The cast of ""Hamilton"" delivered a message to Vice President-elect Mike Pence from stage after he watched the show at Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York on Nov. 18. Pence was booed by some audience members when he first walked in. (Twitter/Hamilton via Storyful)   The cast of ""Hamilton"" was not going to throw away its shot. After Friday evening's performance, at which Vice President-elect Mike Pence was in the audience, several dozen of the Broadway musical's cast zeroed in on Pence during their curtain call. Brandon Victor Dixon -- the actor who plays Aaron Burr -- stepped forth and cut through the applause. ""You know, we have a guest in the audience this evening,"" he said to audience laughter. ""And Vice President-elect Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you will hear us just a few more moments. There's nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen. There's nothing to boo here. We're all here sharing a story of love. We have a message for you, sir. We hope that you will hear us out."" As he pulled a small piece of paper from his pocket, Dixon encouraged people to record and share what he was about to say ""because this message needs to be spread far and wide.""   ['Hamilton': Making ecstatic history]   ""Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you, and we truly thank you for joining us here at 'Hamilton: An American Musical.' We really do,"" Dixon said to further applause. ""We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us. Again, we truly thank you truly for seeing this show, this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colors, creeds and orientations.""      Some audience members booed Vice President-elect Mike Pence as he walked to his seat at a ""Hamilton"" show, held at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York on Nov. 18. (Storyful)   Pence reportedly left the auditorium before Dixon finished speaking, but a show spokesman told the Associated Press that the vice president-elect stood in the hallway and heard the full message. The unusual address quickly went viral and drew not one but two tweets from President-elect Donald Trump, who demanded the next morning that the cast apologize. ""Hamilton,"" a musical about the rise of Alexander Hamilton from his humble beginnings as an orphan and an immigrant to become one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, has a famously diverse cast. One of its oft-touted lyrics -- ""Immigrants, we get the job done!"" -- attracted a standing ovation in the middle of Friday's show, according to theatergoers who were in the room where it happened. (The lyric also appeared on a sign Friday night just outside the Richard Rodgers Theatre, where dozens had gathered to protest Pence.) Twitter exploded late Friday night with responses that cleaved into two camps: Those who cheered the cast for voicing their concerns so directly and those who found the exchange ""rude."" In the latter was Trump, who said that the cast had ""harassed"" Pence with ""cameras blazing.""   Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016     The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016   ""The Theater must always be a safe and special place,"" Trump tweeted as a follow-up. ""The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!"" Dixon responded to Trump on Twitter, saying that conversation did not amount to harassment and that he appreciated that Pence stopped to listen.   @realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen. -- Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) November 19, 2016   By Saturday morning, both #NameAPenceMusical and #BoycottHamilton were trending on Twitter. The barrage of tweets was, well, nonstop. For every tweet that threatened a boycott of the musical, there was another that cheekily mocked it -- or even encouraged a boycott, if it would mean a greater chance of getting tickets.   [Peter Marks: Why Trump gets theater completely and utterly wrong]   Although the Broadway cast's message was directed broadly at what would be an administration under Trump's presidency, Pence himself has a political track record that has been excoriated by the LGBT community. Last year, as governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act after the federal courts ruled that same-sex marriage bans in states were unconstitutional. Under the new state law, Indiana business owners could cite their religious beliefs if they didn't want to participate in same-sex weddings. Opponents said it amounted to allowing discrimination based on sexual orientation. A week later, after facing boycotts and widespread condemnation from rights groups, Pence signed an amendment clarifying that the law could not be used to discriminate against the LGBT community. He has a ""0%"" rating from the Human Rights Campaign, a nonprofit group that calls Pence ""notoriously anti-LGBTQ"" when he was chosen to be Trump's running mate. Republican Chrys Kefalas outlined Pence's anti-LGBT record in a guest column for The Washington Post: During his public career, Pence has been an outspoken opponent of equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens. In Congress, he opposed efforts to encourage foreign governments to decriminalize homosexuality and sought to block the repeal of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. As a governor, he stood against not only marriage equality, but civil unions as well. He also opposed a law prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people in the workplace and signed one opening the door to wide-ranging discrimination against these residents of his own state under the guise of religious liberty. None of this was lost on the audience, who greeted Pence's arrival to his prime orchestra seat with a mix of cheers and boos, according to the AP. Dixon told Broadway.com after Friday's performance that the cast was alerted ahead of time that Pence would be in the audience, and that they spoke to Lin-Manuel Miranda, who created ""Hamilton,"" as well as show producer Jeffrey Seller. Sam Rudy, the show's publicist, later said the speech was composed collectively by Dixon, Miranda, Seller and director Thomas Kail ""with input from members of the company."" The text was completed minutes before the end of the performance, Rudy said.   Proud of @HamiltonMusical. Proud of @BrandonVDixon, for leading with love. And proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater. -- Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) November 19, 2016   ""When we first got the call that [Pence] was coming, there was certainly a question of what we would do,"" Dixon told Broadway.com, which covers Broadway news. ""These are the opportunities that you die for."" Dixon added that he saw Pence enjoying the show and hoped the future vice president would remember the cast.   ['Hamilton's America' tells the story of a great American and a great musical]   ""I truly believe we had an effect,"" Dixon told the site. ""... If you have differences, say something! What better place than on this stage telling this story with these people? I hope he thinks of us every time he has to deal with an issue or talk about a bill or present anything."" It is unclear how Pence gained entrance to Friday's performance; spokespersons for the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to questions by email Saturday. Rudy, the show's spokesman, did not offer additional comments Saturday beyond a transcript of the speech Dixon gave. ""Hamilton"" the musical was inspired by historian Ron Chernow's biography, and Miranda also uses Hamilton's life to relay the complicated, fraught story of the American Revolution. The musical is, among many things, about the difficulty of independent governance and about the Founding Fathers' struggle to establish a democracy, despite their human flaws and differences. It is all told through a mix of hip-hop, R&B, rap and pop songs.    Like the titular character, ""Hamilton"" the musical faced unlikely odds for success. In 2009, Miranda and his musical collaborator, Alex Lacamoire, debuted a rough draft of the opening number at the White House Poetry Jam. ""I'm actually working on a hip-hop album,"" Miranda said in his introduction. ""It's a concept album about the life of someone I think embodies hip-hop: Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton."" The audience at the time, which included President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, rewarded Miranda with enthusiastic applause -- but also some apprehensive laughter. It was, after all, pitched as a hip-hop musical set in the late 1700s about a treasury secretary. Would anyone, let alone a Broadway audience, watch such a show? The answer has been a resounding yes. ""Hamilton"" has been an overwhelming hit since it debuted on Broadway last August. The show won 11 Tony Awards in June, including for best musical. Though many original cast members have since left the show, its popularity has remained unfettered -- to the point where the only ways to nab tickets are to enter a lottery or to pay hundreds of dollars on the resale market. ""We all started laughing, but Lin-Manuel was serious [about 'Hamilton'],"" President Obama said this year, reminiscing about Miranda's visit to the White House seven years ago. ""And who's laughing now?"" Since its Broadway debut, ""Hamilton"" has attracted numerous celebrities and politicians from both sides of the aisle, including Hillary Clinton and Richard B. Cheney. (Lynne Cheney, who is a historian, told the New York Times that she and her husband loved the show: ""The music was terrific. ... It's a play about human beings who achieved greatly."") In the past year, however, the musical has become increasingly politicized. The Obamas have been vocal and unabashed fans of the musical, as well as Miranda's body of work. In October, Miranda and actress Renee Elise Goldsberry rewrote the lyrics to ""Ten Duel Commandments"" and performed the rap in support of Clinton at a fundraiser for the Democratic presidential nominee.

Some Twitter users saw ""Rape Melania"" in their trending-topics boxes Sunday after images of a person holding a sign bearing the phrase during a Saturday-night demonstration in the District circulated on the social network. Photos of the chilling banner, taken at an anti-Trump rally outside the president-elect's new hotel in the nation's capital, drew strong condemnations from Trump supporters and opponents alike.

Responding to a Washington Post inquiry, Twitter emphasized that the phrase trended because people denounced it, not because people advocated sexual assault. Something similar happened in March, when the hashtag #StopIslam trended after a terrorist attack in Belgium. The Post's Caitlin Dewey provided a helpful explanation at the time: As disturbing as this hashtag might appear, however, it's actually quite the opposite. #StopIslam is only trending now because thousands of people are criticizing it. . . . The hashtag has been in circulation for at least five years, when it first entered the tea party-Twitter lexicon alongside bigoted mainstays such as #bansharia and #IslamIsTheProblem. It began spiking in Spain early this morning, when some trollish, right-wing Twitter users there began tweeting it. #StopIslam didn't really take off, however, until the backlash against it began. Nevertheless, Trump backers have seized on the ""Rape Melania"" sign and the social media trend it launched to cast opponents of the next president as hypocrites whose objections to Trump's campaign rhetoric are now illegitimate.   Liberals think Trump is bad for women so they respond by going in front of Trump tower and calling for Melania's rape. #MakesSense -- Young Conservatives (@YoungCons) November 13, 2016     Liberals one week ago: ""Love trumps Hate!""Liberals now: ""Assassinate Trump!"" & ""Rape Melania"" Yeah...the right candidate won, definitely. -- BrokenEgg (@DoatUpon) November 13, 2016     Rape Melania is trending.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks at a Hillary Clinton campaign rally in October. (Robyn Beck/Getty Images)  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Thursday that she will work with President-elect Donald Trump if he sincerely wants to rebuild the economy for the working class, but she laid down markers on several issues where there could be fights ""every step of the way."" Warren, a leading liberal whose voice is likely to be amplified without a Democrat in the White House, put Republicans on notice that the ""loyal opposition"" would vigorously oppose efforts to deport undocumented immigrants en masse, reduce the health insurance rolls, give tax breaks to the wealthy and weaken Wall Street reforms. ""If Trump and the Republican Party try to turn loose the big banks and financial institutions so they can once again gamble with our economy and bring it all crashing down, then we will fight them every step of the way,"" she declared in a speech to the executive council of the AFL-CIO in Washington.   [Liberal Democrats lash out at DNC, say overhaul needed to woo back working-class voters]   Her remarks came as Democrats in Washington engage in soul-searching about how Trump was able to so vastly outperform Hillary Clinton among white working-class voters. Warren chastised Trump for running a campaign that she said encouraged ""a toxic stew of hatred and fear."" But she acknowledged that he tapped into a genuine anger among voters anxious about their economic futures. ""There are many millions of people who did not vote for Donald Trump because of the bigotry and hate that fueled his campaign rallies,"" Warren said. ""They voted for him despite the hate. They voted for him out of frustration and anger and also out of hope that he would bring change."" Warren said voters were ""deeply frustrated about an economy and a government that doesn't work for them."" She added: ""The truth is that people are right to be angry.""   [Trump's victory exposes Obama's inability to connect with white working class]   Warren noted that during his campaign, Trump criticized Wall Street's influence on politics, talked about the need for better trade deals, pledged not to cut Social Security benefits, promised to address the rising costs of college and said he is committed to overhauling the country's crumbling infrastructure. ""He spoke to the very real sense of millions of Americans that their government and their economy has abandoned them,"" Warren said. ""And he promised to rebuild our economy for working people."" If Trump takes on these issues, Warren said, ""count me in."" ""I will push aside our differences, and I will work with him to accomplish that goal,"" she said. ""I offer to work as hard as I can and to pull as many people as I can into this effort. If Trump is ready to go on rebuilding economic security for millions of Americans, so am I and so are a lot of other people -- Democrats and Republicans."" At the top of her speech, Warren said she wouldn't ""sugarcoat"" aspects of Trump's candidacy, which she said ""started with racial attacks and then rode the escalator down."" With his election, she said, Latinos and Muslims are rightly worried about what will happen to their families. Gay couples, she said, are legitimately concerned if their marriages will be dissolved once Trump appoints new justices to the Supreme Court. And women are rightfully concerned that access to health services could disappear. Though she said Trump had set an encouraging tone since his election, the ""first job"" of Democrats now is to stand up to bigotry. ""There is no compromise here,"" Warren said. ""In all its forms, we will fight back against attacks on Latinos, African Americans, women, Muslims, immigrants, disabled Americans -- on anyone. Whether Donald Trump sits in a glass tower or sits in the White House, we will not give an inch on this, not now, not ever."""

"   President-elect Donald Trump acknowledges his son Barron after delivering his acceptance speech at the New York Hilton Midtown on Nov. 9 in New York City. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)  It's been 35 years since a First Kid has attended a school other than Sidwell Friends, the private school whose student body has included Chelsea Clinton and both Obama girls. The elite Quaker institution in leafy upper northwest Washington has educated many a political offspring, from Vice President Biden's grandchildren to Al Gore III to both Nixon daughters. But will President-elect Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, enroll their 10-year-old son, Barron, there? Some educational experts say it's unlikely. First of all, we're not even sure that The Family Trump will actually decamp from their glittery penthouse spread high atop Trump Tower (where the boy has his own floor) for the relatively more cramped residence at the White House. Which could mean Barron would continue at his current private school in Manhattan, Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School. And even if the Trumps do put down roots in Washington, some doubt that the Trumps would pick Sidwell, a school that's become associated in recent years with the Clintons and the Obamas. ""It's associated with the liberal intelligentsia of Washington,"" says educational consultant Steven Roy Goodman, who has helped many a high-profile family navigate the area's private-school landscape. Ditto the Washington International School, whose internationalist philosophy might not jibe with Trump's build-the-wall ethos. ""I don't see that as a fit here.""   [Where will Trump administration officials live in Washington?]   That still leaves plenty of options. Shall we put aside the idea that he'd attend public school, as Amy Carter did? According to D.C.'s enrollment guide, a kid living at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., is slated to attend the School Without Walls at Francis Stevens, a public pre-K-8th-grade institution in Foggy Bottom. But despite Trump's populist bent, he enrolled Barron (and all his other kids) in private schools. Starchy uniforms aren't a problem for the suit-loving boy, whose mom proudly told ABC ""isn't a sweatpants child."" And whatever school they land on will benefit from the prestige of schooling presidential offspring, the marketing value of which is more than enough to offset the hassle of a Secret Service presence. Goodman says he often counsels parents to look at their own schooling when picking a spot for their children, since that's most likely to put them in their comfort zone. ""Given what I know about President-elect Trump, which is that he comes from more of a traditional, classic background, I think that might lead you to Virginia schools,"" he says. St. Stephen's and Agnes or Burgundy Farm Country Day School in Alexandria or Westminster in Annandale might fit the bill, he says (though a 703 commute may not sit well with the Secret Service). St. Albans, the all-boys school near Washington National Cathedral (short commute!), and St. Anselm's Abbey in Northeast are often mentioned as possibilities for the future First Kid. And the Potomac School in McLean is no stranger to political kids, either -- students have included the grandchildren of former vice president Dick Cheney. Leigh Ann Cahill, of the consulting group Independent School Options, notes that the Trumps might want a school that's similar to the one their son currently attends. Columbia (where Barron is either a fourth- or fifth-grader) is a coed, secular school that's not thought of as one of Manhattan's academic pressure-cookers. The Landon School, though it's all-boys, could be a good fit, she says, or a ""religion-lite"" option, like St. Patrick's Episcopal Day. No matter the school, she says, young Barron might experience some ""social bumps"" after such a divisive political campaign. ""He might find that there's a level of awareness and even commitment among his classmates,"" she says. ""It's not necessarily like that in New York.""

(Randall Hill/Reuters)  President-elect Donald Trump's campaign staff temporarily redirected the webpage detailing his controversial proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigration into the United States, one of the most divisive and controversial policy ideas of his campaign, but swiftly sought to restore it after reporter inquiries Thursday. The proposal is detailed on a page titled, ""Donald J. Trump statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration."" Starting on Election Day, that page redirected to a new page where supporters could donate to the campaign. ""Thank you America,"" said the banner on the new page. ""We showed America the silent majority is no longer silent."" ""The website was temporarily redirecting all specific press release pages to the homepage. It is currently being addressed and will be fixed shortly,"" the campaign told The Post in a statement. The website detailing the controversial ban was restored Thursday afternoon. Trump, who has said that Muslim immigration poses a threat to the United States, in December called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.""      Donald Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown"" of Muslims entering the U.S. in December. But since then, his commitment to a ""total and complete shutdown"" has wavered repeatedly. Here's how. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   ""We can be politically correct and we can be stupid, but it's going to get worse and worse,"" Trump said in December during a campaign event in Mount Pleasant, S.C., where he read the statement released earlier in the day. ""Until we are able to determine and understand this problem, and the dangers the threat imposes, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad.""   [Past coverage: Inside Donald Trump's strategic decision to target Muslims]   The proposal was met with massive backlash from Democrats and Republicans alike, who accused the then-candidate of scapegoating Muslims and race-baiting. Trump's critics have accused him of using racial grievances and fears of radical jihadism to motivate his base. ""I think Islam hates us,"" Trump said in March during an interview with CNN. ""There's something there that -- there's a tremendous hatred there. There's a tremendous hatred. We have to get to the bottom of it. There's an unbelievable hatred of us."" The campaign sought to back away from that language earlier this year amid intense scrutiny after it was clear he would clinch the Republican presidential nomination. The repackaged proposal shifted from focusing on Muslims in particular and instead saying immigration should be suspended ""from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism."" Many at the time saw it as an attempt to broaden his appeal beyond his base for the general election. After shifting to a geography-based ban, Trump still made regular reference to jihadism and Muslims in speeches on the campaign trail. His campaign website still included the statement on the morning of Election Day, according to Web caches."

Tax receipts collected by the government rose 5 percent from October 2015 to $222 billion last month, according to the Treasury Department. Expenditures by the government fell 24 percent from the same period to $266 billion, with the decrease largely coming from smaller Medicare and Veterans Affairs payments. Those particular outlays went out in September because October 1 fell on a Saturday this year. The budget deficit is estimated to total $600 billion in fiscal 2017. That would be up slightly from $587.3 billion last fiscal year, which ended in September. The federal government has run a deficit every October since 1955. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Biden also visited a Newark coffee shop Tuesday and talked with a large crowd of University of Delaware students that gathered. ___ 2:30 p.m. Delaware's elections commissioner says early turnout appears to be high as voters cast their ballots for president and a host of statewide and local offices. Elections Commissioner Elaine Manlove says roughly 160,000 people had cast ballots at voting precincts across the state as of about noon Tuesday. That's in addition to about 24,000 Delawareans who voted by absentee ballot. Those combined totals represent more than a fourth of the state's roughly 675,600 registered voters. Manlove says there have been no reports of voting machine problems. Weather proved to be no deterrent to voters, with sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-60s. ___ 4:10 a.m. Regardless of the winners, Tuesday's election promises to significantly alter Delaware's political landscape. Voters will elect a new congressional representative, a new governor, and new leaders of the state's two largest local governments. Balloting in House and Senate races also will define the balance of power in the General Assembly, where Republicans are hoping to end years of Democratic rule and regain control of the Senate. The top of the ticket features a congressional race between Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester and Republican Hans Reigle, and a gubernatorial contest pitting Democratic congressman John Carney Jr. against Republican state Sen. Colin Bonini. Voters also will choose a new lieutenant governor and state insurance commissioner, a new Wilmington mayor, and new chief executive of New Castle County.

Tamara Robinson, spokeswoman for the D.C. Board of Elections, said by phone Tuesday that lag time between people who registered to vote caused a delay in that information showing up at precincts. She did not know how many voters were affected. Robinson says anyone who has a voter registration card, driver's license or other proof of residency will be allowed to vote. Those without proof can cast a provisional ballot. 2 p.m. District of Columbia voters are making their choices for president and some D.C. Council seats, as well as casting ballots on a referendum on statehood for the nation's capital. Retired U.S. Commerce Department worker Chiquita Reams voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton for president at her polling place on Pennsylvania Avenue Southeast. She says she's never forgotten a thank-you letter she got from then President Bill Clinton and his wife. They wrote to her after Commerce Secretary Ron Brown died in a plane crash in 1996 to thank her for coming to the White House for a week to help answer phones as Brown's funeral plans were made. Bus driver Andre Williams voted in Ward 7 for former Mayor Vincent Gray for D.C. Council. Following a campaign finance scandal, Gray lost the 2014 Democratic primary in his re-election bid. Williams says Gray ""has a good track record."" If District voters approve the statehood referendum, the proposal would still require congressional approval. Williams says he voted to support statehood because the District needs representation in Congress. ___ 4:10 a.m. District of Columbia residents are preparing to vote on whether the city should become the nation's 51st state. Tuesday's vote on a statehood referendum provides the most intrigue to a sleepy general election in the nation's capital, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 12-to-1. Hillary Clinton is expected to easily win the District's three electoral votes. Statehood has long been a politically popular, if unrealistic, goal for District leaders. The referendum won't change that, but it would create a proposed constitution with new borders that carve out the White House, the Capitol and the National Mall. It would then be sent to Congress, where Republicans could easily block it from a vote. District residents will also vote on whether former mayor Vincent Gray should return to the D.C. Council.
