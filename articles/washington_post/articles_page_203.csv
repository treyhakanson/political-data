Prosecutors said 24-year-old Kamel T.H.J. and 22-year-old Azad R. allegedly fought with the ultra-conservative Ahrar al-Sham against other rebel groups and Syrian government troops in the Aleppo area from at least August 2013 until April 2014, when the younger man was injured. The two then traveled to Turkey together and then in 2015 onto Germany for the injured fighter to receive medical care. Both suspects, whose names weren't released in line with German privacy laws, were arrested in April and have been in custody since then. Also on Friday, federal prosecutors announced the arrest of a 17-year-old Afghan citizen in Germany for alleged membership in a foreign terrorist organization. Abdullah S.K., who was arrested Thursday, is suspected of joining the Taliban in Afghanistan and participating in weapons training and combat operations from 2013 to 2015, according to investigators. The prosecutors' statement alleged he fired shots at Afghan police officers and soldiers several times. The statement did not say where in Germany he was arrested or how he came to be in the country.

"   A factory in Iowa last winter. (Cassi Alexandra/The Washington Post)  Donald Trump won a narrow victory in the Rust Belt by making a lot of promises he probably can't keep: that he will bring millions of manufacturing jobs back from Mexico and China; that he will revive coal mining; that he will restore the steel industry in Pittsburgh. But to ""jump-start America,"" as Trump pledged in a speech this summer, he won't need to do any of that. He can deliver for his blue-collar base by following a much simpler path. This set of policies would probably create millions fewer jobs than he promised, widen income inequality and almost certainly fail to produce an industrial revival. Yet it would still render meaningful economic improvement, creating jobs and lifting median wages for white workers without college degrees in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. It builds on trends already at work in the economy. And it was pioneered by a Clinton. If Trump can simply find a way to keep the economy growing even modestly for several years, and if the unemployment rate remains low, he has a good chance of presiding over a period of sustained wage growth similar to what America saw in the mid- to late 1990s, when Bill Clinton was president. Those gains will lift all workers, from elite engineers in Silicon Valley to janitors in Maine, if history is a guide. They might not bring back many factory or mining jobs, but they will boost the paychecks of the men and women who lost production jobs years ago and remain angry about it today. Best of all for Trump, those gains have already begun. For all Trump's railing against the ""terrible"" economy under President Obama, census data released in September shows that typical workers at every level, from the very poor to the very rich, experienced income growth in 2015. More in-depth analyses that track individual workers over time, such as one conducted by former Clinton economist Robert Shapiro, suggest that Americans without college degrees started to see rising incomes as far back as 2013. There are lots of questions about Trump's economic plans and how they might affect the economy -- more so than with a typical new president, because Trump declined to fill in key details of his proposals on the campaign trail. His platform included an unorthodox mix of traditional conservative and liberal-populist proposals. He would cut taxes, particularly for corporations and the rich; roll back government regulations; open more land for energy drilling; spend big on infrastructure; and reshape America's trading relationships with the world (this one is hard to forecast, because GOP leaders in Congress disagree with him on it). Contained in those proposals is an easy-to-sketch scenario for how Trump and a Republican Congress could plausibly stoke job growth for years to come. It's the scenario that many Wall Street economists and traders in financial markets appear to be betting on: Trump and Congress agree quickly on tax cuts, deregulation and an infrastructure push, and major trade changes are delayed or nixed. You can see the path for Trump in the Wage Growth Tracker tool developed by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. It documents nominal wage gains -- which is to say, the growth of workers' pay, not adjusted for inflation -- across several demographic groups, one of which is workers without college degrees. It shows that wage growth is accelerating for those non-degree-holding workers, from a 3 percent clip at the beginning of 2015 to nearly 4 percent growth this October. At that pace, wages for that group will soon be growing at a rate similar to that in the early years of Clinton's second term -- still a percentage point less than the red-hot growth of the very late '90s, but nevertheless reminiscent of a period remembered fondly in many economically beleaguered parts of the Midwest and Northeast. That period, as today, was characterized by low unemployment and modest inflation. In the best-case scenario for Trump, 2017 would look a lot like 1997, which began with unemployment at 5.3 percent, just a few tenths of a percentage point higher than where it is now. Arguably, the greatest success of Clinton's second term was simply that he avoided stepping on the job growth that continued for the next several years and that eventually drove nominal wage growth above 5 percent per year for non-college workers. If unemployment keeps falling now like it did then, workers can expect a ""slow and steady increase"" in their inflation-adjusted incomes over the next few years, says Jonathan Willis, a vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. To reach the rapid wage gains of the late '90s, he added, ""we would need another three or four years of solid job growth."" That's plausible for Trump. He could sign a big tax-cut bill, negotiated with and passed by House and Senate Republicans. Such a bill would almost certainly tilt its benefits, both in total dollars and in percentage terms, to business owners, shareholders and the highest-income earners. The big question, based on the differences between the House GOP blueprint and Trump's campaign plan, is how much of a break middle-class and lower-income taxpayers would see. Economists generally expect that those tax cuts, whatever form they take, would stoke job growth by increasing consumer demand. (Even many liberal economists concede that tax cuts for the rich are a form of economic stimulus, though not a very efficient one in their models.) Another boost could come from a deficit-financed plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure. Conservative economists, such as John Cochrane at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, contend that Trump could further fuel job growth by repealing the Affordable Care Act and rolling back Obama-era regulations on the financial sector and other industries. Their prediction is that those changes would give businesses more freedom and incentive to invest in America and hire American workers. The new jobs would very likely be in service sectors, such as home health care and retail, often requiring relatively few skills. But thanks to wage pressures, those types of jobs would pay much better than they did in the years after the recession. There are economic and political risks for Trump in each of those policies, of course. The tax bill and, to a lesser extent, the infrastructure push have the potential to balloon the federal budget deficit. Rolling back Wall Street regulations could raise the risk of another financial crisis and sit poorly with Trump's populist base, which remains furious at bankers over the last crisis; scrapping environmental rules would hurt the fight to avert catastrophic climate change. And then there are the Trump proposals Wall Street is discounting right now: his promises to deport millions of immigrants quickly and to threaten tariffs on trading partners such as China and Mexico in an effort to revive the millions of manufacturing jobs lost in the Rust Belt since the turn of the century. Trump's advisers believe that those policies would stimulate job growth and bring millions of working-age Americans who are currently out of the labor force back to job sites. Most forecasters say the policies would, instead, dampen job growth by reducing the labor force and raising prices on imported consumer goods, and would possibly push America into recession. Avoiding recession is a must for Trump if he wants to maintain his Rust Belt appeal. Since the 1970s, recessions have followed a damaging pattern for workers in traditionally male, blue-collar industries, including mining, manufacturing and construction. When downturns hit, those industries shed jobs. When good times return, they rarely make up any of the lost ground. (In 1970, a quarter of the American labor force worked in one of those blue-collar industries. Today, it's about one-eighth.) Crucially for Trump, his tax cut and infrastructure plans alone could end up triggering recession. There's a good chance -- which markets are already pricing in -- that those plans could stoke higher inflation. The Federal Reserve could respond by raising interest rates more quickly than expected, which could pump the brakes on growth and possibly cause a downturn. This is the scenario that should most worry Trump and his team as they craft policy. It's possible to avoid, though there aren't many examples in American history of the economy humming along at low unemployment for several years without eventually sliding downhill. What Trump needs is just enough policy fuel to continue growth, without provoking a shock -- from a trade war, interest rate hikes or anything else -- that would send the economy tumbling. He'll need to walk a narrow path to pull it off. Sound familiar?"

Las oficinas que ofrecen asesoria legal tienen cada vez mas clientes. En las escuelas publicas deben responder a una lluvia de preguntas de padres y estudiantes. Desde las elecciones, las duras afirmaciones del presidente electo en Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, sobre inmigracion han creado ansiedad entre los inmigrantes de todo el pais, sin importar su estatus legal. Acuden a abogados, escuelas, grupos de derechos y oficinas del Congreso en busca de ayuda.  ""Estamos operando con muchas incognitas, y hay ciertos temores asociados a eso"", dijo Vanessa Esparza-Lopez, abogada en el National Immigrant Justice Center de Chicago. En Chicago, una linea telefonica gestionada por el mayor grupo de derechos de migrantes del estado recibio mas de 330 llamadas en la semana posterior a las elecciones, comparado con el centenar que recibe normalmente. En Denver, autoridades escolares enviaron una carta a los padres en respuesta a sus dudas sobre los efectos de los comicios presidenciales sobre los estudiantes que no tienen permiso de residencia. El Legal Assistance Group de Nueva York dijo que recibe entre 40 y 60 llamadas diarias sobre inmigracion, el doble que antes de las elecciones. La Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights de Los Angeles reporto 19 consultas en un solo dia, todas relacionadas con la ciudadania. Las dudas mas acuciantes proceden de jovenes que se benefician de un programa federal instaurado en 2012 por el gobierno del presidente Barack Obama que deja en suspenso la deportacion de jovenes traidos al pais de forma ilegal cuando eran menores y les concede permisos de trabajo. Unas 740.000 personas se acogieron al programa llamado Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA, por sus siglas en ingles). Abogados senalan que el programa es vulnerable porque fue creado a traves de una orden ejecutiva del presidente, sin el respaldo de una ley, lo que hace que los posibles nuevos solicitantes duden sobre si inscribirse en el. Andrea Aguilera, una estudiante universitaria de 20 anos en un suburbio de Chicago, se siente en el limbo ya que la documentacion que obtuvo a traves del DACA expira el proximo ano. Entro al pais cruzando la frontera con Mexico clandestinamente cuando tenia cuatro anos y mantuvo su estatus migratorio casi en completo secreto hasta que hace cuatro anos pudo obtener un permiso de trabajo gracias al DACA. Desde entonces trabajo como cajera de un supermercado y becaria en una empresa financiera del centro de la ciudad. Dos de sus hermanos estan tambien en el programa; otro es ciudadano estadounidense.  ""Ha sido dificil concentrarse en los estudios"", dijo Aguilera. ""No se que nos va a pasar"". Durante la campana electoral, Trump prometio deportar a los 11 millones de inmigrantes que se estima viven en el pais sin la documentacion pertinente y construir un muro a lo largo de la frontera con Mexico. El republican no ha explicado como va a proceder y recientemente rebajo el numero de eventuales expulsiones del pais. El Center for Immigration Studies, que aboga por una menor inmigracion, explico que el aumento de la actividad se debe a la incertidumbre sobre si el gobierno de Trump aplicara las leyes ya existentes. Jon Feere, analista legal de la organizacion con sede en Washington, dijo que los inscritos en el DACA eran conscientes de los riesgos cuando entraron al programa. Otros no tienen mucho de que preocuparse.  ""Los que cumplen la ley no tienen nada de que preocuparse"", declaro. Sin embargo, incluso los inmigrantes con estatus legal permanente se sienten inseguros desde las elecciones. Abogados y organizaciones de inmigrantes sostienen que los titulares de la ""green card"" -- la tarjeta de residencia permanente para inmigrantes -- sienten que deben asegurarse que que todo esta en orden con tramites como la solicitud para renovacion el documento por temor a que la ley pueda cambiar con el nuevo gobierno. La mayoria de los inmigrantes puede solicitar la ciudadania entre tres y cinco anos despues de obtener la tarjeta verde. Unos nueve millones de inmigrantes con tarjeta verde podrian optar ahora a la ciudadania, segun los datos mas recientes del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional. Algunos buscan aclarar cuestiones sobre cuando pueden patrocinar a familiares que residen en el extranjero.  ""La gente necesita tranquilidad"", dijo Irina Matiychenko, que dirige la unidad de proteccion a inmigrantes en el Legal Assistance Group de Nueva York. ""La gente necesita orientacion"". En Phoenix, los lideres locales planearon un encuentro el fin de semana acerca de lo que significa ser un inmigrante en Arizona. El objetivo es ""mostrar el camino de la confianza y la unidad"". Personal de la oficina del representante democrata de Chicago Luis Gutierrez, firme defensor de los derechos de los inmigrantes irregulares, reportaron un incremento de actividad con al menos 60 nuevas solicitudes de ciudadania en las dos ultimas semanas. Distritos escolares, incluidos los de Chicago y Denver, utilizaron las elecciones para recordar cual es su politica. El superintendente del distrito escolar de Denver, Tom Boasberg, dijo que se enviaron cartas en cuatro idiomas a las viviendas de los 90.000 estudiantes en respuesta a lo que los profesores escuchaban de alumnos y padres. El texto reitero que las autoridades escolares no preguntan por el estatus migratorio de los ninos cuando se matriculan.  ""En un momento de temor y preocupacion, se propagan muchos rumores y desinformacion"", dijo. ""Y por eso es tan importante dar informacion objetiva precisa a nuestras familias de una fuente muy fiable"". ___ Los periodistas de The Associated Press Astrid Galvan en Phoenix, Colleen Slevin en Denver y Amy Taxin en Santa Ana, California, contribuyeron a este despacho. ___ La periodista de AP Sophia Tareen esta en Twitter en http://twitter.com/sophiatareen.

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/12/heres-why-trump-is-already-waffling-on-obamacare/	Hereâ€™s why Trump is already waffling on Obamacare	"   President Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House on Nov. 10. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)  President-elect Donald Trump is already signaling that he might backpedal on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, telling the Wall Street Journal Friday that he'd consider hanging onto popular Obamacare provisions such as ""the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of patients' existing conditions, and a provision that allows parents to provide years of additional coverage for children on their insurance policies."" ""I like those very much,"" he said. Three days into his transition, and it looks like the real estate tycoon is becoming a politician. His apparent reluctance to scrap the entire ACA is understandable. In the long run, waffling on repeal will probably be less painful than causing a health-care catastrophe. Trump capitalized on Republicans' long dislike of the Affordable Care Act by focusing on news, in the last weeks of the campaign, that premiums would increase sharply for many Americans purchasing insurance through its exchanges. But he didn't promise a pared-down health-care regime. He promised to repeal and replace Obamacare with a plan that would cover everyone, offer more choice and cost less. It was a populist approach to health care that wasn't new. Sixteen years ago, in ""The America We Deserve,"" he wrote: ""I'm a conservative on most issues, but a liberal on this one,"" an appeal that didn't hurt candidate Trump. But President Trump is likely to find the issue challenging. Repeal requires only the will of Congress. Replacement is subject to the laws of economics and mathematics, which aren't on his side. In the campaign, Trump proposed replacing the Affordable Care Act with a tax deduction for individuals who pay for health insurance out of pocket. Like all tax deductions, such a deduction is worth more to people with higher tax rates. But most of those who would be left without coverage by an ACA repeal are lower-income individuals with tax rates that are already low. Thus, the benefit they'd receive from a deduction doesn't come close to the financial hit they would experience from an ACA repeal. Independent estimates suggest repeal would cause about 20 million people to lose coverage, only one-quarter of whom would purchase insurance with the deduction. The rest wouldn't be able to afford it. Perhaps with this in mind, Trump proposed several steps to lower the cost of health insurance. Each of them represents Republican-friendly alternatives to the current system, but none is likely to have the hoped-for impact. ""Our replacement plan,"" Trump told a crowd in Roanoke, Va., in September, ""includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts, with support for those who need it."" HSAs, which combine tax-free savings with a high-deductible insurance policy -- for families, a deductible of $2,600 or more -- have long been a conservative favorite. In fact, legislation enabling HSAs was passed as part of the Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2003. There has been a very rapid increase in the use of HSAs in the interim, as employers offering health plans turned to them to offset rising health costs. HSAs may be reasonable for higher-income families, who can afford to put aside a portion of their household income each month for future health-care spending, but they are not a compelling answer for people of modest means. Few families who will lose ACA coverage will want to pay thousands of dollars for an insurance policy that doesn't pay out anything until they have spent another $2,600 on direct medical bills. It's possible that Trump could subsidize the insurance premiums or savings account for moderate-income families, but such a subsidy would drive up government costs immensely. The large number of families with modest incomes who need help affording health insurance is the primary reason why the Affordable Care Act subsidies were not more generous. When it comes to buying insurance, Trump says, ""We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines."" The idea is that insurers should be free to sell in any state, regardless of where they are domiciled. A laudable concept in spirit: Insurance market competition allows consumers more choice and could drive down premiums. But experience is not on Trump's side. Three states have already eliminated restrictions on out-of-state sales of insurance -- Georgia, Maine and Wyoming -- and not a single insurer has entered any of these markets. Why? To sell insurance in one of these states, the big barrier for carriers isn't meeting individual state regulatory requirements. Rather, an insurer has to have contracts with local hospitals and doctors that an out-of-state insurer doesn't have. When they try to set them up, insurance carriers find that doctors and hospitals charge them high prices; Why offer low prices to an insurer that has few enrollees, and thus doesn't have leverage to direct a large volume of patients elsewhere? Facing high provider prices and correspondingly limited enrollment, there is no new entry, and no new competition. The only way for Trump to address this would be to regulate the maximum prices that providers are allowed to charge to insurers. And that seems unlikely for a president-elect and Congress who have railed against excessive federal regulations. Rather than encouraging competition, the primary impact of cross-state purchasing would be to allow insurers to change their corporate location in order to avoid consumer protections. Think about it: Why are most credit card companies headquartered in Delaware or South Dakota? Because those states allow banks to charge any interest rate they want, thus avoiding consumer-protection laws in states where the borrower is located. If cross-state purchasing of health insurance is allowed, enterprising state governments will seek to attract health insurers by allowing them free reign to price the sick at any rate they chose, impose annual and lifetime limits on coverage and make accessing care difficult. To prevent this, Trump would need to re-create the consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act -- the same ones he has promised to wipe away. Other Trump promises will increase the pressure he faces on health care. He promised large income, corporate and estate tax cuts, generally tilted toward high-income individuals. If Trump wants to balance the budget -- as Republicans say they want to do -- he and Congress will need to find areas of spending they can cut. With about one of four federal dollars spent on health care, it's impossible to do that and avoid cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Politically, though, as Trump said during primary season, ""Abolishing Medicare, I don't think you'll get away with that one. It's actually a program that's worked. It's a program that some people love, actually."" Following the lead of congressional Republicans, Trump favors block-granting Medicaid dollars to states. He hasn't said how the block grants would compare with existing spending, but most block grant proposals save money by growing the block grant less rapidly than medical costs increase. One wonders what Trump's supporters with disabled children or elderly parents will think when states have to cut coverage for them. But even the savings from a Medicaid block grant is not likely to be enough to offset the size of the tax cuts that Trump calls for -- estimated at $3.7 trillion to $5.9 trillion over the next decade. Instead, Trump would likely need to turn to the other Republican standby: replacing the Medicare guarantee of coverage for seniors with a voucher that seniors would use to shop for private insurance. In many recent Republican proposals, the voucher amount is set by law to grow less rapidly than underlying medical costs. Effectively, this saves the government money by transferring some of the costs of Medicare to beneficiaries. House Speaker Paul Ryan recently indicated that he wants Medicare privatization to be part of the Obamacare repeal. Nor would this be the only weight Trump's policies would place on the elderly. The Affordable Care Act fills in the ""doughnut hole"" in Medicare's coverage of prescription drugs -- the range of spending where insurance does not pay for any of the cost of medications, and beneficiaries are responsible for the full amount. Repealing the Affordable Care Act shifts these high costs back to less-healthy seniors. There is little public support for block-granting Medicaid, turning Medicare into a voucher program or reinstating the Medicare doughnut hole. Only one-quarter of Americans support turning Medicare into a voucher program, including less than one-third of Republicans. Medicaid block grants are supported by only one-third of Americans, including only half of Republicans. Trump's mantra, ""Make America Great Again,"" means different things to different people, but it's hard to imagine that anyone thinks it means going back to the days when fewer people were covered for health risks and those who are sick paid more for it. To be clear, I am an unlikely person to advise Trump. I worked on President Clinton's health-care reform initiative and was a health-care adviser to President Obama's presidential campaign in 2008. I favor improving, not abandoning, Obamacare. But if Trump were to seek my guidance, here is what I would suggest. First, heed Colin Powell's advice to President George W. Bush in another context: If you break health care, you own it. Don't repeal Obamacare until after you've developed a real plan that covers as many people as the ACA at a cost that is affordable and that has majority public support. Second, focus on an aspect of the health-care debate where your views align with majority opinion: drug pricing. During his campaign, Trump advocated that Americans be allowed to re-import pharmaceuticals from other countries. Branded pharmaceuticals sell for much more in the United States than in other countries. Allowing re-importation would enable consumers, state and local governments, and the federal government to reap significant savings. Three in four Americans support drug re-importation. Indeed, it is the only item of health-care agreement between large groups of Democratic and Republican voters. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for example, supports this idea. But even here, implementation will be an uphill climb. Americans might get the right to buy prescription drugs from Canada, but what should be done when pharmaceutical companies refuse to sell to Canadian pharmacies that export to the United States? Or when pharmaceutical companies get one version of a drug approved in the United States and a very slightly different version approved abroad? Politically, the biggest opponents of efforts to reduce pharmaceutical prices are likely to be congressional Republicans, many of whom are beneficiaries of pharmaceutical industry contributions. Is Trump willing to spite his own party and work primarily with Democrats? One clue may come from the fact that Trump's presidential transition website omits any mention of pharmaceutical re-importation from its list of health-care priorities. However he proceeds, Trump will find that health care goes from being an applause line on the campaign trail to a headache once he's in office. It is entirely possible that Obamacare will cut into the popularity of more than one president. Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that for HSAs, the minimum high deductible increased from $2,500 to $2,600."

""The whole world knows whats happening in Minnesota,"" Trump said. ""How stupid are our leaders."" (The Washington Post)   MINNEAPOLIS -- Donald Trump emphasized his strict opposition to admitting refugees into the United States over concerns about terrorism as he made a closing pitch to voters in a trio of key battleground states Sunday. While the Republican presidential nominee regularly touts his call to halt the flow of Syrian refugees into the United States, during a campaign stop in Minneapolis, he singled out Somalis, mentioning a mall stabbing rampage in the region carried out by a Somali immigrant. Although Trump's words could resonate with conservative base in the state, particularly those with deep concerns about terrorism and the Islamic State, Minnesota has long been a Democratic stronghold in the presidential contests, meaning that Trump probably needs to win centrist and crossover voters to stand a realistic chance of victory. With his comments about minorities, refugees and immigrants having already come under heavy criticism from Democrats, he risked doing further damage to his image in the political middle and left with his latest remarks. ""Here in Minnesota, you've seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without your support or approval, and with some of them then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world,"" said Trump, using another name for the Islamic State. Trump said that as president, he would not admit refugees ""without the support of the local community where they are being placed."" Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant, went on a stabbing rampage at a St. Cloud mall in September before he was shot dead by a police officer. Trump mentioned the attack in his remarks and portrayed it as symptomatic of a larger problems. ""Everybody's reading about the disaster taking place in Minnesota,"" he said at one point.    Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump rallies with supporters in a cargo hangar at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)  The Twin Cities is home to the nation's largest community of Somali immigrants. The FBI's pursuit there of 10 young men from the Somali American community, whom they accused of conspiring to join the Islamic State and kill on its behalf, attracted national attention. Just as he did in Minneapolis, Trump seized on fears about refugees living in Michigan at a later rally in a suburb of Detroit. ""Here in Michigan you've seen firsthand the problems caused with the refugee program. ... With large numbers of poorly vetted refugees coming into your state -- without your knowledge, without your support and without your approval -- it puts your security at risk and it puts enormous pressure on your schools and your community resources,"" he said. Trump mentioned refugees again later at a stop near Pittsburgh.      Khizr Khan spoke at a rally for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Manchester, N.H. Khan made a passionate speech at the Democratic National Convention about his son, Humayun Khan, who died while serving in Iraq as a captain in the Army in 2004. (The Washington Post)   Democrat Hillary Clinton campaigned in New Hampshire on Sunday with Khizr Khan, a Muslim American whose son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, was killed in the Iraq War. Trump attacked the Khans for criticizing him during a speech at the Democratic National Convention, drawing widespread criticism earlier in the campaign. Trump called last year for a ban on Muslim immigrants over concerns about terrorism. While he no longer touts the proposed ban in those words on the campaign trail, preferring instead to say he is focused on blocking the flow of people from countries where terrorism has been a problem, the proposal remains on his website.
