Officer Michelle Tannehill said two juveniles are in custody and are considered suspects in the murder of 15-year-old Javon Wilson, who was shot in the head at his home in Chicago on Friday. Wilson is the grandson of longtime U.S. Rep. Danny Davis.  ""The detectives are continuing their interrogations and charges are expected,"" Tannehill said on Saturday night. The juveniles in custody have not been identified. Police earlier said the shooting stemmed from a dispute over basketball shoes. Wilson knew his attackers and they may have been friends at some point. Davis said he was told that a 15-year-old boy had traded slacks for shoes with Wilson's 14-year-old brother, but thought better of the trade and went to Wilson's house with a 17-year-old girl. He said the pair forced their way in the house and argued with Wilson before the boy pulled a gun and fired. Davis, a Democratic member of the House for 20 years, told The Associated Press Saturday that his grandson was a victim of a world where gun violence has become commonplace.  ""It's almost, just the way it is. People think nothing of it,"" Davis said.  ""Youngsters invariably say, 'I know a lot of guys who've got guns. I know a lot of girls who've got guns,'"" Davis said. ""It becomes a part of the culture of an environment that has got to change."" Chicago has seen a dramatic rise in the number of shootings and homicides, with August being the deadliest month in the city in two decades. There have been 673 homicides so far this year, including the fatal shootings of the cousin of Chicago Bulls basketball star Dwyane Wade, a Chicago police officer's son and the son of a famed percussionist. Davis, who was re-elected this month to his 11th term in the 7th Congressional District and is a former Chicago alderman, was in Chicago on Friday and spoke with reporters after talking to police. He wondered how the shooter obtained the gun and said he'd continue to try to combat gun violence. Davis said his grandson was ""a pretty regular kid"" who loved playing basketball and knew all the pros and their stats, who also loved music and whose grades were improving after a rough patch.  ""The question becomes where does a 15-year-old obtain a gun? Who let the 15-year-old have a gun and under what circumstances?"" Davis asked. ""There's no answer for that except that the availability of guns is so prevalent in America to the point where you almost can't tell who has a gun"" anymore. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

"   (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)  Since they took control of the House in 2010, Republicans have held more than 60 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, in what surely must be a record in American legislative history. So of course they're going to get right on it as soon as President Trump is inaugurated and can sign the repeal. In fact, Kellyanne Conway said yesterday that Trump is considering ""convening a special session"" of Congress to repeal the law. ""It would be a pretty remarkable move,"" she said, which indeed it would be, because Congress will already be in session, but apparently the people in Donald Trump's inner circle are under the impression that Congress is like the Texas legislature that meets once every two years and has to be called back into special session to pass laws. But maybe they aren't going to just repeal it after all. Here's a report from Alexander Bolton of the Hill: Congressional Republicans face internal divisions over how far to go in repealing and replacing ObamaCare, one of their top political priorities of the past six years, without disrupting the lives of millions of Americans.  Conservatives like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) and Utah Sen. Mike Lee (R) are pushing for the law to be ripped out ""root and branch,"" something Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has promised to do. ...   But centrist Republicans are worried about millions of people being kicked off insurance rolls if ObamaCare is repealed. They're hoping to reach compromises with Democrats in hopes of transitioning as smoothly as possible away from the law.  Reach compromises with Democrats? What madness is this? What's going on here is that the whole idea of ""repealing"" the ACA has been something of a scam. For six years, Republicans have told their constituents that Obamacare is a freedom-crushing demon spit forth from the very fires of hell. And it became their primary vessel of symbolic rebellion against President Obama, the way they could show the folks back home that they're sticking their middle finger at that usurper in the White House. That's why they took so many pointless repeal votes. It was a way of saying to their voters, ""Hey, don't forget I still hate Obama.""  Having gone down that road, they now have to follow through -- or at least do something that makes it look like they're following through. The problem is that while ""Obamacare"" as this vague thing few people understand is quite unpopular, most of the things Obamacare actually does are quite popular. Undoing them in one fell swoop would be an absolutely catastrophic disruption of the American health-care system, and undoing them at all will risk an enormous backlash. That's what happens when you toss 20 million people off their coverage and make everyone else's less secure. So what do you do? The answer is that you say you're repealing the law, but you don't actually repeal it. You repeal some parts of it -- the unpopular ones -- while trying to leave the stuff people like intact. Then you say, ""We repealed Obamacare! Woo-hoo!"" and hope your constituents don't notice that you actually didn't. Trump has already pointed to two things in the law that he wants to keep: the ability of young people to stay on their parents' insurance and the ban on insurers denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions. But as Sarah Kliff notes, Trump seems to have no genuine beliefs about health care; his position changes constantly, often in response to whoever he happened to talk to that day.  Since Republicans in Congress have never been able to agree on their ""repeal and replace"" plan, we don't know exactly what will happen. But even if they do keep significant parts of the law, what they get rid of will likely cause tremendous disruption and suffering. Just one example: They say they're keeping the ACA's ban on pre-existing condition denials, but that's not really true. First, we'll be going back to the days when you had to tell the insurance company every time you've been to the doctor in the past five or 10 years when you apply for coverage -- remember how much fun that made the application process? And if you do have pre-existing conditions, like tens of millions of Americans do, you'll be shunted off to a ""high-risk pool,"" which is without a doubt the absolute worst way to cover people with pre-existing conditions. That's because it puts all the expensive patients in one pool. Which means that high-risk pool coverage will almost inevitably mean coverage that is incredibly expensive and not as comprehensive as it ought to be. But Republicans have no choice but to do that if they're going to eliminate the individual mandate (which is one of their top priorities), because with no mandate and a ban on pre-existing condition denials, you'd be able to just wait until you got sick or injured to acquire insurance, and if people were free to do that, the entire insurance market would collapse. That gives you a sense of how complicated ""repeal and replace"" is going to be. But it's important to understand that the decisions about what to keep and what to jettison will be absolutely, 100 percent dictated by politics. That's because when it comes to health-care policy, Republicans just don't care. It just isn't their thing. Apart from a very small number of conservative policy wonks, conservatives' central idea about health care for as long as we've been talking about it as a policy matter, well over half a century now, has been that whatever Democrats are for, they're against. In periods where it isn't a pressing issue, they aren't feverishly coming up with plans, analyzing the problems in the system and worrying about how they can be fixed. It just isn't their thing. They'd much rather talk about taxes or regulations or the military or any number of other issues. The fact that millions of people still don't have coverage -- even if the ACA dramatically reduced that number -- isn't a problem they think needs to be fixed, or at least not one they're willing to devote any energy to. So now, apart from a couple of elements of the ACA (like the individual mandate) that rub them the wrong way, most of them don't really care what either ""repeal"" or ""replace"" looks like in its details. They're going to pass something, and then call it a victory. But the details are what will have an enormous impact on all of our lives."

Canada's Gildan Activewear is buying the American Apparel brand, notorious for sexually provocative ad campaigns, for $66 million. The Los Angeles retailer first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 2015, about a year after it fired Charney for violating its sexual harassment policy. Charney's lengthy legal campaign to retake control of the company was rejected by a bankruptcy court judge in January. Charney denies the sexual harassment charges and has claimed the company was taken from him in a ""coup."" The company brought in CEO Paula Schneider to usher the company out of bankruptcy, but she left earlier this year as the turnaround stalled. For more than a decade, American Apparel has been defined by, and criticized for, its racy ads, often depicting barely-dressed young women in sexually suggestive poses. Though the ad campaign helped put American Apparel on the map, it has struggled like other retailers since the recession. A host of mall staples -- Aeropostale, Pacific Sunwear, Wet Seal and Deilia's --have also filed for bankruptcy protection in the past few years. Even as department stores like Macy's, Kohl's and Penney's prepare for a holiday season that may be the best in years, they have been unable to produce consistently positive results because consumer behavior has shifted so drastically, both in where and what is bought. Many more people shop on online, and more dollars are going toward technology, travel, or nights out. American Apparel, which manufactures all of its clothes in the U.S., has lost money every year since 2010. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010.   Following a brief market plunge, the president-elect's speech last Tuesday night was more conciliatory than many expected and emphasized his commitment to infrastructure investment. Investors have, on balance, concluded that the combination of a shift to very expansionary fiscal policy and major reductions in regulation in sectors ranging from energy to finance to drug pricing will raise demand and reflate the U.S. economy.  The result has been a rise in real interest rates and inflation expectations, along with a strong stock market and a strong dollar. Experience suggests, however, that initial market responses to major political events are poor predictors of their ultimate impact. The late MIT economist Rudiger Dornbusch made an extensive study of the results of populist economic programs around the world, finding that while they sometimes had immediate positive results, over the medium- and long-term they were catastrophic for the working class in whose name they were launched. This could be the fate of the Trump program given its design errors, implausible assumptions and reckless disregard for global economics. I have long been a strong advocate of debt-financed public investment in the context of low interest rates and a decaying U.S. infrastructure, so I was glad to see Trump emphasize it. Unfortunately, the plan presented by his advisers, Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross, suggests an approach based on tax credits for equity investment and total private-sector participation that will not cover the most important projects, not reach many of the most important investors and involve substantial mis-targeting of public resources.     Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump delivered a speech in Gettysburg, Pa., on Oct. 22 laying out his vision for his first 100 days in office if elected president, including immigration enforcement, creating at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax cuts and repeal of the Affordable Care Act. (The Washington Post)   Many of the highest-return infrastructure investments -- such as improving roads, repairing 60,000 structurally deficient bridges, upgrading schools or modernizing the air traffic control system -- do not generate a commercial return and so are excluded from his plan. Nor can the non-taxable pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds that are the most promising sources of capital for infrastructure take advantage of the program. I am optimistic regarding the efficacy of fiscal expansion. But any responsible economist has to recognize that, past a point, it can lead to some combination of excessive foreign borrowing, inflation and even financial crisis. As Dornbusch showed, in emerging markets this can happen quite quickly. In the United States the process would take longer. Even without taking account of the likely costs of the infrastructure plan (which the Trump team badly underestimates) or the proposed defense build-up, the Trump tax reform proposals are too expensive. Many, such as the proposed abolition of the estate tax, will benefit only the high-saving wealthy. While drastic changes in the proposed domestic program are necessary for it to work, the general direction of increasing public investment, reforming taxes and adjusting regulation is appropriate. The same cannot be said of Trump's global plan, which rests on a misunderstanding of how the world economy operates. Consider the immediate effects of Trump's victory. The Mexican peso has depreciated about 10 percent relative to the dollar over fears of new protectionist policies, and many other emerging market currencies have also fallen sharply. The impact of this change is to raise the cost of anything the U.S. exports to Mexico and to lower the cost of anything Mexico exports to the United States.  It will also make Mexico and other emerging markets much cheaper relative to the United States for global companies. So U.S. workers, particularly in manufacturing, will face increased pressure. The plan seems to assume that we can pressure countries not to let their currencies depreciate, as suggested by the intention to have the new treasury secretary name China as an exchange-rate manipulator. This is ludicrous. While there are reasonable arguments that China manipulated its exchange rate for commercial advantage in the past, the reality is that for the past year the country has intervened to prop up its exchange rate. The same is true of most emerging markets. Not even U.S. presidents with political mandates can repeal the laws of economics. Populist economics will play out differently in the United States than in emerging markets. But the results will be no better. All with a stake in the global economy must hope that now, as has happened often in the past, a U.S. president faced with the responsibility of governing preserves the valid core of campaign economic plans while making major adjustments.

" NEW YORK -- The uncertainty surrounding who will be the next U.S. president is over. But with people still bitterly divided, are they ready to think about a holiday shopping season that thrives on feelings of joy and peace? Reports from retailers, including department stores like Kohl's, Macy's and J.C. Penney, showed that shoppers had been starting to step up their spending in the weeks leading up to the election won by Republican Donald Trump. And the companies are generally optimistic about a good holiday season, pointing to higher wages for workers and leaner inventories.  ""A relatively happy employed consumer base is a willing group of consumers,"" said Greg Portell, a partner in A.T. Kearney's consumer products and retail and communications, media and technology group. Pointing to the political environment is an easy excuse for retailers, analysts said. Even after the rancor of the campaign, they believe, Trump supporters will be in the mood to spend and those who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton or another candidate may shop as a balm on their emotions.  ""It's retail therapy either way,"" says Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD Group, a market research firm. What the department stores were seeing before the election was a bit of a mixed bag. Macy's and Kohl's raised their sales outlooks this week as they saw improvement, even as they posted another quarter of smaller declines. Nordstrom reported an increase in the key sales measure, and raised its earnings outlook. But Penney cut its annual outlook for a key sales measure after reporting a surprise sales drop as it wrestled with weak clothing sales. Macy's had specifically cited strength in apparel, across the men's, women's and children's departments. Like some other retailers, Penney's business has been volatile, bouncing back in the summer after a tough start to the year. In general, a dip in buying is normal before a presidential election as people are distracted and advertising space is taken up by political ads, but spending usually bounces back afterward. In 2012 and 2004, year-over-year sales growth slowed an average of 22 percent in September and October, from the January through August period, but rebounded an average of 16 percent in November and December, according to consulting group AlixPartners. Penney's CEO Marvin Ellison said it was hard to quantify how much the upcoming election affected business in the third quarter but that business accelerated in October, the last month of the period. But he noted from an economic standpoint, shoppers ""are in really good shape,"" he added.  ""We are hoping that in the post-election, we are just going to see people spend,"" he said. Some consumers are nervous about changes under a Trump presidency that could affect a lot of different industries. Donna Jonas, a retired customer service representative in Albuquerque, New Mexico, says she started spending less a couple months ago. The 63-year-old worries that Trump might privatize social security and what his plans might be for health care.  ""It's my financial future that I am concerned about,"" she said. Jonas says she has cut back on buying new books, and she and her husband won't buy each other a holiday gift as they usually do. She also plans to spend less on gifts for her grandchildren. Department store executives still say there are reasons to be hopeful.  ""There are a lot of people feeling positive today"" about a Trump presidency, said Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren, citing Trump's victory speech that was seen as conciliatory. As for those who are upset about the election, he says it's too early to tell. Ellison says it's too soon to know how the election effect will pan out, but added, ""We are a very resilient country."" ____ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Frank Pavone of the antiabortion group Priests for Life dedicates a basket of naming certificates for 47 babies who died in the Philadelphia clinic of Kermit Gosnell. (Andre Kim/Priests for Life via Religion News Service)  Ahead of Tuesday's presidential election, the Rev. Frank Pavone took an aborted fetus, laid it upon an altar Sunday and posted a live video on Facebook. Pavone, a Catholic priest who heads New York-based Priests for Life, said the fetus was entrusted to him by a pathologist for burial. During an already heated and divisive campaign season, Pavone's video has raised questions for some about what is appropriate antiabortion and political activism in the church. As of Monday afternoon, the video, which is 44 minutes long, had 236,000 views. In it, he holds up a poster of graphics of abortion procedures. In Pavone's Facebook appeal, he wrote, ""we have to decide if we will allow this child killing to continue in America or not. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic platform says yes, let the child-killing continue (and you pay for it); Donald Trump and the Republican platform says no, the child should be protected."" A call placed to the spokesman for the Diocese of Amarillo in Texas, which is Pavone's diocese, was not immediately returned Monday. The receptionist, however, said her phone has been ringing off the hook.   [As election nears, Pope Francis warns against fear, building walls]   On Tuesday, the diocese posted a statement saying that it is opening an investigation on Pavone's actions saying they were ""against the dignity of human life and is a desecration of the altar."" ""The Diocese of Amarillo deeply regrets the offense and outrage caused by the video for the faithful and the community at large,"" the statement reads. ""The action and presentation of Father Pavone in this video is not consistent with the beliefs of the Catholic Church."" The diocese noted that Priests for Life is a civil institution, not a Catholic one and the organization is not under the diocese's supervision. In a blog post for Patheos, Scott Eric Alt argued that what Pavone did was sacrilege, a violation of Catholic Church canon law, which states that the altar is ""reserved for divine worship alone, to the exclusion of any secular usage."" ""Being pro-life is about respecting the dignity of the human person,"" Alt wrote. ""It is the antithesis of respect for the dignity of the human person to use a dead child as a political prop to lobby for your presidential candidate the day before an election.""   [This Orthodox Jewish immigrant dedicated his vote to a slain Muslim American soldier]   Pavone is a high-profile antiabortion activist who has clashed with leadership within the Catholic Church. In 2014, Cardinal Timothy Dolan cut ties with the priest after Dolan suggested that Pavone had stonewalled financial reform within his organization, which is based out of Staten Island. A spokesman for Dolan, who is also chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Pro-Life Activities, said the archdiocese does not have a relationship with Pavone and has no comment on the video. In a blog post for the Archdiocese of New York, Ed Mechmann wrote about the ""revulsion"" he felt about the video. ""A human being has been sacrificed and the altar of God has been desecrated, all for politics,"" he wrote. ""Everyone who respects the dignity of every human person should reject and disavow this atrocity."" In a statement sent Tuesday to the Washington Post, Pavone said that his actions caused ""no small controversy,"" and his followers have made overwhelmingly positive comments. ""My followers agree that the truth about abortion has to be seen, because the word has lost all its meaning,"" he wrote. ""We sanitize it."" He said his efforts were part of a 9-day effort to get voters to vote for pro-life Republicans. ""In the chapel were only me and the baby, whose funeral has already been held and who has been laid to rest,"" he said. ""No family were present, because they rejected the child and had him killed. His body would have been thrown in the garbage had we not accepted it."" Trump has been a divisive candidate for antiabortion activists, who have tried to keep women at the forefront. Earlier this year, the GOP candidate suggested that women who have abortions should be punished, a position he later reversed.   [Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's most memorable 'jokes' at the Al Smith dinner]   If anything, Pavone's actions are a signal that the older antiabortion groups are on their way out, said Charles Camosy, a bioethics professor at Fordham University and a board member of Democrats for Life of America. The use of graphic images has been a divisive issue in the antiabortion movement, and Camosy said Monday that nearly everyone he knows, including conservatives, have condemned Pavone's video. ""This plays into the narrative so many people have of us, that this is a bunch of wild extremists who will put an aborted fetus on Facebook Live. Come on!"" said Camosy, who noted that Priests for Life was one of the earliest organizations to support Trump. ""This is the death rattle for the culture-war-focused pro-life movement."" Pavone has had a rocky history under Catholic leadership. After Patrick Zurek was installed as bishop in Pavone's diocese of Amarillo in 2008, Zurek wanted a full accounting of Pavone's $10 million annual budget, which was one of the largest among antiabortion groups in the country, according to Religion News Service. In 2011, Zurek suspended his ministry, and RNS reports that Priests for Life had been badly mismanaged, running a $1.4 million deficit and failing to make certain tax filings. Pavone's video comes after a group of Catholics inserted fliers into parish bulletins in San Diego claiming that a vote for a Democrat is a mortal sin. San Diego's Bishop Robert McElroy criticized the flier. And on Saturday, Pope Francis condemned the political use of fear and the building of walls, describing the refugee crisis as ""a problem of the world"" and urging political leaders to do more. Catholics are very divided this election season, especially along racial lines. A recent Washington Post/ABC News tracking poll found that 48 percent of Catholics were polling for Hillary Clinton while 44 percent favored Trump.              1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail      View Photos   The GOP presidential nominee is pressing his case ahead of Election Day.
