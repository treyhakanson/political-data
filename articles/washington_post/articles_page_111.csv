A High Court judge ruled that Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching of the Youngspiration party violated a section of the semiautonomous Chinese city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, as well as laws covering oaths taken by officials. Justice Thomas Au said his decision wasn't influenced by Beijing's controversial intervention last week into the local political dispute, in which it pre-empted the court with its own ruling aimed at blocking the two from getting a second chance. The judge sided with Hong Kong's top leader and justice secretary, who had filed a legal challenge to prevent the two from taking their seats, arguing that they had effectively declined to take their oaths by distorting them at the swearing-in ceremony last month. Provocative tactics by Leung, 30, and Yau, 25, also included displaying a flag that said ""Hong Kong is Not China"" and using an old-fashioned derogatory Japanese term for China. Yau inserted a curse word into her pledge while Leung crossed his fingers.  ""By seeking to make a mockery of China and the People's Republic of China in a derogatory and humiliating manner, it is objectively plain that Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau refused to pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China,"" the judge said. The two told reporters that they would appeal the decision to the Court of Final Appeal rather than accepting the outcome and running for the seats again in a by-election.  ""What is the meaning of joining this by-election if the result can be overruled by the government easily?"" said Leung, who accused Beijing of destroying Hong Kong's values and freedoms. In an unprecedented step, Beijing handed down its own interpretation of the Basic Law last week, circumventing Hong Kong's courts and raising fears that the city's wide autonomy and independent judiciary under Chinese rule were being undermined. China's top legislative panel, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, sparked protests with its decision that under the Basic Law anyone who doesn't take their oath accurately, ""sincerely and solemnly"" should be barred from office. While Hong Kong courts are required to enforce such rulings, Au said he would have come to the same decision with or without Beijing's interpretation. Yau disagreed.  ""The government used a lot of ways to put pressure on the court,"" she said. ""The court made this judgment after coming under heavy pressure and the result is what we have expected."" ___ Associated Press videojournalist Josie Wong contributed to this report.

In the days after Republican Donald Trump won the White House, Democrat Hillary Clinton's loss brought many of her New York supporters to tears -- even in public. Enter 28-year-old Brooklyn artist Matthew Chavez, known as Levee. He set up a table in a long tunnel of the Union Square station where he hands out the blank pastel notes on which straphangers scribble. He calls this ""Subway Therapy."" It's free. More than 1,500 people have shared their grief and anxiety since Wednesday, posting thoughts on the white subway tiles, according to Subway Therapy's Instagram. One reads, ""You will not divide us. Love is everything."" Another says, ""It doesn't end today."" One says ""If they go low, we go high,"" echoing first lady Michelle Obama. The uplifting art installation counterbalances what Clinton supporters say is Trump's racism, bigotry and ignorance. Another sticky note offers soothing words, saying, ""Everything will be alright."" But a few feet over, another person wasn't so sure: ""What do we do now?"" There was an answer amid the sea of impromptu messages.  ""We've been through worse (meaning 9/11) and the city will unite,"" the light pink sticky note said. ""We will get through this together because love trumps hate.""

It has brought hundreds of millions of people online and has become a vast marketplace for digital commerce, yet it is also heavily policed by censors to snuff out any challenge to the ruling Communist Party. Under President Xi Jinping, the censors are working overtime to keep 721 million Internet users under control. The latest effort came Monday. China's national parliament approved a cybersecurity law that can be used to restrict free speech and force foreign Internet companies to heed the demands of China's security services. Censorship is not new in China; a huge phalanx of officials are devoted to it, harsh punishments are meted out, and the country is ringed by a content-blocking Great Firewall. But now censorship will be more fully enshrined in the legal code. Article 12 of the new law prohibits use of the Internet for ""inciting subversion of the national regime"" or ""the overthrow of the Socialist system."" Also banned is inciting separatism or ethnic hatred, ""endangering national unity,"" or ""fabricating"" or disseminating false information about the economy. These are all touchstones of Chinese authoritarianism, vague enough to be deployed in many circumstances to smother dissent. Article 37 of the new law requires ""critical information infrastructure operators"" to store users' data, including that of foreign companies, on Chinese territory, making it easier for the security services to snoop. Article 24 requires Internet providers to demand the real identity of those they provide services to -- making it easier for security services to track down those who would like to speak their mind. Many foreign businesses are also alarmed that the new law may give the Chinese authorities access to their technology and data. Offering a glimpse of how censorship actually works in China, Ronald Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, released a report recently on digital streaming services. Similar to Periscope (which is banned in China), these apps, such as YY, 9158 and Sina Show, have become a craze. Mr. Deibert's researchers downloaded these three, and between February 2015 and October 2016 extracted 19,464 keywords that trigger censorship on chats associated with each application. Rather than monolithic control, they found censorship is decentralized and somewhat chaotic; the platforms are often expected to adhere to a kind of ""self-discipline"" rather than direct orders. Mr. Deibert's group discovered that the most popular app, YY, with 844 million registered users, automatically sends a report back when a user types a banned keyword; the report includes not only the user's name but also who the message was sent to and the message itself. In law and in practice, China is creating the world's largest online thought prison. It turns the idea of the Internet as a force for freedom on its head, and as China goes, so go other tyrants. From Vietnam to Saudi Arabia, from Russia to Turkey, the age of Internet repression has blossomed. Online:  http://www.washingtonpost.com  ___ Nov. 10 The New York Times on Afghan refugees: Pakistan is turning them back. Thousands who spent their life savings on a bid to resettle in Europe are being told it's time to head home. Inside Afghanistan, tens of thousands have become internally displaced in recent months as fighting between the Taliban and government security forces rages in several provinces. The refugee crisis could reach unprecedented numbers, with as many as 1.5 million returning home, many involuntarily, by the end of the year, according to humanitarian organizations. Yet, there is no plan to adequately address this humanitarian emergency. Its scale and the international community's dismissive attitude toward the plight of vulnerable Afghans is shameful. Pakistan, home to 1.3 million registered Afghan refugees and some 700,000 undocumented Afghans, has begun to crack down on those refugees living in the country without permission. By the end of this year, as many as 360,000 could be forced to return to Afghanistan, if current rates hold, according to the United Nations refugee agency. This year's number of returnees is about four times higher than last year's. Among those caught in Pakistan's toughening stance is Sharbat Gula, the subject of a famous photo that was published on a cover of National Geographic magazine in 1985. That photo was taken at a refugee camp in Pakistan when she was about 12. Ms. Gula, now in her 40s, was recently arrested and deported back to Afghanistan because she had been living in Pakistan without legitimate papers. As Afghans become ever more hopeless about the future of their country, a rising number have set out on long and perilous journeys to Europe. Last year, 213,000 Afghans made it to Europe, where leaders have been grappling with the even larger influx of Syrians. While Syrians are not being forced to return home, European leaders last month struck a deal with the government of Afghanistan to establish a mechanism for the return of tens of thousands of Afghans who have failed to get asylum or legal residency in Europe. Under the deal, the Afghan government agreed to accept even citizens who fear for their safety if they were to return home. Those who go back home, often having spent all their money on smugglers, face grinding poverty and violence. Within the country, about 221,000 Afghans fled their homes between January and August, according to the United Nations. For many, the only option is to pitch a tent in one of the country's bulging and poorly serviced refugee camps. The United Nations refugee agency has been making desperate pleas to donors for more assistance as winter approaches. Last month, it said it needed $181 million to cover basic operations in the months ahead. Fulfilling that need immediately is the least the international community can do. Beyond that, it will need to rethink its long-term approach to Afghan refugees and how to resettle more abroad in the years ahead. Online:  http://www.nytimes.com  ___ Nov. 9 China Daily on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Japan: As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi starts his three-day official visit to Japan on Thursday, he will be expecting to see the already close bilateral relationship rise to a new height, with several major deals set to be inked. Among them will be a civil nuclear cooperation agreement, which allows Japan to export its nuclear plant technologies to India, and one on India's purchase of 12 amphibious rescue aircraft from a Japanese manufacturer worth up to $1.6 billion. These deals are especially significant given that India has yet to ratify the international Non-Proliferation Treaty, and that the aircraft deal will be one of Japan's first sales of military equipment since it lifted a 50-year ban on arms exports. The very good personal chemistry between Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is said to have played a part in deepening relations between the two nations. It is reported that Modi is one of the few people Abe follows on Twitter. Modi, on his part, first visited Japan back when he was chief minister of India's Gujarat province. It would be just another diplomatic anecdote if it stopped there. Yet some have tried to describe the visit as a mutual effort by New Delhi and Tokyo to ""counter an assertive China"", or ""to keep a rising China in check"". They hope that an anti-China alliance could be forged between the world's second most populous nation and third-largest economy, because of China's longstanding territorial dispute with India and its spat with Japan over the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. People with such thinking have too simplistic an idea of international relations that are not a zero-sum game. Modi has always sought ""to lead India's foreign policy with its economic interests in mind"". And Japan's trade with India is still less than a quarter of that between India and China. China, as the top trade partner of both, is more than happy to see deepened economic, trade and political relations between its neighbors if they contribute to peace and stability in the region. While some in Japan may continue to trumpet ""the rule of law in the South China Sea"" or ""freedom and openness in the Indian and Pacific Oceans"", as Abe did with Modi in September on the sidelines of a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos, Sino-Indian relations are strong enough to withstand differences and external interferences. Online:  https://usa.chinadaily.com.cn  ___ Nov. 9 The Dallas Morning News on why Donald Trump should be a statesman: Congratulations, Mr. Trump. You're hired. The presidency is the biggest job America has to offer, and come Jan. 20, it's yours. We wish you every success. All of us who live in this great nation depend on strong leadership from you now. In winning the election you have proved many millions of your supporters right. They said you heard their concerns, while Hillary Clinton and establishment figures in government, media and pop culture did not. We've questioned whether your temperament, experience and values are right for this office. We'd like nothing better than to be proved wrong. You made a strong start with your elegant victory speech early Wednesday. You pledged ""to bind the wounds of division"" and to be ""president for all Americans."" Those are noble goals, ones we share. As you build your Cabinet, we hope its members reflect those aspirations, that they indeed work with you in building a government that works for everyone. We, too, will use this time to consider anew what lessons we take from this long campaign and the results it produced on Election Day. Will establishment figures, from both the Democratic and Republican parties, who dismissed the concerns of Trump supporters re-examine their hostility, and look for ways to bridge cultural chasms? Now that the election is over, it's imperative that all Americans, including Republican leaders, broad-minded Democrats and Trump supporters alike, seek out their ""better angels"" and recommit to what's best for America. We exhort them to chart a way forward that truly will make Americans safe and secure, that will more equitably distribute economic prosperity, that will inspire free enterprise, personal liberty and a stronger sense of shared community. Mr. Trump, we call on you to show the way, to lead the country toward these broadly shared goals in ways consistent with the constitutional ideals that have served the United States for more than two centuries. That will take selflessness and leadership by example to build unity and equal opportunity. We are going to be hopeful. We are going to be aspirational for you and for our country. This election gives you the opportunity to prove yourself a statesman. We very much hope you do. Online:  http://www.dallasnews.com/  ___ Nov. 10 The St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Trump and Obama's Thursday meeting: President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump met face-to-face and shook hands for the first time Thursday. First time ever. A worried American public needed badly to witness this moment and be reassured that a peaceful, respectful transfer of power will happen. The meeting had high potential to be tense and uncomfortable, given their years of animosity. Perhaps because of the possibility of confrontation, schedulers had initially planned for a light, 10-minute get-together. Instead, it turned into a 90-minute discussion delving into substantive national and international issues. Thursday's meeting was perhaps the most sobering one of Trump's life. No one can enter the Oval Office without being struck by the awesome responsibility of the president's job. Trump now receives the same daily, top-secret briefings that Obama receives from CIA and National Security Agency officials. This newspaper, like every major metropolitan daily in the country, had strongly opposed the notion of a Trump presidency. When Tuesday's election results came in, our initial reaction was that the nation was headed for disaster. Protesters have taken to the streets threatening violence and insisting that Trump is ""not my president."" To them we say: Get over it. The nation cannot continue the kinds of destructive sniping that dominated the campaign -- sniping that, yes, this newspaper participated in. Thursday's meeting provided some very necessary reassurance that the world around us isn't going to collapse. Trump can, if he works at it, be presidential. It truly is time for Americans to set aside the rancor and harsh words. For Obama, the meeting was a chance to show his human face to Trump, an opponent who spent many years treating the president as an object of ridicule and illegitimacy. It was because of Trump's sustained public campaign challenging Obama's status as an American-born Christian that the president felt compelled to fight back hard, starting with a lengthy roasting of Trump at the 2011 White House Correspondents dinner. It endured up to the last day of campaigning this week. Some say it was the humiliation of Obama's roasting that motivated Trump to run for president. They never had a chance to clear the air until Thursday. And because of Trump's penchant for off-the-cuff, abrasive comments during the campaign, there was little reason for Obama or the American public to see him in any light other than one of callous abrasiveness. We stand by our criticism of his offensive campaign rhetoric and believe he must repudiate it. He should make certain that his followers don't assume his election signals an open season on insulting and demeaning their fellow citizens, and noncitizens, with reckless abandon. Now, as president-elect, Trump has shown some recognition that it's time to assume a more dignified and statesmanlike demeanor. We sincerely hope what was on display Thursday marks Trump's new beginning. Online:  http://www.stltoday.com/  ___ Nov. 9 The Philadelphia Inquirer on division in America: At press time Tuesday night, the presidential election was going into extra innings, in a nail-biter that makes the seventh game of the World Series game feel like a nap. While we don't at this point know who won, what we do know is that many expectations were turned on their heads: mainly, that a bombastic, unqualified candidate with no record of public service with a disorganized, undisciplined organization and little support from his party was still able to attract votes at the same rate as a seasoned, experienced candidate who has prepared for this job much of her life. Throughout this campaign, much of the debate focused on the undecided voter, but in this case ""undecided"" meant that neither candidate held much appeal. Still, the high voting turnout numbers from Tuesday for two ""unpopular"" candidates suggests that people were indeed engaged in this election. Maybe that's not so surprising, and we suspect that one big motivator for the crowds at the polls was fear: Clearly, those who voted for Donald Trump bought into the fear that their candidate instilled in rally after rally: that America is no longer great, that we are a laughingstock, that immigrants are going to take over, and if they don't, the terrorists will. While Hillary Clinton's campaign reacted with a message of ""love trumps hate,"" and sold unity with ""Stronger Together,"" the fact is that Democrats also capitalized on fear to galvanize voters: the fear of a Trump presidency. With no clear winner apparent late Tuesday night, we don't know which fear was the bigger motivator. So we'll talk about our fear: that the United States of America is less united than we'd like to believe. We fear that there are two Americas: one America that is inclusive, progressive, and looks to the future, and another America that is suspicious of outsiders, wants to return to a simpler time that no longer exists (if it ever did) and that is restrictive of human, civil, and reproductive rights. A companion fear: that this country could be forfeiting the leadership role it has held in the world since World War II, with an unstable leader at its head. As Tuesday night's electoral map was filled in with results, what was striking was how the nation's divisions appear to be equal in size. And among the jobs faced by whoever is the final winner of this strange, painfully long election, this will be the most important: finding and building more bridges between these two separate countries. Forget the actual problems of our roads, highways and bridges - the infrastructure of our democracy needs the most work of all. Unfortunately, we believe that only one of the candidates is open to that task. Online:  http://www.philly.com/  Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Conceding Hillary Clinton's staggering loss, Obama vowed to do all he could to facilitate a smooth transition and to ensure Trump would be well-positioned to run the country when he takes office Jan. 20. In a brief conversation, he'd congratulated Trump by phone and invited him to sit down together Thursday at the White House.  ""We all want what's best for this country,"" Obama said. Obama delivered his sunny call for unity while standing in the Rose Garden, much as his predecessor President George W. Bush did after Obama's victory in 2008. It was a symbolic moment meant to signal the calm transfer of power from one president to the next. But it was also a bit of counseling for devastated Democrats. Obama spoke to more than a hundred of his White House staffers, who stood silently, dazed, some crying, before breaking out into a prolonged round of applause that continued long after Obama returned to the Oval Office. Obama made no direct reference to Trump's vows to erase much of what Obama has accomplished. He downplayed the notion that Trump's presidency would mean an about-face for the nation. He said the U.S. has a tendency to ""zig and zag"" rather than move in a straight line, and he added, ""That's OK."" Obama remarks were striking after a campaign in which the Democrats declared Trump was unfit to serve and Obama told voters that ""the fate of the republic"" rested on defeating Trump. The brief call between Obama and Trump in the wee hours of Wednesday, after Trump claimed victory, was a ""warm conversation"" and a ""gracious exchange,"" Trump's campaign manager said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans would first target the heart of Obama's legacy, the health care law they have tried and failed to repeal since it was passed in 2010. With control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, they'll soon be in position to virtually gut it. It's not clear exactly how Trump and GOP allies would go about it. But Republicans last year passed legislation that eliminated Obama's Medicaid expansion, government subsidies for insurance bought on marketplaces and some new taxes used to cover costs. The replacement would have increased the number of uninsured by about 22 million, according to nonpartisan analysts. Obama vetoed it. White House officials said they could continue to make the case against repeal as they walked out the door. But they were largely left hoping that Republicans wouldn't follow through on their repeal pledge, once put in the uncomfortable position of taking away people's health insurance. Other parts of Obama's legacy even more vulnerable, largely because he's relied on executive actions. A hefty list of Obama's initiatives rest on regulation, executive orders or unenforceable international agreements the next president is under little obligation to follow. Trump has supported reinstating waterboarding and other extreme forms of torture that Obama banned. He's also vowed to tear up Obama's immigration actions and discard the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal Obama painstakingly negotiated. The Republican has pledged to ""cancel"" U.S. participation in the international Paris climate change deal. Withdrawing would take four years under the terms of the agreement, but Trump could also decide to simply ignore its U.S. commitments to reduce carbon emission. Trump has also criticized Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran. But he's suggested he wants to renegotiate it, rather than scrap it. It's unclear, though, how he might persuade Iran to accept less favorable terms. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest tried to be optimistic, arguing it wasn't a given that Trump would follow through on vows to roll back Obama's key accomplishments.  ""I think it is too early to tell what decisions Trump will make and what impact they will have in the priorities that President Obama has so proudly achieved,"" Earnest said. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP and Kathleen Hennessey at http://twitter.com/khennessey Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/f721c394-a61e-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	Virginia elects 2 new GOP congressmen in Garrett, Taylor	" RICHMOND, Va. -- Donald Trump's surprise victory has upended Virginia politics, dimming the star power of the state's top Democrats and disrupting the already-in-progress 2017 gubernatorial race, which is likely to be one of the nation's most closely watched elections next year. A Hillary Clinton victory would have given a giant boost to top Democrats in Virginia. Running mate Tim Kaine was set to be the next vice president, longtime Clinton friend Gov. Terry McAuliffe was going to be the best-connected governor in the country, and many expected Rep. Bobby Scott to be Virginia's first black senator as Kaine's senate replacement. Clinton's victory in Virginia, the only one in a southern state, may bode well for future Democratic candidates, but for now it's largely a hollow win. Kaine and Scott will remain part of the minority in their respective chambers, and McAuliffe will spend his last year in office without a direct line to the White House. But the biggest turmoil from a Trump win may be within the state GOP, where gubernatorial candidates were already battling to claim Trump's supporters. Virginia's gubernatorial race, with a general election in November 2017, will test the power of Trump's popularity during the first months of his presidency. Next year's only other significant contests are races for New Jersey governor and New York City mayor. Trump supporter Flux Neo, an attorney in Virginia's deeply red southwest corner, said just how ""Trumpy"" Republicans were before Tuesday will be a key litmus test for future GOP contenders.  ""If you were anti-Trump, you're functionally dead to us as a candidate,"" said Neo. Even lukewarm support of Trump will be problematic, he added. Corey Stewart, one of Trump's earliest and most brash supporters in Virginia, said Tuesday's results have propelled him to the front of the GOP field for governor. He called it a high-risk, high-reward bet that is now paying off.  ""It was a Hail Mary pass. If this guy wins, I'm going to win. If he goes down in flames -- and there were several times when I thought that might happen -- I was going to go down in flames,"" said Stewart. Stewart, who is chairman of the Board of Supervisors in Prince William County, said he'll campaign on a promise of implementing Trump's policies in the state. He said that includes aggressive measures to deport undocumented immigrants. Complicating matters for Stewart is the fact that he was fired as chairman of the Trump campaign in Virginia during the final weeks of the election, after he organized an unauthorized pro-Trump protest outside the Republican National Committee's headquarters. But Stewart said he remains close to the Trump family, and his firing by political operatives won't diminish his support from the Trump faithful. Competing against Stewart for the GOP nomination is former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie, a polished political insider who endorsed Trump, but with muted enthusiasm. Gillespie has broad support from the party's establishment, but his style and background may make it difficult for him to connect with many of Trump's voters. For instance, Gillespie has been an outspoken advocate of expanding the GOP base to include more minorities, while Trump's hardline stance on immigration alienated many minority groups with his harsh rhetoric. On Wednesday, Gillespie's aides tried to play up his support for Trump's candidacy -- noting that Gillespie attended rallies with Trump running mate Mike Pence -- while attacking Stewart as an opportunistic ""career politician."" Conservative radio host John Fredericks, who succeeded Stewart as Trump's campaign chairman in Virginia, said both men will have to win over skeptical Trump supporters. He said Stewart tried to use his platform on the Trump campaign for self-promotion, and Gillespie made a ""calculated political decision"" to support Trump at arm's length.  ""It backfired on him,"" Fredericks said. Republicans Rep. Rob Wittman and state Sen. Frank Wagner also are running. Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam is the only Democratic candidate. Virginia governors are barred from serving consecutive terms. In the end, Northam may be best positioned to benefit from Trump's victory, as the Old Dominion's electorate typically votes against the president's party. Whether that history helps Northam now depends on the one of the most unpredictable political figures in modern history.  ""Historically, the people who lose the presidential election end up being the most motivated to win in Virginia a year later,"" said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. ""Everything will depend on how Trump does in his first year."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Eight years after losing a hard-fought Democratic gubernatorial primary to current Gov. Jack Markell, U.S. Rep. John Carney Jr. was elected governor, a victory he described as both ""humbling"" and ""uplifting.""  ""We've got a lot of work to do,"" said Carney, who will have little time to celebrate before forming a cabinet and putting together a financial team to balance the state's budget for next year.  ""That's going be job No. 1,"" he said. ""I'm going to walk in with a 200- to 300-million-dollar deficit."" During the campaign, Carney called for a ""complete budget reset,"" taking a hard look at both spending and revenue.  ""We've become too reliant on certain revenues that are not sustainable in the future,"" he said. Carney will be replaced in Washington by former state Labor Secretary Lisa Blunt Rochester, who will become the first African-American and first woman to represent the state in Congress.  ""This is more Delaware making history than me as one individual,"" Rochester told The Associated Press. ""I'm so excited I can't even begin to tell you."" Rochester traced her decision to run for Congress to a moment at a grocery store, where she watched a father with three kids try to buy a bag of grapes.  ""He had to put them back because they were $9,"" she recalled. ""That totally changed me. And I listened to the negativity that I was hearing across the country at the federal level, and instead of sitting back I just said, 'I want to step up.' And so I did, even though I had never run for office before, and here we are."" Rochester said she hopes to work with fellow Democrats and Republicans to build alliances to tackle issues such as safeguarding Social Security, protecting the Affordable Care Act, and working to improve the nation's infrastructure.  ""That's what I've built my career on, and that's what I want to take to Washington, D.C., bringing people together, common ground, working on tough issues,"" she said. In other races, Democratic state Sen. Bethany Hall-Long won the contest to fill Delaware's vacant lieutenant governor's seat, and New Castle County Sheriff Trinidad Navarro was elected insurance commissioner. Democrats also elected a new mayor in Wilmington and a new chief executive in New Castle County, the state's two largest local governments. Republicans failed to regain control of the state Senate but did score a stunning upset over Democratic President Pro Tem Sen. Patricia Blevins of Elsmere, the only incumbent member of the legislature to lose Tuesday. The final balance of power in the Senate will hinge on a special election, likely held early next year, to fill the seat being vacated by Hall-Long. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Park will be the first South Korean president to miss an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit since the annual meetings began in 1993, the Foreign Ministry said. It said Park's replacement for the meetings will be named next week. Park announced Tuesday that she will allow the opposition-controlled parliament to select her new prime minister in an effort to reduce the turmoil threatening her presidency. Prosecutors have arrested Park's longtime friend, Choi Soon-sil, and two former presidential aides over allegations that Choi, who has no official government role, interfered with important state affairs and used her presidential ties to pressure companies into donating large sums to two foundations she controlled. Presidential spokesman Kim Dong-jo said Park made the decision to skip the APEC summit in September to focus on issues created by North Korea's strengthening nuclear weapons and missiles programs.
