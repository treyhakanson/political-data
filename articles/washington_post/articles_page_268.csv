Poore told the newspaper on Tuesday that she was not asked or pressured to step down. In the Facebook post, Poore was critical of voters -- particularly straight white males -- who supported Trump. Her widely read Facebook post contained about a dozen profanities. Poore later said she would have considered her language more carefully had she known the post would go viral.

(Seth Perlman/AP)  Aaron Schock, a former Illinois congressman whose Capitol Hill office was decorated in the style of the TV show ""Downton Abbey,"" and whose six-pack abs landed him on the cover of Men's Health, was indicted Thursday on charges that he misspent government and campaign money for his personal benefit. Schock, 35, had resigned from Congress last year amid reports of alleged improper spending. The Republican said in a statement that he did so ""in hopes of sparing loved ones the indignity of being questioned and harassed about unfounded allegations,"" but the government pursued him nonetheless. ""Like many Americans, I wanted to have faith in the integrity of our Justice Department,"" Schock said in a statement. ""But after this experience, I am forced to join millions of other Americans who have sadly concluded that our federal justice system is broken and too often driven by politics instead of facts."" He said he was eager to ""defend my name and reputation in a court of law.""   [He's got a 'Downton Abbey'-inspired office, but Rep. Aaron Schock won't talk about it.]   Schock was charged in a 24-count indictment with wire fraud, mail fraud, theft of government funds, making false statements and filing false documents. The 52-page document spells out a broad array of misdeeds spanning 2008 to 2015.      Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) resigned from Congress amid allegations he misused funds. The Washington Post's Ben Terris explains a few things lawmakers might want to avoid if they want to keep their seats. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)   The indictment alleges that the former congressman from Peoria, Ill., reimbursed himself for 150,000 miles he never drove, bought a new 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe for his exclusive use with campaign committee funds, and reimbursed himself with congressional funds for camera equipment purchased for himself and his personal photographer. It alleges that Schock used government and campaign money to take a private plane with a group to Chicago for a Bears football game, and remodeled his Illinois apartment and Capitol Hill office -- paying those who did the thousands of dollars worth of work at least in part from government and campaign funds. Schock also, according to the indictment, accused a former staffer of inappropriately accessing a friend's social media account and falsely claimed the FBI and Capitol Police were investigating -- prompting the former staffer's father to hire a lawyer. All told, Schock caused the government and his campaign committees to lose more than $100,000, authorities said. ""These charges allege that Mr. Schock deliberately and repeatedly violated federal law, to his personal and financial advantage,"" U.S. Attorney Jim Lewis in Springfield, Ill., said in a statement. ""Mr. Schock held public office at the time of the alleged offenses, but public office does not exempt him or anyone else from accountability for alleged intentional misuse of public funds and campaign funds."" Schock was once a rising star in the Republican Party. He was a prolific fundraiser, generating more than $6 million for his 2012 and 2014 campaigns. Handsome and in good shape, his Instagram was filled with pictures of his outdoor adventures, and he once graced the cover of Men's Health magazine. But in early 2015, the Office of Congressional Ethics began looking into how Schock spent taxpayer money, including the tens of thousands used to decorate his Capitol Hill office in the style of the PBS show ""Downton Abbey."" That controversy, detailed in The Washington Post, seemed almost comical when it was first revealed. After an interior decorator showed a Post reporter the room, Schock's communications director said the reporter had ""created a bit of a crisis in the office"" and asked him to delete pictures taken of it from his phone. He then played down the story and suggested -- as Schock's defense team said more definitively Thursday -- that Schock had never seen the TV show.      Former congressman Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) gave his farewell speech to the House of Representatives on March 26, saying that as he goes through this ""valley in life"" he looks to former president Abraham Lincoln for inspiration. (AP)   The dust-up was soon followed by even more reports about Schock's spending on concert tickets, trips and other travel. Schock said in his statement that the coverage was ""overblown and inaccurate"" and that, at worst, his team ""might have made errors among a few of the thousands and thousands of financial transactions we conducted, but they were honest mistakes -- no one intended to break any law."" ""I simply cannot believe it has come to this,"" Schock said. ""However, we are here not by my choosing. But since we are where we are -- I intend to not only prove these allegations false, but in the process, expose this investigation for what it was."" George J. Terwilliger III, Schock's attorney, said in a statement that the indictment against Schock ""will look bad, but underneath it is just made-up allegations of criminal activity arising from unintentional administrative errors."" He said prosecutors were misusing their power in pursuing the former congressman. ""Criminalizing a handful of administrative mistakes, a few of the thousands of transactions from Aaron's 6 years in office, to charge Mr. Schock two days after a national election has all the appearances of a politically calculated ambush,"" Terwilliger said. For this part, Schock seemed to compare his case to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state -- an inquiry that ultimately produced no charges. ""Unlike some politicians, I did not delete any emails, nor did my staff smash or destroy any electronic devices,"" Schock said. ""Quite the opposite, every record, every document, every picture on the wall was left behind. I took nothing with me. I knew I had nothing to hide, and I believed that a quick review would prove this fact."""

Here are the key moments from that fervent address. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   As you undoubtedly know, Hillary Clinton didn't win the White House on Tuesday night. So, why does this piece have the headline it does? Not because I am trying to make some sort of counter-conventional-wisdom argument for why Clinton actually won in losing the White House. (That would be a super dumb argument to make.) I'm publishing it because it's the piece I wrote Tuesday afternoon in expectation that Clinton would win the election. (The piece I wrote on Trump is here.) I didn't edit anything from the version that was set to run Tuesday night if Clinton had won. I post this to make clear that we -- reporters and people -- all know less than we purport to, that authoritativeness is, at some level, an illusion. Journalism took a hit Tuesday -- and rightly so. I am a believer that transparency -- how we do what we do and why -- is an antidote to the cynicism and anger directed at the media right now. Here's my attempt to walk that walk. Hillary Clinton, eight years after she first sought the office, secured the presidency on Tuesday night -- the first woman elected to the most powerful office in the country. Clinton's path to the presidency -- much like her last two-plus decades in public life -- was not an easy one, defined more by her relentless drive forward than any sort of soaring movement like the one that propelled Barack Obama into office in 2008. And even in victory, Clinton survived rather than overwhelmed. Expected to cruise to an electoral vote victory, Clinton squeaked by -- with Democrats fretting deep into the night about her prospects. In short: It was a uniquely Clinton campaign -- with all the good and bad that connotes. Start in early 2015 when it became clear to anyone paying attention that Clinton was running for president. The prospect of her presence in the race froze things in place for all but the long-shot contenders -- former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley and a little-known Vermont senator named Bernie Sanders. By the time Clinton formally entered the race in April 2015, she looked like an absolute juggernaut. Still popular from her time as secretary of state, Clinton appeared to have it all -- money, activists, polling supremacy. I, and many others, called her the most heavy non-incumbent front-runner in the history of presidential politics -- because that's exactly what she was. Then the campaign began in earnest -- and it became clear within a few months that the Clinton coronation had been premature. The revelation that Clinton had exclusively used a private email server during her time as the nation's top diplomat -- which had gone public a month before she formally entered the race -- went from an annoyance to a massive and ongoing headache. And it wasn't just that Clinton was the first secretary of state to exclusively use a private email server that was the problem. It was how Clinton and her team handled it -- badly, and in ways that reminded Democrats of all the baggage that came with the Clintons. Her initial reaction -- and this lasted for months -- was a sort of standoffishness with the media, insisting that a. she didn't know anything and b. what she did know was that she didn't do anything wrong. Even as those doubts about Clinton's honesty and trustworthiness began to creep back, Sanders suddenly became the viable, and therefore problematic, challenge from her ideological left that her campaign had long hoped to avoid. Sanders, for some Democrats -- especially younger, white voters -- was the antidote to the status quo, look-before-leaping politics that Clinton represented. He was promising free college tuition and railing against the influence of Wall Street, while Clinton was preaching practical policy prescriptions with achievable solutions. Clinton didn't really know how to deal with Sanders. Be too aggressive and run the risk of alienating and angering voters she knew she would need for the general election. Be too soft and let Sanders's support grow. That question confounded Clinton all the way up until the first votes of 2016 in Iowa and New Hampshire. But almost as quickly as voters started voting, two things became clear: 1. Sanders had a durable coalition and 2. that durable coalition simply wasn't big enough to pose a real threat to Clinton's front-runner status. Clinton spent the rest of the primary campaign playing nice with Sanders (and his voters) while working hard behind the scenes to ensure he never made inroads among black and Hispanic voters who were solidly for her. What that strategy led to was a protracted primary fight in which Sanders petered out as much as Clinton beat him. It was in many ways a classic Clinton move -- and an omen of the general-election campaign to come: Yes, she had won, but she had done so in a manner that left many people cold. Despite those setbacks, the narrative of the general election began in much the same place that the Democratic primary did: Clinton as the heavy favorite to beat Donald Trump, a first-time candidate who capitalized on a deeply divided Republican Party to march to the nomination and who was regarded as too undisciplined, too easily provoked, too, well, un-presidential to possibly win. But again, Clinton found herself hamstrung by the email issue as the Justice Department's investigation into her private server -- and whether Clinton or her top aides had intentionally violated rules regarding classified communications -- dragged on. That cloud seemed to lift in July when FBI Director James B. Comey announced that while Clinton had exercised poor judgment in regards to her emails, she had not intentionally broken any rules and therefore would not be charged. The FBI investigation seemingly behind her (and Clinton's resilience again proven), her discipline as a candidate and the rigor with which her staff approached the nuts and bolts -- voter ID, organization building, etc. -- of the campaign began to shine through. Clinton was the far superior debater in each of the three debates. She was prepared and measured, keeping her cool as Trump tried to rattle her with attacks from all angles -- personal, professional and just plain odd. In a word, she looked presidential, while he did not. The debate seemed to set Clinton on cruise control as her campaign began to talk about expanding the map into Arizona, Georgia, Utah and, yes, even Texas. Senate Democrats -- and even House Democrats -- began to speak semi-openly about the possibility of winning back majorities in both chambers of Congress. Then came Oct. 28 and a stunning letter from Comey that emails ""pertinent"" to the Clinton investigation had been discovered on a computer belonging to former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) and his wife -- longtime Clinton confidante Huma Abedin. Within hours, the confident Clinton campaign had turned dark, watching the race thrown into chaos right on what looked like the verge of certain victory. Another hurdle -- and this one potentially the largest yet -- thrown in her way in the final moments of the contest. Concerns about Democratic enthusiasm were rampant and Trump seemed to be on the march again. In the face of such a game-changer, Clinton did what she always did in the face of adversity: picked herself up and moved forward. She and the campaign slammed Comey for what they claimed was unprecedented meddling in a presidential election, effectively turning the conversation in the race to the FBI as opposed to her presidential campaign. Simultaneously, Clinton's on-the-ground organization began to assert itself -- rolling up record totals in key Democratic communities in Florida and Nevada, totals that gave her campaign a massive leg-up Tuesday. The final act featured Comey, again -- with another letter to Congress, this time on the Saturday before the election. But this time it was good news for Clinton -- nothing in the new emails led the FBI to reconsider its public statements on the investigation back in July. The last 48 hours were largely anti-climatic. Both national and swing state polling pointed to the Clinton victory that played out cross the country Tuesday. The Clinton campaign strategy -- slow and steady, get knocked down but just keep getting up -- was rewarded. It's been 3,076 days since Clinton ended her first presidential bid, touting the 18 million cracks she had made in the last, highest, hardest glass ceiling. On Tuesday night, she smashed through it by being exactly who she has been throughout her public life: resilient, dogged and relentlessly prepared."

The board voted Wednesday to jettison the 57-year-old tradition, at least for this year.  Board members instead will convene for the first time in 2017 on Jan. 3 at 6 p.m., a change that Chair Libby Garvey (D) called an experiment.  Two board members expressed opposition to the decision, saying it will eliminate an opportunity for members of the public to see the board in action when they do not have to go to work themselves.  Garvey, who has disliked the tradition since she was a School Board member and felt obligated to attend, argued that New Year's Day should be spent with family and friends.  The attempt to show Arlington is the first local government to ""get to work"" in the new year is lost on most people, she said. And she argued that the county's desire to take advantage of a typically slow news day is outdated, since people no longer rely exclusively on the print edition of The Washington Post.  Board members Jay Fisette (D) and John Vihstadt (I) said it's easier for average citizens to find an hour late on New Year's morning to meet the board and hear the members' speeches laying out their goals for the coming year than it is to attend a meeting on a work night.  After Fisette and Vihstadt were outvoted on an attempt to keep the date as is, they joined the rest of the five-member board on the main motion, making the change unanimous. "

The statement came from Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who said in an interview with the state-run Interfax news agency that ""there were contacts"" with the Trump team. ""Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage,"" Ryabkov said. ""We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes,"" Ryabkov was quoted as saying. Ryabkov provided no further details, and his remarks drew a swift denial from Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks, who said the campaign had ""no contact with Russian officials"" before Tuesday's election.     The Post's Marc Fisher explains how some of President-elect Donald Trump's traits could inform his leadership style when he takes office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Nevertheless, the assertion from Moscow attracted attention from national security experts after a presidential campaign that the Kremlin, according to U.S. officials, sought to influence in unprecedented ways. Washington, for instance, accused the Kremlin of orchestrating hacks into the Democratic National Committee and the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that led to politically embarrassing disclosures by WikiLeaks. Trump faced criticism during the campaign for his positive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin and for other Russia-friendly policy stances, although he repeatedly denied having financial or other ties to Moscow. Speaking to Bloomberg News, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said staffers at the Russian Embassy in Washington met with members of Trump's campaign -- meetings she described as ""normal practice."" Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign refused similar requests for meetings, Zakharova told the agency. Asked later for clarification, a Foreign Ministry official declined to elaborate on Ryabkov's remarks but said standard diplomacy called for ""contact with the leaders in the campaign"" on matters such as clarifying statements by the candidate or conveying interview requests from Russian journalists. The ministry official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. A Clinton campaign official who was asked to comment on Zakharova's statement answered with a one-word email: ""false."" In September, Trump was interviewed by host Larry King for a segment broadcast on RT America, part of a state-owned Russian media network. In the interview, Trump criticized the U.S. news media, calling it ""unbelievably dishonest."" A Trump spokesman said the interview had been a ""favor"" to King, a former CNN host and a friend of Trump's, and that the campaign did not know the interview would appear on RT America.

But neither the administration's hacking allegations nor reporting of Trump's apparent ties to Russia dissuaded more than 59 million voters from casting their ballots for the Republican. Speculation has swirled about Trump's links to Russia since early in the campaign, both because of his warm words about Putin and past business ventures in Russia. It is not clear whether Trump has any investments in the country, because he has not released any tax records. But he made millions of dollars by taking the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013. Wealthy Russians also have been an important source of investments in Trump's businesses. His son Donald Trump Jr. said in 2008 that ""Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,"" adding that ""we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."" Several Trump advisers also have had well-publicized ties to Russia, including his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who managed an investment fund for a Russian aluminum magnate with close ties to Putin. Manafort resigned from the campaign days after his name was found in a ledger designating funds to be paid out from the party of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in a pro-European street revolution in 2014.  [How Manafort revived his career -- and business fortunes -- in Ukraine]  Trump's national security adviser, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, sat next to Putin in 2015 during a dinner held by the Kremlin-funded television channel RT, formerly known as Russia Today. Politically, Trump has called for closer ties with Russia to fight the Islamic State, and he rebuffed calls to renounce Putin after the Russian leader called Trump ""colorful and talented,"" a remark that was mistranslated by some in the news media as ""a genius."" ""A guy calls me a genius, and I'm going to renounce?"" Trump said. ""I'm not going to renounce him."" Trump has not met Putin, according to statements this year, although in 2015 he claimed he had met the Russian leader. While Russian officials were openly jubilant about Trump's victory, Ryabkov also said that Moscow ""does not cherish any special hopes in the wake of Donald Trump's election as U.S. president."" ""We do not feel any euphoria,"" Ryabkov told Interfax. ""We wouldn't like our public, or at least the Interfax subscribers, to have the impression that we are overwhelmed with some rosy anticipation.""

Did he drive a wave of working-class white voters? Did Hillary Clinton rebuild Barack Obama's winning coalition -- young voters, urban liberals and minorities -- while picking off moderate Republicans? Those questions are central to who will win Tuesday's presidential election, and a handful of locales could provide some early answers on election night. The Associated Press has identified 10 counties seen as bellwethers for the Trump and Clinton strategies. All come from battleground states in the eastern time zone, where polls close the earliest. Their importance was determined from conversations with Republicans and Democrats, as well as AP's own analysis. A look at the 10 counties: FLORIDA: In 2012, Obama won by about 74,000 votes (0.9 percentage points): DUVAL This Republican-leaning county, home to Jacksonville, has a solid white majority and sizable black minority, making it look more like the Deep South than south Florida. So a movement in Trump's favor would mean returns closer to 2004, when George W. Bush won by 60,000 votes, than 2012, when Mitt Romney finished just 16,000 ahead of Obama. HILLSBOROUGH Bush and Obama each won Hillsborough (Tampa) twice, and both are two-term presidents. What makes Hillsborough stand out in 2016 is a growing Mexican-American population. There are already signs that Trump's hard-line immigration stance is driving up the Hispanic vote: A quarter of the Hispanics who cast ballots in the opening days of early voting hadn't voted at all in 2012. An expanded electorate (543,000 voted here in 2012) that is less white would benefit Clinton. MIAMI-DADE In Florida's most populous county, older Cuban-Americans fuel Republicans (333,000 votes in 2012), while younger Cuban-Americans, other Hispanics and black voters drive Democratic totals (541,000 in 2012). If Clinton lags Obama's vote totals with black voters, it could show up here. Trump, meanwhile, could struggle to match the usual Republican performance among Cuban-Americans. Watch for whether Trump's Miami-Dade vote totals lag far behind those of Sen. Marco Rubio, a favorite among his fellow Cuban-Americans. ___ NORTH CAROLINA: In 2012, Obama lost by 92,000 votes (2 percentage points): NEW HANOVER Registered Republicans and Democrats are split almost evenly in Wilmington and surrounding New Hanover County, while independents have risen by 10,000 voters since 2012 to outnumber both parties. Obama lost here by 1.5 percentage points in 2008 and slipped to a 4.5 percentage point deficit in 2012. The margin Tuesday could signal how independents are breaking statewide and beyond North Carolina. WAKE In the state's most populous county, the ranks of voters with no party affiliation have grown by almost 50,000 or 24 percent since 2012, while Republican and Democratic registrations have remained roughly level. How those new voters break in a county Obama won by 56,000 votes (11 points) will help determine the statewide outcome and could portend the leanings of urban independents elsewhere. WATAUGA This is one of the few nearly all-white counties in the country that split on Obama's two elections. He won by 4 percentage points in 2008, but his vote totals slipped 13 percent in 2012, resulting in a 3-point loss. Appalachian State University in Boone anchors the population, which is more educated than the broader North Carolina electorate and includes thousands of students -- key Clinton targets. Beyond campus, Watauga has lower income averages and a higher poverty rate, offering Trump an opening. ___ OHIO: In 2012, Obama won by 166,000 votes (3 percentage points) BELMONT This is one of three Ohio River counties Obama won in 2008 but lost in 2012. The county is more than 90 percent white. Fewer voters are college-educated than in the general population and median incomes are lower than the national marks -- all factors that play to Trump's strengths. He won here easily in the Republican primary, trouncing home-state Gov. John Kasich. Obama's vote slipped 13 percent to about 14,000 here in his re-election campaign, while the Republican total climbed 8 percent to almost 17,000. Those totals alone won't flip Ohio to the Republican column, but an uptick for Trump in Belmont could herald gains in similar-profile counties across the state, which has a higher proportion of working-class whites than other battlegrounds. HAMILTON This diverse county, home to Cincinnati, has pockets of everything both candidates are looking for. The city has a large black population. The surrounding areas have college-educated independent and Republican whites Clinton wants, along with working-class whites likely to back Trump. Obama got 225,000 and 220,000 votes here, winning each time by about 6 percentage points. A tighter margin would bode well for Trump. ___ PENNSYLVANIA: Obama won in 2012 by 310,000 votes (5.4 percentage points): CHESTER Obama lost by 0.2 percentage points in 2012, the only metro Philadelphia county he lost after sweeping the metro area in 2008. The Chester population is overwhelmingly white, almost half have college degrees and median income exceeds the national mark. All that makes this county a prime indicator of how Trump is faring among suburban voters who typically back Republicans but are skeptical about Trump. PHILADELPHIA In Obama's re-election, his margin in Philadelphia County was much wider than his statewide margin. As rural and small-town counties trend more Republican, the pressure will be on Clinton to replicate that roughly 6-to-1 cushion approaching a 500,000-vote advantage. ___ Follow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP.

The competitive race for the 10th Congressional District pits Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock against Democrat LuAnn Bennett. And each is trying to woo educated female voters, a pivotal bloc in the suburbs of Northern Virginia. In an election where Donald Trump sits atop the GOP ticket, it would appear the Democrat has an advantage with female voters; in Virginia, they prefer Democrat Hillary Clinton to Trump by a 16-point margin, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll released Tuesday. Men prefer Trump by six points, the poll found. But there are signs that Northern Virginia voters will split their tickets and vote for candidates from different political parties, the poll found. Analysts have rated the 10th District race as a ""toss-up"" tilting toward Comstock. The district includes all of Frederick, Clarke and Loudoun counties as well as the cities of Manassas, Manassas Park and Winchester and sections of Prince William and Fairfax counties. As she courts female voters, Comstock has steered clear of sticky social issues and played down her background as a Hill staffer and GOP operative. Instead, she considers herself a bipartisan lawmaker focused on local concerns, national security and the economy. After selectively criticizing Trump, Comstock issued an all-out repudiation following the release last month of a 2005 video in which he bragged about groping women while on the set of ""Access Hollywood."" The pivot undercut Bennett's strategy to portray the Republicans as allies and may have helped Comstock with independent female voters. Meanwhile, Bennett, a first-time candidate and longtime political donor, has followed the playbook of Democrats such as Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who have won statewide in Virginia by emphasizing gun control, abortion rights and equal pay -- all issues that resonate with female voters. She recently appeared on a panel devoted to gun control with several high-profile Democratic women: Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman turned gun-control advocate after she was injured in a 2011 shooting in Tucson; Wendy Davis, the Texas lawmaker who won national attention by filibustering against an antiabortion law; and Jessica O'Connell, the executive director of Emily's List. Emily's List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, spent $230,000 on pro-Bennett ads in the district, and the group's president has rallied Bennett volunteers. At the gun-control panel at a Loudoun County library, the women shared their stories with a mostly female audience that included a crying toddler. Giffords, whose stilted speech and limp reveal the extent of her injuries, sat next to Bennett, who said there was no issue more important than reducing gun violence. ""I'm a mother. I'm a grandmother,"" Bennett said. ""This is about our children. This is about our grandchildren. This is about the future. We want to keep our children safe."" In fact, veterans of Democratic campaigns in Virginia say few issues resonate with voters in Loudoun County like gun control, which plays well not only with base and moderate Democrats but also Republican voters. Giffords's group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, spent $100,000 on direct mail criticizing Comstock, who received an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association; Bennett got an ""F"".  [Comstock, Bennett make their case to Muslim community at mosque forum]  ""It is clear that gun-violence prevention has become a top voting issue for women across the board,"" said Lori Haas, a gun-control advocate whose daughter was injured in the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. ""When then-candidate McAuliffe ran in 2013, his campaign team was astounded at how much gun-violence prevention moved the needle among women."" That year, McAuliffe broke with convention in Virginia and became an unabashed supporter of stricter guns laws -- a move that helped him defeat former attorney general and conservative Republican Ken Cuccinelli. Gun control also figured prominently in Democrats' failed bid in 2015 to take control of the state Senate. A gun-control group backed by former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pumped $2.3 million into the most competitive races, including against state Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun). At the event with Giffords and Davis, Bennett slammed Comstock's record on gun issues. In Congress, Comstock voted to block consideration of bills that would ban people on terrorist watch lists from buying firearms -- a vote that formed the basis for a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad that went up Wednesday. In the state House of Delegates, she voted to repeal the one-a-month limit on handgun purchases, which was signed into law by then-Gov. Robert McDonnell and remains in place today. Jo Thoburn, chairwoman of the Republican Party committee in the 10th Congressional District, said guns are not a ""women's issue"" and the right to defend oneself is an issue for everyone. She said she was offended by the ""pigeonholing"" of women as a subset of the electorate. ""I believe most women do not want Gabby Giffords-style control,"" she said. ""Pretending like the government can somehow protect us -- if you want protection, carry a gun. I know a lot of women who have concealed carry permits, and they're all voting for Barbara."" In a statement, Comstock's campaign manager, Susan Falconer, said the congresswoman ""has been a leader on women's issues,"" pointing to her support for over-the-counter birth control, family leave for federal employees and increasing the child tax credit. She started a young women's leadership program based on Lean In, the campaign started by Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer. The program has featured BET co-founder Sheila Johnson, who lives in the 10th District. Some of Comstock's television ads close with a soft-focus image of Comstock surrounded by her mother, daughter and granddaughter; no men are visible. Bennett claims Comstock has tried to style herself as a moderate but has a conservative voting record on women's issues, noting she blocked consideration of votes on bills that would require women receive the same pay that men receive in the same jobs. In two debates, Comstock pushed back, saying she pays her female campaign staff more than Bennett pays women who work for her in politics and at her D.C. real estate firm. ""Our opponent has not practiced what she preaches on equal pay by paying men more than women on her campaign. At her developer business, she employs four men and one woman as the website describes in 'key positions,' "" Falconer said. Bennett spokesman Robert Howard said her real estate firm and campaign both ""pay women and men equal pay for equal work, and LuAnn believes that all women should have that right under the law. Barbara Comstock does not. Unlike the congresswoman, LuAnn does not believe men or women should be discriminated against when performing equal work.""  Emily Guskin contributed to this report. "

But it wouldn’t be the best idea.	"   A field trip gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court in March. (REUTERS/Jim Bourg)  We count at least three Senate Republicans who have floated the idea of blocking a President Hillary Clinton's Supreme Court nominee indefinitely. Legally, they totally can do it. Politically, it could backfire. That's because most Senate Republicans' reason for blocking President Obama's nominee was predicated on a timeline (Nov. 8) and a person: the next president. Hours after Justice Antonin Scalia unexpectedly died in February, Senate Republicans' leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), announced that the Senate would wait until the next president took office to fill this vacancy. It's only fair to the American people to let them have a say in this momentous decision, he argued. (Besides, you know, the 2012 election.) A majority of Senate Republicans parroted McConnell's ""wait until after the election"" argument. Republicans were gambling they'd win the White House and be able to replace a conservative justice with another conservative. Now that they might be on the brink of losing (both the gamble and the White House), the ones advocating yet another blockade will have some tricky explaining to do about why this one is necessary. Besides, you know -- the obvious. Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Ted Cruz (Texas) and Richard Burr (N.C.) have all said in the past few weeks they'd consider not considering Clinton's pick and leaving the 9th seat on the court open indefinitely. McCain even promised to take that path, though he walked back that pledge a day later. (There's a way for Republicans to block Clinton's nominee whether they stay in the majority or are in the minority.) Other GOP senators, like John Cornyn (Texas) -- the Senate's No. 2 -- and Marco Rubio (Fla.) are dodging the question but have left open the possibility of a blockade. (Rubio says he opposes the idea of a blockade in principle, but again left the possibility open to block a nominee he doesn't agree with.)      At least three Senate Republicans have suggested blocking a President Hillary Clinton's Supreme Court nominee indefinitely. President Obama criticized that notion at a rally in Chapel Hill, N.C., Nov. 2. (The Washington Post)   There's no line in the Constitution that says the Senate has to confirm a president's Supreme Court appointee, says Russell Wheeler, a Supreme Court expert with the Brookings Institution. But there could be political repercussions when these Senate Republicans try to explain why they said the next president should get to decide, but now...don't want to let the next president decide. Here's McCain's statement after Obama nominated federal Judge Merrick Garland in March. ""This issue is not about any single nominee - it's about the integrity of the Court. With less than a year left in a lame-duck presidency and the long-term ideological balance of the Supreme Court at stake, I believe the American people must have a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court by electing a new president. The last time the American people spoke, they elected a Republican majority to the Senate to act as a 'check and balance' on President Obama's liberal agenda - a responsibility I cannot ignore. We must allow the people to play a role in selecting the next lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court."" (Bold emphasis added by me.) Here's Cruz: ""I proudly stand with my Republican colleagues in our shared belief - our advice and consent - that we should not vote on any nominee until the next president is sworn into office. The People will decide."" Here's Burr:   The American people deserve a voice in the nomination of the next Supreme Court Justice. #SCOTUS pic.twitter.com/q4iYBCqotD -- Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 16, 2016   Here's Cornyn: ""At this critical juncture in our nation's history, Texans and the American people deserve to have a say in the selection of the next lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court... The only way to empower the American people and ensure they have a voice is for the next president to make the nomination to fill this vacancy."" In a February presidential debate, Rubio said he didn't think Obama should appoint someone and that it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to wait until after the election: ""I do not believe the president should appoint someone, and it's not unprecedented."" The irony is that so far, Senate Republicans have been able to get away with setting a record for longest Supreme Court vacancy. Republicans might lose control of the Senate, but it won't be because of Garland, who is not top of mind for most American voters despite Senate Democrats' attempts to make it so. But another blockade could make it top of voters' minds. Democrats have a real case to make now that some Republicans are trying to go back on their word: We waited until after the election, like you wanted. We let the American people pick a new president, like you wanted. Now, why aren't you considering the new president's nominee? That line of attack lays bare just how politically motivated this whole debate about the ninth Supreme Court justice is (and to be clear, it's political on BOTH sides of the aisle). If there's one thing we've re-learned this election cycle, it's that American voters really, really don't like a politician who comes across as politically calculating. And without a good legal or constitutional explanation about why another blockade is necessary, Republicans risk coming across as very politically calculating. And what happens if, at some point in Clinton's presidency, another vacancy opens? Or the court splits 4-4 or passes on some big cases that grab the spotlight? Democrats could pin the blame squarely on Republicans. To sum up, Senate Republicans certainly could decide to block a Clinton pick. But they'll have to talk themselves out of a tight corner to do it."

Now E.U.’s antitrust lawyer is eyeing her next targets.	"  BRUSSELS -- In a year of surging anger about the modern globalized economy, one woman may be the best equipped to defuse tensions -- and she does her work from a sprawling bureaucratic office building in the heart of Brussels. More than almost anyone else in the 500-million-person league that is the European Union, Margrethe Vestager, the E.U. official in charge of competition, has the ability to shape perceptions of an institution that is under attack as never before. As angry voters take to the polls on both sides of the Atlantic amid a surging feeling that the system is rigged, the Dane's mission is to ensure that the little guy has a chance against vast multinational companies. Because the European Union is the largest economic bloc in the world, Vestager's investigations touch powerful players across the globe. She has taken on Google and the Kremlin, and just slapped Apple with a gargantuan fine. She has McDonald's and Facebook in her crosshairs. And she does it all while knitting toy elephants that she bestows on rivals and allies alike.  [How the E.U.'s ruling on Apple explains why Brexit happened]  If she is successful, her efforts could reverberate across Europe, delivering a tough message that Brussels is able to deliver concrete benefits to citizens. But if she overreaches, she could be seen as just another unelected bureaucrat dictating terms to nations trapped within a union that increasingly is seen as causing more strife than comfort.     E.U. antitrust regulators order Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros in taxes plus interest to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through Ireland was illegal state aid. (Reuters)   ""The benefits of globalization do not trickle down automatically,"" Vestager said in an interview in her brightly decorated office. ""It takes politics to make sure that there is a benefit."" Vestager's highest-profile judgment came in late summer, when she announced that Apple had improperly avoided $14.2 billion in payments to Ireland based on a years-long tax deal. The company denies any wrongdoing and plans to appeal. The decision has also come under heavy criticism from the Obama administration, which says that Vestager is twisting competition law and impounding tax revenue that the United States sees as its own.  Vestager ""appears to be adopting an entirely new legal theory and applying it retroactively in a broad and sweeping manner,"" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew wrote this year.  [U.S. raises concerns over European tax probe involving American companies]  And the Irish government worries that the ruling could upend the country's business model, which has attracted investment in recent years by offering a low-tax, English-speaking home for businesses that want a European toehold. But the announcement -- timed in part to dominate the news as Europe returned from its languorous August holidays -- sent a message to ordinary Europeans that powerful companies would not be able to negotiate sweetheart tax deals out of reach of normal citizens. In an era in which blockbuster international trade deals are under fire from opponents who say they neglect all but the strongest business interests, the investigation could make voters sit up and take notice.   Margrethe Vestager. (Jasper Juinen)  ""Vestager has a strong will to go after these cases,"" said Georgios Petropoulos, an expert on the topic at Bruegel, a Brussels-based policy think tank. ""She's not afraid of these big multinationals."" The crossfire has not fazed Vestager, a veteran of political power plays in her native Denmark who helped inspire the main character in the hit TV show ""Borgen,"" her nation's version of ""House of Cards."" ""If my tax rate went down from 0.05 percent to 0.005 percent, I should have felt maybe I should have had a second look at my tax bill,"" Vestager said at a combative news conference in which she announced the Apple ruling. 'Follow the rules' Vestager, 48, was Denmark's deputy prime minister and economy minister before arriving in Brussels in late 2014 as the competition commissioner. She is one of 28 E.U. cardinals whose rank is approximately equal to that of a U.S. Cabinet secretary. Her office is unusually powerful inside the E.U., which typically shares regulatory responsibilities between national governments and Brussels. In the field of competition, however, E.U. regulators have unparalleled powers to enforce bloc-wide rules, meaning they can challenge nations and companies and serve as a rare example of the E.U. delivering concrete benefits to citizens. ""Antitrust is really very special in the commission's having important powers of decision where it doesn't have to refer back to national governments,"" said Alec Burnside, a managing partner at the Brussels office of the Cadwalader law firm, who focuses on E.U. competition issues.  [Europe's cash grab from Apple makes corporate tax reform more urgent]  Vestager shies away from lofty notions about saving the European Union, preferring to focus on the more concrete tasks of her portfolio.  ""It's not in my mission to work against Euroskepticism; it's my mission to work for fair markets,"" she said. But she boils down her sometimes dry, technical work into elemental terms that connect easily with ordinary voters. ""In antitrust, what is at stake is in some ways as old as Adam and Eve, because it is about greed, to get more,"" she said.  ""Few people think about politics every day,"" she said. ""But they are in the market every day"" -- either by working at a job or buying vegetables at the grocery store. The daughter of two Lutheran pastors, Vestager grew up in a small town in Denmark's flatlands. She has said a defining memory of her childhood was the sound of cars rolling up the driveway at all hours of the day, as guests came to ask for help. She tried to preserve that focus on listening to others when she entered politics in her 20s. But listening to others does not mean agreeing with them, and many who have tangled with her say that she is steely once she has made up her mind. On a coffee table in her Brussels office is a cast of a hand with an upraised middle finger, which was given to her by a group of Danish unions enraged by her efforts to curb unemployment benefits. She says she keeps it as a reminder that political decisions will inevitably upset some people. Those who have worked with her say that her style comes from her experience leading a niche pro-Europe political party, the centrist Social Liberals, in Denmark's fragmented political system.  [A tax loophole for U.S. companies operating overseas just got tighter]  In such a party, which typically focuses on a few pet issues, ""your job is not to persuade the majority of the people to do something specific,"" said Henrik Kjerrumgaard, one of Vestager's advisers when she was in Danish government. ""You can allow yourself to say things that make people angry. Because when someone gets angry, you know you've communicated with them in a pure and direct way."" That no-nonsense style may be helping to shift opinions in some Euroskeptic countries -- beginning with Vestager's own. Denmark is famously skittish about handing power to Brussels, and much like Britain, it agreed to join the European Union only if it was allowed to opt out of a host of issues. After British voters made the startling decision in June to leave the European Union, many looked at Denmark as a possible next candidate for a departure. Instead, the desire to leave the European Union has decreased, according to opinion polls. Part of that is due to Vestager's work, observers say. ""A lot of people who didn't like her while she was in Denmark like her now because they say, 'Wow, she's doing what people think the E.U. should do,' "" said Elisabet Svane, a Danish political journalist who wrote a biography of Vestager. ""It's quite practical. She's saying: 'You're not following the rules? Follow the rules.' A lot of E.U. policy is out in the skies, and this is very down-to-earth."" ""She's doing more good for the European Union now in Denmark than if she had still been in Denmark,"" Svane said.
