(Bigstock)  Parents, teachers and privacy advocates are urging a federal commission not to bend to requests to change a federal law so that a centralized federal database of students' personal data can be established. (See letter below.) The Education Department has plans to build a system of records that will collect detailed data on thousands of students -- even though experts say there are not sufficient safeguards to protect student privacy. And the influential Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has supported a number of school reforms implemented by the Obama administration, recently announced that a 2017 higher-education-advocacy priority is collecting data on student outcomes. Supporters of the creation of a federal database say it will help schools better counsel students about their post-secondary education and help policymakers make smarter decisions. Critics are concerned that the data will be misused, released to third parties -- or hacked.  That has, unfortunately, happened before, such as in 2014, when the personnel records and security-clearance files of more than 22 million people stored by the Office of Personnel Management were hacked. A coalition of organizations -- including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy -- just sent a letter to the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking urging that it not support the lifting of a ban on such a database, which was established in the Higher Education Act of 2008. It says in part, referring to PII, or personally identifiable information: Any recommendation by the Commission to establish a federal data clearinghouse of student PII could effectively create lifelong dossiers on nearly every individual in the nation. Instead, we strongly believe that the federal government should use aggregate, de-identified student information already maintained by states or districts for research or policy decisions. How President-elect Donald Trump would feel about such a database is unclear. He has criticized a strong federal role in education -- and even threatened to eliminate the Education Department, but he has not made an issue of student data privacy. Williamson Evers,  a former assistant education secretary and one of the people Trump is thought to be considering for education secretary, has expressed concerns about student privacy, such as in the following 2013 testimony: When I was U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education, the student privacy office was part of my portfolio.  Until December 2011, the U.S. Department of Education interpreted the student privacy protections in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) strictly, but reasonably. But in 2011, the Obama administration turned those protections upside down. The Obama administration reinterpreted technical terms and provisions of the law to allow access to student personal data to non-education government agencies and to private vendors and contractors. It removed requirements that parents had to give consent if third-parties were given access to student personal data. The Obama administration made this change, in large measure, to facilitating workforce planning by government agencies. We live in a time of concern about abuse of data collection and data management -- by the NSA, the IRS, and other agencies. Ohio policymakers should be concerned about the privacy of student personal data and its possible misuse. The student data privacy issue has brought together allies from different political camps. As Inside Higher Ed, a trade publication, notes, the ACLU is joined in opposition to lifting the ban with Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), who is likely to take over the leadership of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. In the following letter, a number of organizations explain why a centralized federal database of student personal data is a dangerous idea.

The city of Obninsk was granted a permit for a rally Saturday in favor of the U.S. president-elect -- another sign of Trump's embrace in a country whose relations with the Obama administration soured badly over rifts such as Syria and Ukraine. The demonstration was organized by Artyom Mainas, a 27-year-old blogger in Obninsk, a nuclear-research center some 60 miles south of Moscow. He said he decided to act after seeing news from the United States about demonstrations in the wake of Trump's election.  ""I thought, well, it would be good if we can organize something here in Russia to demonstrate our support to the newly-elected president,"" Mainas said by telephone Friday. ""We think that Trump is a good candidate for Russia.""  Russians have greeted the election of Trump as a victory, in part because of the Republican's support for Putin and calls for better ties with Russia during the campaign. On Friday, Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said Trump and Putin see ""eye-to-eye politically,"" according to the TASS news agency. Throughout the campaign, Russian officials and state media constantly warned that a Hillary Clinton presidency could erode already poor U.S.-Russia relations . Meanwhile, Moscow has conducted nationwide civil defense drills. The U.S. administration accused Russia of interfering on Trump's behalf, including hacks of emails from top members of Clinton's campaign team. Earlier this week, President Obama warned his successor not to embrace Putin too readily.  [Obama to Trump: Stand up to Putin and Russia]  Putin also sounded a bellicose note Friday, saying Russia is working to develop new weapons to ""ensure a strategic balance."" The Russian leader, wrapping up a week-long series of talks with his senior commanders on Moscow's plans to modernize its military, said that Russia is developing state-of-the art weapons that draw on laser, hypersonic and robotic technologies. ""We are giving special attention to the development of weapons based on new physical principles that allow selective, pinpoint impact on critically important elements of enemy weapons and infrastructure,"" Putin said at the meeting, broadcast on Russian television from the Black Sea resort of Sochi.  Russian military officials have recently described developing warheads for ballistic missiles that would be invisible to antimissile defenses, or capable of evading them. Russia has protested NATO's U.S.-led missile defense system, and Putin on Friday appeared to lodge a response to the U.S. development of Prompt Global Strike, a weapons systems that would allow the U.S. to deliver a strike anywhere in the world within an hour. ""We will do all necessary to ensure a strategic balance,"" Putin added. ""Our task is to efficiently neutralize any military threats to Russia, including those created by strategic missile defenses, the implementation of the concept of global strike, and information wars."" The Kremlin believes that the Obama administration is waging a propaganda war to isolate Russia, and a top Putin aide accused the White House on Thursday of ""doing everything it can to drive bilateral ties into such a deadlock"" that it would be difficult for a new team to improve relations.  [Trump's pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy]  The aide, Yuri Ushakov, said Trump supported Putin's call for normalizing ties, and ""expressed his readiness not only to normalize ties, but also develop them intensively in all areas."" Mainas, the blogger who organized the pro-Trump demonstration scheduled for Saturday, said his idea has attracted more support than he expected when he applied for a permit for a rally of 40 people.  ""I've gotten so many calls already and people are coming in from other cities, so I think there might be more,"" he said. ""We hope that Russia-U.S. relations will improve under Trump and so we have to express our support.""  Natalya Abbakumova contributed to this report.

""If the presidency of Donald Trump inspires anything, it should be a fierce spirit of opposition,"" Leon Wieseltier wrote last weekend in these pages. ""The proper response is steely resolve to wage the fight of our lives,"" Jonathan Chait wrote in New York magazine. But what can anti-Trump liberals and progressives actually do? With his party in control of the White House and Congress, and with Trump about to tip the balance of the Supreme Court, it's easy to despair over how little leverage the Democrats seem to have.  One episode from history reveals reasons to hope. In 1850, like the Democrats and their allies in 2016, the abolitionists took a terrible hit. They had worked for 20 years to bring down the worst institution in American history, chattel slavery. And they thought they might have been on the verge of a breakthrough, with a proposal to ban slavery in all the territories taken in the Mexican War. But in the Compromise of 1850, Congress basically handed those territories to the pro-slavery forces, and, with an updated Fugitive Slave Act, it conscripted every Northern citizen into an army of slave catchers, obliged to aid in sending black people back to the slaveholding South.  And yet, a little over a decade later, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. The abolitionists' comeback was impressive. And it offers a road map away from the election of 2016.  Indeed, by marching and making street theater, forces of resistance to the Trump and GOP victories have already started emulating the abolitionists. In 1854, the federal government tried and convicted fugitive Anthony Burns, sending him back to slavery. Unfortunately for the slaveholders, the abolitionists happened to be holding their annual convention in Boston, where the trial was held. After an ax-wielding mob rushed the courthouse, Boston's mayor put the city under martial law. And on the day of Burns's rendition, 50,000 protesters lined the streets, as federal troops marched the hapless fugitive to the ship that would take him back to his master in Virginia. Chronicled at every step, the Via Dolorosa of Burns awakened and intensified opposition to slavery throughout the North. Boston's Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the feelings of many when he said of the Fugitive Slave Law: ""I will not obey it, by God.'' Today's counterpart to the Burns rendition, of course, would be deportations. Trump has vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. His recent remarks have focused on deporting criminals, but he's also threatened to overturn the amnesty that has protected ""dreamers"" -- immigrants brought to the United States as children. What would the abolitionists do? They would gather in huge numbers every time federal agents came for a Hispanic honors student. They would compel those agents to use force if they wanted to proceed. They would document every moment. And they would use the media -- back then it was the penny press, the Twitter of its time -- to spread the images everywhere. Every vulnerable dreamer should be carrying a cellphone with a number to text if the feds come.  But periodic protests are not enough. Resistance movements need the support of permanent infrastructure. And they must be willing to engage in the time-intensive and expensive organizing that actually changes minds and behavior. In 1831, William Lloyd Garrison and friends he called the Twelve Apostles met in a black church (no white one would have them) and signed the charter of the New England Anti-Slavery Society. Theirs was the first of what would be thousands of such societies formed in the subsequent decades -- and they were especially important after the 1850 defeat, when the normal channels of politics looked so hopeless. These groups were highly organized. They elected executive committees to run their affairs, dispatched speakers to spread the word and held annual conventions. They also had women's auxiliaries; the gender divide sounds awful today, but the women were the heart of the movement. They held fairs to raise money and sell goods made without slave labor. Then they started going door to door with petitions. The pro-slavery Congress forbade them from delivering those petitions, but that didn't matter. Each time a woman approached a neighbor about signing, she got a chance to publicize slavery's cruelty. Of course, the Democratic Party is an established network. But too often, it reaches out to people only at election time. In this year's presidential campaign, its outreach to key constituencies, such as Hispanics and Rust Belt voters, was overly dependent on television and radio ads. The party -- and, just as critically, growing networks of organizations such as Black Lives Matter and Mi Familia Vota -- should look to the model of the abolitionists. They should engage people in person, with concrete actions such as old-fashioned petition drives. Social media can help energize supporters, but beware of activism that never translates beyond Facebook or Twitter. The Freedom to Marry activists developed a smart approach to same-sex marriage rights: They trained supporters to each have conversations with five of their friends or relatives -- and to ask people who responded positively to seek out five more. As a leader of People United for Justice, the Arizona Hispanic outreach group that finally brought down racist sheriff Joe Arpaio, put it succinctly: ""This is about community organizing rather than electoral campaigning.""  Anti-Trump forces should also embrace the potential for states and cities to become bastions of resistance. Before the Civil War, threats of nullification and secession were not limited to the slave states. Garrison, the Massachusetts abolitionist, advocated ""disunion"" from the start. Who wants to be in a club with slave owners, he asked? The Northern states became the abolitionists' strongholds in the 1850s. They passed laws ordering their officials not to participate in renditioning slaves. And when federal authorities initiated proceedings under the Fugitive Slave Act, state courts proceeded to nullify them. In Wisconsin, for instance, after abolitionist Sherman Booth was jailed for encouraging protesters who liberated a fugitive slave due to be sent back to Missouri, the state Supreme Court freed him and declared the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional. When the U.S. Supreme Court asked to review the case, Wisconsin simply refused to forward the papers. The last thing President James Buchanan did before handing the White House to Lincoln was to clear Booth.  There are echoes of this strategy in the pledge by California's legislative leaders that they ""are not going to allow one election to reverse generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity, scientific advancement, economic output, and sense of global responsibility."" There are echoes, too, in the declarations of Washington, Chicago, New York and Seattle that they will remain ""sanctuary cities,"" protecting residents from deportation. And there are echoes in statements like that of the Los Angeles police chief , who said, ""If the federal government takes a more aggressive role on deportation, then they'll have to do that on their own.""  Yes, Democratic power at the state level is limited. Democrats will control the governorship and both branches of the legislature in only six states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Oregon and Rhode Island. But they could be joined in their resistance by some populous and important states that voted against Trump by large margins and that have at least one branch in Democratic hands -- Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Washington among them. Together, these states could make for a formidable opposition. If a Trump-tipped Supreme Court overturns abortion rights or same-sex marriage, these states could offer themselves as havens. If the GOP repeals Obamacare, they could imitate Massachusetts and pass state-based health-care systems. If the Trump administration demands any records they may have of illegal immigrants, states and cities could refuse. By doing so, they would risk losing federal money. But they would also stand to benefit. They would attract businesses and workers, especially young workers, who tend to be more progressive. As North Carolina recently demonstrated, when its transgender bathroom law prompted the loss of billions of dollars in business, defending progressive positions on social issues can make good economic sense, too. If Democrats and their allies follow the abolitionist plan for organizing, they stand a good chance of reversing their ill fortune. It must have seemed like a permanent failure for the abolitionists when they heard about the Compromise of 1850. But the end of slavery wasn't as far off as they feared.

But it wasn’t closing.	" DETROIT -- President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. Trump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a ""Lincoln plant"" would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there. A factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving production of the MKC. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. It's possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. On Friday, Ford would say only that the MKC decision was ""recent,"" but spokeswoman Christin Baker wouldn't say exactly when it was made or whether Trump directly influenced it. The MKC and Escape are essentially the same vehicle and are now built by the same workers on the same assembly line. But while Ford has sold over 258,000 Escapes so far this year, it's only sold about 21,000 MKCs. So, moving the MKC would have had little impact on the factory even if Escape production was not increased. Still, Trump claimed credit for saving a factory from moving to Mexico. ""I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!"" Trump said in one of two tweets on the subject. His initial tweet said: ""Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico."" Ford Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker's plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. Ford plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck.  ""We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,"" Baker said in an email.

On view through Nov. 20 at Kaplan Gallery, VisArts at Rockville. The artist's realist oils depict gentle moments of light and color, punctuated by dark and menacing images. (Michael Sastre)  In his realist oils, Michael Sastre depicts pink flamingos, green jungles and everyday life in Caribbean hamlets. Oh, yeah, and drug smuggling. The artist's VisArts show, ""Collision/Collusion: A Personal Underground,"" could be a collection of unusually detailed storyboards from a planned narco-thriller, or a collaboration between John James Audubon and cocaine-conspiracy reporter Gary Webb. When the painter includes a drive-in theater in one vignette, the movie on the screen is ""Scarface."" Yet Sastre, who has a studio in Rockville and lives part time in Miami, doesn't disclose a political or even narrative agenda. In the foreground of his paintings are gentle moments, such as a river baptism or a dog's nap. The drug-laden aircraft that swoop through these landscapes are as everyday as the birds whose flights mirror the planes' movements. The artist has ""a very close family connection to the world depicted in his recent work,"" a mysterious biographical note reports. But Sastre seems just as interested in the pictures' settings as in their activities. He carefully renders dense foliage, crimson skies and complex reflections in languid rivers. The show also includes pencil sketches and airplane parts, but it's most compelling when all of its elements -- light and color, scenery and activity, banality and menace -- combine in a vision of radiant nature and grubby humanity.

Shoreline The coast is quieter in ""Shoreline,"" Carroll Square Gallery's show of three photographers who document Mid-Atlantic waterfronts. Greg Kahn looks at both people and places to reveal change on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Glen McClure presents a suite of nearly life-size portraits of shipyard workers in Norfolk. Miller Taylor's wide-angle shots, mostly of buildings condemned after a 2009 nor'easter, signal the precariousness of the human presence on North Carolina's Outer Banks. There's no violence in Taylor's black-and-white pictures, although in one, an ominously dark sky sets off streaks of white clouds. Whether keyed to the horizon or the lines of a battered bridge, the photos emphasize the sweep of a world that's too wide for a camera lens (or a human eye) to encompass. McClure's pictures, also black and white, are formal portraits of people in gear that represents the physicality of their jobs. Helmets abound, and one man is in full diving gear. The majority of the subjects are women and include a 42-year veteran and a 22-year-old who was her employer's only female shipfitter. Their still faces belie the challenges of their work. Kahn, the only one of the trio showing color images, captures a different sort of laborer -- crab pickers, oyster shuckers, muskrat trappers -- as well as places where the life they know is vanishing. The most evocative image is one of the surf washing across a two-lane highway. This watery glaze is no nor'easter, but it indicates the coastal future as surely as Taylor's storm-battered structures.

Werner Drewes ""Trespassing,"" the title piece in the Werner Drewes retrospective at the Washington Printmakers Gallery, arrays stark shapes in black, gray and yellow. The print demonstrates the austere formalism that might be expected from someone who studied at the Bauhaus, as Drewes did. But more often, the black emblems float amid brighter colors, as if to declare that the artist has found sunnier climes. The blue-heavy ""Drifting"" even dispenses altogether with black, giving the picture the blitheness its name promises. Although born in Germany, Drewes spent most of his life in the United States; from 1972 until his death in 1985, his home was Reston. The works in this show are primarily from 1970 to 1985, although the earliest date to the 1940s. Those prints are black-and-white engravings, but the later ones are all woodcuts. The shapes retain something of the wood's grain, so the final image has a rough, worn quality. Although his compositions often reflect the Bauhaus' machine-age aesthetic, Drewes countered that with the natural and the handmade.

But if you expect Donald Trump to act as a model of fiscal rectitude as president, the bond market has a message for you, and a very Trumpian one at that:  ""Wrong!"" Investors have been yanking money out of bonds around the world since Trump's victory became apparent early Wednesday, sending prices tumbling and wiping out several months of gains. They expect higher debt, higher inflation and higher interest rates -- all negatives for bonds. Bond investors can get things horribly wrong, and it's only been a few days. But for a normally calm market, a sort of sleepy cousin of the stock market that has been mostly rising, it's been a stunning turn of events.  ""The bond market is supposed to be a dull, boring, stable place,"" said Colin Lundgren, head of U.S. fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. ""Instead, it's been at the center of the storm."" After years of too little inflation, investors are worried that Trump will inadvertently kick off too much and send the national debt up sharply. If that happens, he could do something long forecast, and much feared: kill off the three-decade-long bond bull market that has lifted prices so high, and pushed borrowing rates so low, many experts think it's a bubble ready to pop. Investors are demanding more interest to lend to the U.S. government now because they fear higher inflation is coming as Trump opens the spending spigots to get the economy to grow faster. He's promised to deliver 3.5 percent growth a year. That is much faster than the average 2 percent or so recently, and higher than many economists think possible on a sustained basis. To get there, Trump says he'll slash regulations and taxes, and use federal tax credits to generate $1 trillion from private sources to fix and expand the nation's roads, bridges, airports and transit systems. That has helped send stocks higher in anticipation of bigger corporate profits. But the country will likely need to borrow more under Trump's plans -- a lot more, according to estimates from the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. It says the combination of higher spending and lower taxes will add $5.3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade. That is on top of the nearly $20 trillion in debt that ballooned under President Barack Obama and his predecessor George W. Bush. The Trump campaign says his spending won't be a problem because faster growth will increase tax revenue even at lower rates. Michael Lewitt, a bond fund manager who says he voted for Trump, isn't buying it.  ""Cutting taxes and spending more money and not reforming entitlements, that's going to send debt through the roof,"" said Lewitt of the Credit Strategist Group. ""The market is saying he is not going to worry about this, and that's going to be bad for bonds -- really bad for bonds."" Another possible problem for bond holders is Trump's protectionist leanings. On the campaign trail, he threatened to slap tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods and rip up trade pacts. If he follows through, that could stoke inflation by sending prices of imported goods sharply higher. Bond investors loathe inflation because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed payments. A little more inflation might be a good thing, of course. If anything, the world has been suffering from too little of it. Consumer prices have risen 1.5 percent in the past year, about a half point lower than what is considered the ideal level. Higher inflation is usually a sign of faster economic growth, and it has a way of building on itself. It causes people to spend right away on things out of fear they might have to pay more for them later, and that can stimulate even more growth. But it's hard to contain inflation once it starts revving up. A Trump presidency, some investors think, makes it more likely the Federal Reserve will raise short-term borrowing rates next month to keep prices from rising too fast. What makes this all unnerving is that the bond market is such a fragile place now. The interest that investors are getting on some government bonds is lower than it has been in hundreds of years. Even a little more inflation could wipe out gains from collecting that interest over the life of their bonds, and so many investors are jittery and have moved fast to dump their holdings. That is what happened in trading in the U.S. government bonds in recent days. Investors dumped Treasury notes due in 10 years, sending their yields soaring from 1.75 percent to 2.15 percent in just 36 hours. It typically takes many months for yields to move that much. All this would be bad enough if there wasn't so much debt at risk now. In the eight years since the peak in borrowing before 2008 financial crisis, governments, households and companies around the globe have taken on another $69 trillion in debt, a jump of 53 percent, according to McKinsey Global Institute. Given the complicated global web of bond trading, the danger is that a sudden drop in the price of bonds could trigger selling across markets and for many different kinds of assets. In the 2008 financial crisis, a drop in the value of mortgage bonds sent the prices of stocks and other bonds plunging as investors scrambled to raise cash by selling even things they thought were fairly priced. Of course, bond investors could be getting the Trump presidency all wrong, and quickly start buying bonds they were just selling. A Republican Congress might reject or at least limit any Trump stimulus that would entail gobs of additional spending and borrowing. And just how much Trump wants to spend is unclear because he was so vague on the campaign trail about his plans, and he has no political record. James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Asset Management, says bond investors have plenty of reason to worry, though. It's not just Trump's campaign promises. He spent his business career, after all, as a developer putting up buildings, and borrowing a lot to do it.  ""Project what he's done his entire lifetime, and think of that on government level,"" said Abate. ""He's going to issue debt, and that is what the bond market is spooked about."" ___ Bernard Condon can be reached at http://twitter.com/BernardFCondon. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

In a brief statement Wednesday, the Kremlin said Putin has sent Trump a telegram to congratulate him on winning. Putin expressed ""his hope to work together for removing Russian-American relations from their crisis state."" Putin also says he has confidence that building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington -- one based on principles of equality, mutual respect and a real accounting each other's positions -- is in the interest of both nations and the world.

(Kimihiro Hoshino/Agence France-Presse via GettyImages)  In May, the New Yorker called 2016 ""The Year of the Political Troll."" Hate speech, intimidation, mockery, and racism are increasing globally online. In fact, there's so much incivility, animosity, and disrespect on social media that some 65 percent of American social media users express resignation and frustration about online political conversations. That's not just affecting individual social media users. It's hurting democracy. Here's why. Trolling discourages social media's democratic potential  Only a few years ago, many observers and scholars were touting social media's tremendous potential to enrich democracy. That potential included the possibility that political actors and ordinary citizens from a variety of groups might communicate directly, thereby signaling the beginning of a more participatory kind of politics and a gradual repairing of a relationship notoriously characterized by mistrust. But in our new paper in the Journal of Communication, we show that trolling and harassment have made politicians extremely cautious about engaging with citizens on these platforms. Direct interaction brings the risk of falling victim to trolling and harassment almost immediately. Why engage with the public if doing so brings only personal abuse?   [More and more people get their news via social media. Is that good or bad?]   Instead, politicians use these tools for their marketing and mobilization potential. On Twitter, politicians can promote themselves, bypass gatekeepers, personalize their messages, and craft their own images without -- if they prefer -- responding to a single question from the public. That reduces or even eliminates social media's potential for open, interactive political deliberation that could better inform our democracies.   [How social media undermined Egypt's democratic transition]   Here's how we tested this and what we found We empirically tested this with data from the tweets of German, Greek, Spanish, and British candidates running in the 2014 elections to the European Parliament. We analyzed the tweets they posted and the reactions those elicited. Using automated text analysis techniques and supervised classification, we were able to measure which of the candidates' messages aimed at engaging with voters (as opposed to broadcasting campaign messages) and whether the responses were polite and civil. Around 5 percent of all tweets mentioning candidates were impolite -- but that percentage was even higher for candidates who were trying to interact with the public.   [Tweeting Turkey, or how social media may have fundamentally changed the nature of coups]   As the figure below shows, messages posted by candidates who try to connect with voters brought vitriol. Protected by their apparent anonymity on Twitter, some people would respond to interactions by harassing or attacking the candidate. This result holds when we compare across different candidates and over time.    Tweets by candidates to the European Parliament who try to engage directly with voters tend to receive more (as in, greater quantity) impolite responsesData: European Election Study 2014, Social Media Study.Figure: Yannis Theocharis, Pablo Barbera, Zoltan Fazekas, Sebastian Popa.  Methodology: We use automated text analysis and supervised learning methods to measure whether each individual tweet by a candidate engages the public or broadcasts to them, and to detect impoliteness and incivility in citizens' replies. To facilitate the visualization, the figure displays tweets aggregated into 20 different bins by country, according to their predicted probability of being considered engaging. What do our findings mean? 1. Politicians aren't ignoring citizens on social media. They're avoiding them.  Some observers have claimed that politicians use social media to provide a spectacle of interactivity -- and have decided to use those tools not for genuinely engaging citizens and supporters, but for ""push"" communications that can help them win, such as asking people to vote or contribute to their campaign. In fact, many politicians do try to launch discussions with the public on Twitter. But when they do, they're attacked in return -- and risk becoming the target of trolling campaigns. Such campaigns can require significant damage control and can irreparably harm candidates' public images. A recent study commissioned by the Telegraph showed that, from the tweets addressed to British politicians, only a minority represent constructive criticism or legitimate complaints. Most politicians who post anything quickly become subject to constant personal abuse. Even highly calculated tweets can backfire, as you can see in the responses when the Hillary Clinton campaign asked people to express their feelings about student debt in three emoji. Getting snark and criticism in return, candidates become discouraged and reluctant to engage. They adjust their social media communications, reducing their attempts at interactive discussion and instead ""pushing"" out messages. Those who do risk direct engagement interactively should know what to expect and have a specialized team that can deal with this. 2. Citizens and social media platforms bear some responsibility for discouraging politicians' civic engagement online Even when candidates are willing to communicate directly online, they have good reasons to choose not to risk it. A significant minority of citizens tend to behave badly in these largely anonymous online platforms, in part because of the constraints imposed (or at least not prevented) by the platforms themselves. Social media platforms bear some responsibility as well. Twitter isn't effectively curbing online incivility. That means trolls thrive, a fact recognized by Twitter's former chief executive. 3. Trolling is toxic for democracy Finally, the toxic effect of this behavior for democracy must not be underestimated. Yes, trolling encourages candidates to use social media only for marketing and not for interaction. But trolling is still more corrosive for online political discussions more generally. Incivility, online harassment and abuse increase others' anger, anxiety and aversion. Trolling may also downgrade the overall quality of online discussions, demobilize citizens who are trolled and reduce satisfaction with the platform's potential for discourse. More work must be done on how to effectively reduce such harassment, to benefit both citizens individually and democracy in general.
