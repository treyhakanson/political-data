The group said in a report released Friday that the 2012 law has hurt freedom of expression and individual rights in Russia. It said 148 organizations have been put on the list of ""foreign agents,"" of which 27 have shut. Many of them provided services not provided by the state, such as legal representation or psychological support for victims of discrimination or violence. The law requires all NGOs that receive foreign funding and engage in vaguely defined political activities to register as foreign agents, a term that carries Cold War connotations of spying.

Opera Teen, a veteran reviewer at 18, has submitted his first review to the Washington Post. (Photo: courtesy of Harry Rose.)  Some readers may remember the 11-year-old who wrote two opera reviews for the Washington Post a couple of years ago. In the same spirit of letting younger opera fans be heard from, I am introducing Harry Rose, 18, known to his many readers and Twitter followers as Opera Teen. Rose also fell in love with opera when he was 11, started blogging about it, and has since written for parterre.com, been profiled in the Christian Science Monitor, and seen his blog picked up by the Huffington Post. This fall, he matriculated at Georgetown University, much to the benefit of Washington music lovers. You can read his coverage of the Washington National Opera's season opener, ""The Marriage of Figaro,"" on his blog; here, he gives his views on the second cast of ""The Daughter of the Regiment,"" which I reviewed with the first cast on opening night. by Harry Rose In all the frenzy associated with making opera palatable to the younger generations, comic opera seems to be often overlooked. What aspects of a performance can make an increasingly cynical younger set overlook the typical farce and slapstick and engage with the story beyond a polite chuckle? Well, as Thursday night's Daughter of the Regiment at Washington National Opera revealed, sometimes all it takes is a change of cast. Andrew Stenson and Andriana Chuchman, the Tonio and Marie that are alternating with the ""starrier"" (yet not ideally cast) Lawrence Brownlee and Lisette Oropesa, bring an earnest, infectious enthusiasm and significant voices to match. Singing with confidence and acting with a lighthearted sincerity, the pair lit up an audience peppered with young people and elevated Saturday's middling first performance to not only a strong case for the opera itself, but a strong case for recruiting young, fresh-faced singers to perform it. The plot of Gaetano Donizetti's 1840 opera is trite, but the music is some of his most gorgeous and evocative. In the midst of the Napoleonic wars, the brassy Marie serves as the canteen girl for the 21st Regiment who has cared for her since infancy. But when Marie's noble parentage is revealed, she is spirited away from her adoptive fathers and the Tyrolean Tonio, her true love. In the end, only high jinks in an upper-crust chateau can bring the two lovers together again with a blessing from Marie's long-lost mother, the Marquise de Berkenfeld. Donizetti's music impeccably matches the settings throughout the opera, spanning from the Alpine-esque horn solo that starts the overture to the militaristic ebullience of the Regiment and the hoity-toity majesty of the Marquise's castle. These atmospheres were all communicated with elegant sweep by Maestro Christopher Allen, though there was some occasional discord between sections of the WNO Orchestra and the singers. Chuchman, last seen at WNO as Showboat's Magnolia in 2013, brought a voice of veiled luster as Marie. Sounding seemingly unfettered to a central core, she delivered high-flying technical capabilities to her singing across the range, hyper-focused high notes, and a tomboyish charm to her acting. She was well-matched by Stenson's Tonio. Though his voice lacks the lushness and resonance that Donizetti's Italianate music lends itself to, he compensated with an endearing characterization and stylish negotiation of the French text that suggests that his clean, forward-placed tenor might find a welcome home in French repertoire. Singing with a firmly-supported bass and commitment to the slapstick elements of the production, Kevin Burdette made a strapping Sulpice. His counterpart, the Marquise de Berkenfeld, was played by the sympathetic Deborah Nansteel whose unruly middle register and imperfect French was overpowered only by the relentless swooning and primping she was directed to do. As the Duchess of Krakenthorp, the matriarch of the family that the Marquise is eyeing for Marie, Cindy Gold did an admirable job recycling the English text written for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who performed the role on opening night, though Gold's delivery understandably lacked the delicious political tinge it had coming from Justice Ginsburg. Robert Longbottom's production is straightforward, housed in attractive and minimalistic sets by James Noone, but heavily reliant on singers to electrify it. His choreography, though, leaves something to be desired, as it recalls more of an amateur recreation of what Jerome Robbins devised for ""Wherever We Go"" from Gypsy rather than any type of spontaneous behavior. The WNO chorus sang with laudable unity and surprisingly idiomatic French. Audiences can catch this cast on November 19th and see performances featuring Brownlee and Oropesa on the 18th and 20th."

Follow these steps to find holiday harmony.	"    So, it's fallen to you to host Thanksgiving dinner. For those who choose to accept the challenge, it's easy to let the stressful parts (buying, cooking, cleaning) become more important than the rewarding parts (socializing, eating, keeping leftovers). To assist all those first-time hosts, we tapped two professional party planners to advise on the best way to make a daunting job anxiety-free.  Start planning ASAP. Will dinner be casual or formal? Will plates be china, plastic or paper? Will you set a table or will people be eating and mingling? These are all details you want to work out on the sooner side, according to Andre Wells, a professional party planner who's the founder of D.C.-based Events by Andre Wells. ""The fewer things you have to do as the date gets closer, the more successful your event will be,"" he says. Anna Marie Lowery, events planner for the Consumer Federation of America and an experienced host herself who lives in the District, suggests giving yourself a week to prepare.  So if you haven't started planning yet, get on it. As in, right now. Make lists. A lot of them. The most successful entertainers are the ones who stay organized, Wells says. If you're going solo with hosting duties, he advises making two lists: ""What the dinner is, so you don't forget stuff. And then the items that you need to prepare."" If you're having a Friendsgiving, or a dinner where you delegate some cooking duties to your guests, Wells says to make a list of everything you want at the dinner first, then start assigning tasks. The key here is to be methodical about it. ""If I have my good friend Amy -- who I know is always late -- bring a protein like the turkey, I want to make sure I tell her an appropriate time,"" Wells says. Ditch the decor -- for the most part, anyway. ""Keep it inexpensive, using what you have,"" Lowery says. ""Mismatching glassware and dishes is fine. Food and cocktails will spice up the table."" You don't have to go crazy with decor since the Thanksgiving essentials are organically decorative. The turkey, as Lowery points out, is usually the table's centerpiece, anyway. Handmade place cards are a nice personal touch if you have time. For a quick bit of elegance, Lowery suggests slicing some cucumbers or lemons in a jug of water for guests. Putting on a playlist with some funk music -- Lowery is a fan of the Alabama Shakes -- is also an easy way to generate a feel-good vibe. ""You want to make it seem like it's seamless for you as the host to entertain,"" Wells adds. That means don't stress over inconsequential details. Give yourself plenty of cooking time. ""You don't want to invite people over at 2 p.m. and dinner won't be ready for another 21/2 hours,"" Wells says. Don't be that host who keeps hungry people waiting. If you told people arrival is at 3:00 and dinner is at 4:00, make sure you stick to it. Get your home in shape. Per Wells, put down post-its where each dish will be placed on the table. That way, if you're solo hosting, you don't overwhelm yourself with clattering dishes and moving hot plates. And if you're waiting for friends to bring food, they know just where to put them when they get there. He also advises to have the oven warmed up and ready for when guests arrive with their hot food, and if you're going buffet-style, to have the plates out and stacked and the napkins rolled. ""You want to make it easy for your guests,"" he says. And anything else you can do the day before (like cleaning the bathroom), do it early.  Keep the food simple. Stick to Wells' list of essentials: a protein (turkey or alternatives such as a chicken, ham or roast), starch (cornbread, mashed potatoes, etc.), vegetables (green beans, asparagus, collard greens, etc.) and dessert (literally anything sweet). ""If you have those things, you're all set,"" he says. ""The rest are just things to add."" And finally, try to supervise heavy dinner talk. The current state of politics is an inevitable conversation at the dinner table, and even if views are similar, it's bound to be an impassioned one. ""I feel like if you're the host and the conversation is getting too heavy and personalities are getting too much, it is your job to reel it in and change direction,"" Wells says. He suggests keeping ice breakers or board games handy. ""Avoid politics and religion as much as possible,"" Lowery says. ""There are more positive things to talk about than that."" And if things are getting really rowdy, Lowery adds, ""Change the subject and serve dessert."""

Two days later, Trump called in to a radio show run by a friendly political operative who offered a suggestion. Was it possible, asked the host, Stephen K. Bannon, that Trump hadn't really meant that mosques should be closed? ""Were you actually saying, you need a [New York City police] intelligence unit to get a network of informants?"" Bannon asked. He continued: ""I guess what I'm saying is, you're not prepared to allow an enemy within . . . to try to tear down this country?"" Trump -- presented with a less controversial but entirely different idea than what he'd actually said -- agreed.     Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Senator-elect Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) denounce the acts of hatred that have arose since Donald Trump's election, and urge Trump to rescind Stephen Bannon's appointment. (Reuters)   ""That's right. That's not going to happen,"" he told Bannon.     Today, Trump is president-elect. Bannon, the former Breitbart News chief who helped guide Trump's victorious campaign, is set to be one of the new president's most influential advisers. The clearest public sense of how the two will work together -- and what policies Bannon may try to push -- can be gleaned from a series of one-on-one interviews on Bannon's radio show between November 2015 and June of this year.  In those exchanges, a dynamic emerged, with Bannon often coaxing Trump to agree to his viewpoint, whether on climate change, foreign policy or the need to take on Republican leaders in Congress. At times, Bannon seemed to coach Trump to soften the harder edges of his message, to make it more palatable to a broader audience, while in other cases he pushed Trump to take tougher positions. He flattered Trump, praising his negotiating skills and the size of his campaign crowds. The conversations marked a coming-together of Trump, who at the time was a pariah among many top Republicans, and the alt-right, a loosely defined term describing a far-right ideology that includes opposition to immigration and ""globalism"" and had found a home in the Breitbart News empire. The alt-right movement has also been saturated with white-nationalist rhetoric, prompting criticism of Bannon's appointment this week, though Bannon has said the movement is not racist.         1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Bannon's interviews with Trump were done for Breitbart News Daily, a radio program that airs on SiriusXM satellite radio's ""Patriot"" channel, a home for conservative talk. In all, they add up to more than two hours of one-on-one conversation. By the time of that first show, Breitbart had already become a crucial booster of Trump's presidential campaign. ""Mr. Trump, thank you very much for joining us on the initial Breitbart News Daily Show,"" Bannon said on Nov. 2, 2015. When Trump came on the air, the first thing Bannon wanted to talk about was how well Trump was doing in his campaign -- and how Bannon had noticed it before other people did. ""I said, 'This guy, people are leaning forward in these audiences when he's talking,' "" Bannon said, recalling earlier conversations about Trump's run. ""And we were mocked and ridiculed."" Trump also wanted to talk about how well he was doing. ""We had 20,000 in Dallas. . . . And 35,000 in Alabama, and 20,000 in Oklahoma,"" Trump said, talking about his rallies. ""We've had a lot of fun talking about very negative subjects. Because everything is negative with the country, Steve, I mean, there's nothing good happening."" During their conversations, there were some moments on-air when Trump and Bannon disagreed. Though not many.  Last November, for instance, Trump said he was concerned that foreign students attending Ivy League schools have to return home because of U.S. immigration laws. ""We have to be careful of that, Steve. You know, we have to keep our talented people in this country,"" Trump said. He paused. Bannon said, ""Um."" ""I think you agree with that,"" Trump said. ""Do you agree with that?"" Bannon was hesitant. ""When two-thirds or three-quarters of the CEOs in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think . . . "" Bannon said, not finishing the sentence. ""A country is more than an economy. We're a civic society.""   Trump said he would build a border wall, but still wanted to let highly educated foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges to be able to stay in the country. ""I still want people to come in,"" Trump said. ""But I want them to go through the process."" Bannon said: ""You got to remember, we're Breitbart. We're the know-nothing vulgarians. So we've always got to be to the right of you on this."" ""Oh, that's okay,"" Trump said. In most of the interviews, Bannon often called his subject ""sir"" or ""Mr. Trump."" Trump called his interviewer ""Steve."" In his questions, Bannon often began with praise for Trump. Asking about foreign affairs, for instance, Bannon praised Trump's capacity for dealmaking. ""It's complicated,"" Bannon said. ""That's your calling card."" ""I love complicated,"" Trump responded. ""I thrive on complicated."" The flattery often came before a leading question.  Last December, Bannon told Trump that, ""I know you're a student of military history."" Then, he laid out a case for questioning the U.S. alliance with Turkey, a member of NATO since the 1950s. Wasn't it true, Bannon asked, that the situation was a bit like the web of treaties that connected European countries before World War I? ""People were locked into these treaties. . . . It led to the beginning of the bloodiest century in mankind's history,"" Bannon said. He said that Turkey had changed since it joined NATO, turning to Islamism under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. What if Turkey was drawn into a broader conflict in Syria, perhaps with Russia? ""This is not something, Steve, that you want to end up in World War III over,"" Trump said. In other cases, Bannon would use his questions to frame policy choices -- and then ask Trump if he agreed with the frame and the choice. In the December interview, Bannon presented the problems of climate change and the Islamic State as a binary option -- offering Trump, in effect, the choice of fighting one or the other. ""Do you agree with the pope and President Obama that [climate change] is absolutely a path to global suicide, if specific deals are not cut in Paris, versus focusing on radical Islam?"" Bannon asked, referring to the negotiations that eventually led to a global climate agreement in Paris last year. Trump said that what other people considered to be climate change was probably just weather. Radical Islam should be the focus. ""We are fools,"" Trump said, meaning the Obama administration. In the wake of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan's early May announcement that he was not ready to back Trump, Bannon invited Trump to reflect on whether Ryan (R-Wis.) was showing ""a lack of respect -- not just for you, but for your policies."" On issues ranging from trade to slowing Muslim immigration, Bannon said, ""What [Ryan] wants is for you to drop those policies. Are you prepared to do that for unity?"" When Trump later began to say it would be ""better if we do get together,"" Bannon interrupted, saying that Ryan's version of unity would represent ""a collapse of what you ran on and a collapse on what [voters] backed you on."" ""Well, you can't do that,"" responded Trump. Bannon also seemed to recognize when Trump had made a potential gaffe -- even when Trump had not -- and to try to steer him back to correct it. The first time Bannon asked Trump about U.S. foreign policy toward Turkey, Trump volunteered that he had business interests there. ""I have a little conflict of interest, because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,"" Trump said. ""It's called Trump Towers. Two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one, it's two. And I've gotten to know Turkey very well."" A little later, Bannon circled back, asking Trump to explain why his conflict of interest should not bother voters. ""They say, 'Hey look, this guy's got vested business interests all over the world. How do I know he's going to stand up to Turkey?' "" Bannon said. Trump did not directly address the question. In another conversation, from February, Trump began with an attack on Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), his GOP primary rival, saying, ""I've never seen any human being lie like he lies."" Bannon, who had also praised Cruz in the past, interrupted. ""Mr. Mr. Mr. Trump . . . You've been in New York real estate, and global real estate, and the gaming industry, and with politicians. You can't say, reasonably, that Ted Cruz is the biggest liar you've ever seen,"" Bannon said. ""He's the biggest liar,"" Trump said. ""Okay, let's get on to another subject. I don't want to make you uncomfortable."" A few minutes later, however, Bannon circled back again. ""These personal attacks. It's turning people off,"" he said. ""On this Ted Cruz situation: You've dealt with the toughest hombres in the world. You can't expect us to believe that Ted Cruz is the biggest liar you've ever met. It doesn't stand to reason."" Trump moderated. A little bit. ""He's right up there, let me tell you,"" he said.

Speaking to an audience at a Capitol Hill cultural center, Sotomayor said the nation can't afford for a president to fail, but stressed that ""every person has an obligation both to continue being heard and to continue doing the right thing."" The justice was responding to a question from radio host Bill Press about whether Trump's victory made her feel apprehensive. She declined to answer directly, but said people ""can't afford to give up on pursuing the values that we and others have fought so hard to achieve.""  ""So for me this is a challenge,"" she said. ""I will continue doing what I think is the right thing."" Sotomayor spoke as protesters in several cities -- including the nation's capital -- have marched against Trump's win. Demonstrators have condemned Trump's behavior toward women and his stand on immigration and civil liberties among other things.  ""It is true for those who tell us that we have to support that which he does which is right, and help guide him to those right decisions whichever way we can want to do that,"" she said of Trump. Sotomayor is the first of President Barack Obama's two appointees to the high court. Part of the court's liberal wing, she is known as a powerful critic of police misconduct and a strong defender of affirmative action. Asked whether the court has been handicapped having only eight justices since the death in February of Justice Antonin Scalia, she said it's ""not an ideal situation."" But Sotomayor said the justices worked hard to come to a consensus when they could and split 4-4 in only four cases. Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland for Scalia's seat, but Senate Republicans refused to consider him, saying it should be up to the next president. The gambit paid off when Trump won the presidential race. Sotomayor said in some cases, the court simply avoided the larger question and resolved disputes on narrower grounds. She said that doesn't help when lower courts are split on important issues and are looking to the high court for answers.  ""We function better as nine because we can then resolve the questions that we need to,"" she said. Trump has pledged to fill the empty seat with a judge in the mold of Scalia, keeping in place the court's conservative tilt. Despite their ideological differences, Sotomayor said she considered Scalia a friend with a great sense of humor who was fun to be around. She said they respected each other and found common ground in several areas of the law, including the rights of criminal defendants. She noted that one reason for justices to get along is practical.  ""The person you are fighting against today, you may need for a vote tomorrow,"" she said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Frank-Walter Steinmeier would take over the largely ceremonial role as head of state from Joachim Gauck, whose five-year term ends in February. Chancellor Angela Merkel said her center-right Union bloc would back Steinmeier's nomination for the post, calling it an important signal ""particularly in times of worldwide turmoil and instability."" Together with the votes of Steinmeier's own center-left Social Democratic Party, the 60-year-old political veteran would likely have enough support to win a vote among the 1,260 delegates who elect Germany's next president on Feb. 12. Social Democratic Party leader Sigmar Gabriel told reporters Monday that Steinmeier had earned widespread respect and the necessary trust required to fill the post. Steinmeier is regularly ranked among Germany's most popular politicians. While normally studiously diplomatic, Steinmeier strongly criticized U.S. President-elect Donald Trump during the American election campaign. Asked in August about the rise of right-wing populism in Germany and elsewhere, Steinmeier slammed those who ""make politics with fear."" He cited the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, promoters of Britain's exit from the European Union, and ""the hate preachers, like Donald Trump at the moment in the United States."" Following Trump's election, Steinmeier said the Republican's victory meant ""nothing is going to get easier. A lot will get harder."" He said Germany would seek dialogue with the Trump administration, but warned that American foreign policy would likely become ""less predictable."" Steinmeier first gained national attention in 1998 when he became chief of staff to Merkel's predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder. He was credited with keeping a sometimes chaotic center-left government running smoothly and seeing through a package of economic reforms and welfare-state cuts in 2003. The reforms, launched at a time of high unemployment and economic stagnation, were credited with helping fuel growth and make the economy more resilient, but critics said they fueled social divisions. He won widespread respect in 2010 when he took a few weeks away from politics to donate a kidney to his wife, Elke Buedenbender, a judge at a Berlin administrative court. Steinmeier's promotion would leave a void in the foreign ministry, where he led efforts to resolve conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, declined to comment Monday on a possible replacement for Germany's top diplomat. ____ Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The ECB has so far avoided giving a clear signal on the future of its 1.74 trillion euro ($1.9 trillion) bond-buying program, which pumps 80 billion euros in newly created money into the economy every month in an attempt to spur growth and inflation. With the program's earliest end date set for March, and the bank's next meeting on Dec. 8, the time is approaching for the ECB to indicate whether it will keep the money spigot open or slowly start closing it by reducing, or tapering, the purchases. On one reading, Trump's election win introduces uncertainty about what he will do when he becomes U.S. president on Jan. 20 -- and that could argue for more stimulus. Some analysts think the ECB will decide on at least a six-month extension. Yet the market reaction to Trump's victory has been mostly upbeat so far. Some of Trump's ideas, such as spending $1 trillion on tunnels, bridges, roads and ports, and removing some financial regulations, could boost growth. Such prospects -- uncertain as they are -- have already lifted stock prices for companies that would benefit, such as construction equipment maker Caterpillar. And if the idea of infrastructure spending catches on in Europe, it could help the economy there too, particularly in the 19-country eurozone. Since the global financial crisis, the monetary union has focused largely on cutting spending. That helps reduce debt, but also puts a brake on economic growth. Members of the euro face rules restricting debt and deficits, but the will to enforce the rules seems to have weakened even before the U.S. election, with the European Commission giving Portugal, for example, more time to bring its deficit into compliance. The ECB's stimulus has wide-ranging implications for investors, savers and companies. Ultra-low interest rates -- one product of the stimulus -- have reduced returns on savings, pushed investors into riskier markets like stocks and real estate, and increased pressure on pension programs. Low rates have also weakened the earnings of banks, making some more hesitant to issue loans, which are vital to economic growth. The ECB's decision was already complicated by having to weigh the benefits of more stimulus against those side effects. Benoit Coeure, a member of the ECB's six-member executive board, was quoted Friday in interviews with French newspapers as saying it's ""too early to say"" if Trump's victory will affect the Dec. 8 decision. Economists Joerg Kraemer and Marco Wagner at Commerzbank are among those who think the ECB will be under pressure to extend the stimulus. Their reasoning: more and more voters in Europe, too, are turning against the political establishment. ""In this environment, it will become increasingly difficult (for governments) to push through unpopular reforms which are inevitable in order that the economic and monetary union economy recovers and for the continued existence of the monetary union."" That means the ECB will be left with the burden of helping the economy through its stimulus programs and low rates, the two wrote in a research note. Others, like Ben May, an economist at Oxford Economics, argue that a steady improvement in the eurozone economy could lead the ECB to announce a tapering of its stimulus program, or to put off its decision for a month. The number of unemployed is steadily falling. Inflation has crept up to 0.5 percent in October, far from the ECB's goal of just under 2 percent, but better than the negative readings as recently as May. The calendar of political events, however, suggests the euro currency union could be in for more shocks. -- A referendum on constitutional changes in Italy on Dec. 4 -- four days before the ECB decision -- could, if rejected, topple the government. New elections could boost the Five Star Movement, which has called for a referendum on euro membership. -- A repeat runoff election for president of Austria on the same day could bring right-wing populist Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party into office. -- British Prime Minister Theresa May wants to start by the end of March the official talks to bring the country out of the European Union. Britain is not in the euro, but is a major trade partner, and the talks on its exit could shake business confidence. -- Elections March 17 in the Netherlands could see the Party for Freedom of Geert Wilders as the largest party, polls suggest. Wilders tweeted congratulations to Trump on his ""historic"" victory. -- In France, two rounds of voting for president in April and May could see National Front leader Marine Le Pen make the second round. The National Front wants to leave the European Union and restrict immigration. All that uncertainty could depress business activity as people await the outcome of the votes, says IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer. His view is that the ECB will next month extend its bond-buying stimulus program by six months at the current rate of 80 billion euros a month.

" Nowhere did Donald Trump's candidacy inspire more trepidation or alarm than in the national security community, inhabited by many Republicans who vehemently denounced their party's nominee as dangerously unfit to be commander in chief. Now, as President-elect Trump begins assembling his government, scores of former senior national security officials, foreign policy specialists and career civil servants are wrestling with a dilemma: refuse government service or join the administration of the 45th president? Whether these seasoned experts step forward to help -- and whether Trump accepts them into his administration -- will send a powerful signal about the new president's intentions and ability to broaden his sphere of influencers beyond the loyalists who helped steer him to an improbable triumph in the election. ""I think it's time for the intelligence guys to be professional and to suck it up,"" said Charles Allen, who served nearly five decades in the CIA and is the unofficial dean of former intelligence community officials. ""We work for the president and the Congress, and that's all we do. We're capable, and we have to do our job."" While most pronounced in the national security realm, this dynamic is evident throughout Trump's transition, which is tasked with filling about 4,100 federal jobs. Washington's officialdom is waiting with nervous anticipation for Trump's first appointments, especially those in the West Wing who would serve as the president's gatekeepers.     During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   Does the president-elect install as White House chief of staff a broadly acceptable insider such as Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who was recommended by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.)? Or does he choose an antagonistic ideologue -- perhaps Stephen K. Bannon, the Trump campaign chief executive who assailed the congressional leadership as chairman of Breitbart News? Does he tap a sober-minded consensus choice such as Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.) as secretary of state or a combustible Trump confidant such as former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani or former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who are both said to be eyeing the diplomatic post? Does Trump appoint industry lobbyists and forsake his pledge to ""drain the swamp"" of special interests?  [Donors and lobbyists already shaping Trump's 'drain the swamp' administration]  ""Personnel is policy,"" said Scott Reed, a Washington establishment fixture and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's top political strategist. ""We're going to be watching those first couple of appointments. It will set the tone on what kind of relationship the president-elect will have with the town."" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Saturday that a chief of staff announcement was ""imminent,"" telling reporters that Priebus was interested in the job and is one of several candidates Trump is considering.  So far, Trump has sent mixed signals. He selected Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is regarded as an advocate of inclusion and a bridge to the Washington establishment and conservative think tanks, to lead the transition. He has populated his transition teams with experienced hands for areas including national security, intelligence and military. ""You don't want to get in an echo chamber, where you only have 'yes' people and you don't have any contrary thinking,"" said former Republican congressman Benjamin Quayle.     The Post's Marc Fisher explains how some of President-elect Donald Trump's traits could inform his leadership style when he takes office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Trump's advisers said the president-elect is mindful of the importance of cultivating strong relationships with the Republican-led Senate and House to pass his ambitious agenda, including a tax overhaul and a sweeping infrastructure program. To that end, he tapped Rick Dearborn, a former chief of staff to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) who is well known to lawmakers, as transition director. And Eric Ueland, a veteran Senate staffer who runs the Senate Budget Committee, has been mentioned as a likely pick to head Trump's Office of Management and Budget. There is talk among people familiar with the effort that Trump is open to tapping a Democrat to fill at least one Cabinet position -- perhaps as secretary of transportation, a nonideological post for which President Obama chose Republican Ray LaHood and George W. Bush chose Democrat Norman Y. Mineta. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, seem to be swooning at the unexpected opportunity to govern, though they could easily become alienated. ""I've been on the phone with giddy Republicans for about 48 hours now,"" Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said. ""Everybody assumed we'd come back and be the firewall [against a President Hillary Clinton], and now we see the opportunity to be the point of the spear."" [Trump maps out a new administration to bring a seismic shift to Washington]  'It's their duty' Some of the Republican national security figures who signed a public letter condemning Trump during the campaign said they would never serve in his administration, and they could be blacklisted anyway. But even they have been counseling others that serving might be the right thing to do for the country. As the seriousness of governing subsumes the vitriol of the campaign, a dozen national security experts interviewed said they believed experienced people will resume their roles as apolitical professionals and be willing to join the administration. ""I know many of those people, and some would be sufficiently patriotic to think it's their duty,"" said Jeffrey H. Smith, former CIA general counsel and head of Arnold & Porter's national security law practice. ""It's just too important."" Eliot Cohen, who served as counselor to former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, was a driving force behind an open letter last spring, eventually signed by 122 Republican national security leaders who opposed Trump's candidacy and pledged not to serve in a Trump administration. In an essay titled ""To An Anxious Friend,"" published Thursday in the American Interest, Cohen advised career military, diplomatic and intelligence officials to ""continue to do their jobs."" ""The government has to be staffed,"" wrote Cohen, who is director of the strategic studies program at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. Those accepting, he wrote, should understand the limits of their influence and the extent to which the administration is ""likely to be torn by infighting and bureaucratic skulduggery."" They should say yes, he said, ""with two conditions . . . that they keep a signed but undated letter of resignation in their desk . . . and that they not recant a word of what they have said thus far."" Susan Hennessey, a fellow at Brookings and former attorney at the National Security Agency, said many of her friends who are career national security officers are trying to decide whether to remain in their jobs. ""If you are a person who believes that Donald Trump threatens the very institution and poses a real threat to American security abroad because he is inexperienced and undisciplined, is it your duty to not participate or is it your duty to serve in hopes of providing him wise counsel?"" she asked.  [How Donald Trump won: The insiders tell their story]  The leadership of Trump's national security transition team includes former Republican officials and retired military officers well within the boundaries of the conservative mainstream. The team is headed by former Army lieutenant general Ronald L. Burgess Jr., a previous Defense Intelligence Agency director, and Mike Rogers, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman. Other players include retired one-star general Michael Meese, a protege of David H. Petraeus in Iraq and Afghanistan; Mira Ricardel, a veteran of the Pentagon; retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg, an early Trump supporter; and James Carafano, another retired military officer. Others, particularly among those who have been active on Trump's campaign, have engendered more skepticism. Since the election, some have already made policy statements causing concern -- and creating uncertainty as to whether they are speaking for the incoming administration. Michael T. Flynn, the retired three-star general who often served as a Trump surrogate and a member of the 16-member top advisory group, on Election Day criticized Obama's policy on Turkey, a key but troubling ally in the fight against the Islamic State. The United States, Flynn said in an opinion column published in the Hill, should show Turkey who its ""real friends"" are by extraditing the U.S. resident and Muslim cleric responsible, according to Ankara, for last summer's coup attempt there. Because Turkey is such a crucial ally, Flynn wrote, the U.S. government should also stem its official criticism of the country's crackdown on perceived political opponents. The Obama administration has said there will be no political interference in the Justice Department's consideration of Turkey's request to extradite Fethullah Gulen. On Thursday, Jason Greenblatt, named by Trump as one of his top advisers on Israel, said in Israeli radio interviews that the president-elect does not view Israeli settlements on Palestinian land as ""an obstacle to peace."" Trump says the United States should not impose its own views on the issue, Greenblatt said, and should leave the two sides to work it out themselves. U.S. policy under Obama has been sharply critical of the expanding settlements, which have been internationally condemned as illegal.  [Trump and aides hedge on major pledges, including Obamacare and the wall]  Trump is widely expected to reward his loyalists with plum posts. People familiar with preliminary talks said Giuliani is said to favor secretary of state but also is under consideration for attorney general and secretary of homeland security. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also is in the mix for attorney general and secretary of state, as well as commerce secretary. And Gingrich could end up in any of a wide range of roles across foreign or domestic policy. 'Managers and ideologues' One factor contributing to the uncertainty is that the transition's center of gravity is not in Washington, where the government provides office space, but at Trump Tower, the president-elect's midtown Manhattan skyscraper. His three oldest children -- and especially his son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- are exerting great influence over the early deliberations, as are many of his campaign loyalists, including Bannon and major donor Rebekah Mercer. Darrell M. West, who heads governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said what he sees so far from the Trump transition is ""schizophrenia. . . . When you look at the names being floated, it's a mix of managers and ideologues."" In his transition's first week, Trump has not announced any appointments. In 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named his White House chief of staff -- then-Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.) -- two days after the election. Trump's transition team, which had been led by Christie, has been at work since the summer. But many members did not expect Trump to win and are only now delving into the serious work of assembling the administration and mapping out a detailed agenda to launch after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. ""It's like the dog chasing the bus and we've finally caught it, so now we have to figure out what to do,"" said one Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because transition talks are confidential. For Trump, history offers different guides. President Ronald Reagan reached outside his inner circle of ideological Californians and brought in pragmatist James A. Baker III, who had run two primary campaigns against him, as his White House chief of staff. President Bill Clinton staged a splashy transition, promising a Cabinet that would ""look like America."" But in the end, he stacked his White House with longtime friends -- Thomas F. ""Mack"" McLarty III, a kindergarten classmate, became chief of staff -- and went on to have a chaotic first year. The first glimmer of how President George W. Bush's administration would run came when he empowered his No. 2, Richard B. Cheney, to assemble the government. With the outcome of the 2000 election still in doubt pending a Florida recount and a Supreme Court ruling, Cheney did so from the kitchen table at his townhouse in McLean, Va., and populated the administration with his own allies. Meanwhile, Obama, anxious to avoid Clinton's mistakes, worked from the inside out. He put much of his early focus on filling jobs in the White House, led by the wily Emanuel, which foreshadowed a tightly centralized presidency.  Karen Tumulty contributed to this report. "

"  PARIS -- Brexit, Donald Trump and, just maybe, Marine Le Pen. The tidal wave of populist outrage coursing through the West has found an unsurprising cheerleader in France's Le Pen, the increasingly popular leader of the country's far-right National Front. In the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election, Le Pen thinks she could write the next chapter in a global revolt against the status quo. France's presidential elections are less than six months away. Once confined to the political fringe -- a poster girl for Europe's radical right -- Le Pen is clearly preparing for a boost from Trump's tail wind. She may get it. In regional elections in December, a month after the terrorist attacks across Paris, she won nearly 30 percent of voters in the first round. And that was before Brexit, the July attack in Nice, the drama over the Calais migrant camp and, now, the U.S. election -- all of which have played to her advantage. As in Britain and the United States, a fierce anti-immigrant rhetoric has swept through France, still reeling from terrorist violence. It is largely directed at the historic wave of migration that has brought more than 1 million people from the Middle East and Africa to Europe in the past two years. Thousands of them ended up in camps on the northern coast of France, and when two newcomers took part in the Islamic State-orchestrated attacks on Paris last November, the migrants came to represent a national-security threat -- and an entire religion -- portrayed as a threat to the French way of life.

Edgard Garrido/Reuters  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        Since the Paris attacks, a palpable Islamophobia has emerged in France. Over the summer, there was the uproar over the ""burkini"" swimsuit, and now, after the closure of the Calais migrant camp, there is widespread anxiety over the other camps that have emerged across the country -- including three within Paris. Prominent French intellectuals have normalized the idea of a Muslim ""invasion,"" and even Francois Hollande, the Socialist president, has said that France has ""a problem with Islam."" As it was in the Brexit campaign and the U.S. election, the theme of a national identity under siege is the centerpiece of France's search for its next president.    And no one screams louder about national identity than Le Pen, who has promised to make France ""great again"" in the same nostalgic appeal that Trump successfully pitched to U.S. voters. ""We, too, are keen on winning back our freedom,"" she said in September. ""We want a France that is the master of its own laws and currency and the guardian of its borders."" Le Pen was probably the first foreign politician to herald Trump's victory, tweeting her congratulations before a winner had been officially announced. Then, hours later, she took to the stage at her party's headquarters outside Paris, presenting herself as the torch bearer of a long-brewing international mission to disrupt the established order. She warned political leaders -- inside and outside France -- to watch their backs. ""The political and media elites that were heavily chastised this morning can no longer ignore it,"" she proclaimed Wednesday, smiling for the cameras. ""The French referendum in 2005, the Greek one in 2015, the recent electoral successes of patriots in different European countries, the massive vote by the British in favor of Brexit and now Donald Trump -- all are democratic choices that bury the old order and steppingstones to building tomorrow's world,"" she said.  [Europe's anti-immigrant leaders are taking Trump's show on the road]  But could she win? Most analysts still say there is little chance that the National Front could emerge on top in France's 2017 elections -- despite the staggering unpopularity of Hollande. For one, Le Pen and her populist platform will not be the only option for voters on the right, who could also support Alain Juppe, the grandfatherly mayor of Bordeaux, or Nicolas Sarkozy, the ""bling bling"" former French president with the supermodel wife and a penchant for Islamophobia that has come to rival Le Pen's. For another, despite Le Pen's best efforts to improve its image, the National Front -- which shares much of the nationalism, protectionism and pro-Russian sensibilities of the Trump campaign -- has an unfortunate history of anti-Semitism that many voters have a hard time overlooking, even after their leader's recent attempts to ""de-demonize"" the party. ""I believe that she's played this well,"" said Francis Kalifat, president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France, the country's largest Jewish advocacy organization. ""But in reality, nothing has changed. It remains a xenophobic party and a party that we share no values with."" In a country highly sensitive to the memory of its collaboration in the Holocaust, even the allegation of anti-Semitism can torpedo a political future, said Nonna Mayer, a political scientist at the Sciences Po school in Paris. ""It remains a major taboo in our history."" For many, the National Front is a synonym for that taboo. Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 88-year-old founder of the party from whom Marine is estranged, once referred to the Nazi concentration camps as a ""detail of history,"" a remark that led a French court to declare him guilty of ""questioning a crime against humanity"" and to fine him nearly $35,000. So high is the instinctive French distaste for the National Front that, on the one occasion when the party made it to the final round of the presidential elections, in 2002, both the right and the left rallied around Jacques Chirac, a centrist conservative, who then trounced Jean-Marie Le Pen in a landslide victory. The view in Paris is that much the same would happen if Marine Le Pen ran against Alain Juppe, favored to win France's conservative primary this month.  [Trump's victory places U.S. at the front of a global right-wing surge]  But depending on the results of the primary, Le Pen could be facing off against Sarkozy instead, which experts say would present a scenario where a National Front victory might be possible, largely because Sarkozy's hard line on migrants and Muslims has alienated the moderate voters he would need to fight off Le Pen. ""He has used a very similar rhetoric to Le Pen herself,"" said Cecile Alduy, the author of a 2015 study of Le Pen's reliance on language, referring to the former president's recent turn toward Islamophobia to steal voters away from the National Front. That, added Gerard Grunberg, a political scientist at Sciences Po, probably would hurt rather than help Sarkozy at the ballot box. ""Many voters on the left and right won't support him against Le Pen,"" Grunberg said. Before the presidential elections next year, France will remain in a state of anxiety over the possibility of future terrorist attacks and the migrant crisis, which has caused its political establishment to be ridiculed for responses too little and too late. Until the next president is chosen, one voice in particular is likely to be louder than its challengers, decrying the sitting government, political elites and the European Union itself to an audience of angry and world-weary voters. ""For the moment, there is very little chance that Marine Le Pen would win,"" Mayer said. ""But we should never say never, as Brexit and Trump show.""

Will they ever be again?	"    On Halloween, supporters of Donald Trump dressed up as zombies mugged for the camera following his rally in Macomb County, Michigan. (Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty)   With Breanne Deppisch: THE BIG IDEA: The Reagan Democrats are now the Trump Republicans.  -- Far and away, the most dominant theme in the post-election conversation about Hillary Clinton's defeat has been her underperformance with white working-class voters in the Rust Belt. Nationally, exit polls showed Donald Trump won 58 percent of the white vote -- one percentage point better than both Ronald Reagan in 1984 and Mitt Romney in 2012. -- Macomb County, Michigan, is where Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg went in the mid-1980s for his seminal study on blue-collar ""Reagan Democrats."" Greenberg became a key adviser to Bill Clinton. As a Southerner with national ambitions in the Reagan years, the then-Arkansas governor understandably obsessed with appealing to these voters, who had overwhelmingly supported John F. Kennedy and the New Deal before becoming foot soldiers in Reagan's Revolution. Clinton successfully brought them back into the Democratic fold in 1992. Barack Obama carried Macomb, a working-class area outside Detroit, in both 2008 and 2012. Not only did Trump win 54 percent of the vote there, but he did so on record high turnout. Without his strength there, he would not be ahead in Michigan by 13,000 votes. The area has become Ground Zero of the mainstream media's exploration into how it got so caught off guard by Trump's upset win. Many news organizations -- from community weeklies to  the Detroit metropolitan papers, the Wall Street Journal and the Huffington Post -- deployed reporters to query voters about how they could go from backing Obama to getting behind Trump.    Hillary Clinton speaks exactly one week ago in Detroit, Michigan. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)   -- Clinton's struggles with working-class whites played out in many places beyond Macomb. The media focused way too much on the inner-ring suburbs during the run-up to the election and not enough on the exurbs and rural areas. Charlie Mahtesian, who used to edit the Almanac of American Politics, flags three other very telling examples in Politico: In Pennsylvania: Obama took a 492,000-vote margin of victory out of urban Philadelphia in 2012. Clinton got only a 455,000-vote margin. (She lost the state by 68,000 votes.) Clinton ran close to even with Obama's pace in the Philly suburbs. She even managed to win back well-educated and affluent Chester, the only of the four collar counties that voted for Romney in 2012. ""The difference makers were places like Wilkes-Barre's Luzerne County in northeastern Pennsylvania,"" Mahtesian writes. ""Obama carried the county twice, winning 52-47 in 2012. Trump crushed Clinton there, 58-39.... In the largest county in western Pennsylvania after Pittsburgh's Allegheny County, Trump needed a big number and he got it. Where Romney won 61 percent in Westmoreland, Trump won 64 percent amid higher turnout than in 2012."" In Ohio: Obama won Mahoning County 63-35 against Romney. Clinton won 50-47. ""In similarly situated nearby counties, she flat-out lost. Among them was neighboring Stark County, a bellwether in this heavily blue-collar region that went Democratic in the last three presidential elections. There, she ran 11 points behind Obama's 2012 performance."" In Wisconsin: Trump underperformed typical Republican candidates in the suburban counties outside Milwaukee, but he more than made up for it in more rural areas like Green Bay. And turnout in the state's two Democratic strongholds, Milwaukee County and Madison's Dane County, was smaller than in 2012. Trump won 63 percent in rural Wisconsin, 10 points better than Romney.    Larry Ancona points out the rows of homes where there used to be an American Motors plant in Kenosha, Wis. (David Weigel/The Washington Post)   -- Our Dave Weigel spent the past two days in Kenosha, Wis., chatting with Obama voters who turned to Trump. He has several excellent vignettes: Bob Oldani, 71, cast his first Republican vote for president. ""We need a change in everything, and I hope he can do it,"" the retired machinist said. ""This guy's a billionaire, so I'm thinking he can say, 'Hey, let's just get the job done. I don't need your money.'"" What about the ""Access Hollywood"" tape? ""As far as these rumors with the girls, and all of that,"" he said, ""if you do your job, who cares?""    Bernie Sanders speaks on March 5 at Macomb Community College in Warren, Mich. (Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images)   BROOKLYN IGNORED MANY RED FLAGS:  -- Clinton's loss in Michigan's Democratic primary this March, despite every poll showing her ahead, should have been a bigger wake-up call than it was for her campaign.  -- Many Democrats are now complaining that they tried to sound the alarm, but their warnings went unheeded. Lots of Clinton allies are faulting the campaign for failing to develop a credible message for downscale white voters. They argue that she should have talked more about the economy all along, as Bill did in 1992.    Bill Clinton visits Grace Emmanuel Baptist Church this past Sunday in Flint, Mich. (Tegan Johnston/The Flint Journal-MLive.com via AP)   -- Bill Clinton repeatedly pressed his wife's strategists to do more, but his ideas were dismissed as outdated. From Politico's Annie Karni: ""Some began pointing fingers at the young campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spearheaded a strategy supported by the senior campaign team that included only limited outreach to those voters -- a theory of the case that Bill Clinton had railed against for months, wondering aloud at meetings why the campaign was not making more of an attempt to even ask that population for its votes. ... Bill's [position] was often dismissed with a hand wave by senior members of the team as a personal vendetta to win back the voters who elected him, from a talented but aging politician who simply refused to accept the new Democratic map. At a meeting ahead of the convention at which aides presented to both Clintons the 'Stronger Together' framework for the general election, senior strategist Joel Benenson told the former president bluntly that the voters from West Virginia were never coming back to his party."" -- The Clintons themselves are not blameless. The farther removed they got from Arkansas, the more they lost touch as they entered the highest stratosphere of the New York elite. Bill stopped eating at McDonalds and became a vegan, a telling metaphor that David  Maraniss highlighted in his brilliant piece yesterday.    John and Debbie Dingell in Southgate, Mich. (AP Photo/Detroit News, Max Ortiz)   -- Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell writes in an op-ed for today's Post that she repeatedly suggested Clinton was in trouble with working-class voters in her state, but she was brushed aside. ""The 'Downrivers' -- a collection of communities south of Detroit -- mean auto plants and manufacturing with strong union membership. From the beginning, I knew the Downrivers would support Trump both in the Republican primary and in the general,"" Dingell writes. ""[President Obama] did save my state's industry. But what many keep missing is that working men and women don't see this in their lives. They feel the system is rigged against them. And those workers are white, black, Hispanic, Muslim -- all races, creeds and colors. Economic and national security fears overcame all other factors when they walked into the voting booth.""    Joe Biden took Hillary to his childhood home in Scranton, Pa., after a joint rally on Aug. 15. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- Joe Biden was also speaking publicly about the party's problem. For example, in a discussion on Air Force Two with our Paul Kane last month, returning from a swing to Missouri, the vice president blamed the Democratic drift on what he described as the party's fixation on ""pedigree."" HRC got crushed hardest in the very places where Biden was most often deployed as a surrogate, from Youngstown, Ohio, to Scranton, Pa. ""What are Republicans gonna do for you, white working-class folks? Well, guess what, they ain't gonna help your kid get to school, they're gonna cut it,"" he'd say. ""They're not gonna help you pay the mortgage. They're not gonna help.""    The president and the president-elect in the Oval Office. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   -- There is a lot of soul searching going on inside the West Wing, and a real sense has emerged among senior staff that President Obama's 56 percent job approval rating obscured his failure to connect with working-class whites after he got reelected in 2012. ""He was insulated by a White House bubble and a staff with fewer ties to those parts of the country that were most alienated,"" Greg Jaffe and Juliet Eilperin write in a deep dive. ""His executive actions, essential to advancing his agenda in an era of gridlock, inflamed an increasingly partisan electorate. ... Throughout his second term, Obama spoke only fleetingly of the economic pain in the country caused by globalization, demographic changes and technological advances. His second-term agenda was dominated by immigration initiatives and a sweeping trade deal with Asia."" A missed opportunity: ""Senior White House officials in January described ambitious plans to have the president speak more directly to Americans who disagreed with him. But those efforts were often sidetracked by higher priorities, such as the police shootings and protests this summer. ... By early fall, Obama had shifted his focus to mobilizing young and minority voters. ... His mocking of the billionaire as better suited to 'The Bachelorette' or 'Survivor' than the Oval Office sometimes made it seem as if he were also mocking Trump's supporters."" -- The White House focused too much on mobilizing Obama's core base of supporters than persuading disillusioned white folks. A micro-targeted media strategy took precedence over speaking to the entire country. ""In some instances, Obama's strategy for dealing with the polarization in the country may have made the problem worse,"" Greg and Juliet note. ""To drum up support for its policies, the Obama administration often sought out new media venues to mobilize small, loyal audiences. After his State of the Union address, for example, Obama sat for interviews with enthusiastic and often fawning YouTube stars to talk about his agenda for 2016, the tax on tampons and why he preferred rapper Kendrick Lamar to Drake."" As a senior administration official put it, ""It would be a mistake if the Democratic Party didn't use this as a sobering moment of reflection on whether or not we are connecting, or if we're trying to connect in an outdated manner.""    Supporters cheer Trump at Macomb Community College on Oct. 31. (Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images)   THE AUTOPSIES ARE POURING IN: -- Hundreds of think pieces and op-eds about Democrats turning their backs on folks who used to be central of their coalition have been written since Wednesday morning. Many more are on the way. Here are a few good examples:  The Atlantic's Ron Brownstein: ""How the Rustbelt Paved Trump's Road to Victory"" William Frey of the Brookings Institution: ""The demographic blowback that elected Trump"" ProPublica's Alec MacGillis: ""Clinton and the Democrats were playing with fire when they effectively wrote off white workers in the small towns and cities of the Rust Belt."" The American Prospect's Steven Greenhouse: ""While the Donald had a powerful message for white workers, Clinton failed to convey a robust pro-worker stance."" Former MSNBC host Krystal Ball, a Kentucky native and failed Democratic House candidate: ""There was an incredibly revealing moment at the DNC. In an effort to rev up the crowd one of the speakers called out: 'Who in this room works with their hands?' Silence. It was a lot more than one candidate who led us to this place."" Henry Payne, an auto columnist for the Detroit News, penned an op-ed for National Review about the potency of Trump's protectionist message. He noted that the leader of the Democratic opposition to NAFTA in 1993 was House minority whip David Bonior, who represented Macomb County. And he argues that Trump's broadsides against trade deals, while misguided, really resonated.  Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis, a former chief of staff to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, reflected on focus groups he conducted of undecided voters: ""Many believed that their jobs and their communities were sacrificed in the name of corporate greed, globalization and trade - all to benefit a class of corporate and political elites who, in their opinion, could care less about their lives. ... While these voters despised Trump's offensive statements - a fact that the exit polls confirm - his economic message spoke to them in an incredibly powerful way. Clinton's simply did not."" -- Many people are also turning to book-length explorations of white disillusionment for deeper answers. These are five of the tomes generating the most buzz:  ""The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America,"" by George Packer (The New Yorker staff writer had a relevant piece in the Oct. 31 issue about "" Clinton and the Populist Revolt."") ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" by J.D. Vance ( which I wrote about last month) ""Coming Apart: The State of White America from 1960 to 2010,"" by Charles Murray ""The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker,""  by Katherine Cramer ""Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right,"" by Arlie Russell Hochschild     Donald and Melania listen as Paul Ryan speaks to the press in the Capitol. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)   WILL DEMOCRATS OVERREACT?  -- Many inside the party fear that there will be an overcorrection as 2020 approaches. -- Not only did Clinton win the popular vote, but if marginally more African Americans had shown up in Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, the narrative now would be all about the emerging Democratic majority. Consider this: Black voters accounted for 19 percent of the electorate in North Carolina on Tuesday, compared to 23 percent in 2012. Clinton lost the Tar Heel state by four points. -- The Latino vote might have been overhyped in the days before the election, but they still voted in record numbers. And four in five supported Clinton, according to two academics, who also estimate that between 13.1 million and 14.7 million Latinos cast ballots. That's a significant increase from the 11.2 million Latino votes cast in 2012. -- The electorate of tomorrow couldn't win the election of today for Democrats, but that does not mean it will not win the election of tomorrow. Ruy Teixeira co-authored a famous political science text in 2002 called ""The Emerging Democratic Majority"" about how demographic changes benefit Democrats. In an interview last night, the senior fellow at the Center for American Progress pointed out that, because of demographic changes alone, if Democrats in 2020 garner the exact same share of every racial group that they got in 2016 they will win Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida - and come close in Arizona. That's how relatively close the election was and how fast the complexion of the country is changing. ""The minority vote and the white college-educated vote would have been perfectly adequate to win this election ... but the working class white vote did not stay the same,"" he said. ""If we assume that Trump has promised the sky to the white working class and if we speculate that he might not actually be able to deliver, there may be some opening to reach these voters if you take them seriously."" -- In ""Brown is the new white,"" a book that has been widely read by progressive elites in Washington for most of the year, Steve Phillips argues that Democrats lost in the 2010 and 2014 midterms because they chased white swing voters at the expense of minorities. The African American consultant argues at length that turnout dropped off because minorities did not think politicians were speaking to the issues they cared about. ""When you ignore them in a futile fascination with white swing voters, they will ignore you,"" he writes. ""The worst possible thing Democrats could conclude is that the country's voters have moved to right."" Phillips quotes Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy saying after his narrow 2014 win: ""The only middle-aged white men who voted for me were myself and my brothers. We have to speak to minorities. And we're probably never going to have a majority made up of middle-aged white men.""    Donna Brazile confers with Harry Reid prior to the third presidential debate in Las Vegas last month. (Paul J.

""There are times, there are times when I think, the Republicans -- when they're wrong -- they fight harder. For Democrats, we're like the reverse. ...

(Pawel Kaminski/Disney/ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution via AP)   -- Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly suggests in her forthcoming memoir that Trump may have been ""tipped off"" in advance about a question she planned to ask him during the first Republican debate. From our Paul Farhi: ""Kelly apparently drew Trump's wrath a week before the first primary debate. ... A segment on her show, 'The Kelly File,' had upset Trump enough that he refused to do a scheduled interview with her unless she phoned him personally. She writes that he told her, 'I almost unleashed my beautiful Twitter account against you, and I still may.'"" The day before the debate, Trump reportedly called Fox executives to complain about her, saying he'd heard her first debate question 'was a very pointed question directed at him.'"" The anecdote raises questions about who within Fox News was aware of Kelly's debate planning and could have tipped Trump. In another anecdote, Kelly indirectly suggests she may have been poisoned on her way to the debate, recounting the story of a ""overzealous, suspiciously enthusiastic"" driver who repeatedly insisted she get coffee. Within 15 minutes of drinking it, she was violently ill, vomiting so uncontrollably that she almost had to sit out. The episode reportedly spooked her enough that she shared it with then-Fox CEO Roger Ailes and ""a lawyer friend."" -- Late last night, as these stories popped, the Fox host tried to walk them back:  For the record, my book ""Settle for More"" does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did.-- Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 11, 2016    Also for the record, I believe the reason I got sick the day of the first debate was I contracted a stomach virus, just as Rand Paul did.-- Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 11, 2016   -- In her book, Kelly also offers a window into just how far Trump is willing to go in order to win favorable coverage from reporters.

The Post's Marc Fisher spoke to people who have worked most closely with Trump over the years to determine how the businessman's character traits might inform his leadership style in the White House: ON WHOM HE HIRES: ""Trump ... likes to hire people who have opposed or blocked him. Such hires weren't just put on ice; several became important figures in Trump projects. Trump sometimes brings aboard people who he thinks just look the part. In 1981, he saw a security guard at the U.S. Open tennis championships who did a nice job of ejecting some hecklers. Trump asked [an employee] to hire the man. 'But you've never even met him!' she protested. Trump said he liked how the man handled the situation."" ON HIS LEARNING STYLE:  ""He'll have someone read the reports for him and give them to him orally, real short,"" Res said. ""He brags that he's never read a book all the way through. He doesn't have the patience to sit in meetings. We always had a hard time keeping his attention during the prep for a deposition or something like that. The flip side is that he can scan something and get it quickly."" ON HOW HE'LL GOVERN: ""The new president will have to decide whether to maintain his fiery, divisive campaign rhetoric or work more quietly to cut deals, said [former Clinton chief of staff] Leon Panetta. Trump could 'create a real crisis' if he tries to build a wall and deport all illegal immigrants, Panetta said, or the 45th president could turn to the more conciliatory approach he described in his victory speech Wednesday morning. Trump 'is not a Republican, and he is not a Democrat,' Panetta said. 'He really does have the opportunity to create an interesting coalition if he wants to take the time to do it.'"" -- #NeverTrump Republicans in the foreign policy sphere have begun softening their opposition - largely out of necessity to help the new commander in chief govern.

Loyal Republicans who served in the two Bush administrations ... appeared on television and wrote op-eds blasting him. They aligned under a 'Never Trump' banner and signed a letter saying they were 'convinced that he would be a dangerous president and would put at risk our country's national security and well-being.' The coming weeks will determine whether both sides decide they need each other. ... 'Never Trump' has become 'Maybe Trump.' But whether he would have them is another matter.""

(Chris Cillizza) -- Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer offers advice on how the new Republican majority can succeed: ""During the campaign, Trump's populism often clashed with traditional Reaganism. Two agendas: one ideological, one socioeconomic. They both need to be addressed. Onto the Reaganite core of smaller government and strict constitutionalism must be added a serious concern for the grievances of the constituency that animated the Trump insurgency, the long-suffering, long-neglected working class. The key to success for a Trump presidency is for the Reaganite and populist elements in the party to be willing to advance each other's goals even at the cost of ideological purity. This will require far-reaching negotiations between a Trump White House and a GOP Congress. The Republicans have gained control of all the political branches. They have the means to deliver. They now have to show that they can."" -- Greg Craig, Obama's first White House counsel, summed up the feelings of many Democrats with this quote fo the Times: ""Nothing with Obama's name on it is safe. It will be: 'Let's pull out the list of Obama's sacred cows and slaughter them, one by one.'"" -- Charles Koch praised the new Republican majority in a letter to donors and staff Thursday, signaling his network plans to play a larger role in policy as the nation prepares for a GOP-controlled capital. Network officials say they will aggressively fight efforts in Washington to increase government spending, even if the push comes from Trump himself.

""A big question now is whether Trump's America could awaken the sleeping giant of German might. This nation, weighed down by the horrific violence of Adolf Hitler, has shied away from military strength since the end of World War II.

They join a chorus from Belgium to Finland, where the clamor is growing for a more independent security strategy with the dawn of Trump....

Foreigners are curious, too, and ears perk up when they hear an American accent with its distinctive 'r's.' 'As expats, we are expected to be able to explain the actions of the president,' said Lucia Lucas.... Sometimes strangers overhear her on the train, recognize her accent and launch into questions about U.S. politics.

(Lansing State Journal)   -- Students at a Minneapolis high school spray painted the walls of bathroom doors with the words ""Trump train,"" ""white only,"" and ""white America."" The word ""blacks"" was x'd out, and minority students say they are terrified to go to class. (WCCO) -- New York University said the word ""TRUMP!"" was spray painted across a Muslim prayer room in its engineering school. -- A North Carolina Ku Klux Klan chapter is holding a victory parade to celebrate Trump's election. A website for the group refers to it as a ""Victory Klavalkade Klan Parade"" and announces in all-caps that ""Trump's race united my people."" (The News & Observer) -- A neo-Nazi website called the Daily Stormer is calling on its readers to ""troll"" liberals and Trump opponents in hopes of driving them to commit suicide. A post on the site contains a list of tweets from people who said they are frightened by the outcome of the election. In a separate post titled ""Dear Liberals: This is Now the Era of Revenge,"" the publisher himself encourages people who did not vote for Trump to commit suicide. ""We beat you. We beat you badly,"" he wrote. ""And now that you are on the ground, we are going to keep kicking you in the head."" (Derek Hawkins) -- New York Daily News writer Shaun King began chronicling these sorts of incidents on his Twitter feed. In the last 24 hours, he said he has heard of at least 50 stories of women having their hijab pulled off in public. (Police in Louisiana said one such incident was ""fabricated,"" however.) -- Muslim leaders asked Trump to repudiate these incidents and call for calm. (Reuters) -- In synagogues across the country, Jewish communities gathered for prayer and healing events, less fearful of Trump himself than the anti-Semitic supporters his campaign has empowered. From The Atlantic's Emma Green: ""'As a Jewish person, I'm not as afraid of Trump because his own daughter is Orthodox,' one woman said, referring to Ivanka Trump. 'This has exposed something we've been ignoring for too long,' said another, speaking about the racist and sexist comments exchanged during the campaign. There was a discussion of the stages of grief and talk of making aliyah, or emigrating to Israel--not as a plausible possibility, but as a back-of-mind option in case things get really bad. And yes, people brought up Nazi Germany.'"" -- WaPo's Michelle Ye Hee Lee recounts some of the abuse she received as a female, Asian fact checker in this year's election: ""An email calling me the c-word was the first thing I read when I woke up one morning. One night after dinner, my phone buzzed with a Twitter mention from someone wishing I were sent to an internment camp (I'm not Japanese). Many emails began with, 'Ni hao' (I'm not Chinese). Who knew that 'happy endings' at the local DC Chinese owned massage parlor could earn you a press pass and journalistic credential? ...' 'Michelle, the sex workers in Times Square have more integrity about their prostitution than you have about yours.' I didn't travel on the campaign trail this election. I wasn't blacklisted. No one booed or yelled at me. But I was berated almost daily for doing my job, and so were many other reporters on and off the trail.... I hope such comments were a product of heightened emotions as Election Day approached -- not the new normal.""  Bloomberg Businessweek's two covers this week: pic.twitter.com/iuXc4Mbnhe-- Ryan Krasnoo (@RyanKras) November 10, 2016   HOW TRUMP WON: -- Trump's data team rightly forecast a different America than other analysts were predicting. From Bloomberg Businessweek's Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg: ""Trump's numbers were different, because ... like Trump himself, [analysts] were forecasting a fundamentally different electorate than other pollsters and almost all of the media: older, whiter, more rural, more populist. And much angrier at what they perceive to be an overclass of entitled elites."" Eventually, Trump's analysts became convinced that even their own models didn't sufficiently account for the strength of these voters. They majorly reweighted their polling in the last week, because they thought pollsters had the wrong idea of how would turn out. ""If he was going to win this election, it was going to be because of a Brexit-style mentality and a different demographic trend than other people were seeing,"" Matt Oczkowski said. That mentality is what led to Trump to embark on a last-ditch campaign stretch into states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that no one else believed he could win. (Check out The Post's breakdown of all the states Trump was underestimated in.) -- Clinton proved to be an unwitting ally: ""Clinton was the perfect foil for Trump's message,"" said Bannon. ""From her e-mail server, to her lavishly paid speeches to Wall Street bankers, to her FBI problems, she represented everything that middle-class Americans had had enough of."" -- Trump wound up winning a 53 percent majority of white women. NYT's Sheryl Gay Stolberg interviewed some of these woman who handed Trump the presidency: ""Were they offended by Mr. Trump's vile comments about women, captured on tape? Absolutely. Did they believe the women who came forward and said Mr. Trump had groped them? Not necessarily. Did any of it stop them from voting for him? No.Where those who voted against Mr. Trump saw someone who bankrupted businesses and ducked paying taxes, these women said they saw a man who built a real estate empire and simply followed the law. They saw a man who had raised and promoted a beautiful and successful daughter, Ivanka, and who let a smart and accomplished Washington strategist, Kellyanne Conway, manage his presidential campaign. In short, they embraced Mr. Trump's sales pitch for himself."" ""The fact that he said something crude,"" Naples resident Sue Gauta said, ""is not going to change my mind about the good he can do for our country."" -- Military families were a critical part of Trump's victory, according to an online Morning Consult/Politico poll: 57 percent of voters from military households cast their ballot for the real estate mogul, compared with just 40 percent who backed Clinton. -- Trump's campaign has often been compared to the Brexit referendum, but turnout was way lower here than there. Nearly 10 percent more people voted in the E.U.'s summer referendum than did this year's presidential race, and a Pew Research Center report found the U.S. turnout rates ranked 31st out of 35 of its peers. (Adam Taylor) -- European election observers who visited more than 900 U.S. voting sites on Tuesday cite a ""number"" of faults in America's election process, noting malfunctions with electronic voting machines in 13 percent of observations -- one in eight votes -- as well as excessively long lines and structural hurdles that restrict ballot access. (Max Bearak)    Hillary concedes on Wednesday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   MORE TAKES ON WHY HILLARY LOST: -- ""The causes of [Clinton's] defeat will be debated for years, but in the first cold light of the day after, one big cause seems clearer than others: Her COMPLACENCY,"" argues Politico's Todd S. Purdum: There was Clinton's political complacency: She never so much as visited such usually reliable blue states as Michigan and Wisconsin after the primaries, scoffing at [Trump's] claims that he could remake the electoral map.... There was policy complacency: Clinton never developed the kind of central animating idea or program that wins elections and can be communicated in a heartbeat. 'Stronger Together' is a slogan, but not a call to arms. Nor did she heed the signs. Last spring, the Bernie Sanders insurgency delivered a powerful piece of intelligence to Clinton world, that the status quo was not cutting it with the Democratic base.... She made some concessions to the Sanders-nistas in the Democratic platform over the summer, then largely reverted to form."" -- Clinton's highly-vaunted GOTV operation may have inadvertently turned out Trump supporters. From HuffPost's Zack Exley and Becky Bond: ""Volunteers for the Clinton campaign in Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina have reported that when reminding people to vote, they encountered a significant number of Trump voters. Anecdotal evidence points to anywhere from five to 25 percent of contacts were inadvertently targeted to Trump supporters. The campaign's text messaging GOTV effort may have been the worst offender. Volunteers reported as many as 30% of the replies they received from voters they were urging to get out were Trump supporters."" The efforts may have been a boon for Trump in battleground states, especially because the his campaign struggled to compete with Clinton's ground-game operation. -- The Clinton dynasty may not be over. The New York Post's Emily Smith claims that Chelsea Clinton is being groomed for the New York House seat held by Rep. Nita Lowey: ""Chelsea could run for the seat in NYC's 17th Congressional District once Lowey, a 79-year-old respected career politician with nearly 30 years in office, decides to retire.... Lowey's district includes parts of Rockland and Westchester counties and, conveniently, Chappaqua, the Clinton family home base."" The Clintons purchased a home next door to their primary residence this summer, intended for Chelsea, her husband and their two children.

Trump's transition team did not allow a protective press pool to travel with him from Manhattan to Washington and attempted to restrict media access to his meeting with President Obama, breaking with tradition and stoking fears about press access in a future Trump administration. Former White House correspondent Wolf Blitzer rebuked the breach in press protocol on ""The Situation Room"" Thursday night, calling the lack of access ""truly unacceptable."" And the White House Correspondents' Association said the lack of a protective pool was ""deeply concerning."" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said there will eventually be a pool: ""We fully expect to operate a traditional pool and look forward to implementing our plans in the near future,"" she said. ""We appreciate your patience as we navigate the transition process."" (Peter W.

I will not hand his granddaughter a country shaped by hateful and stupid men. Your tears last night woke me up, and I'll never go to sleep on you again."" -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar writes about what it means to be a black man  in Trump's America: ""After numerous police shootings of unarmed blacks every year, national Black Lives Matter protests, and unprecedented expressions of support from pro athletes, black Americans saw a glimmer of hope that white Americans were finally acknowledging the overwhelming evidence of institutional racism that had been glaringly obvious to blacks for many years. But that hope was misplaced. Instead, a majority of white America chose to swallow the blue pill, preferring to, as Morpheus explains in ""The Matrix,"" ""wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe."" For African Americans, America just got a little more threatening, a little more claustrophobic, a lot less hopeful. We feel like disposable extras, the nameless bodies who are never part of the main cast. ... Trump represents the last wisp of the rich white plantation owner holding on to the glories of the past."" -- ""Leslie Knope"" (a Parks and Recreation writer) addressed Trump's victory in a letter to America: ""And let me say something to the young girls who are reading this. Hi, girls. On behalf of the grown-ups of America who care about you and your futures, I am awfully sorry about how miserably we screwed this up. We elected a giant farting T. rex who does not like you, or care about you, or think about you, unless he is scanning your bodies with his creepy T. rex eyes, or trying to physically grab you like a toy his daddy got him (or would have, if his daddy had loved him). (Sorry, that was a low blow.) (Actually, not sorry, I'm pissed, and I'm on a roll, so zip it, super-ego!)"" (Read the full piece) -- ""To pin this election on the coastal elite is a cop-out. It's intellectually dishonest, and it's beneath us,"" argues Roll Call's Patrick Thornton. ""We, as a culture, have to stop infantilizing and deifying rural and white working-class Americans. Their experience is not more of a real American experience than anyone else's, but when we say that it is, we give people a pass from seeing and understanding more of their country. ... When you grow up in rural America, denying rights to people is an abstract concept. Denying marriage rights to gay people isn't that much different than denying boarding rights to Klingons. More Americans need to see more of the United States. They need to shake hands with a Muslim, or talk soccer with a middle aged lesbian, or attend a lecture by a female business executive. I'm from the Midwest, and I love the Midwest, but ... we cannot fetishize it as 'real' America. What we are seeing is a reaction to a rapidly changing world."" -- Republican lobbyist Bruce Mehlman produced a slide deck for clients to explain the election results.

If working, consider grabbing lunch outside, at least!"" -- ""Trump win shakes up 2017 race for Virginia governor,"" by Laura Vozzella: ""As most of America was still absorbing the news that [Trump] had won the presidency, Republican Corey Stewart had already declared it rocket fuel for his 2017 bid for Virginia governor. Stewart, the one-time chairman of Trump's Virginia campaign, said that despite the fact that Clinton beat Trump by nearly five percentage points in Virginia, Republican primary voters will reward him for being Trump's biggest cheerleader in the state. And he figures the Trump administration will be in accord with his stance that illegal immigrants who have committed crimes be deported. ""If you're an illegal alien in Prince William County, I'd get out,"" said Stewart. ""It's the very first thing I'm going to do with a friendly Trump administration. Now we're going to find out where each and every one of these guys is, and we're going hunt them down and we're going to deport them."" -- Anti-Trump protesters reportedly vandalized the Republican Party headquarters in Virginia on Wednesday night, throwing a pumpkin at the RPV building and damaging the windows and door. The doorbell was also broken, and graffiti was written on the walls. The Democratic Party of Virginia condemned the vandalism, but state Republican Chairman John Whitbeck pointed to their ""hateful rhetoric"" as ""the cause of this violence.""  (Rachel Weiner) -- Which Washington school will Barron Trump attend? It's been 35 years since a First Kid has attended a school other than Sidwell Friends, the private school whose student body has included Chelsea Clinton and both Obama girls,"" Emily Heil writes. But some educational experts say it's unlikely the younger Trump will be enrolled in a school associated with Washington liberal intelligentsia, citing private school options in Virginia instead.
