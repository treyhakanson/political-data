" The secretary of state is the star of most every Cabinet, and when President-elect Donald Trump makes his selection he will signal the kind of posture he intends to present to the world.  Does he want the nation's top diplomat to be a Trumpian clone? That would be Rudolph W. Giuliani, the garrulous former New York mayor who sprays rhetorical fire at Islamic terrorists but whose business background is rife with potential conflicts of interest. Or an ideological crusader? A leading candidate is John Bolton, an architect and enabler of the Iraq War that Trump has so often condemned, whose hawkishness and combative nature made him a controversial U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. What about a clean slate, someone who would see the world with fresh eyes and promote Trump's vision? That's where Nikki Haley figures in, the governor of South Carolina who lacks traditional foreign policy chops but is regarded as a quick study. How about a central-casting statesman? Enter Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee who led the Republican resistance to Trump's candidacy and became a well-worn punching bag for him, but who could be a consensus choice and offer reassurance to anxious U.S. allies.   Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani makes a face to members of the media Wednesday as he leaves Trump Tower in New York. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  There may also be other contenders for the job, which is fourth in line to the presidency ahead of any other cabinet official. One such prospect, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), has suggested in recent days that he does not have much of a footing. ""We have a president who, let's face it, approaches things with an exclamation point,"" Corker said Thursday on MSNBC. ""I think what might be good is someone to complement that and be able to pragmatically go about making things happen."" For other national security positions, Trump has tapped trusted but controversial loyalists. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has a history of racially charged statements, is his nominee for attorney general, while retired Army lieutenant general Michael T. Flynn, who has come under fire for incendiary remarks about Muslims and a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, will be Trump's national security adviser. Whether Trump follows this pattern or takes a different course in choosing his secretary of state, his aides are offering few clues, other than to say that the president-elect is keeping an open mind. ""He's meeting with some of the best and the brightest and the most qualified people, not only to fill specific roles within the administration but also to give advice and counsel on the policies and structure of how to best put together a team and enact a successful agenda,"" transition spokesman Jason Miller said Friday. Earlier this week, Giuliani and Bolton were described by people close to the transition as the leading candidates.  Giuliani, 72, was Trump's campaign-trail sidekick, delivering fiery speeches introducing him. Giuliani earned his longtime friend's admiration by ripping into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with gusto, offering biting critiques of her physical health as well as what he described as her criminal record as secretary of state.     Once a fierce critic of Donald Trump, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is said to be meeting with the president-elect to discuss a possible job as Trump's secretary of state. (Reuters)   Early on, Giuliani was seen as a shoo-in for a top administration position, and he has openly campaigned for the state department. But news reports this week about Giuliani's extensive global business dealings in his decade-and-a-half out of public office raised red flags, all but ensuring a messy confirmation battle. Giuliani has made tens of millions of dollars as a consultant and speaker to foreign governments and shadowy international groups -- an ironic juxtaposition to Clinton, whom Trump castigated for giving paid speeches and accepting foreign contributions to the Clinton Foundation. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has spoken out against Giuliani, as well as Bolton, and signaled that he might filibuster either man's nomination. Bolton, 67, supported Trump's candidacy, in his frequent appearances on Fox News, for which he is a commentator. He also ran an outside super PAC that helped GOP Senate and House candidates. In the last three Republican administrations, Bolton established himself as a hawkish voice on the far right -- especially on the Iraq War -- and espoused views out of step with Trump's. As undersecretary for arms control in George W. Bush's State Department, Bolton was a close ally of Vice President Richard B. Cheney -- so much so that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell came to regard him as Cheney's mole. When Bush nominated Bolton to be U.N. ambassador, he drew heat in the Senate, forcing the president to install him through a recess appointment. Romney, by contrast, could be seen by senators as a consensus alternative to the more polarizing Giuliani and Bolton. He plans to meet with Trump on Saturday at the president-elect's golf club in Bedminster, N.J., for what has been billed as a general discussion about the transition. People close to Trump cautioned that he may not necessarily extend a job offer to Romney -- and even if he does, it is unclear whether Romney would accept. Since his presidential campaign, Romney, 69, is said to have thought about serving as secretary of state, going so far as to consider how he might reorganize the notoriously inefficient Foggy Bottom headquarters and reimagine America's role in the world. One of the more intriguing prospects is Haley, 44, a Republican star who has left little mark in the foreign-affairs community. Asked to describe her qualifications and worldview, some experts were at a loss for words. Robert Zoellick, a former World Bank president who had been in line to serve as Romney's secretary of state, joked in an email: ""Am in the Canadian arctic viewing polar bears with my wife! Connectivity weak."" Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution and a former deputy secretary of state under President Bill Clinton, said: ""Wow. Wish I could help. I really don't know about her background in the field and hesitate to speculate."" Trump allies argued that what Haley lacks in traditional experience she makes up for in other attributes. For one, Trump considers the well-prepared elites who have run the nation's foreign affairs responsible for what he sees as decades of failure. ""There is a great value in fresh eyes,"" said South Carolina Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster, who chaired Trump's primary campaign in the state and would ascend to the governorship should Haley join the Cabinet. ""She's a very quick study, and I think she has a good grip on the points and understands well Mr. Trump's vision and his goals."" But Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia under President Obama, dismissed the notion that a secretary of state with little expertise could succeed. ""Just as you wouldn't want someone with no training or previous experience to operate on your body, fix your car, or repair your computer, you should not want completely inexperienced people to protect our country and defend our national interests,"" McFaul wrote in an email. ""Treating these jobs as ones for amateurs is amateurish and dangerous."" Haley would bring diversity to Trump's Cabinet. She would make history as the first Indian American secretary of state -- and it is not lost on Trump that his candidacy garnered a passionate following among some Indian Americans as well as in India. Haley led a 10-day state economic development trip to India in 2014, and the governor has taken similar trips to England, France, Germany and Japan. ""There's a lot of snooty talk about people being unqualified to be secretary of state, but being a governor or an elected politician is actually pretty good preparation for being a diplomat,"" said Kori Schake, a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and a former Bush national security official who opposed Trump. Schake added, ""At a time in which many people in the United States and outside it are worried about tolerance of not just the Trump administration but the American voters who elected Trump, [Haley] would send a welcoming signal.""   CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article reported that John Bolton's super PAC supported Donald Trump's presidential campaign. It did not, according to Bolton's spokesman. The group focused on Republican Senate and House candidates.   "

In ""Does the Media Matter?,"" Alan Gerber, a professor at Yale, and his team found that randomly assigning participants to receive different newspapers or no newspaper had ""no effect on political knowledge, stated opinions, or turnout in postelection survey and voter data."" Most participants, they found, had made up their mind before reading the news. This was not a unique finding. In another recent experimental study, researchers found that fact-checking of inaccurate statements had little impact on changing the minds of Donald Trump voters. Participants were given a series of falsehoods Trump had said, then shown that they were not true. But voters maintained their unwavering support for him, even if they admitted to previously believing untrue information. ""I guess it means that politicians like Trump can spread misinformation without losing support,"" concluded the study's author, Briony Swire-Thompson, a graduate student at the University of Western Australia. In many ways, Trump's victory was a large-scale natural experiment reaffirming the findings in these research studies. We may never again witness the media's united effort to condemn a major-party presidential candidate. Only six newspapers endorsed Trump, while several media outlets that almost always support Republicans urged their readers to reject him as an unambiguous threat to the world order. This unprecedented coalition was, evidently, ineffective. Now, rather than admitting the difficult realization of their own limits, many journalists are seeking to redirect blame. Facebook, where ""fake news"" spread virally side by side with real reporting, has become the go-to scapegoat. ""Mark Zuckerberg is in Denial,"" declared one piece in the New York Times that excoriated the social network CEO for defending the company's role in the election.   [My 'fake news list' went viral. But made-up stories are only part of the problem.]   Zuckerberg has called accusations that Facebook influenced the election ""a pretty crazy idea,"" citing internal data showing that fake news, hoaxes and alternative news sites represent a tiny fraction of the overall news shared on the platform. He says Facebook routinely introduces a diverse set of views to its users, but they choose to ignore them and don't click through to stories that differ from their preconceived opinions. Indeed, research suggests that most links shared on Facebook aren't even clicked on but are shared by partisans who already know what they want to believe. On the other hand, reporting by BuzzFeed suggests that fake news, most likely hyperpartisan in nature, was more popular than mainstream news just before the election. ""Right now the problem isn't that diverse information isn't there . . . but we haven't gotten people to engage with it in higher proportions,"" Zuckerberg said at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif. It's true: Scapegoating Facebook ignores more fundamental issues with our democracy.   [Facebook fake-news writer: 'I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me']   Before the Internet and the proliferation of cable news, producers and newspaper editors enjoyed a golden era as the gatekeepers of the national conversation. Much of America was all fed the same news, while outlier views were excluded from TV and print. The Internet is an unusually efficient vehicle for making money off the spread of fake and incendiary news, which is why Google, Twitter and Facebook have attempted to clamp down on ads paired with unscrupulous links. But the uncomfortable reality is that journalists no longer enjoy the convenience of a captive audience. Readers can find news wherever they like; Facebook makes it easier for people to encounter and share it, yes, but if that platform didn't exist, something else would. Ultraconservative outlets, such as the Drudge Report, are reporting record traffic. Self-selection is even occurring within conservative outlets, as Trump champion Sean Hannity for the first time beat his colleagues Bill O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly on Fox News Channel in the 25-to-54-year-old ratings demographic, according to the Nielsen data released in September. Unless we fix the demand for biased or fake news, no filter feature that Facebook or Google builds will make much of a difference. America will likely need to reform the education system to create a more informed electorate. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. recently called for a greater emphasis on civics education, while many states are either ramping up their civics courses or mulling new graduation requirements. Of course, journalism has an essential role in educating the public and elevating national discourse. If 29 percent of Americans believe President Obama is a Muslim, that reflects the media's inability to effectively convey ideas. Fixing that is our great challenge, our responsibility. Research suggests that it is only possible to counteract rumors when readers trust the source. According to Gallup, trust in the media is at a historic low of 32 percent, down 28 points since 2005. The proliferation of partisan news and conspiracy-theory outlets has likely fueled this distrust and made it harder for citizens to identify high-quality media. Increasing trust in quality news publishers will likely require journalists to engage with voices and ideas they find deeply offensive, reaching out to the darkest elements of the Internet they might otherwise wish to avoid. I want to be clear: I'm not blaming my colleagues in the news business. But the reaction against Facebook is naive about the realities of the new media landscape and unduly pessimistic about the capacity of citizens to make good choices. The inconvenient truth is that the Internet is a reflection of what people are saying and thinking, whether it's on Facebook or alternatives like the Drudge Report and the massive underground of email chains that circulate conservative rumors. A billionaire CEO will not stem the rising unrest of American populism, and it's troubling that anyone hopes one company should exert so much power even if it could. Before we can solve Facebook's problem, we need to fix our democracy."

The GOP seems bent on redefining itself as a nativist, right-wing party in the mode of some European parties, whom chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon fancies. The danger -- or the opportunity -- is that neither of these visions is sustainable over the long haul. Virginia is a case in point. The Democrats carried the once-red state at the presidential level for the third straight election. Hillary Clinton won the state by nearly 200,000 votes with 49.9 percent of the vote. The state has turned solid blue in large part because the Northern counties, the most populous, home to a diverse mix of minorities, professionals and suburbanites who reject the angry-man appeal both parties seem to be adopting. Clinton won Fairfax County 64 to 29 percent, by nearly 200,000 -- the same margin of victory as her state win. In nearby Loudoun County, she won 55 to 38 percent, with a margin of more than 30,000. In more liberal Alexandria, Clinton won 76 percent of the vote. ""2016 further demonstrates how Virginia has continued to evolve politically,"" says longtime GOP operative Tucker Martin, who worked on the last successful statewide race (Bob McDonnell in 2009). ""A statewide Republican candidate must understand that, and campaign accordingly. Republicans can still win here on the top line, but they must be policy-focused and speak directly to the concerns of all voters."" So it was a Democratic sweep in Northern Virginia? Hardly. In the Virginia 10th Congressional District (which includes parts of Fairfax, Loudoun and other x-urbs), Rep. Barbara Comstock won 53 to 47 percent. (Note the massive ticket-splitting.) She's a mainstream Republican whom The Post's editorial board endorsed for her common-sense positions (""voting against a government shut-down, for example, and protecting federal funding for Metro when it was threatened by other Republicans. The word 'Republican' is absent from her campaign website; the word 'bipartisan' appears throughout""). So which party is going to look out for the interests of places where a mix of middle-class professionals. students, recent immigrants and others depend on American success in the international economy and where people hold dear values such as civility, empathy and tolerance? These people want government to work well, not to go away. They don't want to chest thump. ""In a number of ways, a statewide campaign in Virginia is like running in the Philadelphia suburbs -- that's just the political reality,"" says Martin. ""So focus on kitchen-table issues, use conservative principles to create policy solutions that help folks in their daily lives. That's what it takes. Nothing glamorous about it, but we know that approach works."" Put differently, there is still a center in American politics, one that is not at the moment fully represented by either party. In the rush for the extremes, both parties should keep in mind that rural America and working-class whites are only one part of the United States. It's a diverse country, not bound to either party and desirous of good government. These Americans at the center want schools that prepare their kids to compete, a thriving jobs market and leaders who are decent and respectful. If one or both parties neglect them, there will be a tremendous opportunity for a new one -- which by the way would also sell quite well in urban areas, among women and with millennials. We will see if either party realizes that that part of America needs its attention, too."

(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)  Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) appears to be the early favorite to become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He's already earned high-profile support from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-Nev.) and liberals across the country. And as we wrote last week, Ellison provides perhaps an unrivaled contrast to President-elect Donald Trump -- particularly as a black Muslim from the Midwest, a region that lost the election for their party last week. But Ellison hasn't been a stranger to controversy, either. Earlier in his career, Ellison apologized for and/or backed off a number of controversial statements and politically dicey moves, from likening George W. Bush's consolidation of power post-9/11 to the rise of Adolf Hitler, to defending the leader of the National of Islam, to labeling his 2012 reelection opponent a ""lowlife scumbag."" These comments have rarely been an issue for Ellison in his safe Minneapolis-based district, but now that he's competing to lead the Democratic Party, they've resurfaced. Since his candidacy for DNC chair became official on Monday, conservative outlets have been quick to seize on the Hitler comments -- often stretching them further than the words dictate. An Ellison spokesman is dismissing them as old attacks and emphasizes the congressman long ago denounced anti-Semitism within the ranks of the Nation of Islam. He also pointed to the congressman's work with Jewish groups and support from the Jewish community. Here's what Ellison said back in 2007 during a meeting with a group of atheists: ""It's almost like the Reichstag fire, kind of reminds me of that. After the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the Communists for it and it put the leader of that country in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted."" Ellison didn't say the name ""Hitler,"" but the arson attack on the Reichstag building -- the home of Germany's parliament -- in Berlin in 1933 is remembered as contributing to Hitler's consolidation of power. Hitler used emergency constitutional levers to crack down on the press and opposition groups, eventually extending the crackdown to even more civil rights. The then-freshman congressman's comparison drew criticism from the Anti-Defamation League, which combats anti-Semitism. Then-head Abe Foxman called it ""odious"" and said it ""demeans the victims of 9/11 and the brave American men and women engaged in the war on terror. Furthermore, it demonstrates a profound lack of understanding about the horrors that Hitler and his Nazi regime perpetrated."" Ellison admitted it was a poor choice of words. ""They told me they understood the point I was trying to make, but they didn't think it was the right way to use that historical example, because they thought any sort of comparison to the modern world we live in in some way diminishes the horror of the Nazi era. I told them I feel they're right."" At the same time, Ellison didn't back off the underlying claim that 9/11 had allowed Bush to attain too much power. The country's first Muslim congressman has also backed off his involvement with the Million Man March in 1995 and his comments in defense of Nation of Islam Leader Louis Farrakhan. As the AP's Patrick Condon wrote in 2006, when Ellison first campaigned for Congress: Around 1990, Ellison -- then a University of Minnesota law student known as Keith E. Hakim -- wrote several columns in the student newspaper that are getting a second look. One column defended Farrakhan against charges of anti-Semitism; a second suggested the creation of a state for black residents. In 1995, Ellison helped organize a delegation to Farrakhan's Million Man March in Washington. Ellison, 42, said he was never an enrolled member of the Nation of Islam. He got involved to help improve the lives of black men, he said, and did not fully grasp concerns about Farrakhan's anti-Semitism until after the 1995 march. ""There are legitimate concerns in the Jewish community. That's why I'm happy to answer them,"" Ellison said. But, he added, ""I do also think there are people out there who are fearmongering, who are trying to scare the Jewish community and manipulate this issue."" In 2006, he said, ""I wrongly dismissed concerns that [Farrakhan's comments] were anti-Semitic. They were and are anti-Semitic, and I should have come to that conclusion earlier than I did."" He added at the time: ""I have long since distanced myself from and rejected the Nation of Islam due to its propagation of bigoted and anti-Semitic ideas and statements, as well as other issues. I have a deep and personal aversion to anti-Semitism regardless of its source, and I reject and condemn the anti-Semitic statements and actions of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, and Khalid Muhammed."" Separately, in 2001 while working as a lawyer, Ellison stood up for accused Sara Jane Olson, a member of the so-called Symbionese Liberation Army, which has been called a domestic terrorist group. Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Soliah, pleaded guilty shortly after 9/11 to attempting to murder Los Angeles police officers more than two decades prior but maintained her innocence. ""I think it's dangerous to prosecute people for their political views and their political associations,"" Ellison said at the time. ""I think you prosecute people for what they do, for their acts."" During his time in Congress, Ellison has sought to make inroads with Jewish groups and has spoken out against anti-Semitism. Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of the liberal Jewish group J Street, told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday that Ellison is a ""friend of Israel"" and a ""friend of Jewish people."" ""These kinds of attacks that have been leveled against him are symptomatic of a mood and fervor on the political right that needs to be countered,"" Ben-Ami said, adding that Ellison is to be commended for recognizing when he said the wrong thing. Ellison spokesman Brett Morrow added: ""These are old stories the right wing has rolled out to attack Keith for years. He's focused on moving the Democratic Party forward so all Americans can be successful -- no matter their race, religion or ethnicity."" Should Democrats pick Ellison as their party leader, they'll be picking someone with a completely unique background who would provide a huge contrast to Trump. They'll also be picking someone who, like Trump, could well be a lightning rod."

The students began assembling outside Trump's newly opened hotel Tuesday and walked past the Capitol to the Supreme Court across the street. The streets in between are blocked by protesters and police. The protesters are carrying signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Not My President."" Woodrow Wilson High School students promoted the event on social media, saying they want to tell Trump ""he can't divide us."" Wilson Principal Kimberly Martin said in a letter to parents that the school defends students' right to self-expression, but she warned that students who participate will receive unexcused absences.

In a news conference Monday ahead of his final overseas trip as president, Obama said he still would prefer to have Guantanamo inmates transferred to a facility under U.S. jurisdiction, saying, ""we'd do it a lot cheaper. And just as safely."" He hailed efforts to bring down the number of inmates, but with regard to transferring those inmates, he said, ""Congress disagrees with me, and I gather the president-elect does as well."" President-elect Donald Trump has said it would be ""fine"" to try Americans suspected of terrorism at Guantanamo Bay, if possible, and has raised concern about decreasing the number of inmates. ___ 5:00 p.m. President Barack Obama says he will encourage his successor to allow immigrants who came to the country as children to remain in the U.S. Those immigrants, known as DREAMers, were granted legal status under a 2012 executive order. Obama says that the majority of Americans would not want the young people to ""start hiding again."" He's speaking at a White House news conference Monday ahead of his final overseas trip as president. Obama admitted he was unlikely to achieve his goal of closing the Guantanamo Bay prison, blaming the failure on Congress. He also took a bit of a victory lap, praising his administration for leaving office without a ""significant scandal."" Obama says he urged Donald Trump to follow his example and ""listen to the lawyers."" ___ 4:55 p.m. President Barack Obama says finding a way to alleviate the suffering in Syria is something he thinks about every day, calling it a ""messy situation."" In a news conference Monday, Obama said his administration has made ""every effort to try to bring about a political resolution,"" negotiating with the various parties involved, including the Russians, Iranians and Arab Gulf states. He compared it to efforts to bring about a resolution to the conflict in Libya, saying that in Syria, it's ""a much more messy situation with proxies coming from every direction."" He said, ""I recognize that that has not worked,"" and said his government continues to ""try to find some formula that would allow us to see that suffering end."" ___ 4:40 p.m. President Barack Obama says Donald Trump understands that a candidate being reckless with his words can be less consequential than a president saying the same thing. Speaking at a White House news conference Monday, Obama noted that markets move and foreign governments take note of a president's rhetoric. He said national security ""requires a level of precision"" so deadly mistakes aren't made. Obama added of his blunt-spoken successor that, ""I think what will happen with the president-elect is that there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them."" He said Trump ""recognizes that this is different -- and so do the American people."" ___ 4:30 p.m. With just weeks left in office, President Barack Obama is making the argument that immigration is good for the American economy. In a White House news conference ahead of his final overseas trip as president, Obama addressed a question about whether Americans voted for Donald Trump because they are seeking a ""course correction."" Obama acknowledged that many Americans have grown skeptical about the ""complex argument"" in support of immigration, when they see factories closing at home and jobs going offshore. But he said ""immigration is good for our economy"" if it is ""orderly and lawful."" Trump campaigned on a promise to limit immigration into the United States and bring offshore jobs back home. Obama said it continues to be his ""strong belief"" that achieving a strong global economy does not mean ""shutting people out."" ___ 4:25 p.m. President Barack Obama says he thinks Donald Trump will seek to ""send some signals of unity"" to people alienated by his ferocious campaign. In a White House news conference Monday, Obama said he advised Trump ""to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign"" and ""that's something that he will want to do."" But Obama added that Trump is trying to balance commitments he made to ""supporters that helped to get him here."" On the campaign trail, Trump described Mexicans as rapists and criminals. He vowed to build a wall along the U.S.'s southern border and make Mexico pay for it. He appeared to mock a reporter with a physical disability and threatened to sue several women who accused him of assaulting them. Trump also disparaged the Muslim American parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq, and battled a former Miss America who is Latino about having gained weight. ___ 4:20 p.m. President Barack Obama is dodging a question about concerns that minorities and others have about President-elect Donald Trump's decision to name Steve Bannon -- a man celebrated by the white nationalist movement -- his chief strategist and senior adviser. In a White House press briefing Monday, Obama says it's not appropriate for him to comment on every Trump appointment. But he says he told Trump in their meeting last week that it's important to try to send some signals of unity early on. He says both sides of the political divide should give Trump some time to set up his team and Americans can judge him in a couple years. Obama also says he told Trump that campaigning is different than governing and sometimes good sound bites don't equate to good policy. ___ 4:05 p.m. President Barack Obama says he urged his successor to immediately turn his focus to finding qualified people to staff his White House. In a White House press briefing Monday ahead of his last foreign trip as president, Obama offered some details about the meeting he had last week with Donald Trump. He said he offered Trump honest advice in a lengthy conversation and highlighted the importance of finding trusted aides. Obama stressed the need to give Trump the ""rope and space"" for a ""reset."" The president also reflected on his own arrival in the White House during the midst of the economic crisis. He says Trump will have more ""time and space"" to make ""judicious decisions."" ___ 4:00 p.m. President Barack Obama has a message to Democrats: Compete everywhere and show up everywhere. In a White House news conference Monday ahead of his last foreign trip as president, Obama reflected on Democrat Hillary Clinton's loss to President-elect Donald Trump in last week's election. He also reflected on his own campaign for president eight years ago, recalling all of the time he spent in Iowa to win that state's lead-off caucuses. He said he won the state because he spent time going everywhere, meeting everyone. He stresses that Democrats ""have to compete at a grass roots level."" Clinton spent much of her time and money campaigning in swing and Republican-leaning states in the late stages of the 2016 campaign, losing several states that had consistently voted Democratic in the past several presidential elections. ___ 3:50 p.m. President Barack Obama says he can reassure allies of the United States that his successor supports NATO. Obama made the remark during a news conference just before embarking on his final overseas trip as president. He says on the weeklong tour of Greece, Germany and Peru, he'll relay Donald Trump's ""commitment to NATO."" As a candidate for president, Trump complained that other members of the treaty organization did not contribute enough for the protections it affords. Obama said the reassurance is ""one of the most important functions"" he can serve during the trip. ___ 3:15 p.m. President Barack Obama is about to hold his first news conference since Republican Donald Trump won election to succeed him. The session with reporters on Monday was expected to focus on questions about the election, its consequences for U.S. policy and Obama's own legacy. Obama will then depart on his last overseas trip as president. The weeklong tour was planned when it seemed certain Hillary Clinton would win the contest and was designed to reassure the world that the U.S. had regained its footing after a toxic campaign.

She was 61. A former reporter for The New York Times and The Washington Post, Ifill switched to television in the 1990s and covered politics and Congress for NBC News. She moved to PBS in 1999 as host of ""Washington Week"" and also worked for the nightly ""NewsHour"" program. She and Woodruff were named co-anchors in 2013. She moderated vice presidential debates in 2004 and 2008 and authored the book, ""The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama."" The president on Monday praised Ifill for informing today's citizens while also inspiring a young generation of journalists.  ""I always appreciated Gwen's reporting, even when I was on the receiving end of one of her tough"" interviews, Obama said. Ifill took a leave from ""NewsHour"" for a month this spring for health reasons, keeping details of her illness private. Her health failing, she left ""NewsHour"" again shortly before an election night that she and Woodruff would have covered together.  ""Gwen was a standard bearer for courage, fairness and integrity in an industry going through seismic change,"" said Sara Just, PBS ""NewsHour"" executive producer. ""She was a mentor to so many across the industry and her professionalism was respected across the political spectrum. She was a journalist's journalist and set an example for all around her."" NBC News' Pete Williams, a former colleague, struggled to keep his composure Monday when announcing Ifill's death on MSNBC.  ""She had so many awards in her office you could barely see out the window,"" Williams said. U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said he was a member of the Maryland state legislature when Ifill worked for the Baltimore Evening Sun.  ""She always demonstrated thoughtful intelligence, determination to uncover the facts, and an innate talent for knowing what truly interested the public,"" Cummings said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Ifill ""a legend.""  ""Her dignity and grace, intellect and insight set the standard in American media and public life,"" Pelosi said. Shortly before moderating the debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin in 2008, Ifill brushed aside concerns that she might not be fair because she was writing a book about Obama.  ""I've got a pretty long track record covering politics and news, so I'm not particularly worried that one-day blog chatter is going to destroy my reputation,"" she told The Associated Press then. Ifill, who was black, also questioned why people would assume her book would be favorable toward Obama. ""Do you think they made the same assumptions about Lou Cannon (who is white) when he wrote his book about Reagan?"" she said. In a 2007 opinion piece published in The New York Times, Ifill condemned radio host Don Imus' ""nappy-headed hos"" reference to Rutgers University female basketball players.  ""To his credit, Mr. Imus told the Rev. Al Sharpton yesterday he realizes that, this time, he went way too far,"" Ifill wrote.  ""Yes, he did. Every time a young black girl shyly approaches me for an autograph or writes or calls or stops me on the street to ask how she can become a journalist, I feel an enormous responsibility,"" she said. ""It's more than simply being a role model. I know I have to be a voice for them as well."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Clinton held an 18-minute conference call with Democrats Monday night in which she thanked them for their support. As for losing the presidency to Donald Trump, she says heartbreaks don't heal overnight and this one won't. She tells Democrats that they shouldn't be discouraged or divided. She says the people they fought for in this election need champions more than ever. She adds that the party needs to figure out what happened and why Democrats lost. A Democrat on the call described the discussion on condition of anonymity because the individual wasn't authorized to speak publicly. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

House Speaker Paul Ryan began the day affirming that the Republican congressional majority is strongly aligned with the new president-elect, whom Ryan had initially refused to endorse and some congressional Republicans never backed. Ryan enjoined colleagues to ""hit the ground running as we join forces with the new Trump administration.""  ""We need to seize this moment, and come together like never before,"" the Wisconsin Republican wrote in a letter to the House GOP. ""We cannot be timid about this: the country has voted for change, and we must deliver."" In his letter, Ryan sought support for another term as speaker a year after first assuming the job. Closed-door House GOP leadership elections will take place on Tuesday, and Ryan is expected to prevail despite some rumblings of discontent among conservatives. He would then need to be elected on the floor of the House by the full complement of Republicans and Democrats once the new Congress convenes in January. Republicans will control both chambers of Congress and the White House, giving the GOP a monopoly over Washington for the first time in more than a decade. The situation is full of challenges to navigate, as Congress' Republicans, and Trump himself, confront the task of delivering on his promises to voters. On Monday, one of those pledges ran into reality as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested Congress might not sign on to the U.S.-Mexico border wall long promised by Trump. McCarthy said there is bipartisan support for a border security bill, but that it might not take the shape of a wall along the entire 2,000-mile border. In some spots drone technology or other approaches might work better, McCarthy told reporters.  ""I just want to make sure it's secure,"" the California Republican said. ""I won't predetermine."" That came after Ryan told a CNN interviewer over the weekend that there would be no ""deportation force"" to round up immigrants in the country illegally, as also promised by Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also demurred on the wall idea last week, and Trump himself said in CBS' ""60 Minutes"" interview on Sunday that he'd be open to ""fencing"" in some spots instead. As the House came back into session Monday, some 50 newly elected House members, and six new senators, were arriving in the capital to learn the ropes of their new jobs, much like college freshmen at orientation. The new 115th Congress will include the first Latina senator and a record number of minority women, but Congress will remain overwhelmingly white, male and middle-aged. Before the newcomers can get to work, the existing Congress must close out remaining business with President Barack Obama. Most urgently, government funding runs out Dec. 9, and Congress must pass a new spending bill or face a shutdown. The solution could be to extend existing spending levels, postponing tough decisions until next year, when numerous other tasks will also await. On the Democratic side, there was bitterness in defeat as a group of House Democrats pressured Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to delay leadership elections now set for Thursday. A letter signed by more than two dozen lawmakers sought more time to ""analyze how our party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's strategy fell so short of our goals."" Republicans lost only a half-dozen seats in the House and just two in the Senate, far fewer than forecast. McCarthy and other Republicans also were forced to defend Trump's pick of Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counselor. Bannon was an executive at Breitbart News, a website that appealed to the so-called ""alt-right"" movement that involves efforts to preserve ""white identity"" and oppose multiculturalism.  ""The president has a right to select who he thinks is best,"" McCarthy insisted after a reporter read aloud some of the incendiary headlines Breitbart has published, including referring to former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords as ""The Gun Control Movement's Human Shield"" after she was shot in the head. After the Giffords headline was repeated to him, McCarthy said: ""Nowhere would I ever agree with those words, nowhere would I ever stand behind those words."" But he urged people concerned about Bannon: ""Don't prejudge the new president, give him an opportunity to govern."" ___= Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.

Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, center, applauds after leftist guerrilla commander Ivan Marquez and Humberto de la Calle, the head of the Colombian delegation to the peace talks, signed a new peace agreement in Havana on Saturday. On Oct. 2, Colombian voters narrowly defeated a peace accord signed in June. (Yamil Lage/AFP via Getty Images)  Will Saturday's new peace accord with the FARC guerrilla group fare better than the June deal? The new accord follows an Oct. 2 referendum that narrowly rejected the Colombian government's initial peace deal with the FARC. While the referendum was a major blow to the government, it did net President Juan Manuel Santos the Nobel Peace Prize, underscoring the monumental importance of ending the conflict and the strong backing of the international community. The peace accord signed in June reflects the enormously complex character of Colombia's long-standing civil war. It boils down to five main points: rural reform, political participation for the FARC, a new policy on illicit drugs, reparations to victims, and the logistical steps to enact the settlement, including FARC demobilization and disarmament. The latest, revised deal is similar, but it includes several important changes: the withdrawal of a promise of guaranteed seats for former rebels in Congress, the removal of foreign magistrates from special peace tribunals, and the requirement that the FARC -- formally known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- proffer comprehensive information about its role in the drug trade. There has been no announcement on whether the new deal will be put to another referendum or be decided in Congress.   [Colombia just voted no on its referendum for peace. Here's why.]   Land inequalities are central to ending the conflict There's little indication that the latest deal improves the terms of rural reform, particularly the role of land access and rural development in ending the conflict. The FARC, a Marxist-based guerrilla group, formed in 1964 after more than a decade of civil war. Its most potent message for decades was the promise of a radical redistribution of property should it seize national power. Addressing the country's vast inequalities holds broad appeal in the countryside. The 2015 agrarian census -- Colombia's first since 1970 -- revealed a 45 percent rural poverty rate, triple the urban rate. Farmers get little government support -- 83 percent lack agricultural machinery and 90 percent do not receive any agricultural credits or technical assistance. Access to education in rural areas is also sorely lacking: 73 percent of people ages 17 to 24 have no educational opportunities. The FARC and other violent groups such as the ELN and organized crime have been successful in rooting themselves in rural areas, where many families are scraping by and the opportunity cost of supporting armed groups is low. For decades, Colombia's small landowners and landless farmers were left behind socially and economically. Many have been physically displaced by conflict, and nearly all of them want some form of land reform that will give them the security of ownership of the land they till. But the discussion on land reform was narrow and eclipsed by the FARC Ironically, the public debates and media coverage before and after the October referendum focused almost exclusively on the fate of the FARC leadership and rank-and-file guerrillas. This is in no small part because of the fact that former president Alvaro Uribe -- the most vocal opponent of the June accord -- cast the deal as a referendum on amnesty for the FARC. The referendum's ultimate failure was, therefore, a boon to Uribe. Reflecting his increased political power, he issued a statement asking to review the latest peace deal in detail before pronouncing whether he supports it.   [Why the Colombia peace agreement failed, and what we can expect now]   Yet the failed referendum suggests that Colombia's voters are at war even in how they think about peace. The greatest support for the peace agreement came from the countryside -- the rural areas hit hardest by FARC-driven violence. Civilian massacres, guerrilla recruitment, internal displacement and land dispossession were documented features of the FARC's operations. What explains this seeming contradiction? As several accounts have suggested, rural inhabitants understand the enormous stakes and knew that any peace deal is better than none. But a more likely reason is because the less-discussed but critical component of the peace agreement -- rural land reform -- promised the moon to Colombia's millions of farmers. The agreement envisioned a regionally based land fund to dole out property to the land-poor, the development of rural infrastructure and education, and greater subsidies and credits to small farmers. There is a darker side of land reform By vowing to push for a tough line against the FARC in the new peace deal, Uribe continues to successfully draw attention away from these promises for rural development. Uribe himself hails from a prominent landowning family in the cattle-ranching state of Antioquia. Ranchers and large landowners in Antioquia and beyond have long opposed broad-based land reform, which could tilt labor markets, agricultural production and local political power in the countryside toward smallholders. Furthermore, my research suggests that during his 2002-2010 presidency, Uribe continued the long-standing trend that enabled well-organized landowners to use their local political power and market power to appropriate public lands. As international prices of important commodities such as coffee, sugar and bananas rose, the government doled out more grants of public lands to private applicants. The land grants tied to these price increases, however, were large and systematically targeted toward more unequal places where land was suitable to the cultivation of these commodities. These commodities are produced in Colombia by well-organized and politically influential agricultural groups. This suggests that established, well-organized landed interests disproportionately benefited from windfalls of public land grants driven by price shocks.   [Colombians rejected transitional justice for guerrillas. They want criminal justice instead.]   Can this November peace deal address rural inequality? Santos's next steps will be challenging. To win citizen support for the November peace deal, he has to first come to peace with Uribe -- and he has already extended an olive branch in Uribe's direction. But including Uribe as an architect in peace is likely to shift toward pleasing urban residents -- who want harsher punishments for FARC guerrillas after decades of violence. This shift would come at the expense of residents in the countryside, where economic deprivation has long proven to be fertile soil for rebellion. This would probably provoke continued violence, rather than douse it. In short, regardless of whether Colombia's new peace deal sticks, rural violence and discontent are likely to continue, fueled either by another failed agreement or a revised deal that ignores a fundamental source of Colombia's conflict: the plight of the nearly 25 percent of the population that lives in the countryside. Michael Albertus is an assistant professor at the University of Chicago, where he researches the political conditions under which governments implement egalitarian reforms. His first book, Autocracy and Redistribution: The Politics of Land Reform, was recently published by Cambridge University Press and won the Luebbert Book Award.
