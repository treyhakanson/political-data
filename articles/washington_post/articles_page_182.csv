The U.S. Marshals Service says 25-year-old Dontrell Montese Carter was shot multiple times by law officers Friday morning after he opened fire on them at a mobile home in southeast Georgia. Patrick Carothers, deputy commander of the agency's Southeast fugitive task force, died after being shot twice. Carter had been wanted since Sept. 18, when he fled Sumter County, South Carolina. The Sumter County Sheriff's Office at the time said officers were called after Carter assaulted his girlfriend and fired a gun into the home of a relative who intervened. Authorities said Carter led officers on a car chase, then fired his gun at police as he escaped on foot. ___ 2:30 p.m. Federal authorities say a deputy U.S. marshal has been fatally shot while trying to serve an arrest warrant in southeast Georgia. A news release from the U.S. Marshals Service says the suspect was killed by officers who returned fire. The release says the deputy marshal, 53-year-old Patrick Carothers, was shot twice while trying to serve a warrant at a mobile home in rural Long County, about 55 miles southeast of Savannah. Stewart Cottingham, supervisory inspector for a fugitive task force run by the U.S. Marshals Service, says the suspect was a fugitive wanted in Sumter County, South Carolina.

The federal lawsuit was filed Friday by H. Edward Spires against the secretary of the Air Force and asks for his discharge status to be changed to ""honorable."" Spires says after the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy in 2010 he applied for an upgrade but was rejected by the Air Force Board for Corrections of Military Records, which noted personnel records were lost in a 1973 fire. The Air Force says it can't comment on pending litigation. Attorneys for Spires say he's in poor health and would like a military funeral but that won't be possible without an upgrade.

President Juan Carlos Varela said Friday that France has until the end of the year to make the change. Panama's financial system was shaken in April by the leak of a huge trove of documents detailing offshore financial dealings. Many of the documents detailed how world leaders, celebrities and businesses used tax shelters to hide money. Varela says an independent report with recommendations on how to reform Panama's financial sector will be released Monday. The two best-known members of the independent study panel, economist Joseph Stiglitz and Swiss anticorruption expert Mark Pieth, left the effort in August over internal differences.

""It's the kind of thing that we've done often in the past for foreign correspondents who are exposed to different situations and we make available to them in case they want it,"" Joseph Kahn, the paper's managing editor, told the Erik Wemple Blog. The impetus for the meeting, said Kahn, came from different angles, including addressing how to communicate securely with sources; how to keep email and other communications from hackers; and safety precautions at demonstrations and rallies. Another specific item of concern, said Kahn, is ""reports of women feeling uncomfortable and experiencing harassment on Twitter when they weigh in on sensitive gender incidents."" There's been the worry, added the managing editor, that social media sites aren't a ""really safe space for people who are associated with certain points of view on gender issues or sexual orientation issues, too."" Another safety concern relates to the anti-Semitism that has roared on Twitter and other, more archaic messaging platforms, such as the U.S. Postal Service. New York Times Washington-based editor Jonathan Weisman did battle with such trolls earlier this year after tweeting a story that identified Trump as a porter of fascism. Maggie Haberman, a political reporter who has done close examinations of his campaign, received an orange envelope in the mail bearing an anti-Semitic tract. This particular scourge, says Kahn, ""was not a significant topic at the meeting."" He noted that the topic had come up earlier in response to ""some specific cases."" Whatever the particulars, the trend is clear: Newsrooms are migrating their expertise in protecting personnel in overseas hotspots to domestic coverage. ""We have to keep our journalists safe in Mosul, and we have to keep our journalists safe in Washington, D.C.,"" Sally Buzbee, soon-to-be executive editor of the Associated Press (AP), told the Erik Wemple Blog yesterday. She declined to get into specifics about the wire service's countermeasures. Earlier this week, Politico sent a missive to staff pledging its steadfast work in the area of safety and security, noting that it had a well-connected consultant prepared to address problems. Asked about whether The Washington Post has had to deal with the anti-Semitic problem, Executive Editor Marty Baron responded, ""We haven't had to do anything on that front yet. There was stuff on social media throughout the campaign, particularly the latter weeks. But nothing yet on that front that requires special intervention. (A pastor sent some literature to my address indicating I'd be heading to hell. There was very colorful imagery.)"""

The yield on the 10-year muni bond was 2.525 percent as of 5 p.m. Eastern time on Friday, according to the AP Municipal Bond index. As recently as mid-August, it was below 1.8 percent. Yields on the short-term two-year municipal bond also spiked again, landing at 1.187 percent. Just two weeks ago, the two-year yield was 0.93 percent. The yield on the 30-year muni finished the week at 3.277 percent. While most experts had predicted that stocks would drop after a Trump victory, it was the bond market that cratered last week. Many investors believe that Trump's plans to stoke the economy will result in inflation, higher debt and faster-than-expected interest rate increases, all of which would weigh on the price of bonds. In response, they yanked their money out of bonds, causing prices to tank and yields to rise. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. Municipal bonds are facing many of the same challenges as Treasurys, along with a significant additional uncertainty: tax reform. President-elect Trump has made clear that he will try to lower tax rates, especially for high earners. Should that happen, it would decrease the appeal of tax-exempt holdings such as municipal bonds. That, in turn, would force muni issuers to adjust their prices to attract buyers and increase borrowing costs for state and local governments, says Peter Hayes, head of BlackRock's municipal bonds group. In response to all those potential negatives, investors dumped muni bonds last week, creating the largest weekly sell-off since 2013. The largest municipal bond exchange-traded fund, the iShares National Muni Bond ETF, fell 1.1 percent this past week. Investors have always demanded higher yields for holding long-term bonds, which are riskier than their short-term rivals. The gap, or spread, in yields between short- and long-term muni bonds has also gotten larger following the election. The spread between two- and 10-year muni bonds was 1.338 percentage points, as of Friday evening. Shortly before the election, it was only 1.126 percentage points. In other election-related muni bond news: -- Policy changes: Winners and losers A report released this week by S&P Global Ratings outlined some of the regulatory policies that have the potential to hurt -- and help -- the credit landscape for states. Many states now rely heavily on federal funding to prop up their finances. ""It's been a very strange economic recovery from a state tax revenue standpoint,"" says S&P credit analyst Robin Prunty, ""We've had a lot of downgrade activity, and that's not a pattern we typically see in a recovery period."" States currently receive nearly $370 billion in grants for Medicaid, which could be rolled back with changes in health care policy, the report notes. That would damage the credit outlook for some states. Not-for-profit hospitals and public housing could also face challenges. On the other hand, lighter regulations for power and water utilities may lower the cost to states to provide those services. -- California voters weigh in California ballots this year contained a slew of initiatives that will have a significant impact on state credit and bond issuance in the Golden State. Voters approved a proposition to extend 2012's tax increases on the wealthiest Californians by 12 years. The measure, which hiked income tax rates by 1 percentage point to 3 percentage points for families earning more than about half a million dollars a year, has been credited with helping California emerge from a budget crisis following the Great Recession. Another proposition to approve $9 billion in bonds for school and community college construction projects was also approved. California Gov. Jerry Brown had argued against the measure, saying it favored more affluent communities. Finally, voters rejected a measure that would have required voter approval on revenue bonds totaling more than $2 billion that would be used for public infrastructure projects.

The men denounced the actors' opposition to Trump and called them ""cucks,"" a term favored by the alt-right that implies that someone is a wimp.

6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/11/09/reflections-on-the-election/	“Reflections on the election”	"A nice post by Ted Folkman (Letters Blogatory), a longtime critic of our new President-elect; here's the opening paragraph: The tone of my first reflections on the 2016 general election, written before voting began, was hopelessly smug and made unwarranted assumptions. I assumed that the data we had at the time were true and that it was pretty likely, though hardly certain, that Hillary Clinton would win the presidential election and that the Democratic Party would retake control of the Senate. To quote a former governor of Texas dispatched early in the primary season, ""Oops."" The rest of the post focuses more on the substance, and has interesting, substantive things to say. But I think the opening sets the right tone, a tone that all of us who were blindsided by this election (as I completely was) ought to keep in mind: We were badly wrong in our predictions about American politics. Might we have been badly wrong in our judgments about policy, too? Or even if our policy is completely right, given that policy can only be implemented through politics, might we be wrong in our sense of how best to do that, and in our predictions about how any particular approach would fare? The election is commonly talked about as a revolt against the elites. But it also highlights the failure of the elites -- the elites in the Republican Party, the elites in the Democratic Party, the elites among the commentariat -- to understand how Americans would respond to the Trump candidacy. I totally put myself within that box of deplorable soothsayers: Political predictions aren't my main field, but I made plenty of them in my mind and to my friends, and I was completely mistaken. I suspect that a healthy dose of self-doubt is a necessary, though not sufficient, ingredient for any cure."

President-elect Donald Trump with Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, during his election victory event in New York in the early morning hours of Wednesday. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)  What does political science know about how President-elect Donald Trump is likely to govern? TMC has run a variety of posts on aspects of this question. Here you go: How populists lead and how they affect their voters  Populist leaders undermine democracy in these 4 ways. Would a President Trump? Some people are comparing Donald Trump to populist leftist Hugo Chavez. That's mostly wrong. The difference between Trump and Chavez mirrors the difference between what scholars call exclusionary and inclusionary populism. Can you threaten to jail your opponent in a democracy? Some countries hold elections but aren't actually democracies. Here's what they look like. Voting for populists makes citizens angrier and more discontented. Donald Trump may be showing us the future of right-wing politics. His proposals are in keeping with long-standing trends in U.S. history and society, with the rejection and nativism that have erupted after each immigration wave.    How Trump's proposals may work in practice  Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton support paid family leave. That's a breakthrough. Here's what could happen if President Trump tore up the Iran nuclear deal. Will Donald Trump really build that wall? Here's a new research tool for figuring out which promises presidents keep. Trump's border wall will become a lot less popular if he actually tries to build it.  How a president's power may (or may not) be constrained by the U.S. system of government  So what would a Trump presidency actually be like? He'll have less power than he -- or you -- imagine.  No, White House lawyers would not prevent President Trump from overstepping his constitutional bounds Note to Donald Trump: Here's why you can't run the U.S. government the way you run a business Okay, Trump may be Machiavellian. But which Machiavelli?    What's coming for the Republican Party  Trump will win or lose. Either way, the Koch network will still shape the Republican Party

(Richard Drew/AP)  The weekend before polls closed, the Russian-funded network RT ran an interview between the pedigreed left-wing journalist John Pilger and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The subject: What Assange had revealed by publishing emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The context: Assange, obviously, was revealing secrets about the next president of the United States. ""My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win,"" Assange said. ""Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment. Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc., are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves."" Assange's analysis might have been self-serving, but it was widely shared. Among all the reasons why Clinton lost the presidency, there was a radical asymmetry between the information known about her and the information known about Donald Trump. The Republican became the first candidate in 40 years to run without releasing his tax returns, and the first to win. Clinton, meanwhile, faced years of document releases from Freedom of Information Act Requests, FOIA lawsuits, congressional subpoenas, the release of documents from the FBI investigation into her use of a private server, and not one but two hacks of her campaign apparatus. The result, against Clinton's best wishes, was that more voters knew about the inner workings of her campaign, and her State Department, than had been known about any candidate in history. According to the national exit poll, just 36 percent of voters considered Clinton ""honest and trustworthy."" (Thirty-three percent said the same of Trump.) Sixty-three percent of voters said they were bothered by Clinton's use of a private email server, even though the ironic result of that mistake was that fewer emails were subject to classification than might have been on a state.gov account. By contrast, Trump got through the campaign without revealing his wealth. The closest he came was after a still-unidentified source revealed one year's return to the New York Times, showing him taking on a loss of nearly $1 billion. But while leaks and releases about Clinton's record fed story lines, the tax return story churned through two weeks, then was subsumed by other Trump stories. The fade was dramatized in late October, when Bloomberg's Mark Halperin -- who had said that Trump needed to be asked about the taxes in every interview -- interviewed Trump and did not ask about the taxes. Until Donald Trump, no one had been elected president of the United States without a background in politics, the military, or both. There is, obviously, no FOIA for a privately held corporation's records. Trump effectively hacked the system, while Clinton constantly faced questions about information legally or illegally obtained -- speeches to banks, angry emails about her family foundation, embarrassing exchanges from inside her State Department. Last week, between FBI Director James B. Comey's announcement of a new email investigation and his announcement that nothing had turned up, Vice News reporter Jason Leopold wrote a first-person piece about his own legal quest for Clinton's emails. It would be, he thought, ""the best way to inform the public what a Clinton presidency would look like."" It turned into a scandal that defined her campaign. ""Vice News' attempt to arm the public with information about Clinton's work was understandably drowned out by the noise surrounding her use of a private email server and her shifting explanations about why she used it,"" wrote Leopold. ""In all honesty, I'm not thrilled -- my original goal, to provide voters with more information about what a Clinton presiden[cy] might look like, has been accomplished."" But now, there will be no Clinton presidency. Part of the reason is her original decision to use her family's server. Part of it was due to an aide's inability to see that an email from ""Google"" was intended to hack an account. Clinton and Trump, however, shared a desire to keep as much of their information secret as possible. Trump got away with it; Clinton did not."
