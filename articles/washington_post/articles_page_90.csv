(Emily Heil/The Washington Post)  The White House will always be Washington's most impressive address, but in a Trump administration, there's another spot with plenty of cachet: the Capitol Hill rowhouse known as the ""Breitbart Embassy."" The stately mansion located near the Supreme Court holds offices sometimes used by the right-wing media organization -- which was (is? the ties are still unclear) led by Stephen K. Bannon, the top campaign aide to President-elect Donald Trump who was named the incoming president's chief strategist and senior counselor. According to one person with knowledge of how the house is used, it isn't typically the site of the media organization's day-to-day operations, but Bannon would often hold team meetings around its elegant dining table. Work aside, the brick dwelling also functions as a party house for the city's conservative class. Annual soirees include those timed near the Conservative Political Action Committee's conference and the White House Correspondents' Association's glitzy dinner, plus the odd book party celebrating a conservative author. Many of the festivities at the formally decorated (think ornate chandeliers, swag curtains and oil paintings) venue are extravagant affairs: the 2014 CPAC party featured ""speakeasy"" theme, along with a 17-piece swing band, free-flowing champagne and cigar rollers. A rightward tilt isn't essential to make it on the guest list, which often includes members of the benighted ""liberal media."" Such party-hosting is central to the house's mission, Bannon told us at the time. ""Andrew said that if you didn't have a place within spitting distance of the Capitol, no one would come,"" he said, referring to Andrew Breitbart, the media company's late founder. ""He loved to throw big parties."" In addition to offices in the carriage house and the basement, there are living quarters there, and Bannon reportedly uses the upper levels of the four-bedroom residence as his Washington crash pad. According to D.C. property records, the house is owned by Moustafa el Gindy, a former member of the Egyptian parliament who is now a member of the country's opposition party. It has long been unclear what, if any, his relationship is with the Breitbart crew, other than that of landlord. And now that Bannon has secured the ear of the incoming president, Washington's social watchers expect to see the ""embassy"" parties become an even hotter ticket. Breitbart reps did not respond to requests for comments about their house and their social plans, but some GOP partyers are already looking ahead to inauguration weekend, when traditionally, the incoming president's party revels all over the city."

(John Roark/Athens Banner-Herald via AP)  In the days following the election, university campuses across the country erupted in rallies and marches. College counselors offered ""healing spaces"" and meditation sessions to help students cope with postelection trauma. Some professors even canceled classes or allowed students to opt out of tests. One lawmaker in Iowa says he finds this ""whole hysteria to be incredibly annoying."" Bobby Kaufmann, a Republican, plans to introduce a bill that echoes the eye-rolling frustration expressed by many who think colleges are ""coddling"" their students. He's referring to the piece of legislation as the ""suck it up, buttercup"" bill and he hopes to introduce it when the legislature resumes in January, the Des Moines Register reported.  The bill would take aim at state universities that offer election-related sit-ins and grief counseling beyond the resources normally available to students. Those colleges that use taxpayer dollars to fund these extra programs would be subject to a budget cut for double the amount they spend. Kaufmann said he had heard of four or five schools in other states that were staffing grief counselors in zones where ""kids can come cry out their sensitivity."" ""People have the right to be hysterical,"" Kaufmann said. ""On their own time."" The legislation would also create new criminal penalties for protesters who shut down highways, Kaufmann told the Des Moines Register. Kaufmann, who is serving in his second term in the Iowa House, is a crop and livestock farmer who works on his family's eight-generation farm. He lives in Wilton, Iowa, a town about an hour southeast of Cedar Rapids. He operates a steel-hauling, construction and demolition business and is a member of the Farm Bureau and National Rifle Association, among other groups, according to a biography on the Iowa House Republicans website.  A number of public colleges in Iowa held events to help students discuss and deal with the election results. But at least three of those -- Iowa State University, the University of Iowa and the University of Northern Iowa -- confirmed they are not spending any additional state resources to run the programs, the Des Moines Register reported. ""I think universities are the perfect place to have these types of conversations,"" said Scott Ketelsen, director of university relations at the University of Northern Iowa. ""It's where people learn. It's where they share ideas. I don't consider it coddling."" The Iowa lawmaker's idea for the bill received mixed reactions on Twitter:   YES! Lawmaker drops the HAMMER on colleges coddling election crybabies&#8230; https://t.co/Ny6wAEUCeq via @ALLENWESTARMY Bobby Kaufmann -- Iowa Minute Man (@RandyMillam) November 14, 2016     @desmoinesdem Politics aside, how sad and just plain mean. -- Austin Frerick (@AFrerick) November 15, 2016   On Tuesday, a day after the Des Moines Register reported on Kaufmann's plans, the University of Iowa took to Twitter to encourage students to call counseling services if they were seeking any sort of help.   We are a caring community that values compassion, inclusion, respect, and dignity. #uiowa pic.twitter.com/PgmL853vz2 -- University of Iowa (@uiowa) November 16, 2016   Kaufmann's plans followed a debate over the extent to which college campuses should provide additional resources -- or exemptions -- to help students cope with what some see as emotional postelection trauma. At the University of Michigan at Flint, students were informed of counseling services in three separate emails over a span of five hours. At the University of California at San Diego, a three-hour ""Talk It Out"" event gave students the opportunity to hash out their feelings with a doctor with Counseling and Psychological Services, the College Fix reported.  And a note posted on Facebook and Twitter the morning after the election by Purdue University's student government president incited a slew of negative comments. The Purdue Student Gov account tweeted a template note that ""grieving"" students could send to a professor to request an extension, cancellation or excused absence for that day's assignment. ""This is an instance in which I feel I need to take time for myself to heal after what was a traumatic evening last night,"" the note template wrote. The president later apologized. A sophomore at Duke University posted a similar draft email in the All Duke Facebook page. Responses to the note from Purdue's Student Government called it ""intensely pathetic"" and told students to ""grow up."" ""Poor little snowflakes. Run to your safespaces. Life didn't go your way,"" one comment wrote. In light of this dialogue, and of an article in The Washington Post about postelection shock among Yale University students, one economics professor at Yale retorted that his students ""don't melt."" The professor, Steven Berry, said the day after the election, he allowed his students to choose to opt out of the second midterm for personal reasons and transfer the weight of the exam entirely onto the final exam. While some of his students did email him expressing fear of personal consequences as a result of the election, almost all the students showed up for the test the following day. ""It was hard and most students took the full 75 minutes,"" Berry wrote. ""No crying, no whining, no excuses."" The Iowa lawmaker also criticized some of the protests and rallies that took place across the state and country in the days after the election. He called out protesters who closed Interstate Highway 80 in Iowa City during a rally against President-elect Donald Trump last week. Kaufmann said he plans to establish a law enforcement task force to consider options on how to address the issue and create tougher criminal penalties for those who disturb traffic. Officers now could potentially charge protesters with certain violations, but Kaufmann said many have told him they'd like clarity on the issue, the Des Moines Register reported. ""I have no issue with protesting,"" he said. ""In fact, I would go to political war for anyone who wanted to protest or dissent and they couldn't. But you can't exercise your constitutional right by trampling on someone else's.""

"   In this Jan. 31, 2016, file photo, Pastor Joshua Nink, right, prays for Donald Trump, as his wife, Melania, left, watches after a Sunday service at First Christian Church, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. (AP/Jae C. Hong)  Every four or eight years, after the nation goes through the ritual of picking a president, some of Washington's churches go through another ritual -- getting a president to pick them. When Bill and Hillary Clinton came to town in 1993, preachers from Baptist (his denomination) and Methodist (hers) churches across town picked up their phones and their pens to invite the new first couple to their pews. After hearing from at least half a dozen congregations, the Clintons picked Foundry United Methodist Church on 16th Street NW, where they became active members. George W. Bush, like Ronald Reagan before him, opted for the convenience of St. John's Episcopal Church, just across from the White House. Ministers from numerous denominations tried to woo the Obamas, but the first family never picked one church, instead visiting many churches over the course of their eight years in the White House. And now it's time to ask: Will President Trump go to church in Washington? It may not be likely. Trump has previously been affiliated with Presbyterian churches, and he identifies as a mainline Protestant, but he is not a regular churchgoer.   [Hopeful and relieved, white evangelicals see Trump's win as their own]        Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told conservative pastors in Florida, Aug. 11, that if he's elected, they will ""have great power."" Trump pledged to take on a law that bars tax-exempt organizations from getting involved in political campaigns. (The Washington Post)   Still, The Washington Post emailed or called all 16 churches in the District affiliated with Presbyterian Church (USA), the largest mainline Presbyterian denomination, to find out: Is the same sort of jockeying going on to get this president into the pews? In short: No. One minister of one of the denomination's churches closest to the White House responded to The Post's inquiry, ""Are you kidding?"" When a reporter replied that in fact the question was quite earnest, the minister then said that, come to think of it, he would send Trump a letter of invitation. Presbyterian Church (USA) is a liberal-leaning denomination that has embraced same-sex marriage. Several of these churches in the District are led by female clergy, and several have black clergy and predominantly black communities as well as members from other racial minorities. Some are located in neighborhoods east of the Anacostia where Washington's politicians rarely venture. And of course, all of them are located in the District, where more than 92 percent of voters last week voted for Hillary Clinton instead of Trump.   [This Indiana church was defaced with 'Heil Trump' graffiti -- and decided to keep it]        Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump attended service at Great Faith International Ministries in Detroit, Mich., in an appeal to African American voters. It's the first time Trump has visited a black church during his campaign. (The Washington Post)   The response from most of these churches was essentially: Trump will be very welcome, if he thinks a church like this is his cup of tea.  Capitol Hill Presbyterian's Rev. Scott Wilson: ""Our doors are open to everyone to worship with us and listen to the words of Jesus on love and compassion. Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church is a welcoming and inclusive church, and our doors are always open to anyone who wishes to join us in our community exploring faith, joyfully sustained by the love of God, caring about each other, and the needs of a broken world.""   Fifteenth Street Presbyterian's Rev. Robert Bell: ""I think Mr Trump would be welcome at any Presbyterian Church USA in the city. I know he, like everyone is, would be welcome at ours. He doesn't seem like the type of guy that finds the gospel challenging and meaningful or likes to rub elbows with a diverse group, not all [of whom] are materially successful. But God works in mysterious ways.""   Georgetown Presbyterian's Rev. Camille Cook Murray: ""We have not reached out to Donald Trump. Our congregation is a politically diverse church, unified by our common faith in Jesus Christ. ... Our community is open and welcome to all so yes, if Donald felt called to join our church then he would be welcome.""   National Presbyterian's Rev. David Renwick: ""National Presbyterian has a long legacy of serving presidents, appointed officials, and elected officials on both sides of the aisle, as well as those who serve our nation in both military and civilian capacities. This is clearly a tradition we want to honor and carry forward -- and therefore we warmly welcome our president-elect to join with us in worship. ... With regard to membership -- membership is open to any person who knows their need of a savior, who places their trust in Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, and who commits to be faithful in worshiping and serving God together.""   New York Avenue Presbyterian's Rev. Roger Gench: ""We would, of course, invite the President-Elect to worship with us.  Our logo declares that we are a 'just-seeking and inclusive church,' so we welcome people from varied points of view, race, and sexual orientation."" Sixth Presbyterian's Rev. Edward Taylor: ""I actually did think about sending the Trumps a letter of invitation to our church, but I'm not going to do it. For one thing, I have done it in the past, and I don't think it gets the president to your church.... Of course, anytime you can have the president come to your church that would be wonderful. But, in this case, well, no.""  Bell and Gench said they would probably send Trump a letter to welcome him in writing. This article has been updated.

Luckily for Netflix, fans won’t care.	"       Where is Lane's dad? Why don't Lorelai and Rory ever pay for their food? Perhaps these questions will be answered in the ""Gilmore Girls"" revival coming to Netflix. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)      Let's cut right to the chase, ""Gilmore Girls"" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Conn. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters.  The bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag -- and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating. The best news: Fans won't care. Because ""Gilmore Girls"" is back.   ['Gilmore Girls' revival: How a TV reboot goes from idea to reality]  Although television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like ""Gilmore Girls,"" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the ""real"" ending.      As ""Gilmore Girls"" heads to Netflix for a reboot, here are a few things you can expect in the show's return. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)   As someone who has re-watched ""Gilmore Girls"" more times than I care to admit, hitting ""play"" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of ""Gilmore Girls"" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series?  I'll be honest -- it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or . . . any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements.  But here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. ***     Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop) with Lorelai and Rory. (Robert Voets/Netflix)     Luke (Scott Patterson) laying down the law at his diner. (Saeed Adyani/Netflix)    Viewers get swept back into the all-consuming ""Gilmore"" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year.  The theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory -- the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent -- she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Although theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series, it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (""I heard. You should become a blacksmith,"" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future.  ['Gilmore Girls' on Netflix: A refresher (and rating) on each season]  Lorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren't all smooth sailing -- even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss.  Threaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years.  She's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: ""Luke."" Luke: ""Yes?"" Emily: ""That was just my way of saying goodbye."") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016.  In the years since ""Gilmore Girls"" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show's  lack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same -- and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. ""Body shaming! Trigger warnings!"" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. ""War on Christmas!"" ***    Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), Lane (Keiko Agena) and Rory at a town festival during ""Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life."" (Saeed Adyani/Netflix)  One of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch ""Gilmore Girls"" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time -- and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. All the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. This could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute ""Gilmore Girls"" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting.  Not only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer.  Then again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. That's the one benefit of a ""Gilmore Girls"" mini-movie -- with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every ""Gilmore"" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway.   Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (four episodes) begins streaming Friday, Nov. 25, on Netflix. "

Sheriff Joe Arpaio said Friday he has been humbled by calls from supporters who bemoaned his loss Tuesday to Paul Penzone, a little-known retired Phoenix police sergeant.  ""I am not going to say I let them down,"" Arpaio told The Associated Press. ""It's just sad to see me go."" The 84-year-old will end his tenure as Phoenix's top law enforcer with a racial profiling verdict that discredited his immigration patrols and a criminal contempt-of-court charge against him for prolonging the patrols 17 months after a judge ordered them stopped. Arpaio remains unapologetic in his decision 10 years ago to take on illegal immigration, despite the $48 million in taxpayer-funded legal costs from the profiling case and the misdemeanor charge that could expose him to up to six months in jail if he's convicted. Other police bosses were happy to leave the onerous duties of immigration enforcement to the federal government. But Arpaio said he had a duty to enforce laws passed by the Arizona Legislature, including one that barred immigrant smuggling.  ""I am not going to say I am sorry. We did our job,"" the sheriff said, adding that he is the ""trophy for Hispanic groups coming after me."" In the end, courts stripped away Arpaio's immigration powers two years ago, and his role in the immigration debate since has consisted of speaking out publicly against federal border policies. Lydia Guzman, a Latino civil rights advocate and longtime Arpaio critic, said the sheriff's claim that he has no regrets about targeting immigrants doesn't ring true.  ""He is trying to play the martyr,"" Guzman said. ""I think that deep down inside, at some point, he probably realizes his immigration enforcement was his demise. That's what got him in trouble."" Arpaio has acknowledged disobeying the judge's order in the racial profiling case, but insisted the violation was unintentional. His trial is scheduled for Dec. 6. He has faced other challenges in his bid for a seventh term. The sheriff, who raised $12 million in campaign cash mostly from people living in other states, said he didn't expect liberal hedge-fund tycoon George Soros to give $2.3 million to a group that ran a TV commercial questioning Arpaio's reputation for being tough on criminals. Arpaio also blamed the U.S. Justice Department for announcing a day before early voting began in Arizona that it planned to prosecute him in a criminal contempt case. The sheriff said he believes he will be remembered for his tough jail policies, such as dressing inmates in pink underwear and jailing them in Tent City, a complex of canvas tents where prisoners are housed during Phoenix's triple-digit summer heat. Still, he realizes his successor could eliminate those fixtures. Penzone has said he is open to the idea of closing Tent City and that he regards the pink underwear as a publicity stunt.  ""If someone else wants a change, it doesn't bother me at all,"" Arpaio said. He said he could have retired without seeking re-election, but he wanted to remain on the job -- and he doesn't regret seeking re-election.  ""I wanted to keep going for the next four years,"" Arpaio said. ""It wasn't in the cards."" ___ Follow Jacques Billeaud at twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud.

The sophomore forward had career highs of 18 points and 12 rebounds as the Demon Deacons defeated Radford 80-59 in the season opener Friday night.    ""I feel I came out with a solid start to my sophomore campaign,"" Collins said. ""Statistically, it says it is my best game.""    Devin Thomas was a four-year player for Wake Forest and often helped control the lane. He has moved on, so Collins said he understands the importance of picking up the slack.    ""There's no DT any more to get those tenacious rebounds,"" Collins said. ""Somebody needs to fill that void.""    Collins, who made 7 of 11 shots from the field, had plenty of help. Keyshawn Woods scored nine points in the first 12 minutes of the second half on his way to 14 points in his Wake Forest debut.    Bryant Crawford also added 14 points and eight assists for the Demon Deacons, though he went down with what he later described as a foot cramp after a dunk with less than two minutes to play.    Wake Forest shot 62.5 percent from the field in the second half. At the other end, the Demon Deacons racked up 10 blocked shots, contributing to Radford's 35.8-percent shooting from the field.    ""I thought we played hard enough to win the game for the majority of the game,"" Radford coach Mike Jones said. ""As the game wore on, I thought their size really affected us. I thought it took a toll on us in the second half. I thought we got a little tired.""    Ed Polite Jr. paced Radford with 11 points.     Woods, a redshirt sophomore who sat out last season after transferring from Charlotte, scored all but three of his points in the second half. He made consecutive jumpers as part of a personal 5-0 run as the Demon Deacons built a 56-39 edge.     Wake Forest coach Danny Manning liked what Woods provided.    ""He's kind of a jack-of-all-trades for us,"" Manning said. ""We're very happy that he's out there on the court with us.""    Wake Forest held several 11-point leads in the first half, but led 36-28 at the break.    ""Still there were moments in the game we could have put them away earlier,"" Crawford said.   The Demon Deacons came into the season touting improved perimeter shooting and the game's first basket was a 3-pointer by graduate transfer Austin Arians. But by the end of the half, they were 3 of 12 on 3s.    Radford sputtered offensively early, shooting 2-for-15 from the field in the first 10 1/2 minutes.    ""We were not in sync. They disrupted our flow,"" Jones said. ""We got some good looks and didn't capitalize and I think a lot of that was their defense.""  BIG PICTURE Radford: The Highlanders had seven seniors on last year's team, leaving only fourth-year junior guard Justin Cousin and sophomore forward Ed Polite Jr. as primary returners. They combined for 14 points in the opener. The Highlanders couldn't repeat the type of result they earned in last year's opener when they notched a triple-overtime triumph at Georgetown. Wake Forest: Wake Forest opened the season with a home game for the 13th year in a row, stretching its first-game winning streak to six seasons.  UP NEXT Wake Forest is back in action Sunday at home against Bucknell before heading to the Charleston Classic for three games next week. Radford plays its lone home game among its first seven games when Central Penn visits Wednesday. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hogan (R) endorsed a handful of Republican congressional candidates, none of whom came close to winning their races in the heavily Democratic state. And he very publicly refused to vote for Donald Trump, his party's presidential nominee, who lost Maryland by a large margin but stunned the country with an upset victory. Maryland Democrats, still reeling from Hogan's 2014 win and soaring approval ratings, were thrilled that the governor's slate lost by large margins -- although Senate candidate Kathy Szeliga and House candidate Aime Hoeber secured more votes than initially expected. Szeliga lost the Senate seat being vacated by Barbara A. Mikulski (D) to Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D), capturing 36 percent of the vote to Van Hollen's 60 percent. Hoeber lost to Rep. John Delaney (D) by 15 percentage points.  [See full Maryland election results]  ""We saw Maryland Democrats who were enthused about their candidates, and they came out and voted for them,"" said Charles R. Connor, executive director of the Maryland Democratic Party. ""We think there is a chink in [Hogan's] armor."" Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, said GOP candidates may have been hurt by appearing on the same ballot as Trump, who was broadly unpopular in the state. ""If you don't have a good top to your ticket, the down-ballot races are really affected,"" Cluster said. ""We won't have that problem in 2018, with Larry Hogan at the top of the ticket."" A recent poll by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland poll found that Hogan has a 71 percent approval rating, including heavy support among white Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who were key to his surprise 2014 victory. Some Democrats speculated that Hogan's disavowal of Trump through this campaign might affect the governor's relationship with the base of his state party, many of whom did support the GOP White House nominee. ""I see Larry Hogan in the middle of a vise grip,"" state Sen. Richard Madaleno Jr. (D-Montgomery) said as he watched election results Tuesday night. ""He ran away from their presidential nominee . . . one who talks about a fondness for revenge . . . It puts him in a very weakened spot.""  [Maryland governor is keeping his distance from state GOP]   But Todd Eberly, who is a political-science professor at St. Mary's College, said Tuesday's results -- including big wins for Trump in rural parts of the state -- are a mixed bag for Maryland politicians.  Eberly said there were ""warning signs"" for Democrats, including that they continue to lose -- ""and not narrowly"" -- entire segments of the state. ""Looking at 2018, nothing in the results says that Hogan has something to be concerned about,"" Eberly said. A the same time, he added, the fact that there will be a Republican in the White House could pose reelection challenges for the governor. ""First midterm elections of a new administration are generally bad for the party,"" Eberly said. ""The first victims typically are Republicans in blue states or Democrats in red states, and Hogan is the governor of one of the bluest states. He is going to have to contend with that reality."" Hogan spokesman Doug Mayer said the governor is ""proud of the candidates and proud of the races they ran . . . [The governor's] focus is on Maryland, doing what he has done since he got here, working for all Marylanders."" Hogan issued a statement on Wednesday congratulating Trump and pledging to work with his administration to ""find real solutions to the problems we face as a country."" Mayer said the governor reached out directly on Wednesday to Vice President-elect Mike Pence and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a friend and ally. Hogan backed Christie (R) at the start of the 2016 campaign, raising money and campaigning for him during the GOP primary in New Hampshire.  [Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan voted for his dad for president]   After Christie left the race and endorsed Trump, Hogan pronounced himself ""disgusted with national politics"" and said he would not pick another candidate to support publicly. In June, the governor said that he would vote for neither Trump nor Hillary Clinton, saying he did not ""think either party put up its best candidate."" On Tuesday, he said he wrote in the name of his father, Larry Hogan Sr., a former member of Congress from Maryland and Prince George's county executive.  Josh Hicks contributed to this report. "

State Department spokesman Mark Toner on Monday urged the Chinese and Hong Kong governments to refrain from actions that ""undermine confidence"" in the so-called one-country two-systems principle -- under which Hong Kong retains a separate economic and political system from the communist-governed Chinese mainland until 2047. Toner said an open society with the highest possible degree of autonomy and government by rule of law ""is essential for Hong Kong's continued stability and prosperity."" The dispute centers on two newly elected pro-independence lawmakers who altered their oaths of office. China's top legislative panel ruled Monday that those who advocate Hong Kong independence are disqualified from becoming lawmakers. ____ 7 p.m. A political science expert in Hong Kong says China's move to intervene in a Hong Kong political dispute amounted to the ""strongest message yet"" from China that Beijing would not tolerate serious talk of independence. Linda Li, political science professor at City University of Hong Kong, said Monday the vast majority of Hong Kong residents do not favor breaking away from China but are instead frustrated with governance issues that have stretched on for years. Li says if Beijing retains a relatively restrained tone in the next few days and leaves the matter in the hands of Hong Kong's authorities, ""it would help cool down the tension."" She urged the government to ""limit the damage"" and refrain from prosecuting the two lawmakers. ___ 1:50 p.m. Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, says he will implement a Chinese legislative panel's ruling that bars two democratically elected separatist lawmakers from taking office in Hong Kong. Leung told reporters Monday that the duo from the radical Youngspiration party ""deliberately violated the oath-taking procedure and content requirements of the oath."" He said, ""They even insulted the country and the Chinese people in their words and deeds in the oath taking as well as advocating Hong Kong independence. Their conduct has caused widespread indignation in Hong Kong and across the country."" He said that Beijing's ""interpretation has clarified that any oath taken in a manner that is not sincere or solemn is considered a decline to take the oath and that oath taken is rendered invalid."" Therefore, he said, that person is disqualified. ___ 12:55 p.m. A top mainland Chinese official has delivered an emotional rebuke of two Hong Kong lawmakers who used a derogatory term about China, labeling them traitors to the Chinese people. The pair had referred to China during their swearing-in ceremony with an old-fashioned derogatory Japanese term for the country. Li Fei, deputy secretary general of China's top legislative panel, said Monday that the comments amounted to an intentional smear against all Chinese. Li said, ""All traitors who sell out our country will never meet good ends."" He also recounted Japanese World War II atrocities in Hong Kong in graphic detail, telling of nurses raped and bodies bayoneted and tossed into the city's harbor.  ""Those who witnessed the atrocities may be dead, but the children must never forget Chinese history,"" Li said. ___ 12:45 p.m. An independent pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong says Beijing is making a ""needless intervention"" into a political dispute in Hong Kong because the city's courts could have handled the situation. Eddie Chu said Monday that Beijing was trying to create rhetoric about the independence movement to ""threaten the movement of, particularly, young people in seeking self-determination."" The dispute stems from two recently elected Hong Kong lawmakers, Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching, altering their oaths last month to insert a disparaging Japanese term for China. Chu said the two lawmakers were the first victims in this ""new legal net."" Chu, Leung and Yau were among a group of pro-democracy candidates elected for the first time in September who advocate greater autonomy for Hong Kong. ___ 11:35 a.m. A top Chinese legislative panel's ruling on an article in Hong Kong's mini-constitution says individuals are barred from assuming office if they fail to ""lawfully and validly"" take their oaths. The ruling -- described as an ""interpretation"" of Hong Kong's Basic Law -- says an oath-taker shall be treated as declining to take their oath if he or she ""intentionally reads out words which do not accord with the wording of the oath prescribed by law"" or ""is not sincere or not solemn."" At their swearing-in ceremony last month, two recently elected Hong Kong lawmakers, Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching, altered their oaths to insert a disparaging Japanese term for China. Displaying a flag reading ""Hong Kong is not China,"" they vowed to defend the ""Hong Kong nation."" ___ 11 a.m. A Chinese spokesman of the top legislative panel that has moved to bar two democratically elected separatist lawmakers from taking office in Hong Kong says the central government will not be weak in the face of advocates for independence for Hong Kong. Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, told reporters at a briefing in Beijing: ""The center's attitude is absolute. There will be no leniency."" Li warned against politicians advocating for Hong Kong's independence from the mainland, saying that in future young people should better understand the central government's requirements for governing the former British colony. Li says public officials' oaths are ""solemn"" and that oaths that do not conform to legal requirements cannot be taken again. ___ 9:55 a.m. China's top legislature has adopted an interpretation of an article in Hong Kong's mini-constitution on oath-taking, effectively intervening in a political dispute in the southern Chinese city despite protests there on Sunday. The dispute centers on a provocative display of anti-China sentiment by two newly elected pro-independence Hong Kong lawmakers at their swearing-in ceremony last month. In issuing the interpretation, the National People's Congress Standing Committee said talk of independence for Hong Kong is intended to ""divide the country"" and severely harms the country's unity, territorial sovereignty and national security. The interpretation says that those who advocate for independence for Hong Kong are not only disqualified from election and from assuming posts as lawmakers but should also be investigated for their legal obligations.

(Jonathan Drake/Reuters)   With Breanne Deppisch: THE BIG IDEA: CARY, N.C.--Richard Burr, the senior Republican senator from North Carolina, knows how closely his fortunes are tied to Donald Trump at this point. In a state where the GOP presidential nominee is running neck and neck with Hillary Clinton, he's stuck with him. Last night he campaigned with Mike Pence. ""There's not a separation between me and Donald Trump,"" Burr told a group of party activists recently. Like 2016 in miniature, Trump has sucked up all the oxygen and allowed Democrats to turn several Senate races into referendums on him. As a result, a lawmaker like Burr finds himself vulnerable in a year when he did not expect to. The 60-year-old, once a football star at Wake Forest, has been in Congress since 1994. He could lose to Deborah Ross, a former state legislator and the onetime state director of the ACLU. The final Quinnipiac poll of North Carolina, published this morning, shows the Senate race tied (47 percent to 47 percent) and Clinton leading in the presidential race by two points (47 percent to 45 percent). Ross said in an interview that she can imagine any of the four possible scenarios playing out tomorrow. Trump could win the state narrowly and pull Burr across the finish line. Or Trump could win, and she could still beat Burr (she said she's met several people in rural areas who support Trump and her). Clinton could win the state, and that could get her across. Or Burr, because of split-ticket voting, could narrowly hold on. ""I think all scenarios are possible in a situation where races are close,"" she explained, adding that she tries not to think about it. An adviser to Burr said he has been working to win over some later ticket-splitters in the suburbs around Charlotte and Raleigh, like this one, and expressed hope that the incumbent will prevail even if Trump narrowly loses the Tar Heel State. If Senate Democrats win North Carolina, they will almost certainly get back their majority after two years in the wilderness.    Richard Burr and Deborah Ross square off in the Research Triangle at their final debate. (Gerry Broome/AP/Pool)   -- Bigger picture: I spoke yesterday with 20 strategists and operatives who are closely involved in the battle for the Senate, both nationally and in the states. It was an even mix of Republicans and Democrats. I granted them all anonymity to encourage candor. What follows are the most interesting points and predictions that emerged from these interviews, with the important stipulation that any of it could wind up being wrong. The 2016 cycle has shown the shortcomings of conventional wisdom, and a big surprise somewhere is totally conceivable. -- Every person I talked with presupposes that Hillary Clinton will win the presidency, even though the race has tightened. That means Democrats need to pick up four seats because Vice President Tim Kaine would be the tie breaking vote. -- Both sides are girding themselves for what they expect will be a very late night, but the conventional wisdom is that it is more likely than not that Democrats net at least four. Reflecting the high stakes, a study out this weekend showed that more than $532 million has now been spent by outside groups on Senate ads in the general election. -- Republicans say that they've done remarkably well at staying in the game, considering what a debacle Trump could have caused down the ballot. One GOP power player likened the party to a football team that's playing on the road and down a touchdown with two minutes left in the fourth quarter. Despite everything that's gone wrong in the previous 58 minutes - injuries, turnovers, penalties - they could still find a way to get to the end zone. (Political operatives favor sports and war analogies.)    Ron Johnson, left, and Eric Trump, right, campaigned together in Eau Claire. (Dan Reiland/The Eau Claire Leader-Telegram via AP)   -- Democrats have multiple paths to 50: Everyone agrees that Republican Sen. Mark Kirk will lose in Illinois, a guaranteed pick-up. Ron Johnson has made late strides in Wisconsin after being written off for months. National Democrats stopped running negative ads against him for nearly a month, which allowed the race to tighten. For a stretch, Trump was also spending in Wisconsin and Clinton was dark, which helped. Democrat Russ Feingold is not as good a candidate as he once was, but he is still ultimately expected to narrowly win the rematch. The modeling shows there just are not enough votes for the Republican. ""It's just not in the cards for RonJohn,"" said a Republican.    FBI Director James Comey makes his initial announcement about Clinton on July 5. (Cliff Owen/AP)   -- Jim Comey's latest bombshell announcement, clearing the former secretary of state of criminal wrongdoing (once again), helps Democrats the most in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Neither state has early voting, so no ballots have been banked. The GOP incumbents in both places have emphasized the argument that they should get reelected to be a check and balance on Clinton. The news that the FBI is not going to pursue the email matter further may energize some Democrats who are lukewarm about their nominee while also convincing independents who have been contemplating split-ticket voting to support the Democratic challenger. (Much more on the Comey news below...)    Hillary Clinton meets casino workers at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas last week with Senate Democratic candidate Catherine Cortez Masto. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- Most Republicans have lost hope in Nevada, a place where their candidate Joe Heck led in polls for much of the year. The early voting numbers look pretty bad for the GOP, especially with a spike in Latino turnout. Harry Reid's machine, which I wrote about recently, got its people out. Heck has been unable to stake out a clear position on Trump, which cost him some base support and accelerated the slippage. Catherine Cortez Masto is poised to become the country's first Latina senator.    Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) talks with reporters after the weekly Republican Senate policy luncheon this spring. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)   -- Missouri, Indiana and North Carolina are coin flips. Republicans say they feel better about holding the Tar Heel State than they do the Show Me State. -- Roy Blunt and Evan Bayh, two guys who have come to epitomize everything that voters hate about Washington, might both go down. Though from different parties, they are consummate insiders in the year of the outsider.  Trump should win Missouri by a pretty solid margin, which could help Blunt pull it out. Some GOP operatives are actually a little nervous that if The Donald expands the electorate too much it will actually hurt Blunt. There is a fairly sizable universe of low-propensity ""Trump, not Blunt"" voters who will vote for the GOP presidential nominee and the Democratic Senate candidate because they want to reject the status quo. (Blunt's wife and kids are all lobbyists, and he's never effectively pushed back on ads about his votes to raise his own pay and his posh mansion in Washington.) Jason Kander, Missouri's secretary of state, has run a great campaign and released the best commercial of the cycle (the one where he built a rifle blindfolded). But he remains relatively unknown and does not have the built-up institutional goodwill of someone like Bayh, which has made it easier four outside spending to drive up his negatives.    Evan Bayh thanks volunteers at his field office in Indianapolis. (Michael Conroy/AP)   -- Evan Bayh was heavily favored when he jumped into the race in July, but the ex-senator has not had a good news cycle since then. The GOP feels supremely confident he will lose tomorrow (despite polls showing it close and Democrats expressing hope). Republicans masterfully caricatured Birch's boy as an out-of-touch D.C. influence peddler who has spent little time in the state. His leaked Senate schedule was full of damning revelations about his close ties to Wall Street. The latest oppo hit is that Bayh stayed in a Marriott using taxpayer money, instead of staying in his tiny condo nearby, when he came back to Indianapolis at the end of his last term. Bayh says he will reimburse the government. ""He's kind of like the Jeb Bush of Senate candidates,"" said a Republican who worked to define him. ""The political world has moved on, and he didn't keep up with the times."" Bayh could win because of the strength of his family name, but he's the only Democrat in the country who needs a sizable number of Trump supporters to cross over to vote for him. If Trump wins the Hoosier State bigly, and remember Pence is the governor of Indiana, there may not be enough. One poll published Friday put Republican Todd Young ahead by 5 points. -- Pat Toomey will probably not survive if Trump loses Pennsylvania by more than five points, but he still could find a way to hold on. One GOP operative said it will be ""surprising but not shocking"" if the freshman wins, no matter Trump's margin. The Republican has known since narrowly winning in the wave year of 2010 that he'd have a hard time surviving with presidential-level turnout, and he's acted accordingly. His closing ad highlights his support for tougher gun laws after the Sandy Hook massacre and features a clip of Barack Obama praising him three years ago. This prompted the president to issue a weekend statement slamming him. The senator has never endorsed Trump and still won't say who he is voting for, afraid to alienate Donald's supporters. During a cringe-worthy interview last Thursday, for instance, he was asked 10 times by the Philadelphia Fox affiliated who he'd be voting for. And he became deeply exasperated. (Amber Phillips posted the transcript. Click below for the video.)  WATCH: GOP incumbent Sen. Toomey refuses to answer question on #Fox29GoodDay - will he vote for @realDonaldTrump ? https://t.co/ZPAblPhJbw-- FOX 29 (@FOX29philly) November 3, 2016   Right now, Toomey is over-performing his target numbers in the Philadelphia media market (by resonating with suburban moderates who loathe Trump) and underperforming his targets out-state (where Trump is running pretty strong). But the Democratic emphasis on Philly during the final five days - the Obamas and the Clintons are holding a blowout rally tonight on Independence Square with Bruce Springsteen - may juice African American turnout enough to break the GOP modeling that gets him to victory. Republicans get hope from the fact that Rick Santorum and Arlen Specter won reelection even as their party's presidential nominee lost.    Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan shake hands following their final debate last Wednesday in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/Jim Cole, Pool)   -- Trump's improved standing in New Hampshire has benefited Kelly Ayotte, but she can probably outrun him by no more than five points (depending on who you ask). Republicans are cautiously optimistic and believe that Trump supporters have come home after temporarily defecting when she repudiated Trump over the now infamous 2005 video (just days after calling him a ""role model""). The most amazing dynamic in the Granite State might be how static the race has been. After more than $100 million has been spent, the polls look remarkably similar to how they did on the day that Gov. Maggie Hassan, the Democrat, jumped in.  -- In a lot of these tight races, a superior and more coordinated Democratic ground game could be good for one to three points. New Hampshire's same-day voter registration, for instance, will allow the Clinton campaign to lock in a lot of lower-propensity voters from places like Hanover, home of Dartmouth, tomorrow. And a lot of Republicans are privately dubious of recent polling showing Trump as strong as he is, in part because they don't think some of his core voters will actually show up.    Tim Kaine stumps for HRC in Pittsburgh. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- Three different tip-top Republicans separately predicted a 50-50 split, which would mean that Chuck Schumer becomes majority leader. That would also mean that a 2017 Senate race next year's Virginia Senate race could tip the balance of the chamber. The race to replace Kaine, in this scenario, would almost certainly become the most expensive congressional race in U.S. history. Whomever Terry McAuliffe appoints to replace him would face a still unknown Republican. Ted Cruz running-mate Carly Fiorina, despite blowing a totally winnable 2010 Senate race in California, keeps telling people she wants to run. But she would (to put it nicely) not be able to clear the field. Virginia's demographics may be changing, but with the exception of 2013, the commonwealth has a storied history of rejecting the newly-elected president's party in its off-year elections. (This is why so many expect Ed Gillespie to be the next governor.)  Rubio's closing ad goes positive. -- Marco Rubio will likely win reelection, but the outcome will be closer than most people in D.C. expect. This will generate a round of stories about whether Democrats should have spent more money in Florida to head off his presumed 2020 run for president. Party decision-makers preemptively explain that they could get way more bang for their buck in other states that were easier pick-up opportunities, and that their primary job is winning the majority - not thinking about getting Clinton reelected.    Rob Portman tours Pioneer Pipe last week in Marietta, Ohio. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)   -- An important lesson from 2016: Candidates and campaigns matter.  Burr and Blunt made many mistakes. Many of his allies describe the North Carolinian as lazy and complain that he did not engage with the race until too late (some wonder whether he really wants the job). There is a widespread feeling that Blunt erred by putting his son in charge of his campaign, which made it hard for the campaign to grapple objectively with his residency challenges. Unlike those other two states, which were seen as likely Republican holds a year ago, Ohio was expected to be one of the marquee races of the cycle. But Rob Portman put it away by Labor Day because he ran a solid, textbook campaign. (Read last month's big idea on how he did so here.) As a story about his challenger in Sunday's Columbus Dispatch put it, ""Within a few hours on the campaign trail last week, Ted Strickland was rained on, heckled ... by a man in a Chicago Cubs hat, and learned he was down 18 points in the latest poll. It was, as the children's book says, a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. But Strickland ... has had his share of those lately."" -- John McCain is also safe at this point. Arizona appears to have moved out of reach for Democrats. Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick ran a good campaign and was well positioned if McCain lost the primary or the bottom had truly fallen out from under Trump.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   CLINTON CLEARED AGAIN -- THE LATEST EMAIL BOMBSHELL:  -- FBI Director James Comey announced that Clinton will not be charged criminally following a second probe of her private email server. In a letter to congressional committee chairmen, Comey said investigators had worked ""around the clock"" to review the emails, ultimately finding them either duplicates of previously reviewed correspondence, or personal emails that did not pertain to State Department business. ""We have not changed our conclusions expressed in July,"" he wrote. (David A. Fahrenthold, Rosalind S. Helderman and Jenna Johnson have the full story. Tom Hamburger had the scoop yesterday. Read Comey's letter here.) -- Serious damage was already done, and it is too late to totally reverse it. By clipping Clinton's comfortable lead in several states and taking other red states off the map, Comey might have deprived HRC of a clearer electoral mandate: ""Clinton, who had been trying to expand the electoral map by focusing on red states that included Georgia and Arizona, drew back to defend blue turf like Michigan and Pennsylvania. In those days, millions of votes were cast. In Colorado, for instance, voters submit their ballots by mail. Daniel Cole, a Republican strategist in the state, said the number of Democrats returning ballots had been surging past the GOP total -- until Comey announced his inquiry. Then, on Friday, the GOP total actually eclipsed the Democrats. 'There was an enthusiasm gap,; Cole said. 'Until the latest bend in the email scandal, the wind was kind of out of our sails.'""    -- The Clinton team's public response was surprisingly measured: ""We were always confident that nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited. Now Director Comey has confirmed it,"" Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon tweeted. ""Trump's hopes of using Comey to distract the voters in closing days of the campaign just went up in smoke.""    -- Trump said yesterday morning that his opponent would definitely be indicted soon. After Comey gave lie to that, Donald changed his tune in Michigan to again argue that Clinton is ""being protected by a rigged system."" ""She is is guilty,"" he said. ""She knows it. The FBI knows it. The people know it. Now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8th."" (Jenna Johnson) -- Reflecting how much the markets want the stability that would come up with a Clinton presidency, stocks and the dollar jumped this morning based on the Comey announcement: Futures pointed to a 1.5 percent opening gain for the S&P 500, slated to end its longest losing streak in more than 35 years. The Mexican peso also gained, the Wall Street Journal notes. -- ""In another kind of political season, that might have settled the matter. But instead, it generated a new round of dark theorizing from some of the same people who had praised Comey only nine days before,"" Karen Tumulty writes in an analysis piece. ""The two sides are likely to be arguing for years over the question of who was helped and who was hurt by Comey's string of late-breaking announcements. And on the Republican side, the bureau will face a host of new questions. ... The whole saga also will probably reinforce the disillusioned American public's perception that the political system is corrupt, and that the institutions of government are failing. It is likely, as well, to further undermine the legitimacy of whoever wins the election in this deeply polarized country. 'Regrettably, this is of a piece with every event that happened before it in the campaign,' said William A. Galston, a governance expert at the Brookings Institution. 'In a way, it is a perfectly fitting end to a truly awful campaign.'"" -- While Democrats expressed relief, they also castigated Comey for announcing such an ill-timed investigation. Harry Reid use the word ""irresponsible"" multiple times in his statement. And three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed how badly Comey has hurt his standing:  Ranking member Patrick Leahy read the letter aloud from his phone during an event in Vermont (where he's coasting to reelection). The crowd roared. ""I won't add to what was said because the fact is, I've always believed in Hillary Clinton's honesty,"" Leahy said. ""I've always supported her. ... You know, once in a while it's nice when everything comes together."" ( Seven Days) ""This should end the email saga once and for all,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in a statement. ""The October surprise that came only 11 days before Election Day has unfairly hurt the campaign of one candidate and changed the tenor of this election. The letter makes Director Comey's actions nine days ago even more troubling. There's no doubt that it created a false impression about the nature of the agency's inquiry."" Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) called for Senate hearings to rake Comey over the coals for botching this: ""I think that there should be hearings, and I'm certain there will be hearings in the Judiciary Committee on this matter,"" he said during a morning TV hit.  -- Some congressional Republicans said they won't let this go:   Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) claimed the ""vague"" announcement ""failed to provide context"" and that he was ""unsure"" whether the review was actually over. ""The growing number of unanswered questions demand explanations: Is the FBI continuing to review the newly-revealed emails?"" he said in a statement. ""Did the FBI limit its review to email from when Clinton was Secretary of State, leaving out emails that could shed light on possible obstruction of Congress?"" ""Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,"" Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. ""Let's bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for Donald Trump on Tuesday.""     -- Objectively, Comey really screwed the pooch. ""NBA referees ref the first 44 minutes of a game differently than they ref the final four minutes,"" writes The Fix's Chris Cillizza. ""They understand that in the final four minutes, the bar for a foul is higher because the stakes are raised. Shooting two free throws in a two-point game in the first quarter is very different from doing the same thing with 35 seconds left ... Same goes for Comey. He needed to understand that to say something about Clinton's email investigation so close to the election meant that he had very real concerns about the possibility of a president-elect being indicted. To simply say -- after a nine-day hurricane of news stories about Clinton's emails -- that there was never anything to see here is a remarkable swing and miss on Comey's part."" -- Comey has perhaps irreparably hurt the FBI's brand. Ellen Nakashima, Sari Horwitz and Matt Zapotosky look back on 10 nightmarish days for the bureau: ""As the agents worked, the bureau faced a seemingly endless torrent of criticism. News leaked that agents in the FBI's New York field office had been advocating for a separate investigation of the Clinton Foundation, even though public integrity prosecutors had told them that they did not have a case. That fueled the perception that at least some in the bureau, an organization of predominantly white men, might have partisan motivations, and Democrats called for the Justice Department inspector general to look into the matter."" LATEST POLLING: -- Our Washington Post/ABC News tracking poll finds Clinton with a four point lead over Trump (47-43), regaining her edge in popularity and matching Obama's advantage among minorities in the final hours of the race. -- Bloomberg Politics poll gives Clinton a three point national lead (46-43). She was up nine in the mid-October poll. Clinton holds a 46-38 lead among people who say they've already voted. The email issue appears not to have dogged Clinton's standing among her supporters: just three percent said it caused them to change or seriously consider changing their vote. (70 percent say it hasn't worried them.) -- A CBS News national poll also shows Clinton holding a four point lead (45-41), with just five percent of likely voters saying they could potentially change their mind. -- The final Quinnipiac numbers: Clinton up 46-45 in FLORIDA and 47-45 in NORTH CAROLINA.  -- A Fox 2 Detroit/Mitchell poll in MICHIGAN shows Clinton up five points, compared to a three point lead last week. -- A UNH Granite State poll finds Clinton up 11 (49-38) in NEW HAMPSHIRE. A WMUR poll last week had Clinton leading Trump by seven points (45-38). Hassan leads Ayotte by four in the UNH survey. (49-45). THE BATTLEGROUNDS: -- Late nights: Donald took the stage in Leesburg, Va., at 12:22 a.m. for the last event of his day. Hillary landed at the airport in Westchester, N.Y. at 11:06 p.m. after her nighttime rally with James Taylor in Manchester, N.H. -- The Republican nominee will hold five rallies today, jetting from Florida to North Carolina to Pennsylvania to New Hampshire and then to Michigan. Clinton, by contrast, will appear in three states: North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan.  -- USA Today has op-eds from both Clinton and Trump making the case for ""why you should vote for me.""    THE LATINO SLEEPING GIANT AWAKES: -- A Telemundo/Naleo poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 62 points among Latino voters (76-14). And 56 percent of Latino voters said they were ""more enthusiastic"" about voting this year than in 2012. -- ""In Florida ... there are early indications that Hispanics have mobilized for this election like no other in U.S. history, Robert Samuels writes. ""On Saturday, the Democrats' efforts to court Cuban Americans was on display in Hialeah, the heart of the exile community. In addition to [a] chiva bus, Clinton allies parked a van blasting hip-hop and reggaeton music ... [and] handed out guava pastries from a tent. Waiting for them were a group of Trump supporters who started yelling, 'Lock her up!' The Democrats started shouting back, comparing the GOP presidential nominee to the reviled Cuban dictator: 'Castro, no! Trump tampoco!' They also chanted another Spanish phrase that suggested Trump and Castro were funded by the Russians."" -- President Obama focused on Hispanic voters as he campaigned for Clinton yesterday in Kissimmee, Florida (where I wrote last Tuesday's big idea on Hispanic GOTV efforts from). ""This election is about the character of this country,"" Obama said. ""Who are we? What do we stand for? ... If we win Florida, it is a wrap. If we win Florida, it is over."" (Greg Jaffe) -- Evidence mounts that the Democratic outreach is paying off: Some numbers: Trump campaign officials have zeroed in on Florida as the most important state for Trump to win on Tuesday, Bloomberg's Joshua Green notes - and believe Miami-Dade County is ""the most important county"" for Trump's chances to take home a victory in the state. Whether Trump can win enough voters in Miami-Dade is another question, however: ""Through Saturday ... 707,844 county residents had already voted: 44 percent were Democrats, 30 percent Republican, and 25 percent had ""no party affiliation,"" a group that tends to skew younger and Hispanic, and thus toward Clinton. The demographic mix of early voters also looks highly favorable to Clinton: 58 percent Hispanic, 17 percent African-American and 20 percent white."" A telling anecdote: ""Canvassing on Saturday morning in North Miami, Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, and a handful of local members focused on households, many of them Haitian or Hispanic, with an infrequent voting history. But nearly every resident who answered their door assured her they had already voted."" (Jonathan Martin in the Times) -- Most of Trump's own Latinos employees will vote against him --> ""Latina Hotel Workers Harness Force of Labor and of Politics in Las Vegas,"" by New York Times' Dan Barry: ""Ms. Vargas, who is from El Salvador, and her Latina union colleagues are a growing force in the politics and culture of Nevada, vocal in their beliefs and expectations. It has not been easy. Downsizing after her husband's deportation, selling her bedroom set, moving in with her daughter and her family. Publicly agitating for the union ... and then fretting that there might be retaliation at her nonunion, pro-Republican workplace. And working, constantly working. ... She pulls into the employee parking lot of the gold hotel, set aglow now by the unsparing morning sun. Searching for a parking spot, she passes other women, many of them also in black and gray tunics, hurrying toward the service entrance. Soon she is heading for the same door, one more guest room attendant who wears a back brace while cleaning rooms for a presidential candidate whose name is on the bathrobes she stocks, on the empty wine bottles she collects, on her name tag. He will receive her labor, but not her vote."" -- A narrative to watch for on Wednesday: ""The story of this election may be the mobilization of the Hispanic vote,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told JMart. ""So Trump deserves the award for Hispanic turnout. He did more to get them out than any Democrat has ever done. ... If we don't come to grips with the demographic challenges we have with Hispanics in presidential politics, we'll never right the ship.""    Trump waves a Terrible Towel in Moon Township, Pa., on Sunday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   THE DAILY DONALD: -- Great read: Trump beat reporter Jenna Johnson recounts her year of traveling alongside the Republican nominee to more than 170 rallies: ""In those early days, Trump had no U.S. Secret Service protection and nothing to lose. He took kids on rides in his helicopter in Iowa and stopped by a high school homecoming. There were no fundraisers, no sprawling staff, no teleprompters, no one telling him no. He held rallies in struggling former industrial towns with low median incomes and high rates of anger -- and thousands would show up. [A September rally in] Oklahoma foreshadowed what would come. There was the crowd -- loud and adoring, no matter what Trump said or did or what might be revealed about his past. There was the palpable anger, the sharing of conspiracy theories, the mob mentality. ""Pick up your pitchfork!"" a local politician shouted, firing up the crowd before Trump arrived. ""Follow our next commander in chief! Join the Trump brigade and take back America once and for all!""  Political pundits had said for months it was just for the show, while Trump insisted he had sparked a political movement. He was right."" -- A delusional Trump predicted victory in reliably-blue Minnesota: ""If I don't win Minnesota, I'm going to look real bad to those pundits."" -- Trump proceeded to attack the local immigrant population: Somalis, largely Muslim, who have fled their war-ravaged country and settled in large numbers around Minneapolis. From Jenna: ""You don't even have the right to talk about it. You don't even know who's coming in. You have no idea. You'll find out. You'll find out,"" Trump said. He mentioned a recent case in which 10 people were stabbed at a Minnesota mall. The attacker was a Somali man who had immigrated to the United States with his parents when he was 2. A news agency tied to the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the man was a ""soldier"" for the group. ""You've suffered enough in Minnesota,"" Trump said. He said Clinton would allow more refugees to enter: ""Her plan will import generations of terrorism."" -- Mike Pence said Chris Christie's role as the head of Trump's White House administration team will remain unchanged, despite the criminal convictions of two top former aides. ""Well, what I would tell you is Chris Christie has continued to strongly state his position that he had no knowledge of those actions taken,"" Pence said on ""Fox News Sunday."" -- Sarah Palin drew 400 in northern Michigan as a Trump surrogate, according to the Traverse City Fox affiliate.    Trump speaks last night in Pennsylvania. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   -- Deep dive by the New York Times, ""Inside Trump's Last Stand: An Anxious Nominee Seeks Assurance,"" by Maggie Haberman, Ashley Parker, Jeremy W. Peters and Michael Barbaro: ""On the surface, there is the semblance of stability that is robbing [Clinton] of her most potent weapon: Mr. Trump's self-sabotaging eruptions, which have repeatedly undermined his candidacy. Underneath that veneer, turbulence still reigns, making it difficult for him to overcome all of the obstacles blocking his path to the White House."" Five nuggets: The operation is embarrassingly unsophisticated: ""Over a cheeseburger, fried calamari and an 'Ivanka Salad' at the Trump Grill in the basement of Trump Tower last week, several aides flipped open a laptop and loaded the popular website 270towin.com, which allows users to create their own winning electoral maps. For 10 minutes, they clicked through the country, putting Democratic-leaning states won by Mr. Obama four years ago, like New Mexico and Colorado, into Mr. Trump's column. Their analysis seemed more atmospheric than scientific."" Trump aides have wrested control of his Twitter account, which he has often used to shoot himself in the metaphorical foot, in order to help him stay on-message. Advisers pleaded with Trump not to threaten to sue his female accusers during last month's Gettysburg speech, warning that such threats could make him appear ""small."" But Trump was adamant, telling staffers there had to be a ""severe penalty"" for those who dare attack him. It predictably backfired. Great color: Sitting outside a Manchester campaign event right after Comey's announcement the Friday before last, Trump advisers sent Michael Flynn on stage to ""stall"" while they scrambled to craft a last-minute speech. They became so engrossed that Steve Bannon's pants caught on fire. The groping accusations dashed GOP morale on the Hill: ""Some despondent young (RNC) staff members ... who usually work late into the night in the final stretches of a campaign, took to leaving their desks early, in time for happy hour at bars.""    -- USA Today, ""Following scare at Trump rally, life is now different for protester,"" by Seth A. Richardson: ""Life was fairly normal for Austyn Crites until Saturday night. The 33-year-old, Eagle Scout and high-altitude balloon inventor was by his own account a fairly average guy. He wasn't famous ... until the [Trump] rally on Saturday in Reno. Crites, who identifies as a Republican, went to the rally ... with the intention of protesting ... He never expected what would transpire. As Trump called him out from the podium, accusing him of being a Democratic plant, Crites made his way to the front. Someone yelled he had a gun. ... [Since then], Trump staffers, supporters and alt-right websites wasted no time in attacking Crites."" Kellyanne Conway called him a Democratic plant on national television. Trump Jr. retweeted a false claim calling it an assassination attempt. 'For someone like me, this particular event will in fact change the rest of my life,' Crites said. His parents' information was released online, and his brother and sister in law were targeted: 'We've been getting a lot of direct messages with threats saying they're going to come get us and our family and when Trump becomes president he's going to have us killed. Threats like that,' said Crites' 33-year-old sister-in-law.""    Clinton, accompanied by basketball star Lebron James, speaks to Ohio voters during a campaign rally in Cleveland. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   THE DAILY HILLARY: -- Khizr Khan campaigned alongside Clinton in New Hampshire last night, castigating Trump for being an ""embarrassment"" to the U.S. and contrasting his rhetoric with Clinton's promises to work for ""healing and reconciliation. ""This election will decide the future of America and the future of the world,"" Khan said. ""On one hand, we have Donald Trump and his policies of hate, exclusion, intimidation and division,"" he said. ""On the other hand, we have Hillary Rodham Clinton and her lifelong public service to the country."" (Anne Gearan) -- Libertarian VP candidate Bill Weld -- giving more headaches to Gary Johnson -- praised Clinton on CNN, saying Trump is ""unfit"" to lead the country while Clinton is ""a perfectly reputable, professional, responsible candidate"" for commander in chief. This is just the latest in a string of interviews in which the third-party nominee has vouched for Clinton, John Wagner notes. -- Also making appearances for Clinton is ""Game of Thrones"" author George R.R. Martin, who encouraged early voting and spoke to campaign volunteers in New Mexico. He has previously expressed support for the Democratic nominee in several online posts. (CNN) -- Clinton, Inc. --> ""Chelsea's husband allegedly used foundation ties to boost hedge fund,"" by Politico's Ken Vogel: ""Chelsea Clinton's husband used his connections to the Clinton family and their charitable foundation to raise money for his hedge fund, according to an allegation by a longtime Clinton aide made public Sunday [in the Wikileaks email trove] ... Marc Mezvinsky extended invitations to a Clinton Foundation poker event to rich Clinton supporters he was courting as investors in his hedge fund, and he also relied on a billionaire foundation donor to raise money for the fund ... They also assert that he had his wife Chelsea Clinton make calls to set up meetings with potential investors who support her family's political and charitable endeavors."" The documents were written in late 2011 and early 2012 by ex-Clinton aide Doug Band. Mezvinsky, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, was working with two partners to raise capital to launch a hedge fund of their own called Eaglevale Partners at the time.

But that is part of the deal during presidential campaigns. It is all about being there, whatever that means and wherever 'there' is. Being in battleground states. Being on television. Being in perpetual motion. Being up on the latest. And a whole lot of being up in the air. Being there with the goal of actually getting there. There is also a strong component of being with in these closing days -- celebrity on celebrity, famous people being with her, this famous woman, and the rest of us watching ... If the nation at some point became hooked on reality TV, and [Trump] somehow emerged from that subculture, Hillary has her own version of 'The Voice' going.""    Lynn Young, a Clinton volunteer, canvasses in the suburbs of Colorado Springs yesterday. (David Weigel/The Washington Post)   DISPATCHES FROM THE SWING STATES: -- Dave Weigel, in Colorado Springs, notes a stark contrast between Democratic and Republican get-out-the-vote efforts: ""In COLORADO, which has not voted for a Republican for president since 2004 or for governor since 2002, a taut local Democratic Party has linked arms with a cautious and free-spending Clinton campaign. The state's Republicans, divided and outnumbered in voter registrations, are counting on voters to come home; the Democrats are simply counting voters."" -- Trump's chances in PENNSYLVANIA are likely to hinge on whether enough voters are willing to abandon their usual voting patterns in favor of disruption, our Robert Costa writes after a road trip across the state: ""The journey through Pennsylvania revealed that while Trump signs dot countless lawns throughout the industrial region, they do so progressively less as you move east, as if Trump's support were a fading red swath on the map. For Trump -- who rallied Sunday in Moon, Pa., near Pittsburgh and plans to be in Scranton on Monday -- the hurdle remains wary voters, including moderates in his own party, who see his rowdy populism as an unwelcome upending of American life."" -- The mood at Penn (Trump's alma mater) is ""closer to terrified,"" says Politico's Dan Spinelli: ""At Wharton, one of the world's most respected (and demanding) business schools, students have recoiled at being linked to a wheeler-dealer whose business record suggests more skill at financial chicanery than genuine company-building. ... Perhaps the most galling moments for Penn arrived when Trump tried to play the Wharton card to excuse his pantomimed mocking of a disabled reporter. 'Who would mock a disability?' Trump told Jake Tapper. 'I would never. I'm a smart person. I went to the Wharton School of Finance.'"" -- Jonathan Mahler takes the pulse of the baby boomer generation: ""If Bill Clinton was their white-haired id, Hillary Clinton is their superego in a pantsuit. A shared history binds the boomers -- as do, broadly speaking, some shared traits. Their parents suffered through the Depression and World War II before rearing them in the most prosperous society the world had ever seen. Inevitably, perhaps, they were guided by two polestars: responsibility and entitlement. Those dueling impulses powered the rise of both Clintons: one impulse galvanizing supporters who deeply admired their commitment to public service, the other galling critics who saw them as playing by their own rules ... [The Clintons] would be bookends on their cohort, one seizing the national stage on behalf of their generation in its prime, the other, who now qualifies for Medicare, vying to lead it into its dotage."" -- ""Jewish Voters, Prized in Florida, Tell What Drives Them,"" from The Times' Rick Rojas: ""Republicans are sending around cards showing a glowering Hillary Clinton, an Iranian flag and missiles, and saying: 'The Obama/Clinton Iran Deal Puts Israel at Risk.' ... Then there is the Facebook ad and robocall campaign puckishly titled 'WWJD.' It answered the question many Jews here were wondering: What would Joe (as in Lieberman) do? One of the most prized groups of voters in the Sunshine State is its hundreds of thousands of Jews ... Layered on top of [typical concerns about the nominees] are specific concerns over support for Israel; the nuclear arms agreement with Iran, which is unpopular with Jewish conservatives; and unease over anti-Semitism that has surfaced among segments of Mr. Trump's supporters."" WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- ""Civil rights advocates work to prevent polling chaos,"" by Janell Ross: ""Behind the locked glass doors of a downtown Washington office ... volunteers are fielding phone call after phone call. ... It is one outpost of the Election Protection Coalition voter hotline, a volunteer-staffed nonpartisan network of organizations devoted to protecting the right to vote. The advocates behind the operation say they are worried that more than any presidential election in the past 50 years, the 2016 contest carries a pronounced risk for impropriety and mischief. They, too, like Trump, worry that the election could be rigged. In response, the coalition has set up 23 call centers across the country for what it thinks will be a fractious and contentious Election Day."" -- ""For some Syrian women, refugee life proves unexpectedly liberating,"" by Kristen Chick: ""Samar Hijazi stood in front of the judge of the Sunni sharia court ... last month as he addressed her in rapid-fire bursts from behind an imposing desk. 'This is against God's will,' he said. 'If you divorce, you'll have problems with your children. God will be against you. Will you reconsider?' 'No,' she said firmly. Just like that, Hijazi, 45, was freed from a 33-year marriage to a man she described as abusive and domineering. The refugee from Syria's war had long wished for such an ending, but it had never seemed possible ... That changed when the family fled to Lebanon two years ago. ... For some Syrian women living in Lebanon, the bitter realities of life as a refugee have nourished an unexpected side effect: empowerment. Uprooted from some familiar social constraints and exposed to programs promoting women's rights through contact with aid groups, some of them have obtained a degree of personal autonomy they never experienced in Syria."" -- ""As the most frightening election of my lifetime draws to a close, I find myself thinking of a teenager I met many years ago in Siberia who was moved to tears after sitting for an exam to win a U.S.-sponsored study trip to the United States,"" editorial page editor Fred Hiatt writes in a first-person column. ""She didn't yet know whether she had won or lost -- but it was the first time she had ever felt she was competing for something on her merits, where bribes or connections to people in power would have no effect. That alone made her grateful and admiring of the United States. She was seeing what, to me, is the real America. To me, America is not at heart selfish, petty, hateful or bigoted. One candidate for president may be all of those things, and may suggest that we are like him. But I don't believe most Americans -- including most Americans voting for him -- share those ungenerous traits. I don't believe we will elect such a man, either. But if we did, I believe the real America would be strong enough to survive and outlast him and remain -- or once again become -- the kind of place a teenager in Siberia can admire.""

Republicans in the state are urging Fiorina to run because she would bring immediate star power and fundraising ability to the expensive, back-to-back races for Kaine's seat that will take place if he becomes vice president. Fiorina is not the only Republican interested ... But her national name recognition after the 2016 presidential campaign would make Fiorina particularly formidable in a GOP primary.
