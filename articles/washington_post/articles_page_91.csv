Some live in the ""blue wall"" of states in the Upper Midwest that, until Tuesday, backed every Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992. Some voted for Democrats in the past. Some kept their Trump support secret until after the election to avoid scorn from acquaintances and co-workers. Here's a look at voters who helped usher in a Trump presidency, and why they did so: ___ In Michigan, Patrick Burke supported Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the GOP primary but ""jumped on in full support"" of Trump as he bested the field. The 60-year-old automotive and business consultant lives in suburban Detroit's Macomb County, which was home to the ""Reagan Democrats"" in the 1980s. In 2012, Obama carried Macomb County by 4 percentage points. Trump enjoyed an 11 point-plus margin there. Trump stands for ""making sure that if you work hard that your government is there to help you rather than hurt you,"" Burke said, noting that Trump's message ""of prosperity and reducing the debt and a strong military and reforming immigration really resonated"" with blue-collar workers. A drive through Burke's city Wednesday found more Trump signs than Hillary Clinton, and some took their allegiance to the extreme: One home's front lawn featured a large wooden basket with life-sized, scarecrow-like people sticking out and a sign labeling it ""The Deplorables,"" -- a reference to Clinton's description of half of Trump's supporters as a ""basket of deplorables."" The lawn display also featured a sign that reads: ""Climb In There is Room For All."" Trump's vitriolic volleys are well-known -- his declaration that Mexico was sending ""rapists"" across the border, and a tape that emerged last month on which Trump bragged about grabbing women's genitals. Burke said Trump isn't perfect, but he believes the most divisive and vulgar rhetoric ""was just all talk.""  ""I like the fact that he's been successful. He has built some incredible things. He has had his failures but he's had huge successes,"" Burke said. ""I think that Trump has the vision that we need to have now to get us pointed back in the right direction."" ___ Iraq War veteran Rebecca Zbichorski, 28, of Milwaukee, is a first-time voter who supported Trump because ""America needs a kick in the behind."" A factory worker who gets her health care through the Veterans Health Administration, Zbichorski enlisted in the military at 18 and served nearly eight years as a Marine. She said she sees Trump as a ""regular type of guy"" who doesn't care what anyone thinks, which made him the best candidate to give U.S. government the ""shake-up"" she thinks it needs. Health care was her top issue as a voter, she said. Identifying neither as liberal or conservative, she would prefer Canada-style national health care. She notes Trump once spoke favorably of Canada's system before his current support for working with Congress to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Her family, she said, has had a ""nonstop hassle of getting insurance"" under Obama's health care law. She discounted the women who came forward to say Trump made unwanted sexual advances.  ""In the military, that's a common situation,"" she said. ""It's what happens with a man in power and a woman who comes in who's gorgeous and attracted to money and power. ... I don't know the full facts. The only people who know are the women in question and the man himself."" She unapologetically keeps a copy of Trump's book ""Crippled America"" in full view of her co-workers. It was a way to broadcast her position, which she sums up with a social media meme, minus the hashtag: ""I'm voting for Trump. SorryNotSorry.""  ""He's the slap in the face. He's the wakeup call,"" Zbichorski said. ""Let the man do what he's got to do."" ___ Eileen Barlow, a 56-year-old small business owner and part-time bartender, voted for Trump because he's a businessman and not a politician. He's also not a Clinton.  ""My grandfather always said that what we need is a businessman in the presidential office, and that's what Donald Trump is,"" Barlow said as she stood behind the bar at the local American Legion post in the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Illinois, readying for a busy night that included a meat raffle. In her voting lifetime, Barlow says she supported Republicans about 60 percent of the time and Democrats roughly 40 percent. Most of her family members are Democrats. But Bill Clinton was her ""tipping point."" Barlow voted for him twice. Then came the scandal over his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky  ""After what happened with him, it turned me off the Clintons permanently. Not just that he did it. But admit it. Don't stand there and lie to us,"" she said. Obama's signature health care law was another reason. Both Barlow and her husband are small business owners, and between them have three adult kids. Come Feb. 1, they will be paying just shy of $1,400 per month in health insurance premiums for the two of them, with a $2,500 deductible per person.  ""The Affordable Care Act is a mess,"" she said. ""We're trying to save for retirement. We paid for our own kids' college -- we're still paying for it because we didn't want our kids to be loaded down with debt. And now (Democrats) are talking about giving away free college? Who's going to pay for that?"" Like a lot of Trump supporters, she said, she kept quiet about backing Trump: ""You don't want to be ridiculed, mocked, told you're stupid."" Illinois is a reliably left-leaning state, and Clinton, who was born in suburban Chicago, easily won it Tuesday. She also won DuPage County, where Barlow lives. But Trump resonated with voters elsewhere in a way Mitt Romney didn't, taking 12 more Illinois counties than the 2012 GOP nominee. ___ At Anthony's Barber Shop in Middletown Township, Pennsylvania, owner Anthony Canamucio's customers range from doctors to lawyers to retired steel mill guys of all races. Most of them, like Canamucio himself, voted for Trump.  ""We were sick and tired of elitist and career politicians,"" he said. Canamucio, who typically votes for Republicans, supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker early in the crowded GOP primary, but as that battle stretched on, his choice shifted.  ""You could see who was just a career politician trying to move up the ladder -- Walker included,"" he said. ""And then there was Trump."" Trump ""spoke like people speak here when they're in my barber chair"" and had positions on issues that the 50-year-old barber said mirror most of ""middle America."" Take immigration: Canamucio said it doesn't make sense to him that states are issuing driver's licenses to immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally or that Syrian refugees are coming to this country rather than going to neighboring Arab states. In Trump, he found someone who felt the same way.  ""He was the first person who seemed to have some common sense,"" he said. Now, it's important for Trump to follow through on his campaign promises, he said. ""I think people are expecting him to do what he says he's gonna do. They're just sick of having smoke blown up their you-know-what."" Clinton won Middletown Township and Bucks County. But Trump outpaced Romney's performance in the suburban Philadelphia county and shaved Clinton's winning percentage from just over 50 percent for Obama in 2012 to roughly 50 percent this year. ___ Associated Press writers Jeff Karoub in St. Clair Shores, Michigan; Mike Catalini in Middletown, Pennsylvania; and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.

Bernie Sanders speaks during a campaign stop at the University Of New Hampshire in Durham, N.H., Wednesday, Sept. 28, 2016. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)  Presented with only the following two quotes, it's easy to tell which member of the Sanders family is the politician. Asked by The Post if he thought he could have beaten Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders was temperate in his reply. ""I hesitate to be a Monday morning quarterback,"" he said. ""In my heart of hearts, I think there's a good chance I could have defeated Trump, but who knows."" When his wife Jane was asked a similar question on CNN last week, her answer was more pointed. ""Do you think your husband would have had a better chance at beating Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton did?"" CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked. ""Absolutely,"" Jane Sanders replied, ""but it doesn't matter now."" In the wake of Donald Trump's stunning win on Tuesday, many supporters of Sanders' outside of his immediate family have expressed frustration at what could have been. A key part of Sanders' closing pitch to Democratic superdelegates was that he stood a better chance against Donald Trump (or any other Republican) than did Clinton, an argument that his backers now see as validated. It's a question worth exploring. Or, really: It's a pair of questions worth exploring. 1. Could Bernie Sanders have beaten Donald Trump? Certainly. Of course Bernie Sanders could have beaten Donald Trump. How can we be so confident? A few reasons, including that Hillary Clinton came as close as she did. Save 109,000 votes in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Clinton would have prevailed in the electoral college vote and therefore be president. (That's according to the most recent estimates compiled by Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman.) Or, importantly, if she'd swung Florida and Michigan by about 128,000 votes -- meaning that there were a few ways in which Clinton might have emerged victorious save for a relatively small number of ballots. Out of a pool of 128 million votes, 128,000 is a rounding error, one-tenth of one percent. Any number of different decisions made by either campaign could have resulted in those votes going one way or the other. Meaning that one of those changes -- swapping out Sanders for Clinton -- might certainly have been the difference-maker. One thing that the Trump candidacy and victory should remind us is that all sorts of things can happen over the course of a campaign. There's that great scene in ""No Country For Old Men"" in which Tommy Lee Jones as the local sheriff tells a story about a rancher slaughtering cattle when one comes to and starts thrashing around. The rancher pulls out a firearm to finish off the animal, but its thrashing causes him to miss and the bullet ricochets back to strike him in his own shoulder. ""Point being,"" Jones says, ""even in the contest between man and steer the issue is not certain."" Even in the contest between polished political veteran and angry neophyte, the issue is not certain. In the contest between any two politicians, the contest is not certain. We've entered the post-campaign period during which an awful lot of consultants and pollsters are going to try to dine out on their perceived success over the last several months -- and a lot of losing staffers will start pointing fingers elsewhere. That so many little things might have shifted those 100,000-odd votes one way or the other means that a lot of arguments can be made about why they were or weren't. Which suggests that there's little question that Sanders could have beaten Trump -- just as Clinton could have beaten Trump, Trump could have beaten Clinton or Trump could have beaten Sanders. 2. Did Sanders stand a better chance of beating Trump? This is a much harder question to answer. There was a private poll commissioned by Gravis Marketing released last week showing that Sanders would have easily beaten Trump, which some have used as an argument to prove the point above. But the flip side of any number of things having possibly played a role in determining the outcome of the race is that it's very hard to swap in any other candidate at this point to gauge what might have happened. If Bernie Sanders had won the Democratic nomination, he would have faced an entirely different terrain than did Hillary Clinton. He would have faced opposition from some Clinton die-hards, just as she faced opposition from some of his. In 2008, 16 percent of Clinton supporters angry at Barack Obama's primary victory bailed on him in the general. The dynamics of the race would be broadly different. It's sort of taken as an article of faith that Sanders would have easily flipped those Rust Belt states that Clinton lost. It's clear that his vehemence on trade was more in line with what many voters in that region were hoping to hear. Was that enough? How would Sanders have fared in the face of attacks on his political philosophy? Socialism is broadly viewed positively by Democrats according to Gallup, but is widely unpopular among Republicans. It's mostly younger people who view the idea positively, a group that tends to turn out less regularly than others. More would have done so for Sanders, certainly -- but would the group of Democrats that stayed home simply have moved from one demographic to another? Sanders did better than Clinton in Michigan and Wisconsin, a point that's been made to suggest he'd have done better in those states. But he didn't do that much better, winning 17,000 and 140,000 more votes, respectively. Clinton did far better in Florida and Pennsylvania (532,000 and 204,000 more votes) -- does this mean that Sanders would have underperformed in those states? No: There's no real relation between primary and general election success. There are many other questions. If the Sanders team's emails had been hacked and trickled out by Wikileaks, what might we have learned? Would Sanders have campaigned with Obama, then becoming part of the establishment that turned off other voters? How would his faith have been considered in an election where anti-Semitism was an obvious undercurrent? It seems obvious, from the vantage point of Nov. 13, 2016, that Sanders might have won Florida and Michigan or that coterie of Midwestern states and won the presidency. His team and supporters have a motivated reason to make that case. But it's impossible to know if he would have had a better chance than did Clinton, in part because her chance was very good. Just, as it turned out, not good enough.      Former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on Sunday, Nov. 13, that he is prepared to ""work with"" President-elect Donald Trump provided he champions working families, and vowed to ""oppose him vigorously"" if Trump resorts to ""discrimination"" and ""xenophobia.""

That vote should be favorable: Mr. Garland, 63, is able, moderate, respected and seasoned, an appellate jurist who has previously been confirmed, with significant Republican support, for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  Of course, this will not happen, because it does not suit Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and his fellow Republicans. Mr. Garland's nomination should have been considered and voted on in March when Mr. Obama sent his name to the Senate as a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia. That did not happen because, with the long-term ideological tilt of the court at stake, Mr. McConnell argued that the voters' choice for president in November should get the pick.  This was a gamble on a GOP victory in the fall; and there is no denying that, in political terms, it has paid off. Contrary to predictions that voters would punish GOP obstructionism, they appear to have rewarded it. President-elect Donald Trump will choose Scalia's successor next year, a GOP Senate undoubtedly will confirm him -- and the court will, in all likelihood, shift rightward rather than left in the coming years. Someday Mr. McConnell's example may be invoked against his side -- those who practice situational ethics must be prepared to have situational ethics practiced against them -- but there's no arguing with his success. Except to say, perhaps quaintly, that we don't regard political success as the only relevant measurement here. In addition to the personal injustice to Mr. Garland, the majority leader's ploy wrought harm to basic norms of democratic accountability. Those should have dictated respect for the majority will, as expressed in the incumbency of Mr. Obama -- not anticipatory deference to whatever might happen in November. Any other rule is inherently unstable, as became evident in the waning days of Campaign 2016; when it appeared that Hillary Clinton, not Mr. Trump, might be the winner, Republican politicians started moving the goal posts, suggesting that they might not approve any replacement for Scalia, or even fill subsequent vacancies, until the GOP had regained control of the White House.  In support of his position, Mr. McConnell accurately cited similar musings by then-Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) during 1992, which was then-President George H.W. Bush's final year in office. To that, we can only reply that this purported ""Biden Rule"" never should have been treated as a precedent, and would not have been if Republicans had maintained this year the objections to it that they voiced in 1992. Two wrongs don't make a right, not even in politics.    Read more:   Gregory L.

Pat McCrory, who trailed by a few thousand votes Thursday in a still too-close-to-call race that played out amid anger over the state's transgender bathroom law. The law limiting LGBT rights appeared to have a substantial role in the Election Day contest between McCrory, who signed the measure and vigorously defended it against boycotts and other protests, and Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper, who called for its repeal. McCrory, who in 2012 won the governorship by 500,000 votes in a blowout the same year President Barack Obama was re-elected, was losing by 5,000 votes out of nearly 4.7 million cast. In 2012, McCrory received 170,000 more votes than Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. This time, he trailed Donald Trump by 63,000 votes. McCrory could still win. There are tens of thousands of provisional ballots that have to be examined to determine whether they are valid and can be added to the vote tallies. Counties don't have to submit their final results until Nov. 18. North Carolina debated, passed and signed the bathroom bill in a one-day special session in March. The measure, known as House Bill 2, requires transgender people to use restrooms in schools and government buildings that correspond to the gender on their birth certificate. The law also leaves out gay and transgender people from state anti-discrimination protection. And it disallows local measures that offer protection. The national backlash began immediately. Charlotte lost the NBA All-Star game. The NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference pulled basketball tournament games out of North Carolina, a punishing blow in a state where college basketball is practically religion. Bruce Springsteen and other stars canceled concerts. Businesses like PayPal stopped expansions or moves. Even some of McCrory's supporters were bothered -- not necessarily by the law itself but by the costly and embarrassing spectacle that resulted.  ""The bathroom thing was ludicrous. It took away from a lot of the good he did, like bring jobs back,"" said 54-year-old John Muter, who still voted for McCrory. House Bill 2 struck down an LGBT rights ordinance in Charlotte, where McCrory was mayor for 14 years. Mecklenburg County, which is made up mostly of Charlotte, gave its hometown son a 3,100-vote victory in 2012. On Tuesday, McCrory lost Mecklenburg County by 136,000 votes. William Brinkley was one of those Charlotte voters who flipped their votes, upset that McCrory and other Republicans poked their nose into local business.  ""I'm totally against the entire scheming that they want to pass something without the populace's consent. Trying to do stuff in a closed session is not the way to get stuff done in this state,"" the 27-year-old business consultant said recently. ""I 100 percent think it's an invasion of freedom."" As expected, the bathroom law hurt McCrory in the state's booming and diverse urban areas, such as Charlotte and the Raleigh-Durham area, with their large banking and technology sectors. Unofficial results Tuesday showed that even in many of the rural areas that he won, McCrory didn't match Trump's vote totals. Gay rights organizations welcomed the outcome.  ""There's no question the voters have spoken and resoundingly rejected the hate that is H.B. 2,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. Asked about the law's effect on the vote totals, McCrory campaign spokesman Ricky Diaz said by email there's no outcome yet and others will have time to dissect the election once a winner is declared. Still, even if Cooper prevails, not much may change. Republicans maintained veto-proof majorities in the state Senate and House. The bathroom law was not the only thing to hurt McCrory. The governor took criticism in the past year in the Charlotte area for not actively trying to block construction of toll lanes on Interstate 77. Another place that felt the effects of House Bill 2 -- and other Republican policies -- was the city of Wilmington. Before McCrory took office, Wilmington had a booming $170 million film industry. But the elimination of state tax incentives for film projects and the entertainment industry's backlash against House Bill 2 have cut that to about $60 million this year, said Johnny Griffin, director of the Wilmington Regional Film Commission. McCrory won the county by 15,500 votes in 2012 and lost it by 5,000 votes this time. Trump won the county on Tuesday by 4,000 votes.  ""Trump carried New Hanover County, but McCrory didn't?"" Griffin said. ""The film industry is very important in this town. People get it."" ___ Tom Foreman Jr. contributed to this report from Charlotte. ___ Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at http://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP.

More than two-thirds of Prince George's County voters backed a ballot measure to expand the nine-member council by adding two at-large seats. The new positions are seen as an opportunity for the council to have a broader, less parochial focus and for district lawmakers who are in the second of their two permitted terms to remain on the council if they run countywide. ""I've felt for a long time that you need to have people that have at-large interests in the county and not just in regards to their particular district,"" said Bill Chesley, a developer who has projects in the county and contributed $15,000 to the pro-expansion effort.  ""It's a great county with a great future, and it has a lot going on,"" he said. There are currently five second-term council members: Obie Patterson (D-Fort Washington), Karen R. Toles (D-Suitland), Mary Lehman (D-Laurel), Andrea Harrison (D-Springdale) and Mel Franklin (D-Upper Marlboro). Harrison and Franklin campaigned in support of the council expansion at polling stations. Democratic Party insiders say both appear to be interested in the new seats. Franklin said he has not made any decisions but was pleased that voters embraced the measure, which the council voted to place on the ballot. ""The idea of having a countywide perspective on the council resonated well with our residents,"" Franklin said. ""It's not about any one person or candidate, but about what is the best system for the county going forward."" Harrison was not available to comment.  [Pr. George's revives old debate about adding at-large seats to council]  The passage of the ballot measure is the second major win for the council in recent years after it successfully limited a property tax increase County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) proposed in spring 2015. Baker also supported the council expansion. Two years ago, both he and the council backed an effort to eliminate term limits for county elected officials, but the measure was easily defeated. In this year's election, about 66 percent of voters were in favor of the council expansion, which in theory would allow a lawmaker to serve a total of four consecutive four-year terms. Several other large jurisdictions in the region, including Montgomery County and the District, have at-large members. In Fairfax County, the chair of the County Board of Supervisors is elected at-large. In Prince George's, politicians and activists were divided over whether to support the measure, which will cost more than $1.1 million annually in staff and salaries.  Different factions ended up distributing competing sample ballots advocating either a 'yes' or 'no' vote. Those in favor of the expansion included Council Chairman Derrick L. Davis (D-Mitchellville), who said having two at-large seats would be good for government. ""There are those who think tenure with regard to politics is a bad thing,"" said Davis, who philosophically opposes term limits and has lobbied against them for years. ""But in your workplace, you get better as you learn. So do we.""  [In deep-blue Pr. George's, a slew of sample ballots]  Opponents of expanding the council are already vowing to collect signatures for a new ballot measure to be put before voters in a future election. ""Most people who learned about the issue rejected the ballot question,"" said Larry Stafford of Progressive Prince George's, a coalition of labor and community organizations. In interviews at polling stations Tuesday, dozens of voters said they were unfamiliar with what change was being proposed. ""My conversations with voters showed they had not dug into the information,"" said Davis, recalling how he tried to explain the question to one young woman. ""But I can't be culpable for the fact that you don't seek information."" Activists complained that their efforts to defeat the ballot measure were thwarted by the better-funded Recharge At-Large political committee, which was supported by Chesley and other developers. ""It was very hard to make an education pitch when someone is walking into a polling place and has just a few minutes,"" said Suchitra Balachandran, who was one of a few dozen people campaigning against Question D at polling places across the county. She said county officials should have held more community discussions on the proposal before Election Day. Some of those opposed to the expansion said they may nevertheless try to take advantage of the new seats to bring new faces to the council. ""We will be running a slate of progressive candidates for council seats to create a progressive majority that actually want to look after the interests of residents and not their own self-interest,"" Stafford said.  ""We need a transformation of the county's political class."" "

Aaron Shock (all times local): 5:20 p.m. Aaron Schock's attorney says a federal indictment against the former Illinois congressman doesn't indicate he did anything to corrupt his office. The 52-page indictment handed up Thursday alleges Schock spent government funds to redecorate his Washington office and asked the U.S. House to reimburse him for nearly $30,000 worth of camera equipment. It also accuses him of running up a $140,000 mileage tab over six years. George Terwilliger says the indictment doesn't allege Schock tried to sell access to his office or ""any of the other traditional indications of what's understood to be a public corruption case."" Terwilliger contends all the issues in the indictment are matters of administration of both his official congressional fund and campaign fund. He says the same issues would be found in any congressional office or campaign organization. Schock says he never intentionally did anything wrong. ___ 2:30 p.m. The grand jury indictment against Aaron Schock accuses the former Illinois congressman of spending $40,000 in government funds to redecorate his Washington office -- including the purchase of a $5,000 chandelier. The U.S. attorney's office in Springfield, Illinois, announced the 24-count, 52-page indictment on Thursday. The 35-year-old Republican from Peoria had been under investigation after a spending scandal that included the remodeling of his Capitol Hill office in the style of the television series ""Downton Abbey."" Other allegations include that Schock ""fraudulently"" asked the House to reimburse him for nearly $30,000 worth of camera equipment. It also says Schock received mileage payments from the House and his campaign committees of nearly $140,000 for official and campaign-related travel between 2008 and October 2014. But it says that amounts to reimbursements for 150,000 miles more than his vehicles were actually driven. __ 2 p.m. A federal grand jury has indicted former U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois on 24 counts including wire fraud, theft of funds. The 35-year-old Republican from Peoria had been under investigation after a spending scandal that included the elaborate remodeling of his Capitol Hill office in the style of the television series ""Downton Abbey."" Authorities made the announcement Thursday. Schock had been a rising political star and prodigious fundraiser for the GOP. But he resigned in March 2015 amid intensifying scrutiny over real estate deals, extensive travel that he documented on his social media accounts and other spending documented by The Associated Press and other media outlets. The reports raised questions about improper mileage reimbursements, trips on donors' aircraft and more. The former congressman downplayed the allegations in June, saying any wrongdoing was ""honest mistakes."" ___ 12:05 p.m. Aaron Schock's defense team says it's been told that the former Illinois congressman is being indicted by a federal grand jury. Schock's attorney, George Terwilliger, calls the expected charges a ""misuse"" of prosecutorial power by the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors in Illinois were expected to announce charges later Thursday. Schock, a 35-year-old Republican from Peoria, had been under investigation after a spending scandal that included the elaborate remodeling of his Capitol Hill office in the style of the television series ""Downtown Abbey."" He resigned last year from the House of Representatives. In a statement obtained by The Associated Press, Schock says he never intentionally did anything wrong and that he's eager to defend his name and reputation. He says his case shows that ""our government cannot be trusted."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

(Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post)  Last week, even as most pundits and election prognosticators assumed Hillary Clinton was in poll position to be the next American president, Steve Bannon, the chief executive of Donald Trump's campaign, seemed confident. ""I still think that most of the people in the establishment don't realize how deep this movement is and how powerful it is,"" he said in an interview with a right-wing radio show, where he suggested that, no matter the outcome of Tuesday's election, the politics unleashed by Trump's campaign were here to stay. And not just in the United States.   [How 'globalism' is the boogeyman of 2016]   ""This whole movement has a certain global aspect to it,"" Bannon said, linking Trump's rise to a constellation of populist revolts across Europe. ""People want more control of their country. They're very proud of their countries. They want borders. They want sovereignty. It's not just a thing that's happening in any one geographic space."" Those were the politics that underlay Brexit, the calls for Britain's departure from the European Union that won a referendum earlier this year. While critics of that campaign voiced disquiet familiar to critics of Trump -- over the racism, misinformation and xenophobia fueling the pro-Brexit push -- they failed to grasp the genuine and profound angst and frustration of a segment of the voting public. That anger has been tapped by a host of populist, ultranationalist parties across Europe. ""I'm not particularly surprised because the political class is reviled across much of the West, the polling industry is bankrupt, and the press just hasn't woken up to what's going on in the world,"" Nigel Farage, one of Brexit's main boosters and a loud British advocate for Trump, said in a video message uploaded to his Twitter page. ""So 2016 is, by the looks of it, going to be the year of two great political revolutions. I thought Brexit was big, but, boy, this looks like it's going to be even bigger.""   [Brexit marks the revenge of the nation]   In the wake of his electoral victory, Trump was also hailed by far-right leaders who are seeking their own insurgent wins at the ballot box next year -- including Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Front, and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands. ""Their world is crumbling. Ours is being built,"" tweeted Florian Philippot, Le Pen's chief strategist. Gerard Araud, the French ambassador to the United States, echoed this sentiment with clearly less enthusiasm: ""A world is collapsing before our eyes."" Golden Dawn, a neo-Nazi Greek party that endorsed Trump last month from the floor of Parliament in Athens, cheered Trump's victory. The AfD, a far-right, anti-immigrant party in Germany with links to its fascist past, celebrated Trump's win as a ""historic chance"" and eyed the toppling of Germany's increasingly unpopular Chancellor Angela Merkel -- who, in Tuesday's wake, now finds herself in the unenviable position of being the preeminent champion of the beleaguered global status quo. ""Mr Trump's proposed policies threaten to take an axe to the liberal world order that the U.S. has supported and sustained since 1945,"" wrote Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman, outlining the chaos that Trump's stated isolationism and protectionism may unleash on markets and international security agreements. Already, the specter of the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin -- an autocrat whom Trump spoke of with admiration during the election cycle -- looms over the aftermath of the vote. ""Russia is ready and wants to restore the fully fledged relations with the U.S.,"" Putin said Wednesday in a statement on Russian state television. And, judging from Trump's own messaging, other right-wing leaders outside Europe may also find more common cause with a Trump White House than with previous American administrations. See Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, whose office issued a statement congratulating Trump: ""The U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressed his utmost appreciation to the president, pointing out that his was the first international call he had received to congratulate him on winning the election."" As WorldViews detailed earlier this year, Trump is deeply fond of the Egyptian strongman, who came to power in a military coup and has cemented his rule through an unprecedented crackdown that has filled the country's prisons and led to the deaths of hundreds of opposition Islamists. In a wider frame, Trump comes to power as right-wing movements are in the ascendancy around the world: Illiberal and reactionary politics have fueled support for governments in Russia, Turkey, India and the Philippines and threaten to further fracture the European Union. Their contexts are all different, but a similar pattern can be discerned: an impatience with a supposedly corrupt or broken political system; resentment of affluent elites; and a belief that only tough, strong leadership can save the day. Once a fringe candidate in the American political circus, Trump now stands at the forefront of a world-historic moment, marshaling these grievances. Where he goes from here will be watched closely by foreign politicians who want to follow his lead -- or stave off the success of their own countries' would-be Trumps.

Belichick addressed the letter during a regularly scheduled news conference held hours after the billionaire business was elected president and two days after he read it aloud at a campaign rally in New Hampshire. The letter congratulated Trump on his campaign and praised him for overcoming ""slanted and negative media"" to ""come out beautifully."" But Belichick said he writes hundreds of notes every month and that it ""doesn't mean I agree with every single thing that every person thinks about politics, religion or other subjects."" At the same campaign rally Monday, Trump alluded to a phone conversation with Brady in which he said the quarterback offered his support. Brady wouldn't confirm or deny that Wednesday.  ""I'm just going to talk about football this week,"" Brady said. ""I talked to my wife, she said I can't talk about politics anymore. I think that's a good decision made for our family."" But when pressed, he went a little further.  ""I just want to focus on Seattle,"" he said. ""I have a lot of relationships with a lot of people in the press and I don't think a lot of people are entitled to what my conversations are with friends of mine or people I may speak with."" Belichick reiterated that his comments were not about making a political stance.  ""I think anybody that's spent more than five minutes with me knows I'm not a political person,"" Belichick said. ""My comments are not politically motivated. I have a friendship and loyalty to Donald. A couple of weeks ago we had Secretary of State (John) Kerry in our locker room. He's another friend of mine. I can't imagine two people with more different political views than those two. But to me, friendship and loyalty are just about that. It's not about political or religious views."" Kerry visited the Patriots' locker room when they played at Pittsburgh on Oct. 23.  ""I have multiple friendships that are important to me and that's what that was about,"" Belichick said. ""So it's not about politics, it's about football."" When Belichick was asked follow-up questions about the letter and whether it caused any division in New England's locker room, he repeated ""Seattle"" five times, referencing that the team is focused on preparing for Sunday's game against the Seahawks.  ""We got a huge game this week against a great football team, and a great organization,"" he said. ""And that's where it all is going forward. On Seattle."" ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/09/now-we-test-americas-constitutional-democracy/	Now, we test America’s constitutional democracy	"   President-elect Donald Trump pumps his fist after giving his acceptance speech as his wife, Melania Trump, and their son Barron Trump follow him during his election night rally on Nov. 9 in New York. (John Locher/AP)  Donald J. Trump is the president-elect of the United States. Nope, still hasn't sunk in yet. Let me type it again: Donald J. Trump is the president-elect of the United States. It's not getting much better. The American in me, who fears Donald Trump's temperament, honesty and choice in staffers, is still in a fetal position under the covers. I'm legitimately frightened for the groups that Trump's campaign and his most devoted alt-right supporters targeted with their most extreme rhetoric: women, ethnic minorities, immigrants, Jews, the media, cosmopolitan elites, etc. I might be a straight white male, but I also fit three of those categories, so I'm not feeling the most comfortable this a.m. The political scientist in me, however, sees this as the sequel of what has been the greatest natural experiment in presidential campaign history. With the Republicans preserving their control over both houses of Congress, and with Trump making all kinds of dumba- campaign promises, it's worth asking what the next four years will be like. More specifically: What has made the system of American liberal democracy function the way it has functioned for more than 225 years? What is noteworthy about the American system of government is not what it can do but what it cannot do. The president is not a tyrant. The separation of powers puts important legal constraints on the executive branch. Federalism puts important legal constraints on what the federal government can impose on the states. The Bill of Rights puts important legal constraints on what any level of government can do to the American people.      The Post's Dan Balz explores some of the factors behind President-elect Donald Trump's victory against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Layered on top of those legal constraints is a whole set of bureaucratic norms and procedures that can make it difficult for a president to manage even the executive branch. There are civil service protections for bureaucrats. There are standard operating procedures that officials are loath to contravene. For eight years Barack Obama and his White House staff have struggled with the ""Blob"" of the national security state, and sometimes lost. When Trump is sworn into office, he will face all of these legal and bureaucratic constraints and more. Politically, Trump might have shocked the world, but he will have earned fewer votes than either Mitt Romney or John McCain when they lost. Trump seems likely to have lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. And as Vox's Ezra Klein wrote very early Wednesday morning: [Trump] is entering an office that is weaker than many realize. For all the same reasons Barack Obama could not bring about the change he had made people believe in, Trump cannot wrench America to his vision of greatness. He is constrained by the House and the Senate, by the Supreme Court, by the executive agencies, and -- in ways less formal but no less powerful -- by his own staff and party. Klein is nominally correct -- and yet, the situation is worse than that paragraph suggests. First, the Republicans have also won both houses of Congress. Those lawmakers will have an incentive to cooperate with the president -- including filling new and existing Supreme Court vacancies. Second, as Spoiler Alerts has noted repeatedly over the past two years, one effect of 21st century events and political gridlock has been for the executive branch to exert more authority in areas like foreign affairs. Trump is now the beneficiary of that agglomeration of executive power. And as Benjamin Wittes wrote in May, Trump in charge of institutions like the FBI and Department of Justice is somewhat disturbing given his oft-noted desire for revenge. Third, there is the minor issue of whom Trump will appoint to positions of executive power. The leaked stories about his possible White House staff and Cabinet appointments suggest that, to paraphrase Trump, Republicans are not sending their best into the executive branch. The list of names that has been floated are, to put it gently, ""a list, first and foremost, of people who have defended Trump personally again and again this election."" Basically, what I wrote in May on this topic applies with equal force come January: The political scientist in me wants to see a Donald Trump presidency, because it would be the greatest natural experiment in American politics about whether norms are as important as laws in constraining authoritarian impulses. The American in me is frightened about what the answer would be. So I am not surprised that there's a lot of apocalyptic talk Wednesday morning. It is worth pointing out two very, very important things, however. First, I was super-wrong about how this election was going to play out. Everything my Post colleague Marc Fisher wrote Wednesday morning is correct: Trump broke every political rule of thumb in the campaign playbook and won. He feuded with his own party, had no ground game to speak of, lost all three debates, and still won. For the 2016 election, Bill Mitchell has a better track record of predictive success than the pundits who write for this newspaper. Or most newspapers.   Bill Mitchell beat the markets, NYTimes, HuffPo, 538 and I believe in nothing anymore -- Adam H. Johnson (@adamjohnsonNYC) November 9, 2016   Second, the country did not fall apart Tuesday night. Contrary to the fears of many, there was no disputed election and no election night violence of appreciable significance. Trump gave, by his standards, a gracious acceptance speech. President Obama invited the president-elect to visit him Thursday. If I was this wrong about the political mood of the country, it's quite conceivable that I am also wrong about what Trump will do as president. Maybe he will not implement the campaign promises he has made. Or maybe he will implement them, and the results will not be the economic and foreign policy disaster that I fear. If nothing else, after the cognitive pasting that I received Tuesday night, I need to give President-elect Trump the benefit of the doubt. I have to hope that I am, yet again, wrong."

(REUTERS/Jim Young)      Many have loudly proclaimed that the U.S. election is rigged. Some warn of voter fraud or efforts to suppress votes; others warn of Russian manipulation of voting systems. Can individual citizens do anything to respond to or at least to help identify instances of such threats -- so that election officials can try to fix any problems and prevent them in the future?   [A cyberattack could disrupt the U.S. elections -- but that wouldn't change the results]   Yes. One widely used technique is using social media to document and draw attention to election problems such as long lines. But here's one that can be more effective: File complaints through official channels. Every state makes it possible for citizens to complain about irregularities. Few people know how to go about it. What is an official election complaint? Complaints may allege that illegal acts occurred or they may refer to administrative problems. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) enumerates a few specific complaints that can be made throughout the nation. State laws vary more, and may cover more situations than simply casting and counting votes. For instance, some states have processes for complaining about campaign finance irregularities, internal party processes and various deadlines or required numbers of signatures on electoral petitions. Filing such a complaint will trigger legal processes. Doing so typically involves such legalistic steps as having the complaint form notarized. Some states offer online portals that make filing the complaint easier.   [Everyone is sure that their side is going to win -- even when it's about to lose big. Here's what we know.]   Some states have phone hotlines for reporting administrative problems such as polling places that fail to open on time, broken voting machines, or long lines. Such incidents may need immediate action lest voters be disenfranchised during early voting or on Election Day. Few citizens file official complaints As we reported in a paper that we presented this year at the American Political Science Association meeting, few citizens typically file formal electoral complaints. Complaints are almost never filed through the HAVA process. Since 2006, states told us, the numbers of HAVA complaints were in the single digits. Many states had received no HAVA complaints, ever. We found more complaints filed through state-mandated procedures, but even these weren't common. While we asked every state's electoral officials for complaint data since 2006, only 11 states gave us their complaint data. Six states claimed to have no such data; the rest either did not respond or refused to provide data.   ['Low-information' voters are a crucial part of Trump's support]   We also sought data about state hotlines, with a positive response only from California. On primary day this year, election hotlines in California fielded roughly a thousand incident reports. We've made it easier to file official complaints To make it easier for citizens to complain officially, we have created the United States Election Complaint Portal at Michigan (USECPAM). This website contains contact information for state and county election officials, links to official election-complaint forms and procedures, and the state election law for each state (where available). As far as we know, no one has ever before compiled all these resources for each state.   [The forecasters who predicted Brexit think Trump is likely to lose]   During this year's primaries, we've seen that state and county officials often use Twitter to respond to reports of polling-place problems and other election complaints and concerns. And so we also created a Twitter account (@elec_ballots) with still more information. Visitors will find the Twitter accounts for county- and state-level election officials, state-level Leagues of Women Voters and state-level political parties, organized into lists. All this contact information can also be found through the USECPAM website.   [Hillary Clinton would win in Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Mexico, and New Zealand. But not Russia.]   Twitter or other social media may be a good way to mobilize other people's dissatisfaction as well. If someone has problems with an official, broadcasting a complaint through social media may help get a political response. Our research suggests that people do use Twitter to broadcast such complaints. But official complaints can and do allege official malfeasance -- and can lead to effective legal remedies. So complaining via both social media and official channels may be a better choice than just using one. Our website should help in the quest to get immediate results.   Logan T.
