The small rally of less than 100 people on Cleveland's Public Square on Wednesday included individuals concerned with LGBT rights, reproductive rights and environmentalism, among other issues. The demonstrators took turns using a megaphone to air their views about the election results and their dislike of Trump. No violence was reported in the rally that lasted about an hour before some protesters began marching through the city, chanting anti-Trump messages. Activists ended their march back at Cleveland State University's campus. The Cleveland protest was small compared with demonstrations taking place nationwide Wednesday in cities like Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The remarkable triumph of the politically untested businessman was welcomed in some countries, such as Russia, while in others it was a major shock. When Trump takes office in January, world leaders will confront a man whose stated views represent a sharp break with U.S. foreign policy orthodoxy. He has cozied up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, warned stunned NATO allies they will have to pay for their own protection, floated a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and vowed to make the Mexican government finance a multibillion-dollar border wall. These changes, and others, have the potential to radically remake U.S. policy -- a prospect that has given stability-loving partners a cascading case of the jitters. Trump's victory was hailed in Russia, which has taken an increasingly aggressive stance toward the West in recent months. Putin sent Trump a congratulatory telegram Wednesday and made a televised statement expressing the hope that frayed U.S.-Russian relations could be put back on track.  ""We are aware that it is a difficult path, in view of the unfortunate degradation of relations between the Russian Federation and the United States,"" the Russian leader said, adding: ""It is not our fault that Russian-American relations are in such a state."" Russia became a focal point during the presidential campaign, with government officials and Hillary Clinton supporters suggesting Moscow was involved in hacking her campaign's emails. Trump raised eyebrows when he expressed admiration for Putin and his tough leadership style, and some Clinton backers questioned Trump's business dealings with Russia. Dmitri Drobnitski, a columnist at the generally pro-Kremlin website LifeNews, asserted Trump's victory will help the world.  ""I congratulate the American people with their will and with their democracy and with their strength and with their courage,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So this is not only a victory for the Americans, who defended their democracy against the liberal, global elite-- no, this is a victory that the American people brought to the whole world."" There is anxiety in Europe among NATO allies who are waiting to see if Trump follows through on suggestions the U.S. will look at whether they have paid their proper share in considering whether to come to their defense. That rhetoric has challenged the strategic underpinning of the NATO alliance -- in which an attack on one NATO nation is considered an attack on all -- at a time when Russia has been ever more confrontational.  ""As a candidate, Trump called into question NATO and trade agreements, and reached out to Moscow,"" said Daniela Schwarzer, an expert on trans-Atlantic relations at the German Council on Foreign Relations.  ""Even if President Trump doesn't implement everything, Germany and Europe can't rely on the trans-Atlantic partnership as usual, and will have to stand up for Western values themselves."" Trump's win also caused trepidation in Mexico, where his remarks calling Mexican immigrants criminals and ""rapists"" were a deep insult to national pride. Trump has suggested slapping a 35 percent tax on automobiles and auto parts made by U.S. companies in Mexico, and financial analysts have predicted a Trump win will threaten billions of dollars in cross-border trade. Trump's victory is ""as close to a national emergency as Mexico has faced in many decades,"" Mexican analyst Alejandro Hope said. It also caused concern in Cuba, over Trump's threat to roll back President Barack Obama's normalization of relations unless Cuban President Raul Castro agrees to more political freedoms.  ""If he reverses it, it hurts us,"" taxi driver Oriel Iglesias Garcia said. ""You know tourism will go down."" Trump's electoral triumph was also felt strongly in the volatile Middle East, where multiple crises are unfolding. One major concern is Trump's vehement opposition to the historic nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers under which Iran has curbed its nuclear program in exchange for a gradual lifting of international sanctions. In Iran, leaders emphasized the need to keep the agreement on track despite Trump's victory. The deal ""cannot be overturned by a single government,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said. Israel's leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, indicated a high comfort level with the next president, hailing Trump as a ""true friend of the state of Israel."" Iraq's leader, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, also congratulated Trump and expressed hope the ""world and the United States will continue to support Iraq in fighting terrorism."" ___ Katz reported from London.

2	https://www.washingtonpost.com/adcefa80-a205-11e6-8d63-3e0a660f1f04_story.html	Inside a divided GOP, ‘real anguish’ over the way forward	"   In the wake of Donald Trump's destabilizing candidacy and Tuesday's stunning victory, Republicans across the country are struggling with a question: What does it mean to be one of them? But Trump's strong performance offered few answers. Instead, it could spell the beginning of a long and divisive GOP war over the way forward. The party's old coalition has eroded. The business-friendly conservatism that defined the GOP for a century has been diluted by tariff-happy nationalism. Its core principles are unclear. No one is sure who will decide what's next, or how. The first front in the fight over the party's future will come within days, as House Republicans decide next week on a new speaker: whether to stick with establishment favorite and incumbent Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) or to choose an outsider, if the base agitates for someone new. A cascade of standoffs will follow over a vacant Supreme Court seat, government funding and the federal budget, appointees for a new administration, and the president-elect's agenda. But the party's future will depend, too, on the states, where the GOP has remained dominant, as much as Washington, where it stands diminished. Trump's populist and racially charged campaign revealed a fast-growing grievance movement that took Republican leaders by surprise -- and exposed their detachment from the simmering frustrations and policy aspirations of their core voters. The GOP's usual playbook -- lower taxes, fewer regulations, hawkish foreign policy -- is ready for reuse, but the question for the party is whether Trump will return to those tenets as he plots his presidency. Critics such as Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) argued before Tuesday that the ""Trump approach is a demographic cul-de-sac"" and that ""blaming every closed factory on trade deals"" was unrealistic.    [A generation of GOP stars stands diminished: 'Everything Trump touches dies']  But Trump's win gave him immense capital. His allies, such as his campaign's chief executive, Stephen K. Bannon, see a far different landscape. The incendiary website Bannon once led, Breitbart, has rocketed to the fore of the party and is already spoiling to challenge GOP leaders on Capitol Hill, including Ryan, who has long drawn its ire.   Christopher Ruddy, a conservative media executive and friend of Trump, said his appeal is ""a function of the economic malaise and the lack of jobs as much as Trump. That anger and bitterness is real.""   Trump trampled norms, positions and traditions that were fragile even before he arrived. He alienated (and energized) Latino and Asian voters, but he bolstered the party's support among whites. He sent the GOP's foreign policy establishment running and appeared under banners that evoked the dormant isolationist motto ""America First."" Now, Trump ""gets to redefine the party,"" said Ari Fleischer, a former George W. Bush spokesman who did not vote for Trump or Clinton. ""It will mostly be a non-ideological populist party joined by a conservative movement on occasion. . . . The party will be led by a personality-type figure, not an ideological one. Which means the success of the party is very much tied to the success of the man.""  [Trump-driven divide will consume the GOP long after the election]    ""I just don't see business as usual,"" said former Colorado congressman Tom Tancredo, an advocate of hard-line immigration policy who left the GOP because he said it had become the ""Party of Democrat Lite."" His state, meanwhile, has seen a rise in Latino voting power and was a hotbed of anti-Trump activity. Today's GOP, Tancredo said, faces a choice between the Trump forces that have energized it to the point of takeover and possible donor-class attempts to smother that energy. It's hard to see how the latter bloc gains ground in the immediate aftermath of the election. But even if Trump's wing of the party asserts itself, the avalanche of acrimony and internal battles could be politically lethal. ""There's real anguish and a coming apart,"" said Edward J. Rollins, a former campaign manager for Ronald Reagan. ""It's about more than Trump. The party isn't now all traditional Republicans. It's more of the voters we brought in with Reagan: working-class Democrats who left that party and who have grown in our party. They're here, and they don't see the Paul Ryans as one of them."" Outside Washington, most Republicans, if shocked or not totally with Trump, are focused on holding together and keeping Trump voters within the fold.  ""You saw this Brexit kind of voter in New York, Pennsylvania and Michigan come out for Trump. It's not a new thing to want to make sure they stay Republican. Every time Republicans win nationally, it's because that voter came with us,"" said Ed Cox, chairman of the New York GOP. Cox described his late father-in-law, Richard M. Nixon, as a mainstream Republican who brought together the ""silent majority"" and the conservative movement during the 1968 election. He sees Nixon as a model of sorts for how Republicans will need to fuse various blocs in coming years.  [Two wonks, one question: Could Hillary Clinton and Paul Ryan work together?]    Next year should be an indicator, he added, with gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey and a mayoral election in New York City. As Patricia Poprik worked Tuesday at a bustling GOP headquarters in Bucks County, Pa., a swing suburban area, the county chairwoman was upbeat. ""We're filling spaces where we didn't have committee people,"" she said of Trump supporters. ""We've got to take that passion and keep everyone involved."" Poprik said moderates in vote-rich places such as Bucks County won't abandon the party because of Trump, since most of them still believe that the GOP is ""what it's always been about: smaller government, less intrusion in lives, less regulation, letting people decide for themselves."" ""Those things haven't changed,"" she said. ""The rank and file are here. It's the elites in Washington who should pay attention more to the regular Joes, the moderates and the conservatives, to understand what's happening."" Elsewhere, thousands of state legislators will be working in capitols unified under GOP control. Republican governors such as Maryland's Larry Hogan and Massachusetts's Charlie Baker, both of whom refused to vote for Trump, may be positioned to argue that a more moderate party could do a better job of growing the party beyond its base.   ""Trump has smoked out the rats in the Republican Party -- the globalist rats,"" said state Sen. Frank Niceley, a Republican who has served in Nashville since the 1980s and watched his party become dominant. ""The Romneys, the Bushes, the [Gov. Bill] Haslams have all been controlled by the David Rockefeller globalist wing of the party. There's still those of us who believe in limited government and lower taxes, and we're not going back. When you don't back the nominee, you're done for."" Trump's rise also empowered people whom the Republican Party had thought vanished or irrelevant. Some of his loudest support came from white nationalists and ""alt-right"" conservatives. Some quietly volunteered for him, pulling sleeves over their Iron Cross tattoos. More found allies on social media and megaphones in the mainstream media. Richard Spencer, whose white-nationalist think tank has scheduled a post-election conference in Washington, planned to spend election night at Trump's downtown Washington hotel.  ""Anything that can be perceived that way -- in some cases, that's going to be textbook racist comments -- the party has a responsibility to reject that,"" Flake said.  ['Something is happening that is amazing,' Trump said. He was right.]  Back in Washington,  Ryan and Senate Republicans could be boxed in. On the horizon in 2018 are a slew of Senate races that look like possible pickups in states where Trump is popular. The temptation and pressure to rouse GOP voters rather than rein in Trump's policies could be intense and White House-driven, and many Republicans will argue, perhaps rightly, that it is the way to keep activists aligned ahead of 2020.     Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a conservative who has clashed with his party's leadership, said the dynamics driving Republicans in Congress are likely to be different than the factors affecting the GOP elsewhere. ""In the House, you have this central group of committed conservatives and a group of 20 to 25 moderates that push and pull and try to decide what's going to happen and who gets leverage,"" he said. ""Congress will be more about figuring out who's going to decide what, as the populism out there continues."" Ryan could be a weather vane. An avowed supporter of free markets and sweeping changes to entitlement programs -- which Trump opposed -- he is a proud descendant of Reaganism and supply-side economics. His willingness or reluctance to modify the party's pitch will say much about how much national Republicans are going to incorporate Trump's politics. On the other side of the Capitol, young senators who jockeyed to be the face of the GOP's future before Trump beat them in the primaries, such as Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.), will battle over that role again -- and under Trump's shadow. They'll have support and likely competition from Sens. Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Tom Cotton (Ark.), who have ties to intellectual conservatives and come from the heartland. In the gubernatorial mansions, Baker and Hogan are not the only influential players. Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker ran against Trump and could return to the national stage, with Walker mulling a reelection bid in 2018 and Kasich recently traveling to New Hampshire. Trump's running mate and vice president-elect, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, could be a bridge between Trump supporters and the Republican leadership. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) will be another player, figuring out where his libertarian conservatism fits in light of former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson's campaign as the Libertarian Party nominee, which drew some attention, and his own failed bid for the GOP nomination. Same goes for Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who has been at the forefront of the party's constitutional conservative wing, along with Cruz.    [For Donald Trump's supporters, this election is about him, not the GOP]  But Paul's early flameout in the primaries surprised even Democrats. Before Trump's campaign, Republicans like Paul talked about building a new majority, with criminal justice reform and economic opportunity winning over nonwhite voters, and a government-shrinking message appealing to millennials. The primary contest revealed how little active support there was for those ideas; the only message Trump adopted was that America needed to avoid foreign wars unless they were quick and in search of natural resources. ""You can complain about the candidates or 'the system,' but the bigger problem is there's no mass constituency for radical cuts in government -- among GOP primary voters or the electorate at large,"" said Gene Healy, a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Any progress toward shrinking government and expanding liberty is going to be slow and incremental, and it's almost certainly not going to emerge from presidential politics."" The prospect for immigration reform, too, is all but over. No issue drove Trump more in the primaries. Although Ryan and others in GOP leadership have supported bipartisan efforts in the past, they know any further push could be perilous and opposed by a base that viscerally identified with Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. ""It's got to be done in stages and pieces, not some big, massive bill that ends up collapsing under its own weight,"" Ryan said at the Economic Club of Washington this fall, talking about the prospect of a pact next year. The conundrum of how to build the party with Hispanics is hardly new, and it vexed Republicans four years ago, after Romney called for ""self-deportation"" of undocumented workers. That set off a wave of conferences, speeches and memos about how to rebuild the GOP. As the party wondered how it had misread the mood of the country and allowed President Obama to win a second term, at least one Republican called in to ""Fox and Friends"" to explain that the GOP needed to cut smart deals -- especially on the issue that had alienated Latinos. ""Frankly, the Republicans should take the lead on immigration,"" he said. ""Look, they're never going to win another election unless they do something."" And then Donald Trump hung up the phone. "

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/88ede556-a1ff-11e6-8d63-3e0a660f1f04_story.html	Republicans hold on to Senate majority with upset victories	" Republicans retained their majority in the Senate on Tuesday after a string of upset victories in key states and gave the GOP sweeping powers to advance President-elect Donald Trump's agenda, including his appointments to the Supreme Court. With a GOP House majority also secure, Republicans now have full control of the White House and Congress after an election season that began with their party facing long odds because of the large number of Senate seats they had to defend. Republicans entered Election Day expecting to fight head winds in several states because of Trump's controversial candidacy. But Trump overwhelmed Democrat Hillary Clinton in several critical states, giving the GOP an unexpected margin of victory. Trump provided coattails that gave the GOP a major win that could allow him an easier path toward confirming Supreme Court justices and Cabinet nominees, as well as fashioning long-sought legislation to overturn signature achievements of the Obama administration, particularly the Affordable Care Act. Republicans defended their Senate seats in Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that once looked like some of their toughest terrain.     View Graphic       Democrats picked up a seat in Illinois, where Rep. Tammy Duckworth unseated Sen. Mark Kirk. The stakes for Senate control, always critical to a new administration, became even higher in February when Justice Antonin Scalia died, leaving the Supreme Court evenly divided between the liberal and conservative blocs. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to consider President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, for the seat and said that the next president should make the pick. The result is that whichever party controls the Senate in the next Congress will wield enormous influence over the confirmation process.  With 54 members in the GOP caucus, McConnell's side could afford to lose only three seats and retain the majority outright. Shortly after 1 a.m. Wednesday, all but one contested race had been called and only Illinois had tilted in the Democrats' favor -- leaving the Democrats shy of any chance at the majority.  Two dozen Republicans were up for reelection, while Democrats defended just 10 seats, and only one Democratic seat seemed truly endangered: that of retiring Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.).  Much of 2016 unfolded like a chess match between McConnell and Reid's soon-to-be successor, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), each trying to outmaneuver the other through recruiting the right candidates and raising enormous sums of money to contest the races.  The resulting campaigns, from the far northeastern corners of New Hampshire to the southwestern reaches of Nevada, became a more than $800 million battle waged across the nation through advertising and complicated political machinations that more resembled smaller-scale presidential campaigns.   [Schumer is focusing on the big prize: Senate majority leader]  Pennsylvania, for example, provided the new mark for the most expensive individual Senate race in history, with more than $140 million spent by the candidates, national party committees and super PACs competing to turn votes among the nearly 6 million people who were expected to go to the polls.  According to one estimate, New Hampshire wasn't far behind, with about $125 million spent there -- in a state where only about 800,000 were expected to vote. Early Wednesday, with more than 90 percent of the vote in, New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) and Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) traded the lead back and forth with each new precinct reporting, neither getting ahead by much more than 1,000 votes out of nearly 700,000 cast. And in Pennsylvania, Sen. Patrick J. Toomey was declared the winner over Katie McGinty (D) in a come-from-behind victory that sealed the majority.  The focal point of the Senate fight was seven freshman Republicans running for reelection after being swept into office during the 2010 midterm elections fueled by the staunchly conservative tea-party activists who opposed the 2010 Affordable Care Act.  Those seven, mostly from Midwestern states, ran their campaigns this year in a significantly different political environment because they came from large states where turnout was much higher than it was six years ago because their reelection bids coincided with this year's presidential election.  The most successful was Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio), originally thought to be one of the three most endangered GOP incumbents who turned around his campaign through an aggressive fundraising effort and built up an image of someone focused closely on local issues such as the heroin epidemic plaguing his state. He also pummeled former governor Ted Strickland (D) as ineffective during his term, and by Labor Day Democrats who abandoned the race because Portman had pulled so far ahead.  Strickland conceded moments after polls closed in Ohio.  The Republicans also got a major boost with the victory of Rep. Todd C. Young (Ind.). He came from behind to defeat former senator Evan Bayh, who had been a prized Schumer recruit late in the political season. Young tapped into the anti-Washington mood and portrayed Bayh as a corporate influencer in the years after he left the Senate in 2011. Other victorious Republicans included a pair of former presidential contenders, Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.), both of whom were at times humiliated by Trump during the primary campaign, left that race and returned home to run for reelection. Paul won easily, and Rubio -- who initially said he would not seek a second term -- breathed life into Republican hopes for holding the majority after McConnell persuaded him to run again.   Rubio won his race against Rep. Patrick Murphy (D) by 52 percent to 44 percent, with 99 percent of the vote tallied, according to the Associated Press.  Along with Portman's easy victory in Ohio, those two races gave Republicans the ability to divert financial resources to other key battlegrounds.  ""I think in everyone's budgets a year ago, that was going to be the biggest line item next to maybe Florida. Instead, Portman did a great job of raising money. He did a great job of getting early to define Strickland, who turned out probably to be the worst candidate the Democrats could have had,"" said Carl Forti, a senior strategist for the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with McConnell.  That fund spent more than $87 million on advertising in the battleground Senate races, according to its own estimate, far more than any other party committee or super PAC engaged in the fight for the Senate. A large chunk of that money came from mega-rich donors who are traditional conservatives and were turned off by Trump's nativist campaign, his opposition to trade deals and other longtime business-friendly positions espoused by past Republican presidential nominees. Kirk faced the most difficult road running in a state that breaks so sharply for Democratic presidential candidates that the national GOP never really competed there. Duckworth, a double amputee who served in the Iraq War, easily defeated Kirk and will become the first female veteran who regularly uses a wheelchair to serve in the Senate.  Despite the crushing defeat, the Democrats did elect two other female senators of historic note: Kamala Harris (Calif.), who will become only the second elected African American woman to serve in the Senate, and Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.) will become the first Latina elected to the Senate.  But Democrats came up short in several other key races where Trump performed much stronger than anticipated. In Wisconsin, Sen. Ron Johnson (R) won his rematch against Russell Feingold (D), who had served three Senate terms until losing to Johnson six years ago. Johnson struck a conservative pose for most of his term and seemed out of step with his state's slightly Democratic lean during presidential years, but in the final two weeks of the race, he showed some signs of rebounding, and national resources poured in.  In North Carolina, Sen. Richard Burr (R) ran almost exactly side by side with Trump, as both won the Tar Heel State with about 51 percent of the vote.  And in Missouri, Sen. Roy Blunt (R) was declared the winner over Democrat Jason Kander.  Kelsey Snell contributed to this report. "

With a GOP House majority also secure, Republicans now have full control of the White House and Congress after an election season that began with their party facing long odds because of the large number of Senate seats they had to defend. Republicans entered Election Day expecting to fight head winds in several states because of Trump's controversial candidacy. But Trump overwhelmed Democrat Hillary Clinton in several critical states, giving the GOP an unexpected margin of victory. Trump provided coattails that gave the GOP a major win that could allow him an easier path toward confirming Supreme Court justices and Cabinet nominees, as well as fashioning long-sought legislation to overturn signature achievements of the Obama administration, particularly the Affordable Care Act. Republicans defended their Senate seats in Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that once looked like some of their toughest terrain.     View Graphic       Democrats picked up a seat in Illinois, where Rep. Tammy Duckworth unseated Sen. Mark Kirk. The stakes for Senate control, always critical to a new administration, became even higher in February when Justice Antonin Scalia died, leaving the Supreme Court evenly divided between the liberal and conservative blocs. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to consider President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, for the seat and said that the next president should make the pick. The result is that whichever party controls the Senate in the next Congress will wield enormous influence over the confirmation process.  With 54 members in the GOP caucus, McConnell's side could afford to lose only three seats and retain the majority outright. Shortly after 1 a.m. Wednesday, all but one contested race had been called and only Illinois had tilted in the Democrats' favor -- leaving the Democrats shy of any chance at the majority.  Two dozen Republicans were up for reelection, while Democrats defended just 10 seats, and only one Democratic seat seemed truly endangered: that of retiring Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.).  Much of 2016 unfolded like a chess match between McConnell and Reid's soon-to-be successor, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), each trying to outmaneuver the other through recruiting the right candidates and raising enormous sums of money to contest the races.  The resulting campaigns, from the far northeastern corners of New Hampshire to the southwestern reaches of Nevada, became a more than $800 million battle waged across the nation through advertising and complicated political machinations that more resembled smaller-scale presidential campaigns.   [Schumer is focusing on the big prize: Senate majority leader]  Pennsylvania, for example, provided the new mark for the most expensive individual Senate race in history, with more than $140 million spent by the candidates, national party committees and super PACs competing to turn votes among the nearly 6 million people who were expected to go to the polls.  According to one estimate, New Hampshire wasn't far behind, with about $125 million spent there -- in a state where only about 800,000 were expected to vote. Early Wednesday, with more than 90 percent of the vote in, New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) and Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) traded the lead back and forth with each new precinct reporting, neither getting ahead by much more than 1,000 votes out of nearly 700,000 cast. And in Pennsylvania, Sen. Patrick J.

Nearing the end of his long, improbable journey to victory in the presidential race, Donald Trump, the candidate of so much tumult and bluster, waxed nostalgic about how he got there.  ""I had great parents, great parents,"" Trump told the crowd at a rally in steamy Orlando, Florida. ""I just felt that nice breeze, so they're helping us out."" The candidate who for more than a year had unapologetically demonstrated he would say anything sensed it was time to rein it in.  ""Stay on point, Donald, stay on point,"" he publicly admonished himself just days before the election. ""No sidetracks, Donald. Nice and easy."" It was a rare glimpse of internal dialogue in the man whose whole life has been one long battle to prove himself bigger, louder, richer, smarter, brassier than the next guy. Trump's unbounded confidence -- and obsession with winning -- have been a lifelong constant, evident in ways large and small. Growing up as one of five children in a well-to-do Queens real estate family, Donald was the brash one, a fighter from the start.  ""We gotta calm him down,"" his father would say, as Trump recalls it. ""Son, take the lumps out."" For good or ill, it's advice Trump rarely embraced. Military school helped channel his energy, but Trump's rebellious streak remained. Trump followed his father into real estate but chafed within the confines of Fred Trump's realm in New York's outer boroughs. He crossed the East River to Manhattan and never looked back.  ""He's gone way beyond me, absolutely,"" an admiring Fred marveled. His son had hit it big well before he hit 40. So successful at such a young age, Trump never did have to smooth out those lumps his father had warned about.  ""He was at the top of his own pyramid,"" says Stanley Renshon, a political psychologist at the City University of New York who is writing a book about Trump. ""Nobody was going to say, 'Donald, tone it down.'"" Trump admitted as much in a 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" hot-mic video when he talked about making predatory moves on women and declared, ""When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything."" Trump stresses his Ivy League education, yet revels in juvenile jabs, labeling his adversaries ""stupid,"" ''dumb,"" ''bad"" and ""sad.""  ""I have the best words,"" he declared at a December campaign rally. ""But there's no better word than 'stupid,' right?"" With no one to shush or second-guess him, Trump made brashness his way, along with his trademark glitz and flash. (Flash, in Trump's lexicon, registers a level below glitz.) Through years of boom, bust and more than a decade of reality-TV celebrity on ""The Apprentice,"" the deals kept coming and the price tags (and, often, the debt) kept growing -- as did the hype. Always the hype. Trump, visiting Scotland in 2012 to fight the government's proposed wind farm off the shore of his new golf resort there, was asked during a parliamentary inquiry to provide evidence for his claim that the ""monstrous turbines"" would hurt tourism.  ""I am the evidence,"" Trump answered in all seriousness, drawing laughter from the galleries. ""I am a world-class expert in tourism."" He's not all chutzpah, though. Ivanka Trump tells of her ""incredibly empathetic"" father reaching out to help strangers he sees mentioned in the news whose stories of adversity touch him. A Mississippi man remembers Trump picking up the phone to call when the man's father wrote to ask for a loan to build a hotel back in 1988. Trump didn't offer a loan to the Indian-American small businessman but did give him a pep talk and some advice.  ""Trump inspired my father to the fullest when he told him that Dad's immigrant story was wonderful,"" Suresh Chawla wrote in a 2015 letter to The Clarksdale (Mississippi) Press Register. For all the protesters who roil his rallies, Trump himself has been the heckler of our time. No one is immune. Not senator and war hero John McCain, not the disabled, not Mexicans, not Muslims, not even those people who make up a majority of the country (and the electorate): women. Vanquished rivals learned to their peril that to criticize Trump was to set off the nuclear option in response. Trump calls it having a little fun. Aubrey Immelman, a political psychologist at Saint John's University in Minnesota who has developed a personality index to assess presidential candidates, puts Trump's level of narcissism in the ""exploitative"" range, surpassing any presidential nominee's score in the past two decades.  ""His personality is his best friend, but it's also his worst enemy,"" says Immelman. Still, the loudmouth from Queens has a vulnerable side. He revealed it in a movie review, of all things, with filmmaker Errol Morris in 2002. Talking about ""Citizen Kane,"" his favorite movie, Trump spoke with unusual introspection about the accumulation of wealth.  ""You learn in Kane that maybe wealth isn't everything, because he had the wealth but he didn't have the happiness,"" said Trump, who once wanted to become a filmmaker himself.  ""In real life, I believe that wealth does in fact isolate you from other people,"" he said. ""It's a protective mechanism -- you have your guard up much more so than you would if you didn't have wealth."" There's a wariness to the say-anything Trump that was long in the making. Trump, in a 1990 Playboy interview, said the loss of his older brother Fred Jr., an alcoholic who died at 42, ""affected everything.""  ""He was the first Trump boy out there, and I subconsciously watched his moves,"" Trump said. ""I saw people really taking advantage of Fred, and the lesson I learned was always to keep up my guard 100 percent."" He said he's a ""very untrusting guy."" The man who has married three times lives large and offers the opulence of his real estate developments as a metaphor for what he can do for America. But in fact he has relatively simple tastes, if you are to believe him and his family. He's never had a drink, smoked or done drugs, he says. He's a self-proclaimed ""germ freak"" who'd really rather not shake your hand. Give him spaghetti and meatballs over pate any day, his sister says. Or even meatloaf, a Trump favorite when he's at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. In the end, Trump stood before voters and offered himself as the unadorned solution to what ails a nation he paints in dark, troubled hues, mocking the gimmicks and celebrity endorsements of his opponent.  ""I am here all by myself,"" he told a crowd in Pennsylvania. ""Just me. No guitar, no piano, no nothing."" ___ AP Writers Jill Colvin and Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report. ___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
