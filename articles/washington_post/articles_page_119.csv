White, a former federal prosecutor and private securities lawyer, was appointed by President Barack Obama in February 2013. Her term doesn't end until 2019. President-elect Donald Trump is due to take office Jan. 20 and likely will name his own choice to head the market watchdog agency in the near future. His nominee could move to unwind restrictions on Wall Street banks and corporations. The Trump transition team has set as a goal to ""dismantle"" the Dodd-Frank reforms law enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner who is the team's point man for financial regulatory agencies, is an avowed opponent of regulating Wall Street. White, an Independent, has had to forge consensus amid sometime robust opposition from the two Republicans on the five-member commission. Republicans criticized her for what they saw as overreach by the agency that could stifle financial innovation and economic growth. Some Democrats, meanwhile, accused her of not being tough enough on Wall Street and top executives who may have contributed to the crisis. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Democratic leader who is a fiery critic of Wall Street, last month called on Obama to replace White over the issue of requiring publicly traded corporations to more fully disclose their political spending. Under questioning at a Senate hearing, White wouldn't commit to getting the commission to adopt such a rule. She cited a Republican amendment to a catch-all government spending bill that prohibits the SEC from doing so. Warren and several other Democratic senators were angered by White's position and by waffling on the issue by two long-pending Obama nominees to fill vacancies on the SEC. They blocked the nominations of the two candidates, a Democrat and a Republican. As a result, the five-member SEC has been down two since December 2015. The positions will likely be filled by Trump nominees. In its announcement Monday, the SEC noted a number of rules and policies that White shepherded during her tenure, including regulations under the landmark Dodd-Frank law. Also included were changes to shore up the stability of the money-market fund industry and new protections for mutual fund investors. The SEC also required financial firms that sell securities backed by mortgages or auto loans, like the kind that fueled the crisis, to give investors details on borrowers' credit records and income.  ""My duty has been to ensure that the (SEC) implemented strong investor and market protections, and to establish an enduring foundation for future progress in the most critical areas,"" White said in a statement. ""Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the SEC's staff, we have accomplished both."" Reflecting criticism from consumer and investor groups, Lisa Gilbert of Public Citizen called White ""a disappointing chair.""  ""For more than three years, she stymied effective regulation from the SEC, slow-walking Dodd-Frank rules,"" said Gilbert, who heads the group's Congress Watch unit. And now, she added, the Trump administration ""likely will nominate someone in her place who is even more skeptical of investor protections."" White, who was U.S. attorney in Manhattan from 1993 through 2002, compiled an extensive record of prosecuting white-collar crime, won convictions in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1998 terrorist attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa, and put crime boss John Gotti away. Her 2013 nomination by Obama as the first prosecutor to lead the SEC was taken as a signal in some quarters that he wanted the government to get tougher with Wall Street. After leaving government, White worked for a decade as a corporate attorney at a New York-based firm, her blue-chip client roster including JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, General Electric and Toyota. That work prompted tough questioning by some senators at her confirmation hearing in March 2013. White promised that she would avoid potential conflicts of interest caused by her past legal work and that of her husband, who is a corporate attorney. She said her work for large banks and corporations didn't mean that she had embraced their policies. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Scott Kowalchyk/CBS)  Astrophysicist and TV star Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of Stephen Colbert's favorite guests. On Wednesday, Colbert enlisted him not once but twice on ""The Late Show,"" mostly to help put the chaotic presidential election in perspective for distressed voters -- using science, of course. Colbert devoted a large portion of his show for expressing his disbelief that Donald Trump is the president-elect. He kicked things off with a pretaped skit in which he pretended to wander up to the roof of the building, where Tyson was hanging out with a telescope.   [Late-night TV hosts react to Trump's presidency with disbelief, lots of jokes]   ""You're so much fun to have on the show,"" Colbert said. ""But I gotta say, the way people are feeling, it might be hard to do a comedy show tonight.""    Tyson considered this. ""You know what we do in moments like this in my field?"" he asked. ""We invoke the cosmic perspective."" ""What's that?"" Colbert wondered. ""That's what Earth look likes from high above. Not just, like, from the atmosphere, but from space itself, from the universe,"" Tyson explained. ""And when you do that, all earth's problems dissolve away into the infinitude of the space time continuum."" ""Yeah..."" said Colbert, not sounding convinced. ""Does that make you feel any better?"" Tyson asked hopefully. ""No,"" Colbert admitted. Tyson paused. ""Why don't we just chuck the telescope?"" ""Let's do it,"" Colbert ordered, and the two men ""launched"" the telescope over the railing so it shattered on the ground. Later, Tyson returned for a sit-down interview to plug the new season of his National Geographic show, ""StarTalk."" Naturally, Trump came up almost immediately, as Tyson said he thinks the culture has become too obsessed with ""bashing"" politicians.   [The moment on election night when Stephen Colbert couldn't make a joke]   ""The politician is representing an electorate. So, really, if you're against a politician, you're against their voter base, fellow citizens of this country,"" he said. ""So I as an educator, when I want to educate people, I don't say, 'Don't vote for this person' or 'Vote for that person.' I just simply educate you, so that when the time comes, you can make as informed a decision as you can.""    ""That's very positive,"" Colbert admitted, and then asked Tyson to circle back to the ""cosmic perspective"" he mentioned earlier, and how people can use it -- presumably to feel better about the current political climate. ""It's what the world looks like after you've studied the vastness of the universe,"" Tyson said, and then read a quote from Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell: ""You develop an instant global consciousness. A people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics looks so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter million miles away and say 'Look at that, you son of a b---.'"" Colbert liked that, and even more when Tyson said there's an even bigger mission for the next four years: ""Make America smart again."" ""I'm a fan!"" Colbert said as the crowd cheered. ""I'm a huge fan of rationality and the scientific method."" Read more: Trump said it was important to look 'presidential.' But in victory, he couldn't master it.

5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/9155dbb8-a605-11e6-ba59-a7d93165c6d4_story.html	At Donald Trumpâ€™s hotel in Washington, his delirious Election Night supporters celebrated	" In the middle of a city overwhelmingly opposed to Donald Trump, hundreds of devotees gathered Tuesday night in his Pennsylvania Avenue palace of marble floors and Swarovski crystal chandeliers to plead, pray and scream that he would win the presidency. The Trump International Hotel, just blocks from the White House, served as a bastion for a legion of his supporters, whose ardor only intensified as his momentum built through the night. When televisions flashed Trump's lead in Ohio and Wisconsin, the room erupted. People pointed at the TVs and yelled ""Call it!"" and chanted ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" A thickset man with a red beard and a tattoo sleeve wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat high-fived his smaller friend in a white ""Make America Great Again"" hat. Nearby, a blond woman in a leopard-print dress tried not to spill her on-the-rocks cocktail as people bumped around her.  News soon followed that the Dow Jones futures had dropped 700 points. ""That's just because Wall Street bet on Clinton to win,"" a muscular man with close- cropped hair and a white button-down shirt said to a woman standing beside him. ""After Day One, that's going to skyrocket up."" For much of the night, the ornate atrium of the $212 million, 263-room hotel felt more like a sports bar devoted to an out-of-town team: a Washington Redskins pub in downtown Dallas. While 93 percent of voters in the nation's capital backed Hillary Clinton, Trump supporters could wear their favorite color -- bright red -- and join in familiar cheers -- ""Lock her up!"" -- and watch their preferred TV channel -- Fox News -- free from fear of opposition or judgment. ""It's nice to hang out here and not look over your shoulder,"" said a District psychotherapist in a T-shirt that showed a cartoon Trump in a Superman outfit. ""I would be fearful wearing this on the street."" The psychotherapist, who is gay, had come to the hotel with his partner, a senior manager at a left-leaning D.C. nonprofit group. Fearing both a personal and professional backlash, both men declined to give their names. They had initially planned to attend a friend's party but were, essentially, uninvited because of their political views. ""We have had more vitriol from gays than anyone,"" the nonprofit manager said.  Both men, who support Trump because of his stance on immigration and fiscal conservatism, said they avoid divulging their political leanings at work. ""Advertising it is not worth it,"" the psychotherapist said. Just two weeks ago, Trump himself attended the hotel's grand opening celebration amid his campaign for an even grander property in the nation's capital. ""With the notable exception of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, this is the most coveted piece of real estate in Washington D.C., the best location,"" he said, standing behind a gold and dark-wood lectern adorned with ""Trump hotel."" (In the days since, tourists in jeans and baseball caps have posed for cellphone pictures behind an identical lectern in the atrium as they repeat Trumpisms like ""bigly"" and ""Gina."") Protesters angered by what they see as the Republican nominee's racism and misogyny have demonstrated outside the hotel repeatedly in recent weeks. On Saturday, the building was defaced for at least the second time in a month. On Tuesday, hours before the polls closed, two tall, square-shouldered men in dark suits and Republican-red ties wandered the lounge, asking visitors if they had any questions about the hotel. But the pair seemed less like concierges and more like polite, well-dressed security guards. What did they expect would happen at the hotel Tuesday night? ""Preparing for the worst,"" said one, who had two fading blacks eyes. ""Hoping for the best."" The night was free from unwanted disruptions, but Trump employees ordered out any journalists they spotted interviewing guests, including one of two Washington Post reporters. Trump's unlikely election night success -- driven in large part by a populist message to middle-class Americans -- felt surreal in a room where people in velvet chairs can order rare Hungarian wine for $140 per crystal spoonful. On Tuesday, the hotel's website advertised a special ""Inauguration Rate,"" though Inauguration Day isn't until January. ""It is our pleasure to welcome you to Trump Washington DC on this historic night,"" the site said of the $705 single-day price tag, which was the cheapest room offered to anyone other than AAA members ($680) and military veterans ($604). The 6,300-square-foot ""Trump Townhouse"" was listed at $28,625, including taxes. That's about $2,500 more than the annual per capita income in Michigan, where at Trump's final rally of the campaign, he railed against elites and vowed, ""The American working class is going to strike back."" On Tuesday night, the people at his D.C. hotel reveled in his surging electoral count. After he won North Carolina, they chanted ""Lock her up!"" After Florida, they exploded in cheers, high-fives and pumped fists. ""We're going to build a wall so big,"" a collection of seemingly drunk supporters said to each other after Trump took the lead in the key state of Wisconsin. ""Who's going to pay for it? Mexico!"" Slowly, the people packed into the atrium acted less and less like they needed a refuge as their candidate's chances soared.  And in that moment, no one could have explained election night 2016 better than the hotel's own online slogan. ""Washington,"" it declares, ""will never be the same."" "

Park, who has faced tens of thousands of protesters and an investigation into whether a mysterious confidante manipulated government decisions, made the overture during a meeting with National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun. Just being forced to work with a deputy named by lawmakers -- previously a decision left up to the president -- would weaken her ability to make basic decisions and influence power in the assembly. But lawmakers, who must still settle on a prime minister nominee, are demanding even more. Some opposition members want the president to divorce herself from all domestic affairs and focus only on foreign matters, while others want her to stay out of government completely. These scenarios would destroy Park's authority as president during her last 15 months in office, forcing her to voluntarily yield large parts, or maybe even all, of her presidential powers to a prime minister named by an opposition-controlled legislature. Even so, it is still unclear what the splintered assembly will decide on, or when -- or what Park will agree to. Park's ruling party is divided between those who support Park and those who don't, and the opposition, while having more members than the ruling party, is also split into factions. The prime minister is largely a ceremonial job, though by law he or she directs executive ministries under the order of the president and has other important rights. There have always been calls to give the office more power to balance the large role the president has. Last week Park nominated a new prime minister, but he is likely to withdraw from consideration after Park allowed the legislature to pick a new nominee. The current nominee, Kim Byong-joon, told reporters that he would be in charge of social and economic issues and fully exercise the rights as a prime minister if his nomination received parliamentary approval. Park's office said Tuesday those conditions endorsed by Park would still stand for a new nominee. The political tug-of-war over the prime minister comes amid a scandal involving Park's longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil, who has no official government role. Investigators are looking into whether Choi made major government decisions and used her relationship with Park to force companies to donate money to two foundations controlled by Choi. Earlier Tuesday, South Korean prosecutors raided the Seoul office of Samsung Electronics, the nation's largest and most valuable company, in connection with the scandal. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office provided no other details. The Yonhap news agency said investigators suspect Samsung gave Choi's daughter illicit financial help. Tens of thousands of people rallied in Seoul over the weekend, demanding Park's removal from office. Her approval ratings were, at one point, the worst of any president since South Korea gained democracy in the late 1980s. Nam Jeong-su, spokesman of Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the more militant of South Korea's two large umbrella union groups, said he expects 150,000 anti-Park unionists, plus supporters, to gather Saturday and march to the presidential Blue House. Park's government, meanwhile, said Tuesday she would skip an Asia-Pacific leaders' meeting in Peru later this month. The announcement sparked media speculation that the scandal may have forced Park to cancel her plans to attend the summit, though officials said the decision was made before the scandal exploded and is aimed at focusing on how to deal with North Korea's nuclear program. ___ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.

State by state, district by district, neighborhood by neighborhood, candidates and campaigners are making their last pitch for Congress, state legislatures, governor's offices, ballot questions, judgeships, city councils and lots more. A nationwide look at important, interesting and occasionally odd matters that go before voters on Tuesday: ALABAMA Alabama voters must decide on 14 statewide constitutional amendments affecting everything from funding for state parks and the age of public officeholders to beer. Yes, beer. The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board wants to require brewers to report the name, address, age and phone number from anyone who purchases beer at one of the state's craft breweries for off-premises consumption. ___ ALASKA Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski is up for re-election, and the race has drawn not one but three foes: Democrat Ray Metcalfe, independent Margaret Stock, and Joe Miller, who upset Murkowski in the 2010 GOP primary only to then lose the general election in a historic write-in campaign. This time Miller is running as a Libertarian. ___ ARIZONA Eight years after losing his bid for president, Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain is running for re-election. McCain has publicly struggled with whether to support GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who called McCain a loser and criticized him for being captured during the Vietnam War. Marijuana is on the ballot; voters could legalize the drug for recreational use by adults. Minimum wage could rise to $12 an hour by 2020 under a separate ballot measure. Metro Phoenix Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America, is fighting for his job after a criminal indictment stemming from his immigration patrols. ___ ARKANSAS Arkansas could become the first Southern state to legalize medical marijuana, although a similar proposal lost by less than 30,000 votes a year ago, out of 1.3 million votes cast. Republicans are expected to hold all four of Arkansas' U.S. House seats. Democrats are fielding a candidate in only one district. ___ CALIFORNIA Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer's retirement creates a rare open seat, and for the first time in the modern era, no Republican will be on the ballot. Thanks to California's unusual primary system, in which the two top finishers from the June primary advance to the general election, voters will decide between two Democrats -- state Attorney General Kamala Harris and U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez. The statewide ballot has a whopping 17 propositions, the most on a single ballot since March 2000. There's a measure to legalize recreational marijuana and one requiring porn actors to wear condoms. Voters will weigh in twice on the death penalty. One measure would repeal capital punishment while another seeks to speed up the process. ___ COLORADO Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is running for re-election against a tea party-aligned opponent, conservative Darryl Glenn, who has struggled to raise funds after national party leaders refused to endorse his candidacy. In a hotly contested House race, Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman is facing a challenge from Democratic state Sen. Morgan Carroll in suburban Denver. The chief ballot questions would allow medical aid in dying and create a universal health care system within the state. ___ CONNECTICUT The five Democrats who make up the state's U.S. House delegation face re-election, including Rosa DeLauro, the longest serving member in the group who is seeking a 14th term. Dr. William Petit, whose wife and two daughters were murdered in a 2007 home invasion, is running as a Republican for the Legislature against state Rep. Betty Boukus, an 11-term Democrat who heads the powerful House bonding subcommittee. ___ DELAWARE Voters will elect a new congressional representative and a new governor, while Republicans are hoping to end years of Democratic rule in the General Assembly by regaining control of the state Senate. Democratic U.S. Rep. John Carney Jr. is making a second run for governor against Republican state Sen. Colin Bonini. Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester and Republican Hans Reigle are vying for the state's lone U.S. House seat. ___ DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Voters in the nation's capital will decide whether they want their city to become the 51st state. The measure, backed by Mayor Muriel Bowser, should pass easily, but that's probably as far as it goes. Congress would need to approve any such change and Republicans are unlikely to go along with it. With registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans by 12-1 in the city, statehood would tip the balance in the U.S. Senate with two more Democrats. ___ FLORIDA Florida voters will decide whether Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio gets a second term. They'll also pick at least eight new U.S. House members after districts were redrawn to comply with the state constitution, and will cast ballots on legalizing medical marijuana. Rubio faces Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, while ex-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist hopes to revive his political career -- now as a Democrat -- in a race against Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly in a St. Petersburg-area district. ___ GEORGIA Democrat Jim Barksdale and Libertarian Allen Buckley are challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, who seeks a third term. Barksdale, who owns an Atlanta investment firm, gave $3.5 million toward his first political campaign, but has struggled to get momentum against the well-known Isakson. Georgia voters also will decide on a constitutional amendment allowing the state to take over low-performing schools. ___ HAWAII Voters in Honolulu must make two separate choices after U.S. Rep. Mark Takai died in office: Someone to fill his seat for the remaining two months of his term, and someone to represent the district for the next two years. Voter confusion could lead to two different people winning the same seat, to serve two different terms. In heavily Democratic Hawaii, the only state Senate seat held by a Republican, Sam Slom, could flip. That would make Hawaii the first state in the nation to have a one-party legislative body in since 1980. ___ IDAHO Republicans will dominate at the top of the ticket, leaving an open seat on Idaho's Supreme Court as the most competitive race. Twin Falls attorney Robyn Brody and Republican state Sen. Curt McKenzie are in a tight, nonpartisan race. ___ ILLINOIS Illinois is home to one of the most closely watched U.S. Senate races in the country, with Republican incumbent Mark Kirk and Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth. Kirk, a first-term senator, is considered one of the more vulnerable Republicans, and polls have indeed shown Duckworth with a comfortable lead. Wealthy Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has spent record amounts on down-ballot races in hopes of tilting the Democrat-leaning Legislature toward the GOP so he can press his own policy agenda in second half of his term. ___ INDIANA With Republican Gov. Mike Pence on the national ticket as Trump's running mate, the governor's office is up for grabs. And this is another state with a U.S. Senate race that will be crucial to determining party control. A former governor and U.S. senator, Democrat Evan Bayh, wants to return to the Senate and faces Republican U.S. Rep. Todd Young. Democrats are hoping to gain enough seats in the General Assembly to break the current Republican stranglehold. ___ IOWA Republican Charles Grassley is seeking a seventh U.S. Senate term and trying to retain a seat his party has held since 1957. Democrats are optimistic that their candidate, Patty Judge, can break that winning streak, given her previous elections to statewide office as agriculture secretary and lieutenant governor. Two of Iowa's four U.S. House races are expected to be especially competitive. ___ KANSAS Democrats are seeking to cut into Republican majorities in both houses of the Legislature and oust more allies of term-limited GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. Conservatives and abortion opponents are seeking to remove four Kansas Supreme Court justices in hopes of giving Brownback a chance to remake the court ahead of major abortion and school funding rulings. ___ KENTUCKY Voters will decide whether to send Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, who made an early run for the presidency, back to Washington for a second term. His Democratic opponent is Lexington Mayor Jim Gray. Voters also will determine whether the only legislative chamber in the South still controlled by Democrats remains so. Republicans need to pick up four seats to win a majority in the Kentucky House for the first time since 1920. ___ LOUISIANA Two dozen -- that's right, two dozen -- candidates are vying for an open seat in the U.S. Senate after incumbent David Vitter decided not to seek re-election. One of them is white supremacist David Duke, who is not among the top-tier candidates in polling. Because no candidate is likely to get the 50-percent-plus-one majority needed to win outright, the top vote-getters will head to a Dec. 10 runoff that could end up determining which party gains control of the U.S. Senate for the next two years. ___ MAINE Mainers will decide whether to make marijuana legal for everyone over age 21. Maine is one of nine states considering ballot questions on pot legalization for recreational or medicinal use. Another initiative would require background checks before the sale or transfer of firearms between people who aren't licensed dealers. And one would boost the hourly minimum wage from $7.50 to $12 by 2020. ___ MARYLAND Voters will pick a replacement for the popular Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring after 30 years in the U.S. Senate. U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a seven-term Democrat, is running against Kathy Szeliga, minority whip in the state House of Delegates. She has sought to portray Van Hollen as an insider of dysfunctional Washington. Baltimore will choose a new mayor. ___ MASSACHUSETTS Massachusetts voters will also vote on marijuana legalization, as well as a proposed expansion of charter schools. There are a handful of congressional contests, with Democratic U.S. Reps. Richard Neal, Niki Tsongas, Joe Kennedy, Stephen Lynch and William Keating all facing challengers. ___ MICHIGAN It's the Democrats' last shot to disrupt the GOP's agenda or Republicans will lead the Legislature all eight years of GOP Gov. Rick Snyder's tenure. At least a dozen GOP-held House districts -- half with incumbents, half open due to term limits -- will determine which party secures the minimum 56 seats needed. Democrats have targeted two GOP-held U.S. House districts, while two spots on the Michigan Supreme Court represent the most significant statewide races. ___ MISSISSIPPI All four of Mississippi's U.S. House members -- three Republicans and one Democrat -- are up for re-election. All are likely to prevail. Four of the nine state Supreme Court seats will also be filled, as will four of 10 seats on the state Court of Appeals. ___ MISSOURI Missouri voters will decide whether to send U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt to a second term, or choose Democratic challenger Jason Kander instead. It's a race that will help decide party control of the Senate, and polls have indicated a toss-up for months. Meanwhile, Missouri's contentious campaign for governor has been the nation's most expensive. Republican newcomer Eric Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, has campaigned largely on his military record, while Attorney General Chris Koster has endorsements from the Missouri Farm Bureau and National Rifle Association, which typically support Republicans. ___ MONTANA Popular Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock is up for a second term in the conservative-leaning state against software entrepreneur Greg Gianforte, who spent more than $5.6 million of his own money on his campaign. Incumbent U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking to hold off a determined challenge from Democrat Denise Juneau to maintain a two-decade Republican lock on Montana's sole House seat. Pot is also on the ballot, with a measure that would loosen many of the restrictions imposed on the state's medical marijuana program with a 2011 state law that limited marijuana providers to three patients each. ___ NEBRASKA Nebraska voters have the opportunity to reinstate the death penalty and reverse last year's decision by the Legislature. The citizen-led ballot measure has triggered a millions in campaign spending. In one of the country's most competitive congressional races, Republicans are looking to defeat first-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, who promotes himself as a champion of bipartisanship. His opponent, Don Bacon, is a retired Air Force brigadier general who is running as a Washington outsider. ___ NEVADA Nevada is home to one of the most expensive U.S. Senate races in the country, featuring lots of TV ads about the seat being vacated by Democratic leader Harry Reid. The race is between U.S. Rep. Joe Heck, a Republican, and Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general trying to become the first Latina U.S. senator. Recreational marijuana is also on the ballot, raising the possibility of pot shops springing up near Las Vegas Strip. ___ NEW HAMPSHIRE New Hampshire is a presidential swing state, and home to a tight U.S. Senate contest between Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. It's one of a half-dozen races could help determine which party controls the Senate. Two members of the U.S. House, Republican Chris Sununu and Democrat Colin Van Ostern, are vying to replace Hassan as governor. __ NEW JERSEY One of the nastiest U.S. House races in the country this year has pitted a Republican incumbent, Rep. Scott Garrett, against Democrat Josh Gottheimer. In a district that stretches from wealthy New York City suburbs to the state's rural northwestern corner, the two candidates have called each other liars and engaged in a war of words and accusations to rival the presidential candidates. New Jersey voters will also decide on a proposed expansion of casino gambling. ___ NEW MEXICO There's little suspense at the top of the ticket, with all three U.S. House incumbents expected to be re-elected, so Republicans are focused on defending their narrow majority in the state House. The party took over in 2014, ending 60 years of Democratic control. The criminal conviction and resignation of former Secretary of State Dianna Duran in 2015, for embezzlement and money laundering related to her gambling addiction, has opened that office. The race is between Democrat Maggie Toulouse Oliver and Republican state lawmaker Nora Espinoza. ___ NEW YORK Voters will decide whether the Republican Party maintains control of the state Senate or Democrats secure total control of state government. The outcome is likely to come down to a handful of competitive races on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley. ___ NORTH CAROLINA As a focal point in battles over transgender rights and voter ID laws, North Carolina may be the state where social and ideological divisions are the most defining this election year. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory is in a tight race against Democrat Roy Cooper, the state's attorney general. Former state Rep. Deborah Ross is presenting a strong challenge to incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr in one of the most closely watched Senate races. ___ NORTH DAKOTA As this state's energy- and agriculture-dependent economy falters, voters will choose a new governor to lead it through increasingly troubled financial times. But with Republican Doug Burgum a heavy favorite in this reliably red state, five ballot measures may be of most interest. Among the most-watched will be a measure that would make it legal to possess up to 3 ounces of marijuana for medical purposes. ___ OHIO Early on, former Gov. Ted Strickland looked like one the Democrats' best bet to flip a U.S. Senate seat in his party's favor. He's running again Republican incumbent Sen. Rob Portman. Then outside groups spent more than $50 million to beat Strickland, who also lost key union endorsements and was up against a formidable voter outreach and turnout effort by Portman. Now the seat looks pretty safe for the GOP. ___ OKLAHOMA Oklahoma voters will be watching a ballot issue that targets the state's chronically low teacher salaries and one that would enshrine the death penalty in the state constitution, even as executions remain on hold after mistakes in two recent lethal injections. ___ OREGON A Republican is threatening to win statewide office for the first time in many years, in a battle for secretary of state that is the hottest in Oregon. Democrat Brad Avakian is running ads saying his GOP rival is ""extreme like Trump."" Republican Dennis Richardson has racked up endorsements from numerous newspapers and even from two prominent members of Avakian's own party. ___ PENNSYLVANIA Since 1948, no Democrat has won the White House without winning Pennsylvania. There's also a hot U.S. Senate race between Democratic challenger Katie McGinty and Republican incumbent Pat Toomey, who is among the most vulnerable Republicans as the GOP struggles to retain its majority. Spending on that campaign is on track to hit $140 million. ___ RHODE ISLAND Voters in Rhode Island, a state that has seen its share of political corruption, will decide whether to expand the authority of the state's ethics commission. They'll also be asked whether to allow a new casino. ___ SOUTH CAROLINA: The South's first black senator since Reconstruction, Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, is running for his first full term. He was appointed to the seat in 2013 following the resignation of Sen. Jim DeMint, then won election to the final two years of that term. Democrat Thomas Dixon, a community activist and pastor, is challenging him. Then there's Democrat Dimitri Cherny, whose platform includes colonizing the moon and Mars in case the Earth becomes uninhabitable. He's challenging Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, the ex-governor whom voters sent back to Congress in 2013. ___ SOUTH DAKOTA The main suspense is likely to be the fate of 10 ballot questions on topics ranging from public campaign funding to payday loan interest rates. ___ TENNESSEE Democrats are hoping to chip away at vast Republican majorities in the state Legislature by focusing on urban areas, while the GOP is seeking to stamp out the last vestiges of Democratic support in rural parts of the state. ___ TEXAS Texas' only competitive congressional race looks to be the rematch between Republican U.S. Rep. Will Hurd and former Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego in a district that sprawls from San Antonio to suburban El Paso, including 800-plus miles of U.S.-Mexico borderlands. Hurd unseated Gallego in 2014. The entire Texas House also is up for election, along with 16 of the state Senate's 31 seats. Regardless of the outcomes, both chambers will remain Republican-controlled. ___ UTAH The independent campaign of Evan McMullin has made Utah suddenly relevant in presidential politics. If the former CIA operative, a Mormon, can win the state and claim its six electoral votes, it could upend Donald Trump's chances for the White House end five decades of reliably voting for the Republican nominee. __ VERMONT This state, considered among the most liberal in the country, may well elect a Republican governor. That race pits Lt. Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, against former Transportation Secretary Sue Minter, a Democrat. ___ VIRGINIA Barbara Comstock, a first term GOP congresswoman, is trying to fend off a serious challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett. Trump's unpopularity in northern Virginia has loomed large in the race, with Bennett trying to tie Comstock to the presidential nominee. In the crowded race for mayor of Richmond, the front-runner is Joe Morrissey, a former state lawmaker who went to jail for having sex with his then-17-year-old receptionist, who is now his wife. ___ WEST VIRGINIA Republicans are hoping to ride on the coattails of an expected strong showing for Trump, who has promised to put coal miners back to work. In the governor's race, Democrat Jim Justice, a billionaire coal and agriculture magnate, faces Bill Cole, the state Senate president. In the state auditor's race, Democrat Mary Ann Claytor is vying to become the first African-American statewide officeholder in West Virginia history. ___ WASHINGTON Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee is seeking a second term. He faces Republican Bill Bryant, a former Seattle port commissioner who says Inslee has mismanaged the state's mental health system and failed to fund K-12 education as mandated by the state Supreme Court. Six initiatives are on the statewide ballot, including raising the minimum wage to $13.50 an hour by 2020 and imposing a carbon emission tax on certain fossil fuels. ___ WISCONSIN It's 2010 all over again in Wisconsin's U.S. Senate race. This time, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is the incumbent and former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold is the challenger. Johnson argues that having been fired once by voters, Feingold does not deserve to be sent back. But Feingold says Johnson has not led on the issues Wisconsin voters care about and should not be given a second term. ___ WYOMING Republican Liz Cheney is heavily favored to win Wyoming's only seat in the U.S. House, which was formerly held by her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her opponent, Democrat Ryan Greene, works for an oilfield services company. Wyoming voters also will decide whether to allow the state to invest potentially billions more in the stock market, changing a state law that limits investments. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
