The 2012 Republican nominee was one of a parade of officials Trump is welcoming through doors of his white-pillared clubhouse throughout the weekend. But Trump did not reveal any new appointments on Saturday -- or indicate whether Romney could be in line for a role in the new administration.  ""You'll hear some things tomorrow,"" Trump said late in the afternoon. Trump's Sunday schedule in Bedminster includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. On Saturday he met with education activists Michelle Rhee and Betsy DeVos, as well as retired Gen. James Mattis, considered a contender to lead the Pentagon.  ""We're seeing tremendous talent,"" Trump said. ""People that, like I say, we will 'Make America Great Again.'"" ___ Trump opponents try to beat him at the Electoral College BOISE, Idaho -- Grassroots campaigns have sprung up around the country to try to persuade members of the Electoral College to do something that has never been done in American history -- deny the presidency to the clear Election Day winner. Activists are circulating online petitions and using social media in hopes of influencing Republican electors to cast their ballots for someone other than President-elect Donald Trump and deprive him of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the next occupant of the White House.  ""Yes, I think it's a longshot, but I also think we're living in strange times,"" said Daniel Brezenoff, who created a petition in favor of Hillary Clinton and is asking signers to lobby electors by email or phone. ""If it was ever plausible, it's this year."" Trump has won 290 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, with Michigan undecided, but Clinton is on pace to win the popular vote by at least 1 million ballots. Trump's opponents are motivated by the outcome of the popular vote and by their contention that the businessman and reality TV star is unfit to serve as commander in chief. Just one elector so far has wavered publicly on supporting Trump. ___ Debate over 'Hamilton' speech exposes post-election cracks NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump demanded an apology from the cast of the Broadway musical ""Hamilton"" a day after an actor in the hit show delivered a pointed message about diversity to his running mate who was in attendance. The speech aimed at Mike Pence prompted angry responses from liberals and conservatives alike -- underscoring yet again the fractious aftermath of the 2016 election. The bitter back-and-forth came after the vice president-elect caught Friday night's performance of ""Hamilton"" with his nephew and daughter. A mixture of boos and cheers could be heard inside the theater as Pence took his seat. When the show ended, Pence was asked by a cast member to hear a prepared speech after the curtain call from the multiracial and multicultural cast, saying it is concerned about the Trump administration.  ""We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,"" said Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, the nation's third vice president, as his fellow actors joined hands. ""We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us."" The unusual address quickly went viral and Trump on Saturday tweeted that it was ""very rude,"" arguing that Pence was ""harassed"" and theater ""must always be a safe and special place."" He urged the cast to apologize. Dixon responded on Twitter that ""conversation is not harassment sir"" and added that he appreciated Pence stopping to listen. Pence had ducked out before Dixon finished the unprecedented message but heard the full remarks from the hallway outside the auditorium. ___ Political risks come with control of Washington for GOP WASHINGTON -- For Republicans, there will be no one left to blame. As they prepare to take control of the White House and both chambers of Congress next year, Republicans are celebrating the opportunity to enact a new agenda for the country, including lowering taxes, securing the border and repealing President Barack Obama's health care law. But with that opportunity comes massive political risk: If President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans don't deliver, they will face a serious reckoning with voters. That could begin with the 2018 midterm elections, when every House member and one-third of the Senate will be up for re-election.  ""The American public has clearly said that they want to go a different direction,"" said Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado. ""And if we are not effective in moving in that different direction, they will take the opportunity away from us, and they will return it to the Democrats."" Said Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, speaking Friday at the Federalist Society: ""It's time to put up or shut up. There are no excuses."" ___ What more to discuss? For Obama and world leaders it's Trump LIMA, Peru -- Trying to tie up loose ends of his foreign policy agenda, President Barack Obama on Saturday instead found world leaders more focused on someone else: President-elect Donald Trump. Global hand-wringing over America's next president has taken much of the wind out of Obama's final overseas trip. Adopting an altruistic tone, Obama has offered frequent reassurances that the U.S. won't renege on its commitments. Yet he's been at a loss to quell concerns fully, given new signals from Trump that he intends to govern much the way he campaigned. Obama's visit to Peru, the last stop on his trip, has brought those concerns to the forefront: Much of Latin America is on edge about a potentially dramatic shift in U.S. immigration policy under Trump. And Asian leaders gathered in Lima for an Asia-Pacific economic summit are trying to game out what Trump's presidency will mean for trade with the world's largest economy.  ""We're going to have a busy agenda,"" Obama said as he sat down with leaders of countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the sweeping free trade deal with Asia that Obama painstakingly brokered. It was unclear whether their agenda was really as busy as all that. Vehemently opposed to the Pacific agreement and similar deals, Trump has vowed it won't be ratified on his watch. In an acknowledgement of that political reality, the White House has stopped actively lobbying Congress to try to pass it. ___ S. Korean prosecutors say Park conspired with her friend SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean prosecutors on Sunday said they believe President Park Geun-hye conspired in criminal activities of a secretive confidante who allegedly manipulated government affairs and exploited her presidential ties to amass an illicit fortune -- a damning revelation that may convince opposition parties to push for her impeachment. Prosecutors are planning to soon question Park, who has immunity but can be investigated, said Lee Young-ryeol, chief prosecutor of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. Prosecutors on Sunday formally charged Park's longtime friend, Choi Soon-sil, on suspicion of interfering with state affairs and bullying companies into giving tens of millions of dollars to foundations and businesses she controlled. In a televised news conference, Lee said that based on the evidence, ""the president was involved as a conspirator in a considerable part of the criminal activities by suspects Choi Soon-sil, Ahn Jong-beom and Jung Ho-sung."" He was referring to two presidential aides who also were formally charged Sunday for allegedly helping Choi.  ""However, because of the president's impunity from prosecution stated in Article 84 of the constitution, we cannot indict the president. The special investigation headquarters will continue to push for an investigation of the president based on this judgment,"" Lee said. ___ Space station receives oldest female astronaut, bit of Mars CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- The International Space Station gained three new residents Saturday, including the oldest and most experienced woman to orbit the world. A bit of Mars also arrived, courtesy of a Frenchman who brought along a small piece of a Mars meteorite. Launched Thursday from Kazakhstan, the Russian Soyuz capsule docked at the 250-mile-high outpost just an hour or two before NASA launched a weather satellite from Florida. The Soyuz delivered NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, French astronaut Thomas Pesquet and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy. They joined three men already on board, one American and two Russians. This is the third space station mission for Whitson, who at 56 is older than each of her crewmates. She already holds the record for most time in space for a woman: nearly 400 days during her various missions. By the time she returns next spring, she should break the record for any American, man or woman. ___ 8 arrests as rival protest groups clash near Texas Capitol AUSTIN, Texas -- Eight people were arrested on Saturday when a small group of protesters calling themselves White Lives Matter were confronted by counter-demonstrators supporting Black Lives Matter at the Texas State Capitol near where Gov. Greg Abbott had earlier dedicated a monument recognizing the contribution of African-Americans to the state. Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Victor Taylor said four of the arrests were for assault, two for evading arrest, one for disorderly conduct and one for ""interference with public duty."" Two of those arrested were on Capitol grounds and the others on adjacent streets.  ""Some protesters assaulted other protesters,"" Taylor said. ""We don't know for sure which side they were on. A lot of them were co-mingled."" Austin police and state troopers dressed in riot gear and some mounted on horseback had tried to keep the two groups separated. Taylor said the confrontation did not affect the unveiling of the monument, which was in a different part of the grounds. A state helicopter circled overhead. ___ Activists: Intense bombing of Syria's Aleppo kills 20 BEIRUT -- Government bombardment of besieged rebel-held neighborhoods in Aleppo killed at least 20 people Saturday, the worst since airstrikes resumed earlier this week, said Syrian opposition activists, as the U.S. called for an end to the bombings. Saturday was the fifth day of renewed assaults by Syrian warplanes on eastern Aleppo districts, a rebel-held enclave of 275,000 people. The onslaught began Tuesday, when Syria's ally Russia announced its own offensive on the northern rebel-controlled Idlib province and Homs province in central Syria. The bombing on Saturday came after a day of airstrikes that hit four hospitals in east Aleppo. A statement issued late Friday by the opposition's Aleppo Health Directorate said that all hospitals in east Aleppo are out of service because of the bombing over the past days.  ""The intentional destruction of infrastructure for survival has made the besieged steadfast people, including children, elderly and men and women, without medical facilities to treat them,"" the statement said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said not all hospitals in east Aleppo neighborhoods are out of service but people are finding difficulties reaching them because of the intensity of the shelling. ___ 2 juveniles held in fatal shooting of congressman's grandson CHICAGO -- Two juveniles are in custody and could be charged in the fatal shooting of an Illinois congressman's grandson following a dispute over a pair of basketball shoes, a Chicago police spokeswoman said on Saturday. Officer Michelle Tannehill said the juveniles are considered suspects in the murder of 15-year-old Javon Wilson, who was shot in the head at his home in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago on Friday. Wilson is the grandson of longtime U.S. Rep. Danny Davis.  ""The detectives are continuing their interrogations and charges are expected,"" Tannehill said on Saturday night. The juveniles in custody have not been identified. Police earlier said the shooting stemmed from a dispute over basketball shoes. Wilson knew his attackers and they may have been friends at some point. Davis said he was told a 15-year-old boy had traded slacks for shoes with Wilson's 14-year-old brother, but thought better of the trade and went to Wilson's house with a 17-year-old girl. He said the pair forced their way in the house and argued with Wilson before the boy pulled a gun and fired. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He said the baby is in protective custody and is doing well.  ""This is the best possible outcome to a very sad case,"" Ramsay said at a news conference.

In a statement issued late Saturday, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he sent a letter to Defense Secretary Ash Carter and National Intelligence Director James Clapper asking them to appear before the committee to ""discuss the veracity of press reports"" that they recommended the removal of Adm. Mike Rogers, who oversees NSA and the new U.S. Cyber Command. Nunes referred to a report in The Washington Post, saying that Carter and Clapper wrote a letter to President Barack Obama last month recommending Rogers' removal. It's unclear why they would recommend dismissal. The Defense Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the news report. Rogers has been mentioned as a candidate for a position in President-elect Donald Trump's administration, an idea that gained traction when Trump met with Rogers, whose tenure at the NSA has been tainted by breaches of classified material from the agency. Rogers took the helm at NSA in 2014 after former contractor Edward Snowden stole massive amounts of classified documents and shared then with journalists, who disclosed widespread surveillance. Reforms to prevent future thefts were imposed, but more recently, the FBI arrested NSA contractor Harold Martin III, who they say had stolen enough classified material to fill roughly 200 laptop computers. He has also been in the middle of a debate over whether the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command should be run by two people, not one. Nunes defended Rogers.  ""Since Adm. Rogers was appointed as NSA director in April 2014, I have been consistently impressed with his leadership and accomplishments,"" Nunes said in the letter. Nunes asked Carter and Clapper to provide the committee with times and dates the two could testify by 5 p.m. Monday. He also said he planned to hold an open hearing soon to discuss how the intelligence community would be affected by a proposed separation of the NSA and Cyber Command.

A Friday deadline came and went with Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper's unofficial advantage growing to about 6,600 votes over Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, from nearly 4.7 million cast. McCrory is fighting for his political life in a battleground state that Donald Trump and Republican Sen. Richard Burr won by relatively comfortable margins. After endless legal battles over how, when and where people can vote, they're fighting now over whether to count 60,000 provisional ballots and thousands more absentee ballots that have remained sealed since Election Day. Still more delays are in store as McCrory's campaign supports allegations of hard-knuckled fraud lodged by voters in more than half the state's 100 counties. If Cooper's margin remains below 10,000 votes, McCrory can call for a statewide recount, and with the possibility of other legal challenges and conceivably even legislative intervention to decide a contested result, few outside Cooper's campaign are ready to put a date on the naming of the next governor.  ""This is unprecedented,"" said Brad Crone, a longtime Democratic consultant and North Carolina history buff. ""This is new waters that we're sailing into."" The two Republicans and one Democrat on each county's elections board have been meeting this week deciding whether to toss out or unseal and count each of the remaining ballots. The largest challenge was unanimously dismissed Friday by the board in heavily Democratic Durham County, where a handful of computer cards got overloaded with ballots cast by early voters, forcing officials to hand-count 94,000 votes from the paper record. A Republican lawyer questioned the tally's accuracy, but the board's Republican chairman, William Brian Jr., said all evidence points to a true count. The state also must comply with a federal judge's order to count the votes of people who said they registered since last year at Division of Motor Vehicles offices, even though their names didn't appear on the voting rolls, unless the agency can prove they declared in writing that they did not want to register. The DMV said Friday that it has delivered information connected to about 8,100 driver's license numbers. The information will be used to decide whether ballots should be counted or thrown out. McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor, won his first race for governor by more than 500,000 votes four years ago, but he's been pilloried by Democrats and urban voters for signing a law that limits LGBT rights and tells transgender people which bathrooms to use. The state's electorate also witnessed McCrory's defense of the GOP's 2013 law that required voters to have photo identification to vote in person, reduced the number of days of early voting Democrats favor and eliminated same-day registration for early voters. The law was struck down in July by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. McCrory's campaign said, without offering detailed proof, that the fraud being challenged in more than 50 counties includes people voting more than once and ballots cast by dead people and convicted felons. And in rural Bladen County, a winning candidate claimed hundreds of mail-in ballots were forged by get-out-the-vote workers for an organization that received contributions from Democrats. The Bladen challenge, however, doesn't involve enough votes by itself to decide the governor's race. McCrory has said little about the race since election night, when he told Republicans ""the election is not over"" and said ""we're going to make sure every vote counts in North Carolina."" Instead, he's held news conferences on wildfires in North Carolina's western mountains and attended a meeting Friday on the recovery after Hurricane Matthew. McCrory's campaign was significantly outspent, but he benefited from his frequent television appearances discussing the hurricane's destruction. Cooper declared himself the winner on election night but has kept a low profile since then, but his staff and legal team said McCrory's fraud allegations are a sign of desperation.  ""Voters chose a new governor; it's time for the McCrory campaign to accept it,"" said Cooper's campaign spokesman Ford Porter, who didn't respond to the AP's request to speak with Cooper on Friday. McCrory's campaign also declined an interview, offering instead his top campaign strategist, Chris LaCivita, who defended the campaign's effort to challenge any irregularities.  ""You just can't this dream this up,"" LaCivita said. ""Of course, we're going to pursue challenges and pursue leads."" Marc Elias, a Washington-based attorney helping Cooper's campaign, said the number of allegedly fraudulent ballots McCrory's side has challenged isn't enough to change the lead, even if they were thrown out, so it's just a matter of time before Cooper's victory is confirmed.  ""There is nothing that Gov. McCrory or his legal team will be able to do to undo what is just basic math,"" Elias told reporters on Friday. ""The fact is, more North Carolinians voted for Roy Cooper than voted for Pat McCrory, and did so by a close but a significant margin."" McCrory campaign spokesman Ricky Diaz countered that Cooper's side is making ""presumptuous statements"" at a time when counties have postponed their final tabulations. Cooper is relying on ""piecemeal results from a handful of Democrat-leaning counties in order to deflect attention away from serious voter fraud concerns that are emerging across the state,"" Diaz said in a statement.

Trump announced that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) as CIA director, while also choosing retired lieutenant general Michael T. Flynn as his White House national security adviser. Trump's selections were greeted with widespread applause by his core supporters and other Republicans. But Democrats and civil rights advocates denounced Sessions and Flynn for their controversial records, portending a potentially messy Senate confirmation process for Sessions, a 20-year veteran of the chamber. The announcements came as Trump is weighing his choices for two of the Cabinet's highest- profile posts: secretary of state and secretary of defense. He retreated Friday afternoon to his golf club at Bedminster, N.J., where he intends to spend the weekend with working sessions with his staff and visitors, including 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Sessions, 69, was Trump's first endorser in the Senate and quickly became an influential policy adviser to the GOP nominee. He consistently defended Trump, including after an ""Access Hollywood"" video showed Trump bragging about grabbing women by their genitals.

Senate Republican leaders rallied to Sessions's defense and said they intended to approve his nomination to lead the Justice Department and serve as the nation's top law enforcement officer.

""I look forward to fulfilling my duties with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality."" Because of Senate filibuster rule changes, Democrats' options to derail Sessions's nomination are limited. To be confirmed, Sessions would need a simple majority in the Republican-controlled chamber. Unlike Sessions and Pompeo, Flynn is appointed and does not require Senate confirmation. Still, Trump's pick of the three-star general and decorated intelligence officer has ignited controversy. Flynn has made inflammatory and derogatory comments about Muslims, and he traveled to Moscow last year to dine alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a gala celebrating RT, the state-run propaganda television network. Flynn also supported Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.  [Trump's new national security adviser has said some incendiary things on the Internet]  The president elect is also scheduled to meet Saturday with Romney, who was a fierce critic of Trump's candidacy but who is being discussed as a potential candidate for secretary of state. Other scheduled visitors on Saturday include former D.C. public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, retired Marine general James Mattis, who is seen as a plausible defense secretary, and Robert L. Woodson Sr., who heads the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise in Washington. Woodson, who advises House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on poverty issues, said he is being considered for secretary of housing and urban development. If selected, Woodson, who is black, would add diversity to Trump's team. Meanwhile, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, is the leading candidate as Trump's pick for Director of National Intelligence, according to a person familiar with the matter. The DNI oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. Rogers took up the helm of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command in April 2014 in the wake of disclosures of widespread NSA collection activities that rocked public confidence in the agency. His term was set to expire in the spring, and his future was uncertain. He has had a rocky relationship with Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Rogers's consideration was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is chairing Trump's transition, put a positive spin on Trump's announced appointments and future selections during a brief visit with reporters Friday at Trump Tower in New York. ""The president-elect is a man of action, and we've got a great number of men and women with great qualifications who look forward to serving in this administration,"" Pence said. ""Our agency teams arrived in Washington, D.C., this morning, and I am very confident it will be a smooth transition that will serve to lead this country forward.""  Trump characterized Flynn, who was one of his most trusted campaign advisers and frequently traveled with him and spoke at rallies, as ""one of the country's foremost experts on military and intelligence matters."" ""I am pleased that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad,"" Trump said. After meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday evening, Trump continued his outreach to world leaders on Friday by speaking by phone with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.  During the campaign, Trump had said he might reconsider the United States' commitment to the alliance. But he and Stoltenberg ""underlined NATO's enduring importance"" during Friday's call, according to a statement from a NATO spokeswoman. Stoltenberg invited Trump to Brussels for the NATO summit next year.  As they have all week, potential administration appointees cycled through Trump Tower on Friday for face-to-face meetings with the president-elect, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a potential defense secretary candidate, and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R), who is under consideration to be U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee swatted away questions from reporters about whether he was seeking a position. ""My job right now is to listen to the president-elect,"" he said. ""It's his job to make the decisions. . . . The only person giving out jobs in this building is President-elect Donald Trump, not me."" Meantime, the Trump transition named agency landing teams for the departments of Defense, State and Justice, along with the National Security Council, to help smooth the transfer of power in the weeks leading up to Trump's inauguration Jan. 20. Teams will begin work in other agencies and departments next week. Trump's selection of Pompeo to lead the CIA did not spark as much controversy as his choices of Sessions and Flynn. Pompeo, 52, was elected to the House in 2010 as part of the first wave of tea party lawmakers. A U.S. Military Academy and Harvard Law School graduate, he served as an Army cavalry officer before founding an aerospace company and running an oil-field equipment manufacturing firm. He also has worked as an attorney with the Washington mega-firm Williams and Connolly. Pompeo serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and is a close ally of Pence. He backed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) over Trump in the Republican primaries but supported Trump in the general election. A vocal critic of Obama's nuclear accord with Iran, Pompeo gained prominence through his role in the congressional investigation into the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and assailed former secretary of state Hillary Clinton during the committee's hearings. Trump said of Pompeo: ""He has served our country with honor and spent his life fighting for the security of our citizens. . . . He will be a brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community to ensure the safety of Americans and our allies."" Senate Democrats have pledged a rigorous confirmation review for all of Trump's nominees -- especially Sessions. ""I know Senator Sessions and we work out in the gym, but the fact that he is a senator does not absolve him from answering tough questions in the confirmation process,"" incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. ""Given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say."" But some conservatives suggested it would be politically damaging to Democrats if they attempt to block Trump's nominees, pointing to the fact that a handful of Senate Democrats face reelection in 2018 in states that Trump carried easily. ""Mr. Trump has a plane and double-digit victories where Senate Democrats are up for reelection,"" said Leonard A. Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society. ""Obstructing his nominees will be a political loser.""  Karen DeYoung, Robert Costa, Mike DeBonis, Ellen Nakashima, Greg Miller, Julie Tate and Katie Zezima contributed to this report.  "

They were fans of Ferdinand Marcos, the man who ruled the Philippines for two decades before being toppled by the ""people power"" revolution of 1986. He fled to the United States with his footwear-obsessed wife, Imelda, and a not insignificant portion of the country's wealth. Since his death in 1989, the Philippines has debated what to do with his remains. His embalmed corpse has been displayed since 1993 in a glass casket in his home province. Those assembled outside the court wanted to bury him at Manila's National Heroes' Cemetery. Now, thanks to President Rodrigo Duterte, they got their wish. On Friday, Marcos was interred in a private ceremony on military land, a striking symbol of the nostalgia for the kind of strongman politics that's fueling the global rise of the populist right.   Activists and civil society groups stage a rally to protest the hero's burial accorded to former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos on November 18, 2016 in Manila, Philippines. (Dondi Tawatao/Getty Images)  The move fulfilled a campaign promise made by Duterte, who has praised the former dictator and said the burial will ""heal"" the country. Millions of Filipinos disagree.  [Imelda Marcos lobbied hard to give her late husband a 'hero's burial']  ""Ferdinand Marcos was a thief, a murderer and a dictator,"" said Vice President Leni Robredo in a statement issued Friday. ""He is no hero.""   The debate over the ceremony shows a nation divided on the weight of its authoritarian past and what that means for the future. For many Filipinos, the Marcos era was a horror that cannot and will not be forgotten. Marcos was elected in 1965 and declared martial law in 1972, during his final term in office. The suspension of democracy brought extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances and torture. Meanwhile, the Marcoses grew ridiculously, ostentatiously rich. They are believed to have made off with billions of dollars.   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos reads a statement at the Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu in 1986. (Jack Smith/AP)  But in the three decades since Ferdinand and Imelda fled, leaving behind her infamous shoe collection, their clan has largely escaped punishment and, in recent years, has even returned to public life. Imelda is a member of congress, daughter Imee is a governor, and son Ferdinand Jr., known as Bongbong, is an influential former senator who narrowly lost the race to be vice president in Duterte's government. Support for the family comes mostly from those young enough not to remember martial law and those who deny or play down what happened during Marcos's rule. In a Nov. 14 interview, Delfin Lorenzana, Duterte's secretary of national defense, denied that Marcos was directly responsible for human rights violations. ""During martial law, there were a lot of abuses that were committed, but I don't think they were sanctioned by the president,"" he said. Rehabilitating the Marcos legacy serves two political purposes: It helps secure an alliance between the new president and a powerful political clan. It also plays to a longing for a national savior who can restore ""discipline,"" a sentiment that has fueled Duterte's rise. Duterte, once nicknamed ""the death squad mayor,"" swept to power last summer on a promise to ""kill all"" the country's drug users and dealers and rid the country of crime. His bold promises impressed Filipinos fed up with the corruption of the country's ruling class. Thirty years after the ""people power"" revolution, about one quarter of people live in poverty -- Duterte vowed to help by tackling social ills. As president, Duterte has delivered the bloodshed he promised. Thousands of people identified as suspects have been killed, often after being named on ""drug lists"" compiled by neighborhood officials and the police. Faced with criticism of his ""drug war,"" Duterte has lashed out at critics at home and abroad, using sexist language to shame a senator who challenged him, lecturing President Obama on colonialism, and directing profane gestures and comments toward the European Union.  Blasting American colonialism and calling for an ""independent"" foreign policy appeal to a rising nostalgic nationalism in the country that is becoming a potent political force. The people gathered outside the court in Manila saw Duterte as Marcos's heir and someone who would create an era of pride and stability, they said.  They insisted that Marcos seized power because he had to, that he had no choice. ""If there were no problems, there would not have been martial law,"" said Grace Koo, 52.  Koo said today's drug problem justifies a similarly strong response. ""It's good that there's lots of killing,"" she said.  ""There should be due process, but there's millions of people [using drugs]. How long would that take?"" That is not far from what the president himself has said. Duterte recently said he may be forced to suspend the writ of habeas corpus to enable arrests without warrants, a plan critics called a precursor to martial law. Some Marcos-loving supporters said that would be fine. ""Martial law was the best time that happened in the Philippines,"" said Artemio Lachica, a 74-year-old retired teacher. Duterte will follow in Marcos's footsteps, for the good of the nation, because he has no choice, he said. ""Duterte wants to duplicate what Marcos has done.""

Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director	" President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) as CIA director, a pair of hard-line conservatives who offer early signs of the shape of Trump's Cabinet. Trump also confirmed the news reported a day earlier that he has selected retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as his national security adviser, a position that, unlike the other two, does not need to be confirmed by the Senate. ""The president-elect is a man of action, and we've got a great number of men and women with great qualifications who look forward to serving in this administration,"" Vice President-elect Mike Pence told reporters in New York. ""Our agency teams arrived in Washington D.C. this morning, and I am very confident it will be a smooth transition that will serve to lead this country forward.""   [Jeff Sessions is Donald Trump's biggest fan. Here's how their relationship began.]  The announcements were greeted with widespread applause from Republicans, but Democrats and civil rights groups denounced Sessions and Flynn for their hard-line views on Muslims and immigrants that have put them in close alignment with Trump. The criticism could portend a messy Senate confirmation process for Sessions, though several of his GOP colleagues, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), lavished praise on him.

Flynn has spoken out frequently against radical Islam and clashed with the Obama administration while serving as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, from where he was ousted in 2014. Sessions supported Trump's call last year for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and has called for deporting millions of people who are in the country illegally.

(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)   GOP officials working with the Trump transition operation said that the president-elect plans to meet Friday with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R), amid reports he is being considered to be U.S. ambassador to Israel. Also spotted at Trump Tower on Friday was Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), reportedly a candidate for defense secretary. Among those Trump will meet with on Saturday are former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who has been cited as a possible candidate for secretary of state, former D.C. public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts and retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, whose name also has been mentioned as a potential defense secretary nominee. Meantime, the Trump transition named agency landing teams for the departments of Defense, State and Justice, along with the National Security Council, to help smooth the transfer of power in the weeks leading up to Trump's inauguration Jan. 20.  Sessions, 69, was Trump's first endorser in the Senate and quickly became the then-candidate's chief resource on policy, but the fourth-term senator has been dogged by accusations of racism throughout his career.  In 1986, he was denied a federal judgeship after former colleagues testified before a Senate committee that he joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought they were ""okay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana."" ""If you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man,"" Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) said in a statement. ""No senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, immigrants, and people of color than Sen. Sessions."" The NAACP wrote in a Twitter message that Sessions's nomination is ""deeply troubling, and supports and old, ugly history where Civil Rights were not regarded as core American values."" Sean Spicer, a Republican National Committee spokesman who has been assisting the Trump transition operation, said on a conference call with reporters that the nominees' personal view ""isn't what matters. You are serving the president-elect of the United States and his views . . . Everybody who serves in a Trump administration will serve Donald Trump and Mike Pence. They will implement their vision and their ideas.""  South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R), appearing at a Federalist Society convention in Washington, did not mention Trump's nominees in her remarks. But Haley, whose parents immigrated from India, urged the Republican Party to remind the public that it is the party who will offer opportunities ""to all citizens, regardless of their race, gender or where they are born and raised."" Sessions served as a U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and as Alabama's attorney general. In a statement, he said there was ""no greater honor"" than to lead the Justice Department. ""I enthusiastically embrace President-elect Trump's vision for 'one America,' and his commitment to equal justice under law,"" Sessions said in a statement. ""I look forward to fulfilling my duties with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality."" Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz), a key Judiciary Committee member who had been wary of Trump during the campaign, intends to support Sessions's nomination, his office said. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), also at the Federalist Society convention in Washington, said that Sessions would make an ""extraordinary"" attorney general. ""He is a committed and deeply principled conservative,"" Cruz said. Several Senate Democrats pledged a rigorous confirmation review.  Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who will become Minority Leader in January, said Sessions's rhetoric and opposition to a comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 make him ""very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division."" But some conservatives suggested it would be politically damaging to Democrats if they attempt to block Trump's nominees. ""Mr. Trump has a plane and double-digit victories where Senate Democrats are up for reelection,"" said Leonard A. Leo, executive vice president of The Federalist Society.

A U.S. Military Academy and Harvard Law School graduate, he has a varied background. He served as a U.S. Army cavalry officer before founding an aerospace company, serving as president of an oil-field equipment manufacturing firm and -- in a brief, little-known chapter of his early career -- was an attorney with the Washington, D.C. mega-law firm Williams and Connolly. He currently serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and is a close ally of Pence. ""He has served our country with honor and spent his life fighting for the security of our citizens,"" Trump said of Pompeo in a statement. Notably, Pompeo backed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) over Trump in the Republican presidential primary. In May, a Pompeo spokesman gave a somewhat tepid endorsement, saying the congressman would ""support the nominee of the Republican Party because Hillary Clinton cannot be president of the United States.""  Pompeo is a vocal critic of President Obama's nuclear accord with Iran. ""I look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism,"" he tweeted Thursday, before his offer to become CIA director was public. The choices of Sessions and Pompeo follow Trump's decision to offer the position of national security adviser to Flynn, and confirm the president-elect's desire to assemble his Cabinet by naming national security and law enforcement leaders first.  [Trump's pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy]  At the same time, Trump is soliciting the help of Romney, a mainstream consensus figure who had been the face of the Republican resistance to Trump's candidacy, in assembling his government. Trump sought a meeting with Romney, who had fiercely criticized him during the campaign, to broker peace -- and Sessions, a vice chairman of Trump's transition, told reporters that Trump could consider the 2012 GOP presidential nominee for an administration position, perhaps secretary of state. The presence of Flynn and Romney in Trump's orbit sends mixed signals to already jittery leaders around the globe, as well as officials in Washington's foreign policy community, about the tone and substance of the Trump administration's posture to the world. Flynn, who would hold the most powerful national security position, is a retired three-star general and decorated intelligence officer who established a close relationship with Trump while campaigning at his side this year. His behavior and a string of controversial and dark statements about Islam, among other topics, have alarmed many of his former colleagues. Trump's selection of Flynn comes after the president-elect enraged Democrats and civil rights groups by appointing Stephen K. Bannon, former chairman of Breitbart News, an alt-right news site that has become a forum for the white nationalist movement, as his chief strategist and senior counselor in the White House.

That might have helped elect Trump.	" Many undergraduates, their fawn-like eyes wide with astonishment, are wondering: Why didn't the dean of students prevent the election from disrupting the serenity to which my school has taught me that I am entitled? Campuses create ""safe spaces"" where students can shelter from discombobulating thoughts and receive spiritual balm for the trauma of microaggressions. Yet the presidential election came without trigger warnings? The morning after the election, normal people rose -- some elated, some despondent -- and went off to actual work. But at Yale University, that incubator of late-adolescent infants, a professor responded to ""heartfelt notes"" from students ""in shock"" by making that day's exam optional. Academia should consider how it contributed to, and reflects Americans' judgments pertinent to, Donald Trump's election. The compound of childishness and condescension radiating from campuses is a reminder to normal Americans of the decay of protected classes -- in this case, tenured faculty and cosseted students. As ""bias-response teams"" fanned out across campuses, an incident report was filed about a University of Northern Colorado student who wrote ""free speech matters"" on one of 680 ""#languagematters"" posters that cautioned against politically incorrect speech. Catholic DePaul University denounced as ""bigotry"" a poster proclaiming ""Unborn Lives Matter."" Bowdoin College provided counseling to students traumatized by the cultural appropriation committed by a sombrero-and-tequila party. Oberlin College students said they were suffering breakdowns because schoolwork was interfering with their political activism. California State University at Los Angeles established ""healing"" spaces for students to cope with the pain caused by a political speech delivered three months earlier . Indiana University experienced social-media panic (""Please PLEASE PLEASE be careful out there tonight"") because a Catholic priest in a white robe, with a rope-like belt and rosary beads, was identified as someone ""in a KKK outfit holding a whip."" A doctoral dissertation at the University of California at Santa Barbara uses ""feminist methodologies"" to understand how Girl Scout cookie sales ""reproduce hegemonic gender roles."" The journal GeoHumanities explores how pumpkins reveal ""racial and class coding of rural versus urban places."" Another journal's article analyzes ""the relationships among gender, science, and glaciers."" A Vassar College lecture ""theorizes oscillating relations between disciplinary, pre-emptive and increasingly prehensive forms of power that shape human and non-human materialities in Palestine."" Even professors' books from serious publishers are clotted with pretentious jargon. To pick just one from innumerable examples, a recent history of the Spanish Civil War, published by the Oxford University Press, says that Franco's Spain was as ""hierarchizing"" as Hitler's Germany, that Catholicism ""problematized"" relations between Spain and the Third Reich, and that liberalism and democracy are concepts that must be ""interrogated."" Only the highly educated write so badly. Indeed, the point of such ludicrous prose is to signal membership in a closed clerisy that possesses a private language. An American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA) study -- ""No U.S. History? How College History Departments Leave the United States out of the Major,"" based on requirements and course offerings at 75 leading colleges and universities -- found that ""the overwhelming majority of America's most prestigious institutions do not require even the students who major in history to take a single course on United States history or government."" Often ""microhistories"" are offered to history majors at schools that require these majors to take no U.S. history course: ""Modern Addiction: Cigarette Smoking in the 20th Century"" (Swarthmore College), ""Lawn Boy Meets Valley Girl"" (Bowdoin College), ""Witchcraft and Possession"" (University of Pennsylvania).  At some schools that require history majors to take at least one U.S. history course, the requirement can be fulfilled with courses like ""Mad Men and Mad Women"" (Middlebury College), ""Hip-Hop, Politics and Youth Culture in America"" (University of Connecticut) and ""Jews in American Entertainment"" (University of Texas at Austin). Constitutional history is an afterthought. Small wonder, then, that a recent ACTA-commissioned survey found that less than half of college graduates knew that George Washington was the commanding general at Yorktown; that nearly half did not know that Theodore Roosevelt was important to the construction of the Panama Canal; that more than one-third could not place the Civil War in a correct 20-year span or identify Franklin Roosevelt as the architect of the New Deal; that 58 percent did not know that the Battle of the Bulge occurred in World War II; and that nearly half did not know the lengths of the terms of U.S. senators and representatives. Institutions of supposedly higher education are awash with hysteria, authoritarianism, obscurantism, philistinism and charlatanry. Which must have something to do with the tone and substance of the presidential election, which took the nation's temperature.  Read more from George F. Will's archive or follow him on Facebook.

He was 94. His grandson, Raymond Dennis Large III, said that Laird died in Florida. Laird left a legacy that included a telephone call that eventually played a role in one of the biggest political stories of the century -- the Watergate scandal that drove Nixon from office. Laird was Nixon's counselor on domestic affairs in October 1973 when Nixon had to replace Vice President Spiro Agnew, who had resigned in scandal. Laird called his good friend, Michigan Rep. Gerald Ford, to ask if he would be interested in replacing Agnew.  ""Frankly, the question came like a bolt out of the blue,"" Ford said in 1997, recalling his conversation with the ""can-do conservative"" from Wisconsin. Ford accepted. About a year later, Nixon resigned because of Watergate and Ford became president. Ford pardoned Nixon, and two years later, Ford lost the presidential election to Jimmy Carter.  ""I thought Ford was the right person to bring the country together after the Watergate fiasco,"" Laird once said, taking credit with Bryce Harlow for persuading Nixon to pick Ford. Ford once praised Laird as a patriot before a partisan. His grandson Large, who is the son of Alison Laird Large, called his grandfather ""one of the lions of our republic.""  ""He truly was someone that worked across party lines,"" Large said. ""He was a very dedicated Republican but he was able to see the human in everyone. His work speaks for itself."" Former Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, is married to Laird's niece Jessica. He said that Laird remained engaged with public issues until the end of his life.  ""Even at the end Jessica would get two, sometimes more, letters a week from him, handwritten letters. I think last week she had one discussing the election, public issues, his views of things."" Laird, the son of a Presbyterian minister, was 30 when he was elected to the U.S. House in 1952. He represented Wisconsin's 7th District -- mostly dairy-farming or lumber-producing counties in central Wisconsin -- for nine terms, and was credited with helping spearhead the vast expansion of medical research and health facilities in the U.S. Nixon appointed Laird as the nation's 10th defense secretary in 1969 and the first to come from Congress. The Vietnam War raged, with no end in sight for the 550,000 troops stationed in the Southeast Asian country as America lost its resolve for the fighting. Laird coined the term ""Vietnamization"" to describe Nixon's policy of assigning an ever-increasing combat role to South Vietnamese troops, allowing the pullout of U.S. forces. When Laird stepped down as defense secretary in January 1973, there were about 69,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam.  ""As a consequence of the success of the military aspects of Vietnamization, the South Vietnamese people today, in my view, are fully capable of providing for their own in-country security against the North Vietnamese,"" he said at the time. However, Saigon fell under communist control in 1975. But the problem, Laird wrote later, was not Vietnamization but the United States' failure to provide continued financial support while the Soviet Union was sending Hanoi far more than the limit it had agreed to.  ""We grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory ... when Congress cut off the funding for South Vietnam that had allowed it to continue to fight on its own,"" he wrote in 2005 in the publication Foreign Affairs. While at the Pentagon, Laird ended the military draft and established the all-volunteer force. ""It's been a very successful program,"" he said in 1997. ""I am very proud that I was there as secretary of defense to start it."" Doyle said Laird will be viewed ""through the crucible of Vietnam"" but it shouldn't be lost on people that he ended the draft. He was also proud to be a politician and viewed it as an honorable profession, Doyle said.  ""He was a Republican that really believed government was a worthy cause, that politics was a worthy effort,"" he said. In 1973, Nixon brought Laird to the White House as counselor on domestic affairs. Several months later, the Watergate crisis deepening, Laird resigned. The Laird Center, a complex for medical research at Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin, is named after Laird, who grew up in Marshfield. Laird often said Marshfield Clinic doctors encouraged him to get involved in health issues after he was elected to Congress, including his involvement in legislation that made health maintenance organizations possible. Laird was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on Sept. 1, 1922, and the family moved to Marshfield when he was a young child. He graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota in 1942 and served aboard the Navy destroyer U.S.S. Maddox in the Pacific during World War II. Laird was elected to his first political office in 1946, when he succeeded his late father, Melvin Sr., as a state senator in the Wisconsin Legislature. At the time, Laird, only 23, was the youngest state senator in the United States. When the Laird Center was dedicated, Henry Kissinger recalled the many power struggles he had, as Nixon's national security adviser, with Secretary of Defense Laird, needling him on a day when political nostalgia and good humor filled the air.  ""I always sent deputies to deal with him, and I would give them several pieces of advice,"" Kissinger said in his deadpan voice. ""First, you must remember Mel Laird is extremely smart. Second, he knows he is extremely smart. Third, he will let you know he is extremely smart. Fourth, it is much less painful to let him do what he wants. Fifth, when he says, 'You know what I mean,' there is no conceivable way you could know what he means. And sixth, when he calls to complain about a newspaper story, you know he has put it out himself."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In the Baltimore region, racist graffiti has been scrawled across bathroom walls in suburban schools, frightened immigrant students have sought reassurance that they would not be deported, and principals have instructed staff and students to act with civility and respect.  ""With such an emotionally charged election, it is natural that our students are entering our building and bringing in what they hear,"" said Hope Baier, coordinator of Baltimore County Public Schools' office of school counseling. ""We have to have these really raw discussions."" Even a superintendent has entered the fray. When Dallas Dance retweeted a message about caring for nonwhite students after President-elect Donald J. Trump's stunning victory last week, politicians and parents lambasted the Baltimore County superintendent. Educators said they are trying to encourage calm and reasoned discussion. They want to help their students make sense of a deeply polarized electorate while encouraging them to understand and respect the views of classmates with different backgrounds and political perspectives. Thousands, including many young people, have staged protests in cities nationwide since Trump's election. That has brought a backlash from conservatives, who say that the nation needs to unite behind Trump and that his supporters are being unfairly characterized as racist, misogynistic and xenophobic. Teachers are expected to remain politically neutral, but educators said they cannot ignore the fallout from a presidential campaign marked by debates that singled out Latin American immigrants, Muslim refugees and black communities, and caused anxiety among some students from those groups.  ""It has been a very emotional week for a lot of students,"" said James LeMon, principal of Wilde Lake High School in Howard County. ""There are obviously two different opinions on the election and the outcome. We are going to have an outlet for student voices."" LeMon said he plans to offer small groups of students the opportunity to gather in the school cafeteria for guided dialogues starting this week. Seated at round tables, students will be able to discuss issues while a teacher moderates. Atholton High School in Howard County has been roiled by an incident in which a white student took a picture of herself in blackface and flashing a peace sign, and posted it on Facebook, with a message containing a racial slur. Elsewhere in Howard County, administrators reported ""inappropriate"" graffiti on Murray Hill Middle School's building. They declined to release details of the message, only saying it could be described as racially or religiously intolerant. And in Harford County, a racist sentiment was written across the bottom of a flier announcing a December blood drive at Fallston High School. School counselors and psychologists said distraught students should be given the chance to vent their feelings and help with channeling any confusion and anger in a positive direction. Shreya Hessler, a child psychologist in private practice, said teachers and parents can help foster a healthy discussion by sharing their own feelings. The youngest children have some of the most difficult and insightful questions, she said. For example, she said, they may ask why the adults can't get along, or why can't they sit down and talk to one another. She said children, who are expected to listen to teachers and work with fellow students, can have difficulty understanding the divisive nature of American politics. Older children can learn to advocate for change, even in very small ways, she said. ""Are there things that can be done to make your voice heard?,"" she asks children. ""Are you willing to hear the person on the other side?"" Teachers said they are endeavoring to give students the space to express their views in a constructive way. The conversations have taken place in hallways, in forums after school and among small groups of students. Many said this is a teachable moment. Howard County Superintendent Renee Foose released a statement encouraging dialogue in schools about the checks and balances in government and ""what it means to live in a diverse and inclusive society."" Carroll County administrators reminded teachers to remain politically neutral and encouraged them to facilitate a conversation if students had questions or wanted to discuss the election results. Baier, in Baltimore County, said schools aren't just teaching academic subjects; they are also focused on social emotional learning. She sees the election as an opportunity for schools to teach students how to cope with disappointments.  ""What we know is that all voices need to be heard and respected,"" she said, adding that students need to learn to disagree respectfully. Some teachers are digging into how the U.S. government works and the checks and balances that keep the American president from being the country's sole authority figure. On the morning after Election Day, social studies teacher Rashawna Sydnor said an African-American student asked if he would be sent to Africa when Trump becomes president. She told him he has rights as a citizen of the United States. After getting several more questions from scared and confused students, Sydnor dropped her lesson plans and decided to teach students about the branches of government, the importance of voting, and the Electoral College. She also showed students parts of a documentary about the 1965 civil rights march from Selma, Alabama, to the state's capital as part of a campaign to gain voting rights for black people. The lessons are paying off and her students seemed much calmer Monday, she said. Students are now discussing the attitudes of Trump supporters. ""Not everybody who supports him have these negative attitudes toward people of color,"" she told them. Steven Johnson, a social studies teacher at ConneXions, a West Baltimore charter arts school for students in grades six through 12, had been teaching his students about immigration the week of the election. Many of his students had not had much contact with people from other countries, so Johnson decided to take the class across the city to visit Patterson High School, where half the student body is made up of students who recently arrived in this country. The students from the two schools had plenty to discuss at the event called ""Building Bridges, Not Walls."" Salam Gebremichael, 16, told two middle school girls about how she balanced water on top of her head when she was just 10 years old in Sudan. Daisha and Kelsey Hummer, both 13, asked her why she left her country and how she ended up in Baltimore.  ""We are Christian,"" Gebremichael said. ""In Sudan they kill all the Christians."" At the end of the visit, Ahchaadbarkayakyah McNeill, 12, another ConneXions student, said he wanted to go to high school at Patterson so he could learn new languages from the other students. He also had a new view of the city where he lives.  ""The way I see, it is poverty and violence,"" McNeill said of Baltimore. ""The way they see it -- they like it here."" Some students have joined the postelection protests; others have staged their own. One evening last week, a few dozen high school students gathered at the Washington Monument in Mount Vernon. They held hands and chanted, ""Love trumps hate!"" and ""United we stand, divided we fall!"" The students -- from Baltimore School for the Arts, City College, Polytechnic Institute and Western -- said they opposed Trump's views on many issues.  ""We decided to have this rally to remind ourselves and our classmates and anybody in our community that we still have a voice,"" said Abby Pelton, 18, a senior at the Baltimore School for the Arts. ""We can say no to Donald Trump's policies if we disagree with them, and we will.""  ""It's also about asking everyone in America to come together and rally as a people,"" said Daniel Imhoff, an 18-year-old senior from Baltimore School for the Arts. ""We are so divided right now."" Towson High School student Aislinn Bratt, who's also the student representative on the Baltimore County school board, said the election got students talking to each other. They're also taking more of an interest in how the government operates and how foreign and domestic policies are set.  ""The message that many are responding to the election with is one of love and acceptance ... that America is home to all different people, regardless of their race, religion, gender, or political views,"" she said. ___ Baltimore Sun reporter Alison Knezevich contributed to this article. ___ Information from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
