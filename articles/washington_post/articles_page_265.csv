But at the Sarajevo War Hostel, guests have the luxury of knowing they won't be killed, starved or lose family or friends. And unlike the Sarajevans who actually endured the 1992-95 war, the visitors can leave any time. Those who check in to the War Hostel are greeted by the owner wearing a helmet and a flak jacket. They get to sleep in rooms with just one bulb on the ceiling, running on a car battery. The plastic sheets on the windows are just like the ones the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees handed out to Sarajevans so they could replace window glass shattered by bombs. At night, they use candles to move around the hostel and to read by. The walls are plastered with wartime newspaper articles -- most of them from The Associated Press -- depicting the daily struggle in besieged Sarajevo. At the War Hostel, visitors quickly discover it is one thing to watch people surviving wars on TV. But it is really something else to spend the night on a sponge mattress on the floor, covered with military blankets, and in the darkness listen to the sound of exploding bombs outside. A tape of the bombs plays all night long. In a makeshift bunker and by candlelight, the hostel owner, Zero One, 25, shares with guests his childhood memories of wartime and the postwar era, and tells them how wars can influence people's lives forever. His birth name is Arijan Kurbasic, but he calls himself Zero One, the wartime code name used by his father, who was a soldier in the Bosnian Army. The code name conceals his ethnic background.  ""I just want to be identified as a human being as this was the most important thing to be during the war. Either you are one or you are not,"" he explained. ""Zero One I chose to honor my father."" The war unfolded after Yugoslavia fell apart and its republics declared independence one after the other. Nationalist politicians were determined to divide the new country of Bosnia and Herzegovina along ethnic lines and pitted the country's Muslim Bosniaks, Roman Catholic Croats and Christian Orthodox Serbs against each other. However, Sarajevo, as well as other parts of Bosnia, were ethnically diverse and many locals rejected the nationalist plans -- for which they paid a high price. The Serb siege of Sarajevo went on for 46 months -- precisely 1,425 days -- longer than the siege of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, during World War II. Sarajevo's 380,000 people were left without food, electricity, water or heating, as they hid from snipers and the average 330 shells a day that smashed into the city. Over 100,000 people were killed during the Bosnian war, 11,541 of them in Sarajevo. Guests appreciate the intensity of the hostel simulation. ""The best way to learn about something is usually experience,"" said Andrew Burns, 21, a hostel guest from the U.S. ""It provides emotions behind events. I can read a textbook all I want, but most of that information escapes from the mind immediately. But when I come here and I see people who talk about their experiences, that makes it real, that makes me want to learn about it, to try to help, try to love."" Zero One also offers guests a chance to watch documentaries about the siege, and can organize tours of the city's war sites, like the front lines and a tunnel Sarajevans dug under the airport runway to connect the city with the outside world.  ""They come here, they experience this and it changes their perspectives,"" Zero One says of his guests. ""For one or two nights, to live like this, it changes their views and then they appreciate their own life, they appreciate water, they appreciate comfort, they appreciate a bed, they appreciate everything else. . It really gives them a different perspective and that is the whole point of this."" Guests agree that the War Hostel is ""unique,"" as Eren Bastaymaz, 30, from Turkey, put it. ""You can find better hostels anywhere in the world, but this atmosphere, I've never seen anything like this before."" ___ Associated Press Sabina Niksic contributed to this story from Sarajevo. ___ If You Go...

A statement from the attorney general's office said an army doctor and the officer in charge of the training program are also under arrest. The statement issued Thursday says the seven were detained on charges of abusing their power and causing physical harm, as well as failing to help someone in need. The two soldiers, both age 20, died in September when temperatures in the training area exceeded 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit.) The training course was halted and the Defense Ministry ordered an investigation. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The center-left Social Democratic Party, environmentalist Greens and ex-communist Left party won enough seats in September's vote for a majority in the German capital's assembly. Another German state, Thuringia, became the first to get such a governing coalition in 2014. Some left-wing politicians are proposing the parties could form a national government following next year's general election. The leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats in the Berlin assembly, Florian Graf, said Thursday his party would consider voting with the nationalist Alternative for Germany, if necessary.

Cleanthis Georgiades, president of Cyprus Sports Organization, said that those involved in match-fixing are ""extremely dangerous"" people, with huge financial interests at stake. Earlier this week, the Cyprus Football Association vowed to impose severe penalties on clubs suspected of match-fixing after UEFA ranked the country's championship to be among the worst offenders in Europe. UEFA suspects six first-division matches and a domestic cup match may have been fixed since September, said Marios Lefkaritis, a vice president at UEFA and honorary president of the Cyprus Football Association.. The Cyprus FA has received files on 75 matches suspected of being fixed since 2011, Lefkaritis said. Georgiades said the situation was out of control.  ""If authorities are going to stamp this out, legislation must be passed that unties their hands because it's wiretapping that helps crack such cases,"" he told The Associated Press. Cyprus Justice Minister Ionas Nicolaou said legislation is expected to go to parliament for a vote in January, Meanwhile, police said a pre-dawn bomb blast on Thursday damaged the entrance of the Limassol offices of an insurance company headed by Cyprus FA chief Costakis Koutsokoumnis. Police spokesman Andreas Angelides said it was too early to definitely link the attack to the issue of match-fixing. Koutsokoumnis appeared to allude to the bomb attack in a written message on his personal Facebook page, saying, ""When you make reforms, you occasionally have to pay the price.""

Ghareb Khidir, spokesman for Sudan's foreign ministry, said on Thursday the Russian gesture gives ""strong support to the African position against the ICC,"" describing the court as a ""total failure."" Three African nations announced plans to withdraw and Russia, which is not an ICC member, snubbed the ICC with President Vladimir Putin signing Wednesday a symbolic decree to withdraw from the court. Khidir says he hopes the departures of South Africa, Burundi and Gambia from the ICC and Putin's gesture would prompt others to withdraw. Russia is not an ICC member since Moscow never ratified the Rome Statute that created the court. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

PAUL, Minn. -- A Minnesota prosecutor who filed manslaughter charges Wednesday against a police officer in the death of motorist Philando Castile detailed the deadly encounter July 6 between Castile and officer Jeronimo Yanez. The following excerpt from John Choi's remarks closely matches a criminal complaint. In his remarks, Choi also mentioned Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds: Officer Yanez asked Castile to produce his driver's license and proof of insurance. Castile first provided him with his insurance card. Castile then, calmly, and in a non-threatening manner, informed Officer Yanez: ""Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me."" Before Castile completed the sentence, Officer Yanez interrupted and calmly replied: ""OK,"" and placed his right hand on the holster of his own, holstered, gun. Officer Yanez then said: ""OK, don't reach for it, then."" Castile tried to respond but was interrupted by Officer Yanez, who said: ""Don't pull it out."" Castile responded, ""I'm not pulling it out,"" and Reynolds also responded by saying: ""He's not pulling it out."" Then Officer Yanez screamed, ""Don't pull it out!"" and quickly pulled his own gun with his right hand while he reached inside the driver's side window with his left hand. Officer Yanez pulled his left arm out of the car, and then fired seven shots in rapid succession into the vehicle. The seventh and final shot was fired at 9:06 and two seconds p.m. After the final shot, Reynolds frantically yelled: ""You just killed my boyfriend!"" Philando Castile moaned and uttered his final words: ""I wasn't reaching for it."" To which Reynolds loudly said: ""He wasn't reaching for it."" Before Reynolds completed her sentence, Officer Yanez again screamed: ""Don't pull it out!"" Reynolds responded by saying: ""He wasn't."" ___ Online: Choi's prepared remarks, video of his news conference and other documents are available at: http://bit.ly/2ghHHa1 Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

However, the backing of the deal by Yemeni rebels, also known as Houthis, was a moot point since Yemen's internationally-recognized government has already dismissed the plan as ""unilateral,"" saying it was not involved in recent talks between Kerry and a Houthi delegation in Oman. On the ground, government forces expelled rebels from several districts in the western city of Taiz while an international rights group issued a damning report on Thursday, criticizing the Houthis' detentions of political opponents. Human Rights Watch said the Shiite rebels have carried out hundreds of unlawful detentions and torture since capturing the country's capital, Sanaa. The New York-based group said it has documented two deaths in custody and 11 cases of alleged torture and abuses. HRW also called upon the Houthis in Sanaa to hold officials accountable and to release the detainees -- without forcing them to sign false confessions of cooperating with a Saudi-led coalition that is waging a war to expel the Houthis from territory the rebels captured. Sarah Leah Whitson, the Mideast director at Human Rights Watch, said the war between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition ""provides no justification for torture and 'disappearance' of perceived opponents."" Houthis descended from their northern enclave in 2014 to take Sanaa and much of northern Yemen. The rebels forced President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee the country and seek shelter in Saudi Arabia, which subsequently launched the intervention by mostly Gulf Arab states that has consisted mainly of a punishing air campaign. The airstrikes, together with the ground fighting, have pushed the already impoverished nation to the brink of famine and displaced nearly three million people. The conflict has killed over 4,000 civilians. In his announcement, Kerry said the cease-fire was supposed to start on Thursday and lead to the formation of a unity government before the end of the year. Mohammed Abdel-Salam, the Houthis spokesman, told Al-Masirah TV late on Wednesday that the rebels agreed to the deal. The peace plane, however, sidelines Hadi, transfers his authorities to a newly appointed vice president, and gives the Houthis a share of power. Residents in Taiz, one of the worst-hit cities in Yemen's conflict, said fighting escalated in the city's eastern districts. Images were posted on social media showing pro-government fighters on tanks and armored vehicles, flashing the victory sign in front of newly captured positions, including the city's military hospital. Airstrikes resumed on other Yemen front lines: in the eastern province of Marib, outside of Sanaa, and in the northern Houthi stronghold of Saada. Dozens were killed and wounded in the fighting but a precise death toll among fighters from the two sides was not available. The residents spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety.

The city is under pressure from the state and federal governments -- and local environmentalists -- to stop allowing overflows from its combined stormwater and sewer system, which happen every time it rains more than a trace. The council earlier this year approved a $188 million plan to catch and hold the overflows from three of its four outfalls, which drain south into Hunting Creek and then into the Potomac. But the council said it would wait until 2032 to study how to address the biggest overflow, the one that dumps sewage directly into Oronoco Bay at the foot of Pendleton Street. On Wednesday, the council voted to have the city environmental services office launch its study of how to address the Oronoco outfall in 2018. Planning would start in 2026, followed by construction in the 2030s.  [Alexandria's Old Town spews 11 million gallons of raw sewage into Potomac]       The council voted in May to build a 1.6-million-gallon storage tunnel and a 3-million-gallon holding tank for the three outfalls that empty south of the Capital Beltway.  The state Department of Environmental Quality, which must approve the sewer repair plan, sent the city a letter in mid-October questioning its assumptions on rainfall. That tunnel and tank project would be paid for with bonds, potentially adding $10 to $15 per month to the average residential sewer bill, which now ranges from $45 to $60. City officials say a similar fix at the Oronoco site would probably add another $12.50 a month to sewer bills. Mayor Allison Silberberg (D) and council member Paul Smedberg (D) have asked state lawmakers who represent Alexandria to seek state money to defray some of those costs. A spokesman for the Potomac Riverkeeper Network on Thursday called the city's decision to alter its time frame ""spinning to a ridiculous degree,""and argued that the years-long studies are merely foot-dragging because the technology to address the overflows is well established. ""That is unacceptable to us and should be unacceptable to the citizens of Alexandria who want to recreate in the river safely,"" said Phillip Musegaas, vice president of programs and litigation for the environmental group. ""To us, it makes no sense to deal with half the problem now and push the other half of the problem far down the road."" Silberberg said city officials are moving as fast as they can. ""This issue has been festering in the city not just for years, but decades,"" she said. ""Given the magnitude of the construction that will be necessary, the city's timeline is a reasonable and responsible approach."" More than 800 cities nationwide are grappling with sewer-overflow issues, including Chicago, Philadelphia and the District, which is building a $2.6 billion, 13-mile tunnel to store sewage and rainwater en route to the Blue Plains wastewater-treatment plant, just across the river from Alexandria. Until this week, Alexandria planned to address the North Old Town sewage overflow in the short term by requiring separate sewage and stormwater systems in new projects and encouraging installation of permeable pavement, green roofs and more trees.  After pushback from some residents, environmentalists and state Sen. Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax), whose legislative district lies just south of Alexandria, the council decided to also speed up its plan to study of what else might be needed. At their meeting, council members credited local activist Jack Sullivan, who wrote a report to a citizens advisory committee recommendation, for pushing them to come up with a more proactive plan for Oronoco Bay. Silberberg said his effort was ""a great reminder that one citizen can make a difference.""  Sullivan called the council's action ""a step in the right direction"" Thursday, and said he was glad the council had ""acknowledged that we have an obligation to clean up"" the Oronoco Bay sewage overflow as well as others.

High-spirited high school students marched through San Francisco's downtown, chanting ""not my president"" and holding signs urging a Donald Trump eviction. They waved rainbow banners and Mexican flags, as bystanders in the heavily Democratic city high-fived the marchers from the sidelines.  ""As a white, queer person, we need unity with people of color, we need to stand up,"" said Claire Bye, a 15-year-old sophomore at Academy High School. ""I'm fighting for my rights as an LGBTQ person. I'm fighting for the rights of brown people, black people, Muslim people."" In New York City, about a hundred protesters gathered at Union Square in Manhattan to protest a Trump presidency. They held signs that read ""Divided States of America"" and ""Not My President"" and ""Let the New Generation Speak!!"" At a subway station along 14th Street, New Yorkers expressed their thoughts -- ""Time to Fight Back"" and ""Keep the Faith! Our work is just beginning!"" -- along the walls of a walkway using sticky notes.     More than 1,000 protesters marched in New Haven, Conn., Nov. 10, against the election of Donald Trump as president. (The Washington Post)   On Twitter, Trump supporters accused protesters of not respecting the process because it didn't work out in their favor.  ""You're literally protesting against free democratic elections. Go live in North Korea, you absolute trash,"" one said. ""They're not protesting Trump, they're protesting democracy and the right to disagree with them. Isn't that fascism,"" said another. Thousands demonstrated Wednesday around the country, from New England to Kansas City to the West Coast. Flames lit up the night sky in California cities as protesters burned a giant papier-mache Trump head in Los Angeles and started fires in Oakland intersections. In Chicago, where thousands had recently poured into the streets to celebrate the Chicago Cubs' first World Series victory in over a century, several thousand people marched through the Loop. They gathered outside Trump Tower, chanting ""Not my president!"" Since Tuesday night, protesters have marched in the Midwest, including St. Paul, Minnesota, Omaha, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Missouri. Marchers protesting Trump's election chanted and carried signs in front of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. ___ Associated Press writer Janie Har in San Francisco contributed to this report.

"    Are we addicted? Election obsessives can't bear to miss a single tiny detail of this race, as if watching helps exert some measure of control. (Amy Cavenaile/The Washington Post; iStock)  Looking back, could Mary Louise O'Brien see a moment when her addiction got out of control? Perhaps it was this summer, when instead of going to bed, she passed out on the couch night after night, listening to the comforting words of Rachel Maddow. Or when she caught herself sneaking election news on her smartphone so her husband wouldn't see her doing it. Was it when she started checking the political polls every 10 minutes, just in case Donald Trump started surging? ""I am obsessed, just totally obsessed,"" said O'Brien, 69, a retired military librarian and Hillary Clinton supporter in Norfolk who has never been so consumed by an election. She is constantly checking into election forecasting sites such as Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight. ""Because, you know, Nate Silver updates every three minutes."" What was the moment for all of us -- when, whatever our politics, we crossed over from avid news consumers to something more rabid? Maybe scientists will someday study our brains and find this moment etched into the neurons, the way fire scars are preserved in the rings of a tree. Much has been said about the portion of the electorate disgusted with both choices, disengaged from the process -- but there are also those so bullish on their candidates -- or so frightened by the alternative -- that they cannot bear to look away. Even before the FBI announced, murkily, that it was looking at a new trove of maybe-relevant emails, Clinton supporters knew better than to count on all those landslide predictions. Trump supporters, meanwhile, know that the polls don't look so great for them, but what about the ""hidden vote?"" We talk about wishing it was all over, but we can't let it go. Like football fans superstitious about their ""lucky"" underwear, election obsessives can't bear to miss a single tiny detail of this race, as if watching helps exert some measure of control. ""There's a sense of foreboding for a lot of people, that there's so much at stake this year that we have to make the right decision,"" said Jay McConville, a business development consultant and former chairman of the Fairfax County Republican Committee, who checks social media and news sites for political nuggets first thing in the morning and last thing at night and ""innumerable times a day."" Everyone around him is doing it; even his mother-in-law, who had never been involved, he said, is practically tethered to Fox News.  [Face it, America: You loved having a celebrity candidate. So who will it be next?]  Election obsessives check Twitter, CNN, Reuters Polling, NBC, the BBC, Politico and RealClearPolitics hourly, in a compulsive loop. They use the word ""vigilance."" They report having election dreams. They have bathroom speakers in the shower playing the ""NPR Politics Podcast"" and Vox's ""The Weeds."" They check PredictIt, the political prediction market where traders buy and sell shares on the political future, to see whether everyone is thinking what they're thinking. People who normally geek out on baseball stats are delving into the methodology of the polls instead. Some rave about a squiggly electoral-vote chart on FiveThirtyEight known as ""The Snake."" ""I love The Snake,"" one person said. ""It's beautiful."" 'It's like this sick thing' Tom, a Department of Homeland Security contractor, had never worked the phones for a candidate, but this election he has made 2,312 calls on behalf of Trump. He didn't want his last name used in this story because ""Trump is rather unpopular in D.C."" and he feared his support could harm his reputation. Since the primaries, he has been placing money on various electoral outcomes at PredictIt, where he's betting that Clinton will win fewer than 360 electoral votes. He said he woke up at 3:15 a.m. on five consecutive nights to eyeball the USC Dornsife-Los Angeles Times ""Daybreak"" poll as it was updated. Wait -- the USC Dornsife-Los Angeles Times ""Daybreak"" poll, you say? ""That poll tends to favor Trump,"" Chris O'Brien said. The election-junkie son of Mary Louise O'Brien pointed to a recent story popular among election obsessives detailing how one 19-year-old African American man in Illinois might be skewing its results to the right. The election obsessives are in deep, and it's easy to see why. This is the rare ""most important election of your lifetime"" that truly feels like the most important election of your lifetime. Apocalyptic language runs thick on both sides. October has been chock-full of October surprises, and an election playing out on Twitter can't help but feed what has been called the technology ""compulsion loop."" When's the next WikiLeaks dump? When's the next Trump tape? The American Psychological Association says election stress has grown bigly this year; the mindfulness guru Sharon Salzberg is offering a specially tailored election meditation to help followers get through it. TV shows, books and movies are losing their share of attention, the Wall Street Journal recently reported, as election binge-watchers refuse to pay attention to anything else.  [Will America's daddy issues swing the election?]  ""It's like this sick thing, from when I go to sleep to when I wake up before dawn, to see what Trump tweets await me,"" said David Marcus, 56, of Port Washington, N.Y., who directs communications for a nonprofit. ""You know those experiments with rats, where they give them a little bit of sugar and they want to come back for more, more, more? That's what I've become. I'm normally fairly interested in politics, but there's something so gripping and so impossibly unbelievable about this election that I can't stop checking every news feed from every legitimate newspaper and every blog and -- everything."" His girlfriend, he said, is eager to talk to him about something other than politics. His 17-year-old daughter approached him to discuss applying for college on the night of the final presidential debate, but ""we were on debate lockdown,"" he said. He set aside time for her the next night, vowing to himself to ""try, try, try to not check Facebook, not check news."" And then there's the avid Twitter user @newsjunkie3355 who identified herself as Elizabeth Quigly, 48, of Miami. She said she got ""addicted"" to the election seven or eight months ago. Once upon a time, she said, she watched TV for about two hours a day -- dramas such as ""Law & Order"" and ""Vikings."" But since the stakes of the election became clear, she said, her TV goes on at 8 a.m., a roving circuit of CNN, Fox Business and Fox News. When she ends her days watching Sean Hannity at 10 p.m., she feels vindicated but uneasy, worrying about the bad news he may be leaving out. When she ends her days watching Don Lemon, she goes to bed mad. As for Mary Louise O'Brien, her brain is occupied by an electoral map of the United States. She's now following the U.S. Senate races, too, since a Democratic president could use a supportive Senate, and is gripped by a potential squeaker in Nevada. ""I've got it all memorized, the red and the blue, and how the states change, and I have my states that I'm watching all the time,"" she said. The constant checking has cemented a cruel kind of operant conditioning, wherein she experiences anxiety about the state of the race, and the checking calms her down. This reinforces the habit, so that when she grows anxious again a few minutes later, she has to check again. With each minute that ticks by since she last checked, she worries more. Tick. . . ""Right now, I'm not able to check because I'm talking to you,"" O'Brien noted. ""I'm going crazy."" Tock. . . ""I'm kidding,"" she added. ""Sort of."" "
