Republican state Rep. Jason Spencer said in a statement posted Thursday on the website of the Georgia House of Representatives that he is dropping his proposal ""due to the visceral reaction it has created."" The American Civil Liberties Union and Muslim advocacy groups said Spencer's bill to change the 65-year-old anti-Klan law aimed to prevent Muslim women from wearing scarves and other religious headgear to cover their faces in public. Spencer insisted he wasn't targeting any specific groups. His bill made no mention of Muslims or religious garb. ___ 5:16 p.m. Advocates say a Georgia lawmaker appears to target Muslim women with proposed changes to a 1951 state law passed to stop the Ku Klux Klan from wearing masks at public rallies. Muslim-American groups and the American Civil Liberties Union are condemning the proposal by Republican state Rep. Jason Spencer as a veiled attempt to ban Muslim women from wearing scarves and other religious headgear to cover their faces in public. Spencer says he's not targeting any specific group. His bill doesn't mention Islam or religious garments, though it does explicitly note the anti-Klan law would apply to women. Even if it passed, Spencer's bill likely wouldn't affect Muslim women. The Georgia Supreme Court has ruled the 1951 law applies only to masks worn for the purpose of intimidating others. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told the council Thursday that an arms embargo would be ""an important step toward curbing the ongoing violence perpetrated by government and opposition forces against civilians."" But Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Petr Iliichev said an arms embargo ""would hardly be helpful in settling the conflict"" and sanctions against South Sudan's leaders ""would be the height of irresponsibility now.""

Adam Crapser's supporters say he doesn't know the language or the culture of South Korea. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ordered Crapser deported because of criminal convictions, including assault and being a felon in possession of a weapon. His Seattle attorney, Lori Walls, told The Associated Press in an email Thursday: ""Adam got deported last night. I just heard from him."" ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson said Crapser arrived in Seoul, South Korea, Thursday morning on board a commercial airline flight escorted by ICE deportation officers. Crapser was brought to South Korea when he was 3, but no one ever sought U.S. citizenship for him. He and his older sister were adopted by Americans, who later abandoned them. The siblings then were separated and sent to live in foster and group homes. When Crapser was 12, he moved in with an abusive family. His new father was convicted of multiple crimes. Crapser himself later got into trouble with the law, which made him liable for deportation. He had come under the scrutiny of federal immigration authorities only after he applied for a Green Card. Richeson said Crapser was arrested by ICE on Feb. 8 after serving a 60-day sentence for menacing constituting domestic violence and attempted coercion. He had been held in an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington since then. His supporters said he had waived an appeal for his deportation because conditions in the detention center were so miserable. The New York Times reported recently that his birth mother in South Korea, who had put her son up for adoption because she couldn't afford to keep him, was learning English so they could communicate when they were reunited. __ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at http://twitter.com/andrewselsky Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The truck was transporting fuel to Malawi from the port city of Beira and was near the border when the accident occurred, the government said in a statement. The injured were taken to the hospital, and a government team was to travel to the area in Tete province, about 1,200 miles from the capital, Maputo, on Friday. Mozambique is one of the world's poorest countries and struggles constantly with food shortages caused by drought.  -- Reuters EGYPT 82 young detainees pardoned by Sissi Egypt on Thursday pardoned 82 detainees, including many students and a former TV host convicted of ""defaming religious symbols."" The names of those pardoned by President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi were compiled by a committee he set up to examine the cases of young detainees who had not been involved in violence. The committee has said that active members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group would not be pardoned. The military overthrew President Mohamed Morsi, who hailed from the Brotherhood, in 2013. Sissi, who led his ouster, was elected the following year. Authorities have detained thousands of people in the past three years, mostly Islamists but also secular activists. The government has not said how many detainees are being held, but rights groups estimate the number at 20,000 to 40,000. Those released Thursday included more than 30 students, as well as a 21-year-old news photographer. A second batch of detainees is expected to be pardoned before year's end. The government maintains that there are no political detainees in Egypt, arguing that everyone in detention is being accorded due process.  -- Associated Press SOUTH KOREA Lawmakers pass bill on Park investigation South Korea's parliament on Thursday passed legislation that would allow a special prosecutor to investigate a corruption scandal threatening the presidency of Park Geun-hye. The opposition-controlled National Assembly also voted for a parliamentary investigation into allegations that Park let a secretive confidante manipulate power from the shadows and amass an illicit fortune. The bill on an independent investigation came as state prosecutors prepared to indict Park's friend by Sunday.  An independent investigation would increase the pressure on Park to resign. Although emboldened by a wave of massive protests, opposition parties have yet to seriously push for her impeachment over fears of triggering a backlash from conservative voters and negatively affecting next year's presidential election. Park has 15 days to sign off on the bill or to reject it, although that is seen as unlikely. Park has apologized for letting her friend Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a late cult leader who was Park's mentor in the 1970s, edit some of her draft speeches. But she has not commented on accusations that she let Choi manipulate key government decisions on policy and personnel. -- Associated Press  Ex-Rio governor snared in Brazilian graft probe: A former governor of Rio de Janeiro state long dogged by corruption allegations was arrested at his home, accused of receiving bribes and laundering money in a graft probe roiling Brazil.

But executives at major retailers say they're betting that the political climate will do little to alter your shopping habits this holiday season.  ""We haven't really seen any noticeable change in sentiment in our customers,"" said Greg Foran, Walmart's U.S. chief executive, on a Thursday conference call when asked whether the election would have an effect on the business.  Foran's comments echo what Brian Cornell, the chief executive of Target, said Wednesday when asked a similar question. ""We remain very optimistic about the holiday season,"" Cornell said, referencing economic factors such as a low unemployment rate.  Both retailers reported relatively upbeat earnings results this week, adding to evidence that the retail industry is headed into the holiday shopping season with a tail wind. In its U.S. division, Walmart saw a 1.2 percent increase in comparable sales, a measure of sales online and at stores open more than a year. The uptick came as the retailer did a better job of keeping store shelves well-stocked, and as its online sales heated up. This time around, e-commerce accounted for a greater share of the growth on this metric than in any previous quarter.  Still, profit declined as the big-box chain invests in raising wages for its workers and in building out technology and infrastructure to strengthen its digital business. Walmart's revenue was $118.2 billion, up 0.7 percent from the same period last year. (Adjusting for currency fluctuations, revenue was $120.3 billion.) Profit slipped 8.2 percent, to $3.03 billion, or 98 cents a share. Target, meanwhile, reported improvement on some key measures: Foot traffic to its stores grew in the most recent quarter, and strong sales during the busy back-to-school shopping season helped narrow its decline in comparable sales. The retailer said it also has benefited from a recent change to its marketing tactics, in which it has moved to put a bigger spotlight on value and low prices. Target recorded a profit of $608 million ($1.06 per share) for the three months ending Oct. 29, up from $549 million (76 cents per share) a year earlier. Target's revenue slipped to $16.4 billion, a 6.7 percent decrease from the same period last year. However, the decline largely reflects Target's decision to sell its pharmacy business to CVS.  Both retailers saw challenges in the quarter in their grocery departments, as broad-based deflation in food prices created a drag on revenue.  Macy's and Kohl's also reported stronger-than-expected earnings results last week. And the Commerce Department said Tuesday that retail sales were up 0.8 percent in October, a robust showing that suggests consumers are feeling relatively confident.    "

Here are some approaches to the problem that officials say are working: -- HELPING VETERANS -- The number of homeless veterans in the U.S. has dropped 47 percent since 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). That's due in part to HUD's collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs on programs that have provided veterans more than 79,000 rental vouchers. The programs emphasize enhanced coordination between veteran service organizations, government agencies, city mayors, faith-based providers, affordable housing operators and nonprofit organizations. About 111,000 formerly homeless veterans have been housed through such programs. -- HOUSING FIRST -- The nation saw an overall decline in long term or chronic homelessness ""because of our Housing First approach, which provided more permanent supportive housing opportunities for people with disabling health conditions and other needs that require supportive services,"" said Julian Castro, secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Housing First model offers people housing without requiring checks of their sobriety or mental health stability as a condition to be awarded housing. The program emphasizes that having a home and supportive services first will help stabilize people suffering from problems ranging from alcoholism to mental illness. -- INVESTING IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- Voters in Los Angeles approved a proposition on Election Day to invest $1.2 billion in safe housing and programs to benefit chronically homeless people. Other cities should adopt similar tax measures to invest in affordable housing and address the shortage, Castro said. -- BRIGHT SPOTS -- North Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia had the largest declines in overall homelessness from 2015 to 2016.

Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) poses for a portrait during an interview with The Washington Post in October. (Gareth Smit for The Washington Post)  Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is expected to be the incoming Senate minority leader, has thrown his support behind Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The backing provides a major boost to the expected candidacy of Ellison, who has the support of several liberal lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and an array of progressive advocacy groups. Schumer spokesman Matt House said that Schumer and Ellison spoke Thursday and that Schumer has decided to support the Minnesota lawmaker, who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus.   [Keith Ellison, Howard Dean offered as possible DNC chairs as Democrats seek to regroup]   ""Without a Democratic White House, Schumer's view is that the DNC is where the grass-roots organizing in sync with legislative battles should be organized,"" House said. The choice of DNC chairman has quickly emerged as a proxy for the direction that Democrats want to see their party take in the aftermath of Hillary Clinton's stunning loss on Tuesday to Donald Trump. Sanders and other liberals pushing Ellison argue that the DNC needs to shift its focus from raising money from well-heeled donors to building grass-roots enthusiasm for Democrats among working-class and middle-class Americans -- including some of the voters who propelled Trump's victories. Former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who previously served as DNC chairman, announced on Twitter on Thursday that he is interested in returning to the job. Dean supported Clinton in the Democratic primaries. Ellison, who backed Sanders during his presidential run, said last night that he would make an announcement on Monday about whether he will seek the DNC chairmanship. Speaking on a conference call with members of Democracy for America, Ellison described his vision of the role the next chairman should play, saying the party needs to focus on ""relationship-based initiatives that put TV as a tool, not as a go-to; which puts econometric modeling, not allowing that kind of expensive stuff substitute for getting Dems together around a pot of chili and getting to know them every single place."" ""And I think we need a chair who's going to go lead some door knocks around this country in the off year, in the off year, so people get to know them and get to feel like this is their party, this is the party of working men and women of this country,"" Ellison added. The next DNC chairman will succeed Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic activist who has been serving on an interim basis."

Again.	"    A rainbow flag blows during a demonstration in Berlin. (Gregor Fischer/AFP via Getty Images) When Oregon's Kate Brown became the first openly LGBT American to be elected governor of a state Tuesday night, her victory was hailed as a mark of progress by advocates for gay and transgender rights.   But the LGBT community found little else to cheer. In addition to the concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's victory, the number of openly gay legislators elected across the country declined for a second year. Congress is the one place where LGBT legislators held their ground. In the House, the six ""out"" incumbents all were easily reelected. In the Senate, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, who was elected in 2012, was not up for reelection this cycle. None of the 13 LGBT candidates attempting to defeat incumbent candidates or parties were successful, though.   Several of the races were blowouts, but LGBT candidates also lost tight contests. For instance, in Minnesota's 2nd District, polls showed Democrat Angie Craig with a lead, but she ended up losing to Republican Jason Lewis by two points; an independent transgender candidate, Paula Overby, took 8 percent of the vote. Two candidates seeking to become the first elected openly gay Republican in the House of Representatives (Paul Babeu in Arizona and Clay Cope in Connecticut) lost by wide margins. The real story, though, was in state legislative elections, where the number of LGBT state legislators fell for the second straight year.    The graph below shows the trend over time. The number of LGBT state legislative members has slowly climbed, beginning with the election of Elaine Noble in Massachusetts (elected in 1974, seated in 1975) and Allan Spear in Minnesota (who had been elected in 1972, but did not come out until December 1974). It reached a peak of 119 in 2014, but over the past two years it has fallen.  Going into Tuesday, there were 110 state representatives and senators who were publicly ""out"" -- about 1.5 percent of all of the country's legislators. When the ballots were counted, the number of LGBT legislators stood at 105. Most were incumbents who were reelected, while others were candidates winning legislative seats for the first time. (Details about all of the 2016 LGBT candidates are here, and the full list of newly elected congressional and state legislative elected officials can be found here.) Four states lost their lone LGBT state legislator, adding Delaware, Hawaii, South Dakota and West Virginia to 10 other states without a single LGBT representative in the state assembly. Not surprisingly, there was a significant partisan divide. Among the pool of LGBT state legislative candidates this year, there were just six Republicans, compared with 142 Democrats. Two Republicans won their races and one was not up for reelection. The decline in LGBT legislators this year came from losses among whites. The number of African American legislators increased from nine to 11; the number of Hispanic representatives went from seven to 10. The number of Asian/Pacific Islander and Native Americans increased by one. Transgender candidates and elected officials remain incredibly rare. Democrats Misty Snow and Misty Plowright lost their U.S. Senate and House races in Utah and Colorado by large margins. As noted above, Overby ran as an independent in Minnesota and took a single-digit share of the vote. Rachael Booth had a small chance of becoming the first out trans person to take statehouse office in the Grafton 15th House District of New Hampshire. In 2014, a Republican won the seat by 500 votes and in 2016 there was no incumbent. Booth lost by 18 points, though, meaning that an out transgender person has still never taken statewide elected office in the United States. In fact, there are only three openly transgender Americans in elected office (a school board member in Massachusetts, a judge in California and a city council member in Wisconsin). At this point, we can only speculate about the reasons for the decline in LGBT legislators. It may be that potential candidates and voters are seeing faster progress through the courts (e.g., on marriage equality), devoting money and attention to those efforts rather than winning elective office. It may also be that the major parties are doing little to recruit LBGT individuals to run, leaving the pool of potential candidates quite small. Of course, the pattern could also be due to idiosyncratic factors -- for instance, five LGBT legislators had to give up their seats this year because of term limits. Whatever the reason, the decline in LGBT representation has consequences for the legal, political and social climate. The number of out elected officials affects the content and tone of debates about issues affecting the queer community. It is perhaps no coincidence that when the North Carolina state legislature last year passed its controversial ""bathroom bill,"" there were no LGBT legislators in the chamber.

(Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press)  For 20 months, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's email practices were front-page news without attention to local public officials' similar practices.  That needs to change. Consider Maryland and my home county, Anne Arundel. When former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley was running in 2015 for the Democratic presidential nomination, he acknowledged that, like Clinton, he used private email for government business. He explained that since Maryland had no email retention policy, he violated no law. During the 2016 legislative session, eight Republican members of Maryland's General Assembly introduced legislation in the House and Senate to rectify that omission.  But Republican Gov. Larry Hogan didn't lift a finger to support their legislation, despite subsequently claiming: ""Since day one, we have made it our priority to improve transparency in state government."" The Office of Maryland's Attorney General, held by Democrat Brian Frosh, routinely corresponds with local government officials via their private email addresses. His office not only doesn't discourage them from using private email for government business but also has insisted that business conducted with private email concerning confidential matters must stay in the officials' private archives regardless of how secure they are. In Anne Arundel County, County Executive Steve Schuh uses private email for government business, including in correspondence with his staff and appointees to county commissions. Senior public school officials get around the Public Information Act a different way: by recycling email backups every 30 days.  Since Maryland's Public Information Act allows 30 days to respond to a Public Information Act request, staff can delete, transfer or otherwise hide email in response to such a request without violating Maryland law. My reading of county policy and practice is that employees with embarrassing emails are expected by one means or another to prevent the public from accessing them. Consider an assistant superintendent who orchestrated a lobbying campaign to influence Maryland General Assembly legislation on behalf of the school system. A Public Information Act request asking her for known responsive emails generated none.  The school system provided no acknowledgement or explanation for the missing emails. Sometimes what constitutes government business may appear arbitrary. For example, some school administrators use their personal email and others their government email when serving as regional representatives for the administrators' union. The problem with Maryland's current email law is twofold: not only is there no email retention requirement, but even if there were such a requirement it would be unenforceable. Unlike our federal government, there is no FBI, inspector general or other independent office with the expertise and incentive to investigate the creative disappearance of email records in response to Public Information Act requests. Our email records system is based either on trust or reliance on email recipients to publicly expose controversial emails. That is like basing a criminal-justice system on the premise that criminal gangs will either turn themselves in or cc: their plans to their victims. The politics of fixing Maryland's email abuses are abysmal. Despite the news of Clinton's email scandal, government officials have every incentive to turn a blind eye to the analogous problem at a local level. Notwithstanding officials' hollow commitments to openness, the problem is so pervasive in Maryland that it is hard to find officials who wouldn't be implicated and inconvenienced by fixing the problem. Maryland's Association of Counties, the powerful trade association that represents local government officials in the state legislature, has been implacably opposed to any efforts to meaningfully fix the problem, and it can kill legislation discreetly without forcing its members to take an embarrassing public position in support of Clinton-like email secrecy. Next election season, Marylanders should ask their governor, county executives and school superintendents: What are your email practices? To what extent should your emails and those of your staff be public? When, if ever, do you condone using private email for government purposes, deleting controversial emails and archiving confidential information in private record keeping systems? Have you ever penalized an employee for violating your stated email policy? Only by asking such inconvenient questions in public and forcing government officials to answer on the public record is there any chance of them fixing the problem. Sure, they will have strong incentives to lie or otherwise creatively obfuscate in response to such questions. After all, by the nature of their jobs government officials must pretend they have nothing to hide from their constituents. But the unpopularity of Clinton's misleading statements has shown them that such deception can be politically risky. The time is long past for Maryland to pass legislation locally and statewide with meaningful email retention and enforcement policies. If we fail to do so, we should eternally forgive Clinton for both her email practices and lying about them because our double standard will reveal us to be the greater hypocrite. J.H. Snider, president of iSolon.org, regularly writes about issues of democratic reform."
