The demonstration involving Montgomery County students was among numerous protests in the Washington area and around the country since Trump's surprise victory in the Nov. 8 election. Students at Woodrow Wilson High School in the District say they will leave their Northwest school at midday Tuesday, with plans to protest at the new Trump International Hotel a few blocks from the White House.  Students at Montgomery Blair High School streamed onto the school's football field about 10 a.m. Monday for a walkout that soon turned into a march along University Boulevard. The procession grew larger as it drew students from Northwood and Albert Einstein high schools and headed into Wheaton and downtown Silver Spring. ""Not our president,"" some students chanted. ""No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here,"" others called out.     Students at Montgomery Blair High School left school and marched along a street to protest the election of President-elect Donald Trump. (WUSA 9)   The backpack-clad marchers, flanked by police cars with flashing lights, snarled traffic but found support from many drivers, who honked and flashed peace signs. One group of students said they encountered a Trump supporter who told them to go back to class. Police reported no serious incidents. Students said the protest was an effort to have their voices heard; because they aren't old enough to vote, they said, it was the most effective way to raise concerns about the president-elect. Others said they walked out as a show of solidarity with people who felt alienated during Trump's campaign, including immigrants, Muslims, women and minorities. ""I think we're trying to show that young people have a voice and we want to be heard,"" Olivia Hardwick, 14, a Blair freshman, said as she and others walked down Georgia Avenue.  [In election's wake, racist incidents have schools on edge]  Blair students talked about their school being diverse -- 26 percent of the students are black and 32 percent are Hispanic -- and how they believe it is important to stand up for minorities.  Officials estimated that about 1,000 students walked out, about a third of the Blair student body of 2,800; some who joined the protest on the football field went back to classes and did not march. Sam Rose Davidoff, 15, a sophomore and activist at Blair, said the protest was meant to show that Trump has not won over young people like them. ""Although we can't get represented through voting, we can get represented through protesting,"" he said.

(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)  The spark for the protest started at Blair last week and circulated on social media. The school's principal, Renay Johnson, gave the students permission to gather on the football field but said their absence would be unexcused. Once on the field, many students said they realized there would be little visibility for a protest tucked away on a sports field and decided to head into the streets.  ""I feel disappointed that Trump is president,"" said ninth grader Jorge Ventura, 15. ""I feel anyone, any race, should come here and feel welcome."" Immigrants contribute to American society, he said. ""They could cure Ebola, cancer, anything like that.""  [At deep-blue Yale University, students shocked to be facing Trump presidency]  Montgomery school officials said students who missed class would be marked with unexcused absences unless their parents provide a note saying they approved the absence. A number of students said they had called their parents and gotten support.  A Montgomery County police spokeswoman said there were no arrests. The marchers dispersed shortly after 1:30 p.m. Jerry Cave, a Montgomery County Republican activist, criticized the anti-Trump protests, saying they are ""exactly what I had anticipated: that immediately upon Donald Trump's victory, the left would attempt to delegitimize his presidency."" ""High school kids are supposed to be in high school,"" Dave said. ""I grew up in D.C. with the Vietnam riots going on and we didn't do that. And believe me, we were every bit as politically engaged as the kids are now."" The Maryland demonstration came amid a week of similar public displays, mostly in areas where Democrat Hillary Clinton saw significant support at the ballot box.  Berkeley High School students joined other California schools in protest last week, walking to the University of California at Berkeley as a group. About 300 Minneapolis students walked out of five high schools across the city Friday to protest Trump's election and the Dakota Access Pipeline. They marched into downtown Minneapolis and made their way into various business lobbies, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Hundreds of students from the Los Angeles Unified School District were out on the city's streets demonstrating Monday morning, some holding U.S. and Mexican flags and signs that read ""Siempre unidos"" -- always united. Michelle King, superintendent of the Los Angeles system, said students should limit their protests to non-instructional time.  ""For their own safety and to follow the law, they should remain on campus,"" King said in a written statement. She said the schools are using assemblies, classroom dialogues and speaking activities to ""provide a secure forum for our students."" ""These are important conversations that need to take place,"" King said in the statement. ""However, it is critical that students not allow their sentiments to derail their education or for their actions to place them in danger."" Jeanne Theoharis, a professor of political science at Brooklyn College at the City University of New York, said high school students have historically taken to the streets in protests and in some instances have been on the forefront of major civil rights movements. High school students were a key force in a civil rights campaign in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963. One of the cases that led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision to end school segregation stemmed from a high school student strike in Prince Edward County, Va. Theoharis said the public presence of these students matters because it shows that they believe their voice will be heard and that they can spur change in policies, a belief that she said is a crucial aspect of democracy.  ""They see the necessity not to normalize this,"" Theoharis said. ""They see the necessity to build a resistance and say this is not who we are as a country.""  Protests also broke out during the past week at major college campuses, which often have left-leaning student bodies. Some of those protests morphed into contentious clashes between Clinton and Trump supporters. Protesters at American University in the District, for example, burned flags during a protest last week, an action that led to a shouting match with Trump supporters.  [Mobs of tearful, angry students protesting Trump victory swarm college campuses]  Students at D.C.'s Wilson High School -- the biggest high school in the D.C. Public School system -- plan to take the Metro downtown on Tuesday, march along Pennsylvania Avenue and stand in front of the Trump Hotel holding hands, according to a widely circulated flier.  Maria Patino, an 18-year-old Wilson senior, said she thinks it's unfair that Clinton won the popular vote but was not elected president. As an immigrant, Patino said she wants to speak out against Trump's comments about Mexicans. ""I have been here for three years,"" Patino said. ""Coming to a country where the culture and language are so different is not easy. I want those who support Trump to understand that we deserve better treatment."" In an email to the school community Monday morning, Kimberly Martin, Wilson's principal, emphasizing that the protest was not a sanctioned school event and that students who miss class would receive unexcused absences. Martin also wrote that school administrators and teachers defend all students' right to peaceful protest and self-expression.  ""Wilson Social Studies teachers, and many other teachers, empower students to be inquisitive, informed, and engaged citizens who use critical thinking, inquiry and literacy to prepare for college, careers, and civic life,"" Martin wrote in the email. ""However, students will be reminded to follow their regular class schedule, as we cannot ensure the safety of any student that chooses to leave the school before dismissal.""

""What's clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxieties, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive,"" he said. He observed that Trump was ""impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate. That's powerful stuff."" ""Do I have concerns? Absolutely,"" the president added. ""He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues."" And Obama cautioned that there are ""certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well, unless he recognizes them and corrects"" them. He was obviously trying hard to as diplomatic as he could, which was no easy task.  *  Elise Viebeck, Jerry Markon and Karen DeYoung report that Donald Trump and his new partner are already getting along swimmingly: President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in a telephone conversation Monday that relations between their countries were ""unsatisfactory"" and vowed to work together to improve them, the Kremlin said in a statement. The statement said the two leaders discussed combining efforts in the fight against terrorism, talked about ""a settlement for the crisis in Syria"" and agreed their aides would begin working toward a face-to-face meeting between them. Trump's office has not commented on the call, and the Russian statement did not indicate who initiated it. Since his victory last week, Trump has received congratulatory calls from a number of foreign leaders. On the day after the U.S. election, Putin sent Trump a telegram covering many of the same themes, including his desire to improve U.S.-Russia relations and establish a dialogue based on ""mutual respect and genuine consideration for each other's positions."" Yet the statement, if true, could subject Trump to criticism that he is continuing his controversial embrace of the Russian leader. The president-elect drew rebukes from both political parties during the campaign for repeatedly expressing his admiration for Putin, suggesting at one point that Putin is more worthy of his praise than President Obama. I eagerly await the congressional investigation into the way the Russians used hacking and WikiLeaks to meddle in our election. Ha, ha, just kidding! There won't be any investigation. * Daniel Strauss reports that Rep. Keith Ellison (Minn.) has formally announced his bid to be chair of the Democratic Party. Given that he already has the support of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), he's got the inside line. * Eric Levitz reports that new FBI statistics show that hate crimes against Muslims increased by 67 percent in 2015. I can't imagine what might have contributed to that. * Jason Sattler gives five ways liberals can fight Donald Trump. * Dahlia Lithwick says that the Republicans stole the Supreme Court and Democrats need to obstruct whatever nominee Trump puts up to fill the vacancy created by Antonin Scalia's death. Yes, they'll lose in the end, but they should do it anyway to make sure everyone understands what happened. * David Roberts and Brad Plumer say that what Trump and the Republicans are going to do to the environment is even worse than you imagine. * Amanda Marcotte says that same-sex marriage rights may be the one thing that's safe from Trump and the GOP. * Glenn Kessler explains that when House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) says ""because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke,"" he's just straight-up lying, or as Kessler would say, four Pinocchios. In fact, it's just the opposite: because of Obamacare, Medicare is in much better financial shape than it was before the law was passed. * Jill Lawrence argues that if you want to see whose views are being ignored by American politics, you should look at coastal liberals. * At the American Prospect, I argued against the notion that Hillary Clinton could have persuaded some of Trump's voters had she pandered to them more effectively.  * And finally, this is a sad day for American journalism.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/10/fact-checking-in-the-aftermath-of-an-historic-election/	Fact checking in the aftermath of a historic election	"   (Reuters/Lucas Jackson)  Donald Trump won the electoral college and, thus, the presidency -- and did so while earning an astonishing 59 Four-Pinocchio rulings from The Fact Checker. (Hillary Clinton, by contrast, earned seven Four-Pinocchio ratings.) We often say that we do not write fact checks to influence the behavior of politicians; we write fact checks to inform voters. What voters do with the information in our fact checks is up to them. Certainly we do not expect voters to be swayed by fact checks when casting as important a vote as for the presidency -- though one angry Clinton supporter emailed Tuesday night to say his candidate lost because The Fact Checker devoted too much attention to her email controversy. Nevertheless, we did find that Trump frequently invented statistics, used faulty reasoning, flip-flopped without explanation or made highly misleading statements -- to a degree that was unusual for a politician running for president. Perhaps this mattered to some voters -- exit polls indicate he lost college-educated voters to Clinton -- but clearly it was not especially important to others. (Clinton had her own trustworthiness issues, so perhaps that canceled out any concerns about Trump.) Clinton also is on track to win the popular vote in a sharply divided country; she lost the electoral college because of tactical reasons, such as her failure to deliver supporters to the polls in several key swing states. So Trump's consistent failure to be accurate may have hurt his image. Some commentators have argued that the rise of Trump indicates that the United States has entered a post-fact era, but recent research indicates that fact checks do have an effect. In contrast to an earlier finding that fact checks may reinforce a false belief, new research -- including a test of a claim about crime made by Trump -- found that a fact check reduced the prevalence of a false belief. Moreover, fact-checking websites all experienced huge surges in readership during the election campaign. The Fact Checker had five times more unique visitors than during the 2012 cycle. Based only on anecdotal evidence -- emails from readers -- one reason that Trump's false statements may have mattered little to his supporters is because he echoed things they already believed. When he said that illegal immigrants were pouring over the border or were mainly criminals -- statements not supported by data -- he found a ready audience that already believed such sentiments. ""That's one of the disorienting realities of this political year,"" conservative Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes told Business Insider in August. ""You can be in this alternative media reality and there's no way to break through it."" Sykes said he was criticized for ""not repeating stories that I know not to be true."" But now that Trump will assume the presidency, he may find that it is not in his interest to keep making factually unsupported questions. For instance, he frequently said that the unemployment rate is really 42 percent, rather than the 5 percent figure produced by the government. We know from readers that this claim, though false, was readily accepted by some supporters. But now Trump will head a government that includes the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So unless he orders the BLS to change the internationally accepted method by which it calculates the unemployment rate, his own government will be issuing numbers that directly contradict him. From a political perspective, Trump faces another problem. If a 5 percent unemployment rate translates to 42 percent, under his accounting, then even reducing the official rate to zero would mean an unemployment rate of 37 percent -- which is not much of a platform for reelection. Similarly, Trump claimed that he could save $300 billion from a Medicare prescription drug program that actually costs $78 billion a year. Such claims might prove awkward once he learns that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office produces an estimate of the fiscal effect of every piece of legislation. Trump has also pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, and replace it with something ""terrific"" that is ""so much better."" But he left the policy specifics rather vague, especially how he would transition about 20 million people who have gained health insurance under the law to a new system without wrenching headlines about millions losing their insurance. As President Obama can attest, such coverage can be politically damaging. So it would be important to get your facts straight -- and not say things like ""If you like your insurance plan, you will keep it."" The advocates for Brexit were found to have made many unsupported claims -- and yet unexpectedly won a June referendum in which people voted for Britain to exit the European Union. The London-based fact-checking site Full Fact rigorously checked the claims made by both sides, but false claims about Brexit persisted. Will Moy, the director of Full Fact, said that one lesson learned is that there needs to be sustained fact checking over time. ""A fact checker jumping into a campaign is much like someone arriving late at a party, interrupting your conversation, telling you that what you were just saying to your friends is wrong, and then expecting you to be grateful,"" he said. ""Do people in politics take pride in winning any way, in knowing what they're talking about and being trustworthy, in getting results in the real world?"" he asked. ""Fact checkers need to fight for the latter two. We need to show the harm of not knowing what you're talking about and not being able to deliver on your promises, and we need to do what we can to influence the incentives on people in positions of power, as we do, for example, when we seek corrections, or use the collected evidence of our fact checks to get systems changed to make accurate information easier to find and inaccurate information most costly to use."" At The Washington Post, our main goal is to shed light on critical issues and explain the complexity of policy issues and debate. Every new president starts with a clean slate, and we are eager to see whether Trump improves his Pinocchio ratings once he takes the oath of office.
