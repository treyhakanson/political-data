(Evan Vucci/Associated Press)  The pattern of learning transition news from foreign leaders continues. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg spoke with President-elect Donald Trump on the phone Friday to congratulate him on his election victory and discuss the organization's ""enduring importance,"" NATO shared in a readout of the call. Trump and Stoltenberg spoke about ""how NATO is adapting to the new security environment, including to counter the threat of terrorism"" and agreed that ""progress has been made on fairer burden-sharing"" when it comes to defense spending among members ""but that there is more to do."" Stoltenberg, a former prime minister of Norway, said that he ""looked forward to welcoming President-elect Trump to Brussels for the NATO Summit next year to discuss the way forward,"" the statement said. The call was not announced by Trump's transition team in its scheduling update Friday morning.   [Trump chooses Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director]   Trump leveled pointed criticisms at NATO at times during the campaign, questioning its relevance in today's world and suggesting that if he won, the United States might not automatically aid small Baltic states under a hypothetical attack from Russia. ""If they fulfill their [financial] obligations to us . . . the answer is yes,"" Trump told the New York Times in July. His then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort tried to walk back the comment, saying Trump simply wants NATO ""modernized."" In late September, Trump's tone seemed to change. ""When I am president, we will strengthen NATO,"" he said during a speech at the Polish National Alliance in Chicago. Trump has become an all-consuming topic for Stoltenberg in the past 10 days: The secretary general spoke about the incoming U.S. president at an event organized by the German Marshall Fund of the United States on Friday as well. ""I'm absolutely confident that President Trump will maintain American leadership in the alliance and will maintain a strong U.S. commitment to European security,"" Stoltenberg said during a question-and-answer session. ""Two World Wars and the Cold War taught us that NATO is important for stability in Europe,"" he said. ""But stability in Europe is also important for the United States."""

But only 49 percent correctly guessed that 300 million children around the world are living in areas with toxic levels of air pollution. That's according to UNICEF.

Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller says the crowd of about 500 protesters dispersed early Saturday afternoon after linking arms to block the entrance. No one was arrested, and workers had been evacuated. Earlier Saturday, Keller says a caravan of about 150 cars left the protest camps and arrived in Mandan, where protesters stood and blocked the intersection of Highway 6 and Main Street. The caravan then headed west to the work yard where construction equipment is kept. The four-state, 1,200-mile pipeline is complete except for under the Missouri River in North Dakota. Protesters fear the pipeline could affect water supply and disturb tribal cultural sites. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Andrew Kelly/Reuters)  At the start of Fox News's election night coverage, commentator Monica Crowley assessed the state of polling on the 2016 presidential campaign: A ""reliable predictive model,"" said Crowley, might not be ""operative.""   On Fox News, Monica Crowley declares that a ""reliable predictive model"" may not be ""operative"" tonight. -- ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) November 8, 2016   Now, Crowley is a loyal conservative who has made some out-there statements about Donald Trump, like the time she made this observation about the candidates' relative health: ""There's a difference between biological age and physiological age. Mrs. Clinton is going to be 69 years old in a couple of weeks. Donald Trump just turned 70,"" she said. ""But the overall perception is that Donald Trump is a young 70, and Mrs. Clinton is a relatively old 68, 69, in terms of physiology."" In light of such remarks, it was easy to dismiss her critique of the quantitative model as a repeat of Republican disbelief of 2012 pre-election polls showing President Obama with a substantive lead. Only, Crowley nailed it hard. The seven hours that followed her statement showed, precisely, that a reliable predictive model wasn't operative. Evidence to that effect was everywhere, especially on the graphs of outlets that had attempted to predict the outcome of the presidential election:   Analytics! pic.twitter.com/1JAJ2wiyTY -- Don Van Natta Jr. (@DVNJr) November 9, 2016   Earlier on Election Day, another common face on Fox News said similar things. ""I do think a lot of the polls are purposely wrong,"" said Donald Trump in a Tuesday morning interview on ""Fox & Friends."" ""The media's very dishonest, extremely dishonest, and I think a lot of the polls are phony. I don't even think they interview people. I think they just put out phony numbers."" This was laughable coming from Trump, a guy who touted his polling awesomeness throughout the primary race. Back in January, for example, he said in an Iowa rally, ""There's actually this theory that even though I'm leading in all the polls, I'll actually do better than the polls."" As with many proclamations from Trump, yesterday's dig at polling practices had its share of hyperbole/falsehood: We have no evidence that pollsters fabricated their work -- just that they messed it up on an historical level. Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia said earlier today on Fox News: ""We were wrong, the entire punditry industry, the entire polling industry and the entire analyst industry,"" said Sabato, adding that he didn't have egg on his face. ""I have omelet on my face."" GOP strategist and NBC analyst Mike Murphy had this to tweet:   I've believed in data for 30 years in politics and data died tonight. I could not have been more wrong about this election. -- mike murphy (@murphymike) November 9, 2016   The subject line on this morning's Politico Playbook includes this disclaimer: ""WE WERE ALL WRONG."" All around the dial last night, it was the same: major media figures admitting that their polling numbers stunk. The meae culpae were uncharacteristically groveling and absolute coming from media types, who generally like to equivocate and make excuses before issuing corrections. Yet here, the data was just overwhelming: It was the media's precious random-sampling polls vs. actual voting results from duly empowered vote-counters. There was no conceptual hiding place. And just how wrong were those polls? Have a look at this tweet from Natalie Jackson, the Huffington Post's senior polling editor:   Not a single poll ever showed Trump winning in Wisconsin. Ever. https://t.co/hI49J0OEuB -- Natalie Jackson (@nataliemjb) November 9, 2016   Trump ended up squeaking through in Wisconsin, 48 to 47 percent. Speaking of the Huffington Post, it predicted a comfy Clinton win in the electoral college. ""Our final forecast is that she'll win 323 electoral votes, far more than the 270 she needs to win. According to our model, she'll win Florida, North Carolina and New Hampshire, and that'll be that. Early night,"" wrote Huffington Post Washington Bureau Chief Ryan Grim in a mass email that was proved wrong within about five hours. Cockiness built upon cockiness at Huffington Post, as Grim last weekend taunted Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight for his methodology in arriving at election forecasts. ""The short version is that Nate is changing the results of polls to fit where he thinks the polls truly are, rather than simply entering the poll numbers into his model and crunching them,"" wrote Grim. As it turned out, Silver should have been doing even more of that skewing stuff. His final forecast for the election gave Clinton a 72 percent shot. The Huffington Post settled somewhere near 100 percent for Clinton, leading Grim to ditch his bumptiousness on Twitter last night:   .@NateSilver538 Yes. You were right that there was far more uncertainty than we were accounting for. I apologize. Gonna stick to punditry. -- Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) November 9, 2016   Apologies of that sort are flying up and down the Acela corridor today: I'm so sorry. It is as if the entire coastal elite just spilled hot coffee on someone. Balance requires referencing a supporter of the quantitative efforts. In an interview on Fox News this morning, Tom Bevan of Real Clear Politics said, ""Everyone's running to say that the polls were terribly, terribly wrong. That's not actually true. If you look, Hillary Clinton's going to win the popular vote. That's what the polls said. In the final Real Clear Politics four-way average, she was ahead by 3.2 percent. She's going to probably end up with roughly a 1 percentage point popular-vote victory. That's a variation of only 2.2 percent, that's actually less than what we had in 2012."" Pressed by host Martha MacCallum on how the polls suggested there was no way Trump could win, Bevan fired back: ""Part of the reason for that is that's how people frame the race."" He noted that there were polls showing Trump ahead in Florida, North Carolina, New Hampshire. The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza argued on Twitter:   Important thing to remember: 1. It's ok to be wrong about elections 2. The key is to figure out why and then explain it to people -- Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) November 9, 2016   That approach understates the stakes here. Trump predicated his campaign on bashing the ""dishonest"" media. Ninety-nine percent of the time he brandished his media critiques, he was either lying or distorting the record to the point of blurriness. Like when he said camera operators weren't showing his crowds; like when he protested that he opposed the Iraq War in spite of numerous fact-checks finding the exact opposite; like the way he attempted to discredit the New York Times. With each attack, Trump ratcheted up the media's duty to make absolutely no errors in covering the Trump phenomenon. And yet here we are with this turd. Get ready for it: For the next four years, Trump will retreat to these unfair polls every time the media catches him in a lie or a mistake. And misfires in pre-election polls wouldn't matter so much if media outlets didn't rely on them so darned much. But they do, especially on cable news. ""NEW POLL"" is verily a perma-chyron on the major cable networks. It's how they start out their coverage, how they finish their coverage and how they pad their coverage in between. Polls are newsy, easy to understand, predictable for planning purposes and fun to display on the screen. That's why they're ubiquitous, and also why last night is far more of an embarrassment than it ever should have been."

Rhonda Crawford had been expected to win Tuesday's election over a write-in opponent, as she was the only name listed on the ballot. The 45-year-old can't be sworn in to the $180,000-a-year job unless she's cleared of wrongdoing. The former nurse was fired from her courthouse job and criminally charged for donning a black robe and presiding over traffic cases that should've been heard by a real judge. The Illinois Supreme Court temporarily suspended her law license.

That doesn’t mean Clinton is blameless.	"   Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton greeted the audience at the first presidential debate on Sept. 26. (Evan Vucci/AP)  When journalists describe the 2016 presidential campaign as ""nasty,"" ""ugly"" or ""venomous,"" they are mostly talking about Donald Trump. By any objective measure, the Republican nominee deserves most of the blame for dragging a race for the nation's highest office down to the lowest level anyone can remember. It is Trump, after all, who says he might not accept the outcome of the election, talks about jailing his opponent, behaves like a cyberbully and boasts about the size of a certain appendage. But that does not mean Hillary Clinton is guiltless, despite the suggestion of some supporters that she has played within normal political bounds and that criticism is rooted in a media false equivalency.   1. Trump attacks Hillary with brazen lies2. Hillary attacks Trump with his own words3. Big media: Both sides are equal -- Peter Daou (@peterdaou) November 4, 2016   The idea that the press has taken a ""both sides are equal"" approach to covering campaign rhetoric is total nonsense. Article after article after article has described Trump's style as unique in American politics. ""Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has,"" the Los Angeles Times reported in September. When Trump said during a debate last month that Clinton would be in prison if he were president, the Chicago Tribune described the remark as ""an unprecedented break with U.S. political decorum."" ""There is a long tradition of presidential candidates ratcheting up their language when they are trailing in the closing weeks of an election,"" the New York Times reported in October. ""But in the same fashion Donald J. Trump has broken with other political traditions, he is taking a long-standing rite of fall to new heights -- or perhaps new lows."" These are excerpts of news stories, mind you, not editorials or opinion columns. Over and over, the media has made clear that Trump is in a class by himself.  Yet Clinton has contributed to a toxic political environment, too, albeit on a smaller scale. This week, she appeared to question Trump's patriotism when she told a crowd in Cincinnati that her rival ""seems not to like America."" As The Fix's Aaron Blake noted, Clinton has often said that Trump's ideas are un-American, but to say that he doesn't like his country is pretty extreme. When Rudy Giuliani said in February 2015 -- before Trump or Clinton launched their campaigns -- that he does ""not believe that the president loves America,"" the former New York mayor was widely criticized in the media for a remark that seemed over the line. Also this week, Clinton conjured the famous/infamous ""Daisy"" ad from 1964 that cast that year's Republican nominee, Barry Goldwater, as a dangerous figure who might spark a nuclear conflict. The provocative original spot aired only once. Clinton used the same actress (now an adult, obviously) in her ad, and made essentially the same argument against Trump. ""The fear of nuclear war that we had as children, I never thought our children would ever have to deal with that again,"" Monique Corzilius Luiz says in the Clinton ad. ""And to see that coming forward in this election is really scary.""  And while Trump's rude treatment of journalists is unparalleled, Clinton also has abandoned such precedents as allowing reporters to observe fundraisers and accompany her in a protective pool that would enable coverage of her every move on the trail. The White House Correspondents Association has written letters to both candidates expressing concerns about lack of access. So, yes, Trump is the No. 1 offender in this unpleasant election season. But his overshadowing of Clinton's role in the tumult does not mean she hasn't played one at all."

"   The Capitol dome at dusk  in 2013. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)  +How can the next president improve the uncooperative atmosphere in Washington?  So far, the ""The Missing Debate"" has covered a wide range of policy imperatives, from the future of the Federal Reserve to housing policy to K-12 education. While we've discussed a wide range of potential solutions, we're under no illusion that they are likely to make headway in Washington's current political climate. When this vicious electoral season comes to a close, we're likely to be left with a further divided government and an increasingly polarized electorate. Perhaps the biggest question regarding any policy agenda is whether there is any hope for lawmakers to break through the dysfunction that has paralyzed Congress over the past few years. For that reason, the final question of the series focuses on reforms that could improve relations between the two parties and make lawmakers more willing to cooperate and pass needed legislation. What is the one most important reform the next administration and Congress should champion to improve the political atmosphere in Washington?    Ellen L. Weintraub is a commissioner on the Federal Election Commission. What sentiment unites supporters of candidates as diverse as Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders? Disgust with the way we fund our elections. One recent poll found that 85 percent of Americans believe the system needs either fundamental changes or a complete rebuild. How bad is it now? ""60 Minutes"" reported earlier this year that each day of their terms, members of Congress are expected to spend four hours on the phone raising $18,000 a day from big donors across the country. This is time not spent legislating. Not learning about the issues. Not getting to know their colleagues better. And since ""call time"" is horrible, soul-crushing work, it can't be improving their moods. Shedding this telemarketing burden will go a long way toward giving members of Congress the capacity to build more constructive relationships with each other, with their constituents and with the executive branch. And what single reform can do all this? Bringing a voluntary system of public campaign financing, which has been successful at the state and local levels, to congressional races. Most public campaign financing programs involve a match of contributions raised by candidates, with a lid on the size of contributions that are allowed. They require candidates to collect a substantial number of small-dollar contributions to qualify. And typically, contributions must come from registered voters in the candidate's jurisdiction. Not corporations, not unions, not PACs. People! Voters! Constituents! As it is now, the concerns of the country's wealthiest people absorb the time and attention of office-holders. But when candidates need small and local contributions, they have a powerful incentive to devote time and attention to the needs of typical constituents, those who don't live in the world of big political money. These citizens deserve and are demanding a government that is responsive and accountable to them. And when members of Congress descend upon the Capitol, ears burning with their constituents' most urgent concerns, they will find that what they've heard wasn't that different from Florida to Idaho to Maine to Arizona to Kansas: What will best ensure my family's future? How can we keep the United States strong and the world peaceful? And how will we pay for everything? From common concerns, common solutions can be pursued. Presidents and Congress usually shy away from investing political capital in campaign finance reform. The one thread tying every federal elected official together is that they worked the existing system to win office and any large-scale reform threatens them. But if no one is willing to commit to reform, the system won't get any better. Our members of Congress will continue their wretched telemarketing lives, and the American people will continue to be fundamentally dissatisfied with and shortchanged by how our democracy works. There are many other much-needed reforms that could cast light on dark money, address the outsize role of unaccountable outside spending groups, strengthen parties, protect voters from coercion, shield our system from foreign influence and boost voter turnout. But few reforms could match the immediate impact of public campaign financing on Washington's political climate. More than a hundred years ago, Teddy Roosevelt won office in a system he recognized as corrupt. To the dismay of his backers, he bucked that system and championed some of our first campaign-finance reforms. Washington needs that sort of courage today more than ever.
