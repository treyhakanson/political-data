Chris Christie in next year's election is ratcheting up. The race took a turn this week when Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who carved out a name for himself leading the legislative investigation into the George Washington Bridge scandal, announced his candidacy for the June primary. Wisniewski joins the race after Phil Murphy, a fellow Democrat, onetime Goldman Sachs executive and Obama administration diplomat, consolidated considerable support within the party including from key party chairmen and lawmakers. He also loaned his campaign $10 million, a boost that others have not matched. Murphy's position is strong, but Wisniewski is staking his candidacy on a potent -- and recent -- example: the national Democratic Party's backing of establishment favorite Hillary Clinton over Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. On the GOP side, Christie is prevented by term limits from running again and is unpopular in New Jersey. He's taken shots at Murphy but hasn't thrown support to any of the Republicans running or expected to announce a run. Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli is officially in the race for Republicans. Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick are expected to announce their intentions to run. A closer look at the contest: ___ CLINTON-SANDERS Democrats just lost a national election after picking the nominee with more establishment support. Hillary Clinton lost to Republican Donald Trump after the party picked her over Sanders. Wisniewski, who was Sanders' New Jersey campaign chairman before backing Clinton when she won the primary, is seizing on this connection.  ""I believe it's time we have policies that work for everyone in our state, not just the wealthy and well-connected,"" he said. Still, Wisniewski is not an outsider. He's been in the Assembly since 1996 and was the state party chairman in 2010. Establishment support, which tilts toward Murphy, counts for a lot, providing favorable ballot positions and potential for volunteers for turnout efforts. Murphy also was not the Democratic-candidate-in-waiting the same way Clinton was. The race looked to be competitive until Murphy began to consolidate support and several other high-profile candidates dropped out of running before officially announcing. ___ MONEY Murphy is leading the money race, by a lot. Wisniewski has not reported any fundraising yet to the state election commission. In addition to the $10 million loan, Murphy has spent about $1.7 million so far on the primary, including on digital and television ads, according to state records. Ciattarelli, the Republican, has spent about $200, records show. Neither Bramnick nor Guadagno has formed a committee yet, though Bramnick has embarked on a tour with mayors across the state and Guadagno founded a think tank to work on policy prescriptions. ___ THE GENERAL New Jersey and Virginia are outliers when it comes to electing governors, going to the ballot in the year after presidential elections. In each election going back to Republican Tom Kean in 1985, New Jersey residents selected a governor from the party opposite of the winner of the presidential election. If that trend holds true, then the winner of the Democratic primary is in strong position going into the November election because Trump won this year. ___ CHRISTIE AND THE GOP Republicans are on the ropes in New Jersey. The party lost the registration battle in 2016, which saw Democrats grow the gap from about 600,000 more voters to 800,000 more through November, according to state data. They also control a minority of seats in the Legislature, with Democrats shaving their margin in 2015 by four Assembly seats. Christie's approval rating is also at record lows, and there's uncertainty about whether he will finish his term, which ends in 2018, because he may be selected for a Trump administration post. Christie has said he would consider a post if offered, but his circumstances, which looked bright for him after Trump's win, have changed. He said this week he has ""every intention"" of staying. Were he to leave, Guadagno would succeed him, giving her a chance to govern before potentially announcing her own run. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"      Before Stephen K. Bannon became a close advisor to Donald Trump, he hosted ""Breitbart News Daily,"" a radio show, on which he interviewed Trump nine times. The Washington Post's David A. Fahrenthold discusses what those interviews tell us about their relationship. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   As enraging as it is that President-elect Donald Trump ran a racist and xenophobic presidential campaign, it is even more galling that he is elevating the man who unabashedly took white supremacy out of the shadows to a senior position in the White House. When he was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, Stephen K. Bannon served as the alt-right's sherpa from far-right fringe to mainstream. And he did so using Trump's coattails, first by championing the candidate on Breitbart and then serving as Trump's campaign chief executive. What passed for news on that website was nothing but breathtaking racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic garbage. That Bannon and his influence will be just steps from the Oval Office as chief White House strategist and senior counselor is beyond outrageous, especially in light of what happened with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Surely, you remember him. [Michael Steele: Donald Trump is ""the freeest president we've had in a generation""] Wright was the legendary pastor of the Trinity United Church of Christ  in Chicago. A young Barack Obama wrote fondly of him, his role in helping the biracial community organizer find himself and the spiritual home the minister provided. Wright was the one who married Obama to his wife, Michelle. His importance in their lives then cannot be understated. But that all changed when an incendiary phrase from a Wright sermon from 2003 was unearthed and played on a feedback loop to a stunned nation in 2008. ""The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing 'God Bless America.' No, no, no, God damn America, that's in the Bible for killing innocent people,"" Wright said. ""God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme.""    The Rev. Jeremiah Wright speaks in Jackson, Miss., on March 25, 2012. (Rogelio V. Solis/Associated Press)  The impertinent rhetoric and fiery delivery seemed to confirm fears that the black man with a funny-sounding name not only was not really American, but he also was a closet reverse racist who neither loved America nor white people. The ensuing controversy put Obama's presidential campaign on life support. It took a beautifully nuanced speech on race about a week after the sermon surfaced to save his White House ambitions. Because of other sermons that surfaced and Wright's negative reaction to the harsh spotlight, Obama disavowed Wright and resigned his membership in the church. If you want an excellent explanation of Wright's religious philosophy and the Obama-Wright relationship and controversy read ""The Black Presidency: Barack Obama and the Politics of Race in America"" by Michael Eric Dyson. ""I won't go to a church that's friends with a racist and an anti-Semite,"" Sean Hannity said on his Fox News program on March 12, 2008, while pressing Dee Dee Myers on whether she would attend a church like Wright's. [Why lies about Obama resist the truth] ""The fact is, you have a president who for years went to a church whose pastor said stunningly hateful things about Americans,"" former house speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said of Obama in January 2015. ""He spent 17 years in the church of Jeremiah Wright, and this is the guy who said 'God damn America, not God bless America,' '' former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said in February 2015, in one of his many critical, disrespectful aspersions against the president. Those folks above who slammed Obama because of his association with Wright have proven themselves Grade-A hypocrites when it comes to Bannon.    Steve Bannon, campaign chief executive for President-elect Donald Trump, leaves Trump Tower in New York on Nov. 11. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)  ""[T]hey're attacking Steve Bannon as something that I know that he's not,"" Hannity said last week, despite ample evidence to the contrary. ""The Bannon-priebus team is a tremendous choice by President elect Trump,"" Gingrich tweeted last week. ""Bannon for key strategies,priebus for daily management. great team[.]"" Notice how Gingrich, lover of protocol and titles, placed Bannon's name before that of Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee. That Gingrich lauds Bannon for ""key strategies"" speaks volumes. ""He is a patriot. He loves America,"" Giuliani generously said of Bannon last week. ""He may have a different view of America than you or I, but he loves America as much as you or I do."" [Giuliani continues his ugly race to the bottom against Obama] Wright was kicked to the curb because he delivered caustic sermons that proved politically problematic for a parishioner on his way to the presidency. And throughout his two terms, Wright's words were used to question Obama's loyalty to the United States and delegitimize his presidency. Meanwhile, Bannon openly trafficked in racism, xenophobia and misogyny to help elect Trump and appeasers are attempting to divorce the man from what he actively championed at Breitbart and on Trump's campaign as he stands ready to assume enormous power as senior counselor to the president. ""I'm not a white nationalist,"" Bannon told Michael Wolff of the Hollywood Reporter in an interview published Friday, ""I'm a nationalist."" Translation: don't believe your lying eyes.    President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on Nov. 10. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  The America I was taught to love demanded more from its leaders. Our presidents were held to high and seemingly impossible moral standards because they were considered a reflection of our better selves. They are more than who we are. They are who we aspire to be. That a majority of the American people voted for Hillary Clinton is an affirmation of those aspirations. Trump's ascendancy to the presidency and the senior counselor who will guide him during it are stunning shows of contempt for who we have always sought to be.

Trump must choose thousands of appointees and nominees who will oversee the nation's security, economy, foreign affairs and domestic policies. His picks so far suggest that loyalty is paramount. Early backers and those who served key roles in Trump's campaign will continue to form the inner circle of a Trump administration filled with a combination of experienced, Washington insiders and controversial outsiders, including some whose selection has sparked anger and alarm. Here's who he's chosen so far. -- WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Reince Priebus The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Priebus earned Trump's trust and confidence over the campaign. The 44-year-old Wisconsin political operative, who has spent his career as a Republican party official, is poised to be one of Trump's most important gatekeepers, controlling access to the president and providing counsel. -- CHIEF STRATEGIST and SENIOR COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Steve Bannon One of Trump's most controversial hires to date, Bannon joined Trump's campaign as CEO in August after serving as the head of Breitbart News -- a far-right outlet that is one of Trump's biggest backers. Bannon, 62, worked for Goldman Sachs, then started his own media-focused boutique investment banking firm. After selling the business, he became a film producer, which introduced him to conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart and author Peter Schweizer. Jewish groups and a long list of Democratic leaders have denounced Bannon's hiring and called on Trump to reconsider. -- ATTORNEY GENERAL: Sen. Jeff Sessions The first senator to endorse the president elect, Alabama's Sessions is known for his tough stance on immigration enforcement policies. Sessions, who served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and Alabama attorney general before his election to the U.S. Senate, is expected to push the Justice Department to the right. Sessions, 69, could, however, face confirmation hiccups: His last confirmation hearing, in 1986 for a federal judgeship, was derailed over allegations that he'd made racially charged remarks while U.S. attorney in Alabama. -- ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY: Michael Flynn A retired Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn was another early Trump backer and served as the president-elect's top military adviser during the campaign. After retiring in 2014, Flynn quickly turned on the Obama administration and accused it of being soft on terrorism.In recent public comments, Flynn has emphasized his view that Islamic State extremists pose an existential threat on a global scale and demanded a far more aggressive U.S. military campaign against the group. In August, he declared that Islam ""is a political ideology"" and that it ""definitely hides behind being a religion."" DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: Rep. Mike Pompeo -- The Kansas congressman is a relatively new face in Trump's circle. The hard-line Republican shares much of Trump's worldview. He has heavily criticized the landmark Iran nuclear deal, blasted Hillary Clinton over the attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Libya and her use of a private email server, and believes Edward Snowden is a traitor who deserves a death sentence.

If there was any doubt about whether Donald Trump meant business with his hard-line campaign pronouncements on immigration, race, terrorism and more, the president-elect went a long way to dispel them Friday with his first appointments to his national security team and at the Justice Department. Trump's trifecta in selecting Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn for national security adviser and Rep. Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA sent a strong message that Americans are going to get what they voted for in electing a Republican whose campaign talk about national security matters largely toggled between tough and tougher. There has been ongoing mystery about what to expect in a Trump presidency: Even some of Trump's own supporters wrote off some of his more provocative campaign comments. Trump's own policy statements have zigged and zagged depending on the audience. And his first two appointments to the White House staff -- GOP Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and onetime Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon as a senior adviser -- sent a mixed message with the choice of an establishment figure and a flame-throwing outsider. But Friday's picks offered a concrete indication that Trump's presidency may in fact be headed sharply to the right on issues of national security.  ""If you believe in personnel as policy, it's pretty clear where the arrows are pointing,"" says Calvin Mackenzie, a presidential scholar at Colby College in Maine. Princeton historian Julian Zelizer says the three choices all represent conservative figures with track records in government, not ""wildly out-of-the-box people who don't even come from the world of politics.""  ""That's a message not just about him following through on his campaign promises, but it's about partisanship,"" says Zelizer. ""He's giving a signal to the Republicans to stick with him because he'll deliver."" Trump still has plenty of big appointments yet to make, including secretary of state, that could telegraph other directions. And Congress, too, will have a say in setting national security policy. Trump's three latest all have sharply differed with Obama administration policy: --Sessions, the Alabama senator and former federal prosecutor, is known for his tough stance on immigration enforcement. He's questioned whether terrorism suspects should get the protection of the U.S. court system, opposes closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and has highlighted concerns about voting fraud, which the Obama administration sees as a non-issue. He has said Obama's counterterrorism policies have ""emboldened our enemies"" and those concerned about warrantless wiretaps have ""exaggerated the extent to which this is somehow violative of our Constitution."" His appointment to a federal judgeship in 1986 fell through after he was accused of making racially charged statements while U.S. attorney in Alabama. --Pompeo, the three-term congressman from Kansas, is an outspoken opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, has said NSA leaker Edward Snowden is a traitor who deserves the death sentence and has said Muslim leaders are ""potentially complicit"" in terrorist attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam. --Flynn stepped down as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in April 2014 and said he'd been forced out because he disagreed with Obama's approach to combatting extremism. Critics said he'd mismanaged the agency. Flynn has pressed for a more aggressive U.S. campaign against the Islamic State group, and favors working more closely with Russia. The three appointments sync up with messages that Trump voters sent in the exit polls on Election Night. Trump's backers put a higher priority on addressing terrorism and immigration than did Clinton's supporters. Three-fourths of them said the U.S. was doing very badly or somewhat badly at dealing with IS. Just 2 in 10 thought blacks are treated unfairly in the U.S. criminal justice system. Three-fourths backed building a wall on the southern border to control illegal immigration. Trump's positions, meanwhile, have gone through different iterations, continue to evolve and still have big gaps. On immigration, his views have arrived at a policy that sounds much like Washington as usual. The approach he sketched out in a post-election interview on ""60 Minutes"" would embrace the Obama administration's push to deport the most serious criminals who are in the U.S. illegally as well as the call by many Republican lawmakers to secure the border before considering any legal status for those who've committed immigration violations but otherwise lived lawfully. He even pulled back a bit on his vaunted southern wall, suggesting a fence may be enough for part of it. Trump the campaigner also moved away from his inflammatory vow to freeze the entry of foreign Muslims into the U.S., settling late in the race on ""extreme"" vetting of immigrants from countries and regions plagued by violent radicalism. He's vowed to crush the Islamic State group, but he won't say how. Trump has also said he believes in enhanced interrogation techniques, which can include waterboarding and other types of torture that are against the law and that many experts argue are ineffective. Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on Friday dismissed Trump's comments about waterboarding as the talk of a ""first-time neophyte running for office.""  ""Water-boarding coming back, I find that hard to believe,"" he said. ___ Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann and Calvin Woodward contributed to this report. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE: Nancy Benac has written about government and politics for 35 years. ___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac AP News Analysis Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/19/how-jeff-sessions-went-from-fringe-figure-to-mainstream-republican/	How Jeff Sessions went from fringe figure to mainstream Republican	"   Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) delivers a speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July. (Mike Segar/Reuters)  President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he will nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to run the Justice Department. A few years ago, this would have a startling pick.  Sessions has always been one of the most conservative senators in the GOP, a fringe figure perhaps best known for his hard-line views on immigration. Now, if confirmed as attorney general, he will become the nation's top law-enforcement officer.  The mainstreaming of Sessions reflects just how much politics has changed of late. His rise to prominence has as much to do with Trump as it does with his party's recent swerves to the right. When he was first elected to the Senate in 1997, Sessions was one of the nation's five most hard-line Republican senators, along with James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). But ever since the tea party shook up Congress in 2010, Sessions has found himself moving closer to the center of the GOP.  His own views haven't softened. Rather, his colleagues are getting more extreme. This chart shows the evolution of the Republican and Democratic members of the Senate over the past century using a common measure of political polarization. Both parties have been pulling away from each other in recent decades. But during the past five years, the Republican Party took a particularly sharp right turn. This scoring system, which was developed by a group of political scientists, assigns each lawmaker a number depending on how polarized their voting habits are. The red zone on the chart shows the range of scores for Republican senators over time, while the blue zone on the chart shows the range of scores for Democratic senators. Higher scores indicate more conservative voting patterns, while lower scores indicate more liberal voting patterns. Republicans who lie above the red zone -- like Sessions in his early career -- are more conservative than 90 percent of their fellow party members. Likewise, Democrats who lie below the blue zone are more liberal than 90 percent of other Democrats. In the 1940s, there was considerable overlap between Democrats and Republicans, but since the 1980s, they have grown further and further apart.     Today, Sessions is still more conservative than about three-quarters of his GOP colleagues, but he's no longer an outlier. He's been flanked by people like Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas).   During his time in the Senate, Sessions made a name for himself as an advocate for tougher immigration laws. He has repeatedly lobbied for increased security on the Mexican border, wants to reduce legal immigration, and claims that there is ""a clear nexus between immigration and terrorism.""      President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)   On one hand, this nomination makes a lot of sense for Trump. Sessions was the first sitting senator to endorse Trump, and his border-hawk views align well with the Trump brand. He has been a close adviser to the campaign, a loyal surrogate and serves as vice chairman of Trump's transition team. It was widely expected that Sessions would be rewarded with some kind of appointment. On the other hand, Sessions carries a lot of racial baggage. As my colleagues have pointed out, Sessions was once denied a federal judgeship over allegations of racist behavior, and he has gone on record opposing the Voting Rights Act. Yet, if he is confirmed, Sessions will be the nation's chief officer in charge of protecting civil rights and voting rights. That would be, well, interesting."

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)  Evangelicals, like the candidate they backed overwhelmingly, are the proverbial dog that caught the bus. Unfortunately, the bus they caught is unlikely to take them where they want to go. Right Turn, as we did before the election, talked to Robert P. Jones, chief executive of PRRI and author of ""The End of White Christian America,"" about the election and evangelical voting, a hot topic among both supporters and opponents of President-elect Donald Trump. It's fair to say that without self-described evangelicals,Trump would not have won. ""Trump commanded the support of white Christians of all kinds this election. According to PRRI's analysis of exit poll data, a state's percentage of white Christians was more highly correlated with support for Trump than the state's percentage of whites alone or the state's percentage of white working class citizens,"" Jones explained. ""But no group of Christians supported Trump more than white evangelical Protestants, who set a new high water mark in support for Republican presidential candidates this year, when they gave Trump 81% of their votes."" Jones observed that in this election, these voters ceased to be ""values"" voters. ""I argued as early as February after Trump won the South Carolina primary that Trump had effectively converted white evangelicals from being 'values voters' to 'nostalgia voters.' But when I wrote that article, I never anticipated how total that conversation would be."" He continued: ""The traditional concerns about the character of candidates, coarsening of culture, secularization all seem to have gone completely out the window. White evangelicals' support for Trump has also completely upended their political ethics. Five years ago, only 30% of white evangelicals said that a public official who commits immoral acts in their private life could still fulfill their public duties ethically; this year, with Trump at the top of the ticket, 72% of white evangelicals agree that this bifurcation is possible."" In other words, while claiming the mantle of Christian virtues, these voters aligned themselves with someone entirely lacking them. That sets up a dilemma going forward. ""In addition to Trump's own challenges -- someone who boasted about never having asked for forgiveness and about sexually assaulting women -- it's hard to see how white evangelicals reconcile their values with Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon -- a person who has openly advocated 'turning up the hate' as a laudable political strategy -- as the president-elect's chief strategist,"" Jones said. ""This will be a real test for white evangelicals who supported Trump, especially those who claim they did so primarily because of the upcoming Supreme Court vacancy and the issue of abortion."" He added: ""For all of those white evangelicals who claim to have supported Trump narrowly on the issue of abortion and with some broader reservations, they have a particular and weighty responsibility to call out the Trump administration and hold it in check when it veers into language or policies that threaten the safety of vulnerable populations, undermines religious liberty and constitutional protections of anyone, or encourages bigoted or hateful speech and actions. Doing so loudly and early would be a real act of both patriotism and faithfulness to the principles 'values voters' have always claimed they supported."" For now, however, these Trump supporters are mute at best, and some even stoop to defend Trump and Bannon. That suggests a permanent abrogation of their role as guardians of Judeo-Christian values. Jones is as curious as the rest of us to see what happens next. ""It will be important to see what the large evangelical organizations who did not endorse Trump -- such as the Southern Baptist Convention and the National Association of Evangelicals and Christianity Today -- do,"" he observed. ""Russell Moore at the SBC and Galen Carey at the NAE will be key figures to watch here."" Jones explained: ""The challenge for these leaders and organizations is that they are addressing a membership base that has spoken decisively in support of Trump. The real question, I think, is whether white evangelicals give Trump a blank check because he is a Republican president or whether leaders might help their members find what that tradition has called a 'prophetic voice,' one that might just call Trump to repent if, for example, he follows Bannon's strategic advice to use hate as a tool to achieve political ends."" We seem to have come full circle. In response to secular, liberal critics, evangelical leaders have defended their participation in major political and social battles, citing the example of the civil rights movement, when faith leaders from Christian and Jewish denominations lent their moral authority to the fight for racial justice. If, however, Christian conservatives are now making amoral, political calculations, they cannot very well set themselves up as arbiters of values or tell their congregants how faith should influence their votes. We underscore one more aspect of evangelicals' support for Trump. There is no issue on which evangelical conservatives have been more vocal and indignant than on the issue of ""religious liberty"" -- the First Amendment right of Americans to avoid obligations that might otherwise fall on them so as to preserve their religious tradition (e.g. a conscience clause for doctors who object to performing abortions). However, in embracing a candidate who painted an entire religion as the enemy, for a time wanted to ban all its adherents and favored a ""Muslim registry"" (!) these evangelicals have been revealed to be egregious hypocrites and, yes, even religious bigots. At least we know with whom we are dealing."

McConnell, 74, is a discreet but deadly master of the Senate's legislative chess game. His role will be to steer GOP bills to the desk of a president whose name he barely spoke during a tumultuous campaign in which many Republicans viewed Trump and his incendiary comments on Muslims, veterans and others as political poison.  ""It's time to accept the results of the election, to lower the tone and to see what we can do together to make progress for the country,"" McConnell, from Kentucky, told reporters Wednesday. As Senate minority leader, Schumer will assume his weakened party's most powerful remaining post as it struggles to define its role in a Republican-dominated government. The New Yorker's ascension from his No. 3 spot has been a virtual lock since last year, when he quickly cemented votes for the top job after current Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., announced he'd retire. Most of each party's leaders will remain in their posts next year, an ironic stability following an election that seemed to show a demand by voters for change. McConnell and Schumer faced no opposition at separate closed-door meetings. Later Wednesday, Schumer visited McConnell in his office, telling a reporter afterward: ""First meeting. Working out things."" Republicans will control the White House, House and Senate but their potential Achilles' heel is the Senate, which they will dominate 52-48. Assuming Republicans don't eliminate the rule allowing filibusters, Schumer should be able to keep the GOP from the 60 votes they'd need on some issues to break the procedural delays, potential leverage for bargains.  ""Where we can work together we will,"" Schumer told reporters about Trump, with whom he shares an affection for TV soundbites and sharp elbows. But Schumer said he's also told the president-elect, ""On issues where we disagree, you can expect a strong and tough fight."" Schumer has mentioned infrastructure as an area of possible cooperation. Many Democrats will feel pressure to back Republicans on other issues, too. Twenty-five of the 33 Senate seats up for 2018 re-election are held by Democrats and their two allied independents, including several from deeply Republican states like Montana and West Virginia, and they'll have to find ways to appeal to constituents. Underscoring Democrats' effort to understand why last week's election turned so sourly against them, Schumer announced a broad, 10-member leadership team. It ranged from liberals like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to moderates like West Virginia's Joe Manchin.  ""We need to be a party that speaks to and works on behalf of all Americans,"" Schumer said. The 65-year-old Brooklynite vaulted over No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin of Illinois, who will remain in that slot. Schumer has been a savvy partisan combatant willing to strike compromises, such as on a 2013 bipartisan immigration overhaul that eventually died. McConnell has been a coolly effective leader, steering his party through a long battle over a Supreme Court vacancy and Trump's stormy presidential candidacy. McConnell distanced himself from Trump during the campaign, at times flatly refusing to discuss the race with reporters. In what seemed like a show of independence, McConnell answered a question Wednesday about whether he backs Trump's call for a five-year lobbying ban by former executive branch officials by saying the Senate will address ""the real concerns of the American people."" He cited overhauling the tax code and President Barack Obama's health care law and approving a new justice and said the Senate won't ""relitigate what anybody on either side may have said during a very hotly contested presidential race."" McConnell, who's led Senate Republicans for a decade, has pushed a conservative agenda while cutting budget deals with President Barack Obama. And he enraged Democrats by refusing to let the Senate consider Obama's nomination of federal judge Merrick Garland to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that occurred last February, which paid dividends when Trump won. In the House, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is on track to keep his job after Republicans endorsed him Wednesday by voice vote. House Democrats postponed their leadership election until Nov. 30 after junior lawmakers demanded more time to digest the Election Day results, a warning shot at Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. In a letter seeking support, Pelosi told fellow Democrats they must be ""a strong voice for hard-working families"" and ""unified, strategic and unwavering."" She said she is already backed by two-thirds of Democrats -- more than enough to win. ___ Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor, Matthew Daly, Erica Werner, Mary Clare Jalonick, Donna Cassata and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.

Trump tweeted to condemn ""professional protesters, incited by the media."" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   Forgive me for what is going to sound like an odd analogy, but the street demonstrations across the United States have given me an uncanny sense of deja vu. I live part of the time in Warsaw, and I was there last year during an ugly election. Hateful screeds about Muslim immigrants (though there are hardly any Muslim immigrants in Poland) and angry ""anti-elitist"" rhetoric overwhelmed a stiff and unpopular female leader; the center-right and center-left politicians split into quarreling factions, allowing a radical populist party to win with a minority of voters. Upon taking power, it set out to destroy the country's democratic and state institutions: the constitutional court, the independent prosecutor, the independent civil service, the public media. Poles took to the streets. There were huge demonstrations, the largest since the collapse of communism in 1989. Nobody had expected them, and -- like the demonstrations in U.S. cities last week -- nobody had planned these marches in advance. A year later, here are some reflections on their value: * Protest makes people feel better. Because the government's language was vicious and angry, the demonstrators tried hard to be nice and polite. During protest marches, they didn't walk on the grass. They chanted for ""freedom, equality, democracy,"" which has a nice lilt to it in Polish. The middle-aged ex-radicals who had demonstrated against communism in the 1980s felt energized and young again. The boost to morale was real. I am sure that's true for many marching in New York or San Francisco this week, too. * Protest, if not carefully targeted, achieves little. The Polish protests were meant to ""defend the constitution,"" a very theoretical goal. Because they were about a principle, not a policy, the government found them easy to ignore, and the slogans never inspired younger or rural voters. Sound familiar? The calculus did shift, it is true, when hundreds of thousands of Polish women dressed in black joined a national protest against a very harsh proposed abortion law. The protest was aimed at a specific measure. It took place not just in Warsaw and Krakow, but also in every city in the country, as well as many smaller towns. Perhaps the sight of so many of angry women spooked the party leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is an elderly bachelor; perhaps the thousands of photographs that appeared all over the world frightened the prime minister, who is female. In any case, this targeted, well-organized, broadly based single-issue protest had far more impact than the general marches, and the government withdrew the law. * Protests inspire conspiracy theorists. Authoritarian personalities don't believe in spontaneity. They think that everything is part of a plot to deceive them. Trump's first tweet, as president-elect, referred to protesters as ""paid."" Similarly, Kaczynski has implied variously that protesters are former members of the communist party or secret police, that they are agents of foreign powers or that they are, in the words of another radical politician, in the pay of an unnamed ""Jewish banker."" This line of thinking allows the rulers to discount the protesters. If they are ""paid"" or ""foreign"" or ""manipulated,"" after all, then they can be ignored. Also, the hard-core voting base -- in Poland, about 20 percent of the country -- can be inspired to focus its hatred and anger on the ""traitors"" instead of listening to what they are trying to say. * Politics matter more than protests. A year after the street movement began, its leaders, the ""Committee to Defend Democracy,"" have become an important part of national political culture. Their marches and meetings inspire people. Their television appearances are carefully watched. But because they kept their distance from political parties, they haven't much altered opinion polls. The government is still supported by a committed minority. The center-right and the center-left remain splintered into smaller groups. If anything, the protest movement seems to have solidified a general disdain for politics and a dislike of politicians in general. * In a democracy, real change comes through politics, political parties and elections. Poland, although damaged, is still a democracy. If the people who are willing to put time into demonstrations also prove willing to work on behalf of candidates in local elections -- or to become candidates themselves -- they will achieve far more. A mayor is in a far better position to resist attacks on the civil service than a man carrying a sign. A different parliamentary majority could block the would-be authoritarian government altogether. The same thing is true in the United States. Five Democratic senators could do more to block extremist judges or damaging policies than 5 million -- or even 50 million -- people chanting slogans. Protesting might make you feel better, it might win a few battles and it might attract attention. I'm sorry if you are angry at ""the establishment,"" but you need to work for it and within it if you want it to change."

The summoning of Kim Chong came as prosecutors prepare to take their investigation to Park, who has apologized over suspicions that she allowed her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil to manipulate power from the shadows and exploit her presidential ties to amass an illicit fortune.  ""I will sincerely attend to the prosecution's investigation,"" Kim told reporters before entering the prosecutors' office. Kim has been suspected of swinging lucrative business deals to sports organizations controlled by Choi, who prosecutors have arrested and plan to indict by the end of the week, and also influencing the ministry's decision to financially support a winter sports foundation run by Choi's niece. The media has also raised suspicions that Kim aided Choi in her alleged attempts to land Olympic construction deals through business partnerships. Nussli, a Swiss company that reportedly had a business partnership with a company Choi owned in Germany, hasn't responded to multiple requests by The Associated Press seeking to confirm whether it had tried to win construction deals for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games with the help of Choi. In a telephone conversation with the AP last week, Kim said that, under the direction of the president's office, he instructed Pyeongchang organizers sometime around March or April to review Nussli's design for temporary stands at one of the Olympic venues being built. However, Kim said the design was merely one of the alternatives reviewed as the government looked for ways to reduce Olympic costs, and that it was immediately rejected by organizers because it wasn't economical enough. Kim also said he had no knowledge at the time of business ties between Nussli and Choi's company, The Blue K. Kim resigned as deputy sports minister last month amid the allegations. Prosecutors had initially planned to question Park as early as Wednesday, but in a televised news conference on Tuesday, Park's lawyer requested more time to prepare. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of South Koreans rallied in Seoul calling for Park's resignation in what may have been the largest anti-government protest staged in the country since it shook off dictatorship three decades ago. In an attempt to stabilize the situation, Park has said she would let the opposition-controlled parliament choose her prime minister. But opposition parties say her words are meaningless without specific promises about transferring much of her presidential powers to a new No. 2. Opposition parties have yet to seriously push for Park's impeachment over fears of triggering a backlash from conservative voters and negatively impacting next year's presidential election, but they have been stepping up calls for her to resign. Under South Korean law, the president has immunity from prosecution except in cases of treason, but she can be investigated. Park has 15 months left in her term. If she steps down before the end of it, an election must be held within 60 days. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, top left, speaks about Secretary-General-designate Antonio Guterres of Portugal, right, at the United Nations in New York on Oct. 13. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)  Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, was assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs in the Reagan administration and responsible for United Nations matters at the National Security Council in the George W. Bush administration. For the first time in decades, the United Nations is undergoing a transition at exactly the same time as the United States. The term of the outgoing secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, ends on Dec. 31, and his successor, Antonio Guterres, takes over on Jan. 1, 2017. There are opportunities here--for Guterres, a former prime minister of Portugal, and his team to forge a constructive relationship with President Trump and his administration. The United States remains the U.N.'s largest contributor, supplying 22 percent of the U.N. regular budget and making very large voluntary contributions to many U.N. agencies. For Guterres to succeed in his job he will need a good relationship with our new president and Donald Trump's new secretary of state and U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, as our ambassador is formally called. The time to start cultivating relationships of trust and confidence is now. But the dual transition also poses risks. Guterres will be making up his mind over the next few months about his key appointments in the U.N. Secretariat -- at a time when the Trump team is not yet in place and the influence of the Obama administration is fading. Guterres will be choosing  officials to run U.N. agencies such as the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), as well as for his own top staff. He'll be choosing U.N. special representatives handling Syria and Libya and myriad other problems that affect U.S. interests. The number-three position in the United Nations, the under-secretary-general for political affairs, has been held by American citizens for the past decade -- and is arguably the most important American post in the entire U.N. system. Having an American at the top of the World Food Program and UNICEF (as we do now) is nice, but doesn't much affect U.S interests. Having an American as under-secretary-general for management is useful, but we don't need an American for that; a Swiss, a Brit or a Singaporean could do the job just as well. Having an American in the Department of Political Affairs job does matter for U.S. interests, because that department has a budget of more than $600 million, is involved with every sensitive global political issue and has missions in dozens of global trouble spots. The under-secretary-general for political affairs works for the U.N., not the U.S. government, and does not share confidential information with American officials--whatever the Russians or Chinese may think. Moreover, the Americans selected for this job have been American career diplomats, not political appointees from the party in power in Washington. But the man or woman in that position has the secretary-general's ear on matters of real significance for U.S. security. He or she can bring to the United Nations a real understanding of American goals and interests. If there is no American in this position, Guterres could make decisions that will compromise U.S. interests and ruin his own relationship with Trump, without even knowing he is doing so. As a European from an E.U.- and NATO-member country, Guterres may want to bend over backward to show he is not beholden to the Western countries or the United States, or he may think he fully understands what the U.S. interests and objectives are. If so, he would be making a great mistake. So Guterres should be told right now by the current U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, that if he takes the Department of Political Affairs position away from the United States, he will be making a decision that will shadow his entire tenure at the U.N. And the Trump transition team should somehow reach out to him to deliver the same message. Guterres should be reminded that he cannot succeed as secretary-general without the full support of the U.N.'s most generous and most powerful member, and that downgrading American participation in the top U.N. ranks would be commencing his relationship with the new administration in an almost irreversibly negative way. Here is an issue on which the outgoing Obama and incoming Trump administrations will see eye to eye:  If the United States does not engage with Guterres's team soon, we will lose opportunities and decisions will be made without us.  We can be sure Russia, China, Iran, and others will act to fill the gap. As the dual transitions continue in the United States and the United Nations, our current and our next presidents together should act very soon to assert American influence at the United Nations and with the new secretary-general.
