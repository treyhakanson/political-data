The Daily Record of Baltimore reports (http://bit.ly/2fZN1e2) the city made the appeal Wednesday. Senior U.S. District Court Judge Marvin Garbis ruled last month that the ordinance violates the Center for Pregnancy Concern's free speech rights. The center, which operates in buildings owned by the Catholic Church, provides free pregnancy services to women but does not refer them for abortions. Enforcement of the ordinance is on hold until the litigation is resolved. ___ Information from: The Daily Record of Baltimore, http://www.thedailyrecord.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

But housing experts say consumers shouldn't get carried away by the post-election wave. The advance of the past week or so, stoked by a surprise victory that turned economic expectations on their head, could soon settle.  ""Consumers considering buying or refinancing now should stay patient, as we'll likely see rates stabilize once markets find a new equilibrium,"" says Erin Lantz, vice president of mortgages at Zillow. In the week ended Thursday, the average rate on the 30-year fixed-rate loan jumped to 3.94 percent from 3.57 percent the previous week, mortgage company Freddie Mac reported. That put the benchmark rate close to its year-ago level of 3.97 percent. The average for a 15-year mortgage, a popular choice for people who are refinancing, climbed to 3.14 percent from 2.88 percent. The rate rise was powered by a sustained decline in U.S. government bond prices in the days after Trump's victory became known early last Wednesday. Bond investors looked toward tax cuts and beefed-up spending to upgrade roads, bridges and airports under a Trump administration, which could fuel inflation. That would depress prices of long-term Treasury bonds because inflation would erode their value over time. The selling wave dubbed the ""Trump Dump"" lifted bond yields, which move opposite to prices and influence long-term mortgage rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond zoomed to 2.06 percent last Wednesday from 1.87 percent on Election Day Tuesday. By this Thursday morning, it was at 2.25 percent Thursday. Adding to the expectations of higher interest rates, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen sketched a picture Thursday of an improving U.S. economy and said the case for an increase in rates has strengthened. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates when it meets in mid-December. Spilling over into the mortgage market, prospective buyers have appeared to be streaming in.  ""We are seeing borrower demand up,"" said Sam Mischner, senior vice president of sales at LendingTree. Still, mortgage rates remain near historically low levels. The all-time low for the 30-year rate was 3.31 percent in November 2012.  ""Rates are so low,"" said Patrick Newport, U.S. economist at HIS Global Insight. If the new expectations for the economy and interest rates ""make a dent in the housing market, it shouldn't be much."" The low rates have helped boost home sales and prices this year. But there are economic unknowns as the new administration's economic policy starts to take shape. And constraints on home purchases like tight credit standards and affordability remain, bolstered by market expectations of further rate increases. Steadily rising rates would ultimately limit the number of possible buyers and how much they can afford to pay. And existing homeowners who might otherwise be looking for an upgrade could choose to stay put rather than face higher interest costs. The median sales price of existing homes has climbed 5.6 percent from a year ago to $234,200, according to the National Association of Realtors. To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount. The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged from last week at 0.5 point. The fee for a 15-year loan also held steady at 0.5 point. Rates on adjustable five-year mortgages averaged 3.07 percent, up sharply from 2.88 percent last week. The fee remained at 0.4 point. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It's a phrase that became synonymous with Donald Trump's high-intensity campaign rallies, an expression that became more rallying cry than policy proposal during his rise to political power. As Trump's candidacy gained momentum over the past year, calls for shoring up America's southern border became something else -- a form of teenage bullying. One of the latest examples came at a high school volleyball tournament in Snyder, Tex., where Archer City High was facing off with Fort Hancock on Friday. Clumped in the stands, according to the Dallas Morning News, a group of Archer City students holding Trump/Pence signs and wearing wigs, trucker hats and fake mustaches directed a chant toward their opponents on the other side of the gym: ""Build that wall."" Fort Hancock is about an hour south of El Paso, along the Mexican border. The Fort Hancock Independent School District's student population is 97 percent Hispanic, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Archer City is about two hours northwest of Dallas, near the Oklahoma border. The Star-Telegram, citing the Texas Education Agency, noted that Archer City High had an enrollment of 384 students last year, 83 percent of whom were white. Just 9 percent of the students were Hispanic. The Archer City students also held a Texas flag and a second one declaring, ""Come and Take It."" The latter is an iconic emblem of the Texas revolution that was flown at the Battle of Gonzales, the first military clash between Texans and Mexican forces. Known to anyone who's taken an eighth-grade history class in the state, it remains a source of antagonistically tinged pride among some Texans who look down upon their southern neighbor.   [A Baylor student was shoved and called the n-word. This is how the school responded.]   For some in the crowd, the chant and the flag were highly offensive. ""No doubt in my mind that this sentiment has always existed with groups of people but to display it so openly is so not correct!,"" Carlos Urias wrote in a post on Facebook the next day. ""I guess it makes it easier to treat others in this manner being that this sentiment was modeled verbally during the course of the presidential campaign. ........Sad."" The ""Build that wall"" chant had become a fixture of Trump's raucous rallies, The Washington Post's Jenna Johnson reported in February: ""The wall nearly always comes up in Trump's rally speeches and it often prompts laughter and applause -- and protesters with signs outside the rallies,"" Johnson reported. ""The wall is so popular with his supporters that Trump gleefully realized at a recent rally that he could drown out a protester who was starting to act out by suddenly switching topics and mentioning the wall. At Trump's rally at the University of South Florida in Tampa on Friday, one guy dressed up as the wall, wearing a white bodysuit with bricks drawn on it and a sign reading: ""The Trump Wall."" As the promise of the Trump's wall becomes bigger, grander and more fantastical, it is sometimes difficult to tell if Trump is joking or sharing a serious policy development. Trump said Friday that he's dead serious. ""These people come up to me, they say: 'Donald! You don't really mean we're going to build a wall, do you?' And I say, I say: 'Absolutely, we're going to build a wall,'"" Trump said, as the crowd yet again cheered. ""Hundred percent.""   [Middle schoolers chant 'build that wall' during lunch in aftermath of Trump win]   The Archer City School District said in a Facebook statement Sunday that administrators were ""aware of some offensive language used by our student section during the Ft. Hancock game"" and were taking ""appropriate action ... to address this behavior."" ""In no way do we condone this type of language or behavior,"" the statement read. ""We apologize to the students and community of Ft. Hancock. The administration is making every effort to ensure this doesn't happen again."" Archer City Superintendent C.D. Knobloch told the Star-Telegram that he suspected heated emotions from the election spilled over into the volleyball match. ""In my opinion it is stemming from the presidential election,"" Knoblock told the paper. ""If we hadn't had that election last week, this wouldn't have happened. Our students are not racists. It's as simple as that."" ""We're sorry this happened,"" Knobloch added. ""The whole community is torn up about it."" Fort Hancock Superintendent Jose Franco told the Star-Telegram that he accepted Archer City's apology. ""I guess what bothered me most was no adults, no officials did anything about it while the match was going on,"" Franco told the paper. ""We come from a very competitive district where's there's plenty of trash talk and that's just part of the game, having fun with it, but this is the first time it has ever crossed the line."" ""Little did they know that Hudspeth County where we live went for Trump,"" Franco added. Sixty-seven percent of Hudspeth County, in fact, voted for the Republican candidate while 28 percent voted for Hillary Clinton, according to the Texas Secretary of State. In Archer County, Trump collected 88 percent of the vote to Clinton's 9 percent. Perhaps even more absurd, Franco told the Star-Telegram, was the concept of chanting ""build that wall"" at Texans who live near the Mexican border. ""You know the wall is a joke, right?"" Franco said. ""My office sits less than a mile from the Rio Grande port of entry. We have a wall. It looks like something out of Jurassic Park. It goes two miles each way from the port of entry and then it ends in nothing.""   ['Bye, Donald Trump lover': Video shows mother kicking her young son out over mock election vote]   The Texas chant was one of numerous incidents that occurred in the wake of Trump's Election Day victory. Students at a Michigan middle school began chanting ""build the wall!"" during lunch on the day after Trump's election.      Students at a middle school in Royal Oak, Mich., chanted ""build the wall"" in the school cafeteria, following Donald Trump's presidential win Nov. 9. (Anonymous via Storyful)   A black student at Baylor said she was shoved by a white male while walking to class on the morning after the election. Her assailant, a fellow student, told her ""no n---s allowed on the sidewalk,"" she said -- then echoed Trump's campaign slogan, declaring: ""I'm just trying to make America great again."" Days later, a University of Michigan student was approached by a stranger who threatened to set her on fire if she didn't remove her hijab, campus police said. At a high school in Pennsylvania, two students paraded through the hallways with a Trump sign as one student shouted, ""White power!"" -- a moment that was captured on video. On Saturday, an Episcopal church in Maryland was vandalized with a chilling message: ""Trump nation. Whites only."" The following morning, in central Indiana, the organist at an Episcopal church discovered a swastika, an anti-gay slur and ""HEIL TRUMP"" spray-painted on the outside walls. In an interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes"" broadcast Sunday night, Trump said that he was ""so saddened to hear"" that people were harassing others in his name. ""And I say, 'Stop it,'"" the president-elect said. ""If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say it right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'"" Three days later, a Maryland high school student wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat was injured and taken to the hospital after he scuffled with a group of anti-Trump protesters who punched and kicked him.          1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

State Rep. Curt Nisly, of Goshen, says he'll sponsor the bill when the Legislature meets in January. Abortion-rights groups are certain to oppose the measure, and it is doubtful that it will advance in the Statehouse. But anti-abortion groups are emboldened by Donald Trump's election and hope the Republican president-elect will appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade. Social conservative activist Monica Boyer says now is the time to push for legislation like Nisly's. She and other abortion opponents hope a legal challenge would reach the nation's highest court.

As the operation to retake Mosul enters its second month on Thursday, Iraqi forces are preparing for prolonged, grueling urban combat. They have slowed the tempo of their operations, advancing just a few hundred meters at a time. Iraqi forces have gathered troops many times the estimated 5,000 IS fighters in the city. But hundreds of thousands of civilians still remain in the city. And the ferocity and magnitude of IS counterattacks and defenses in Mosul is unlike anything Iraqi forces have confronted in the fight against the militant group so far. As a result, overwhelming force can't bring swift victory, and the campaign is likely to take weeks. THE EASTERN FRONT Iraqi forces have advanced the furthest and faced the heaviest resistance in Mosul's east. Iraq's special forces say they control significant pockets of four of Mosul's easternmost neighborhoods: Zahra, Qadisiya, Tahrir and Gogjali. The territory measures less than a tenth of the city's total area. Inside those neighborhoods, Iraqi forces are now surrounded by thousands of civilians as they continue to push to the city center. The presence of civilians has already thwarted the use of overwhelming air power to clear territory. Iraqi officers say they also worry that IS supporters among the civilians are helping the group.  ""We control all of this area,"" Iraqi special forces Maj. Ahmed Mamouri said, speaking in the Zahra district. ""We've cleared the territory of fighters, but some of the civilians still support Daesh,"" he said using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. Mamouri said he believes IS supporters still living in this neighborhood are acting as spotters to aim mortar attacks and scout targets for suicide bombers. That forces his men to not only focus on the front-line fight, but also look backward and repeatedly screen the thousands living among his men's positions, supply lines and defenses. When IS initially swept into Mosul in 2014 the group was met with significant popular support from residents, who are overwhelmingly from the Sunni Muslim minority that has long resented marginalization by the Shiite-dominated central government. That support has eroded under more than two years of harsh militant rule and dire living conditions, Iraqi and coalition officials believe. ___ A COMPLEX, BLOODY FIGHT AHEAD Over the past year, Iraqi forces have slowly clawed back territory from IS. Facing a militant organization that proclaimed itself a state, Iraq's security forces battled IS with conventional military tactics: cutting supply lines, besieging cities and measuring victory in square kilometers. In Mosul, Iraqi forces are undertaking a much more complex fight. Mosul is not yet surrounded by Iraqi forces and has smuggling routes and supply lines with IS territory in Syria. Iraq has mobilized some 100,000 troops from the military, as well as tribal and militia fighters, to take on the estimated 5,000 IS fighters inside Mosul. Also, the U.S.-led coalition has deployed some 100 U.S. troops to Iraqi front lines to help. The coalition has also launched more than 4,000 airstrike the past month, mainly around Mosul, and provided Iraqi forces with surveillance and intelligence. The individual tactics employed by IS mirror past fights: extensive tunnel systems, large, armored car bombs, snipers and small units of fighters left behind to fight to the death. But the sheer scale of IS defenses and counterattacks in Mosul has stunned Iraq's military. During a single week, Iraqi special forces Lt. Col. Muhanad al-Tamimi said more than 30 car bombs attacked his troops on Mosul's eastern edge. The U.S.-led coalition estimates that since the operation was formally announced, coalition airstrikes destroyed hundreds of meters of IS tunnel networks. The group has deployed 158 car bombs since the assault on Mosul began, according to a senior Iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the number. Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S.-led forces supporting the operation, said Tuesday that airstrikes had destroyed 59 suicide car bombs and over 80 tunnels used by Islamic State fighters. ___ HUMANITARIAN FALLOUT In past fights against IS in Ramadi and Fallujah, Iraqi ground forces emptied entire cities of their civilian populations, simplifying the battlefield. In Mosul, a city more than five times the size of Ramadi, that's not an option. Aid groups warn that the massive displacement of those still living in Mosul would overwhelm humanitarian organizations and the Iraqi government. Iraqi commanders responded by telling people to stay in their homes and wait out the fight. But aid groups and government agencies can't reach the thousands sheltering so close to the front line.  ""We give them everything,"" said al-Tamimi, who commands one of the divisions leading the Mosul advance. He says his men distribute extra food and water to civilians when they can, but eventually the government needs to step in. Convoys of black armored Humvees weave past small groups of civilians sitting on street corners and crowds lining up outside a handful of reopened shops. Hundreds of civilians also continue to flee daily from areas still under IS control, filing past front lines and holding white flags fashioned from scraps of fabric. ___ SOUTHERN AND WESTERN ADVANCES Iraqi forces to the south, north and west of the city are struggling to cut supply lines and tighten their hold on the city. On the city's southern approach, Iraqi forces advanced more than 40 kilometers (24 miles) over the past month, largely up the Tigris River valley. They are now preparing to launch an operation to retake Mosul's airport on the city's southern edge. Over 60 kilometers (36 miles) west of Mosul, government-sanctioned Shiite militia forces are slowly working to surrounded the historically Turkmen town of Tal Afar, which sits on a key supply line linking IS-controlled territory in Iraq to the group's holdings in Syria. ___ ONE FAMILY'S STORY Since the operation began, more than 56,000 civilians around northern Iraq have been forced from their homes, according to the United Nations. Inside Mosul, thousands remain in neighborhoods retaken by government forces. But thousands more have been driven from their homes by the fighting. Mahmoud and his family waited out weeks of airstrikes and shelling in Mosul's Qadisiya al-Thaniya neighborhood. Loud explosions that shook the house and broke windows became commonplace. Early in the operation, an airstrike destroyed a car bomb just two houses away.  ""The shrapnel landed on the roof of our house and in the garden,"" he said. He spoke on condition only his first name be used, fearing for the safety of family still in IS-held parts of Mosul. When clashes broke out on his street, Mahmoud decided to pick up and move a few blocks away from the front line with his wife, children and their grandparents. Everyone packed small bags and waited until the fighting subsided at dawn to flee. Then just minutes after leaving their home, Mahmoud's father in law stepped on a booby-trapped explosive. The blast killed him instantly. The rest of the family suffered shrapnel wounds. After the blast, Iraqi troops evacuated the entire family to a front-line field clinic on the city's outskirts.  ""I haven't told my children yet that their grandfather is gone,"" Mahmoud whispered, his eyes welling with tears. From here, he said he was told his family would be taken to a camp for displaced civilians to wait until it's safe to return.  ""This war will be difficult,"" he said, ""I don't expect to go home for at least a year."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Here, a listing for a 1-bedroom condo in Penn Quarter. (Screengrab from Airbnb.com)  As the country braces for Donald Trump's presidency, Lyudmila Tregubova is preparing in her own way: By readying the two bedrooms in her Capitol Hill home for overnight guests during January's inauguration. She's charging $615 for one bedroom, which has already been booked, and $550 for the other. Tregubova, meanwhile, will relocate to a couch on the living room. ""With inauguration, you post a room -- and all of a sudden it's booked,"" said Tregubova, 57, who began renting out her house during President Obama's first inauguration in 2009. ""The demand is big."" As thousands make plans to descend on Washington for Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration -- as well as the next day's Million Woman March protest -- local Airbnb bookings are nearing all-time highs, company spokesman Crystal Davis says. More than 10,000 people are expected to book Airbnb rentals in the Washington area for inauguration day -- a 600 percent increase from 2013 during President Obama's second inauguration, according to company projections. ""This is, without a doubt, the busiest event for us,"" said Karl Scarlett, owner of Great Dwellings, a District-based company that helps homeowners manage Airbnb rentals. ""January in D.C. is usually brutal for this industry. But when there's an inauguration, people are literally booking in the $1,000-a-night range.""   [One of the most lavish hotel inauguration packages includes a private chef for your dog]   A recent search on Airbnb's website turned up listings commanding as much as $10,000 per night for a two-bedroom condo at the Newseum. With taxes and fees, the total for a three-night stay was $36,532. A ""bright hip spot in Columbia Heights"" that generally rents for $90 a night, was listed for a nightly rate of $1,333. With taxes and fees, that would set you back $4,882 for a three-night stay. Looking for a bit more space? A ""luxury rowhouse"" in Logan Circle promises two bedrooms for nearly $2,700 a night. Lara Hawketts, owner of Home Sweet City, which manages local Airbnb rentals, says inauguration weekend prices are, on average, four times higher than the usual going-rate. The company is also requiring a seven-day minimum for inauguration bookings. ""This is the likely the most people will ever pay,"" she said. During Cherry Blossom season, for example, prices are marked up about 50 percent. ""It's been interesting to see the rise in demand.""   [Want to put your apartment on Airbnb? Here's what you need to know first.]   Right after the election, she says, things weren't looking so great. Following Trump's win last week, Hawkett says she received a wave of phone calls -- all cancellations -- from Hillary Clinton supporters. A number of area hotels told The Washington Post they had similar experiences. ""We had a bunch of bookings pre-election -- and literally the day after the results came in, they all cancelled,"" she said. ""But now it's creeping back up."" Tregubova says she's prepared for whatever January's festivities may bring. After all, she says, in 2009, she had 16 guests staying under her roof. ""Everything was booked, so people were saying, 'Please, please, we'll sleep on the floor,'"" she said, adding that she ended up renting out her parlor to a family of four who brought their own air mattress. She has since downsized, from a 5-bedroom house to a 2-bedroom, and says she's learned a thing or two about playing host to inaugural revelers. ""It's simple,"" she said.

Repeal the Affordable Care Act. Privatize (excuse me, ""reform and strengthen"") Medicare. Slash Medicaid. Cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations. Undo environmental protections. Make it harder for unions to organize. Repeal the Dodd-Frank law to unburden Wall Street from meddlesome oversight. Defund Planned Parenthood. Build a border wall.  It's a veritable smorgasbord, and after eight years of a Democratic presidency, they are positively famished. But there's one thing standing in their way: the filibuster. With only a 51-seat majority in the Senate (52 seats if, as expected, the Republican candidate wins a runoff election in Louisiana), they're nowhere near the 60-vote supermajority they'd need to overcome Democratic filibusters. So now they have to answer a question: Will they kill the filibuster once and for all?  For some time now -- starting many months ago when contemplating the possibility of full Republican control of government -- I've been arguing that they will. With all those tantalizing laws just waiting to be passed, and with an angry base ready to revolt if they don't do what they promised, it will be just too tempting. Yes, they might come to regret it the next time there's a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate, which could happen four years from now. But the first time Democrats filibuster an important GOP priority -- especially ACA repeal, which Republicans turned into a symbolic vessel for all their hatred of President Obama and all their supposed ideological commitments -- talk radio and Fox News will explode with rage and a demand to nuke the filibuster once and for all. The pressure will simply be too hard to resist. But I may have been wrong. The narrowness of the Republican majority means that Democrats would need only a couple of Republicans to vote with them to deny the GOP the 51 votes it needs to institute a change in Senate rules. And now at least four Republican senators have gone on record saying that the filibuster should stay. Lindsey Graham said emphatically that ending the filibuster would be ""a horrible, terrible idea."" Orrin Hatch was even more categorical. ""Are you kidding?"" he responded when asked by the Huffington Post's Michael McAuliff whether it should be eliminated. ""I'm one of the biggest advocates for the filibuster. It's the only way to protect the minority, and we've been in the minority a lot more than we've been in the majority."" And NBC's Benjy Sarlin reports that Jeff Flake and Jim Inhofe both told him the filibuster should stay. There are a few reasons Senate Republicans might want to keep it. First, senators are very, very protective of their privileges, the many ways the institution gives each member extraordinary powers to slow things down and even grind them to a halt. A Senate that runs on simple majority rule would be almost like the House, a prospect senators of both parties find utterly horrifying.  Second, Mitch McConnell may find it handy to allow some pieces of Republican legislation to die in the Senate, particularly ones that threaten to produce the kind of political backlash that would threaten his majority and President Trump's reelection. The House is likely to produce a torrent of far-right bills, and McConnell can allow the more dangerous ones to be filibustered, then put the blame on Democrats when angry conservatives bellow. The trouble is that it's not up to him which bills Democrats choose to filibuster and which they don't. And if they follow the precedent McConnell established during the Obama years, they'll just filibuster everything. That was McConnell's innovation: While the filibuster was once a technique that members of the minority used only rarely (and it once required actual talking, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington""-style), McConnell made it the default for any legislation more consequential than the renaming of a post office or a measure declaring August to be Jock Itch Awareness Month.   Presuming Democrats go that route, it wouldn't mean there'd be nothing congressional Republicans could do, because they can use the ""reconciliation"" process -- in which filibusters are not allowed -- for some things, particularly changes to taxing and spending. But they'll quickly find reconciliation's limits to be painfully constricting, and pressure will begin to build. That's when the Republican senators now standing behind the filibuster might begin to waver. You could easily imagine a scenario where Democrats filibuster the first few big Republican bills, and then things suddenly look very different. Those Republicans might say that when they supported the filibuster, it was on the assumption that Democrats would use it responsibly, but now that they've seen the full extent of the Democrats' villainous obstructionism, they must regretfully support the end of this formerly noble instrument of democracy that those dastardly Democrats twisted into a tool to subvert the people's will. It's too early to know exactly what will happen, particularly since we don't know how the impulsive, vindictive buffoon in the Oval Office is going to inject himself into this process. But Republicans will learn that even when you control all three branches of government, things can still get complicated."

The president says ""if you're not serious about the job, then you probably won't be there very long because it will expose problems."" The president says he told Trump when they met that the passions generated during the campaign may not work in unifying the country now, and Trump seemed to understand that. But Obama suggests Trump's ability to unify the public will tested by how he uses his rhetoric now and the appointments he makes for his administration. ___ 6:20 p.m. President Barack Obama says he won't advise people protesting Donald Trump's election victory to keep silent. His message instead: Voting and organizing matter. Obama says he has continually told young people not to take the nation's systems of government and way of life for granted. He says democracy is hard work and noted some 43 percent of eligible voters didn't vote. Obama also says that the foundations of a health democracy mean people have to be engaged, not just in an election or when an issue pops up for a few weeks. ___ 6:10 p.m. President Barack Obama says he hopes President-elect Donald Trump will ""stand up to Russia"" when it deviates from U.S. values and international norms. Obama says on issues such as the Ukraine and Syria, the U.S. has very significant differences with Russia. He says it's important to find areas of cooperation with Russia when values align, but he also hopes the new president will be firm with Russia when they don't. Obama says he's doesn't expect Trump to follow the Obama' administration blueprint or approach, but also hopes he won't simply walk away from the administration's efforts. The president also says Trump's commitment to NATO is important. ___ 5:55 p.m. German Chancellor Angela Merkel says her country is prepared to increase its military commitments as demanded by allies such as the United States. Germany has long been criticized by the alliance for not meeting its obligation to commit at least 2 percent of its GDP to defense spending. And President-elect Donald Trump pressed NATO allies during his election campaign to pay their share, and suggested the U.S. might back away from the alliance if they don't. Merkel says: ""We got the message and have started to react."" She was speaking at a press conference with President Barack Obama in Berlin on Thursday. Germany spent about 1.2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense last year. ___ 5:50 p.m. President Barack Obama says it's important that global trade agreements continue when concerns are running high about globalization and its effects on some people. Obama is holding a news conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Obama is alluding to skepticism in the U.S. about free trade agreements that was on display in the recent election of Donald Trump. Obama says the last several decades have shown that markets, trade and commerce can create prosperity in all countries. The president also says the European Union remains one of the world's great achievements. He says those achievements should be nurtured and cultivated, not taken for granted. ___ 5:45 p.m. German Chancellor Angela Merkel says the world can't revert to a time before globalization. She says her country will continue to pursue free trade deals with the United States. Negotiations over a trans-Atlantic trade pact failed to conclude before the end of President Barack Obama's second term, effectively putting the project on ice for years to come. Merkel told a news conference with Obama in Berlin on Thursday that she is ""quite sure we will return to it one day."" She says she hopes to ""work closely with the new president"" when Donald Trump takes office next year. Trump's skepticism about free trade agreements underpinned his campaign. ___ 5:15 p.m. The United States urged Russia a week before Election Day to stop interfering in the election through cyberattacks. That's according to a senior Obama administration official who requested anonymity to discuss private diplomatic conversations. The official says the U.S. contacted Moscow about malicious cyber activity that was originating in Russia and targeting U.S. elections systems. The complaint was registered through a secure ""hotline"" between the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in both the U.S. and Russia. The U.S. has previously accused Russia publicly of coordinating hacks of the Democratic National Committee and other U.S. institutions in the run-up to last week's presidential election. --By Josh Lederman ___ 4 p.m. President Barack Obama is sitting down with German Chancellor Angela Merkel for formal meetings in Berlin as part of Obama's sixth and final visit to the nation. The two leaders sat down on opposite sides of a long table along with top foreign policy aides. Obama was accompanied by his national security adviser, Susan Rice. Obama and Merkel made no comments to reporters as they started the meeting. They'll take questions together at a news conference later Thursday afternoon. ___ 3:40 p.m. German news magazine Der Spiegel says U.S. President Barack Obama has praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel as someone ""who is willing to fight for her values."" Obama told Spiegel and German public Television ARD in a joint interview Thursday that he's glad Merkel is around and that ""the Germans should appreciate her."" Obama also warned not to underestimate the consequences of globalization. The president told the two media organizations that, ""If the global economy does not respond to the people who feel left behind; if inequality continues to grow, we will witness that the divisions in the industrial countries will broaden."" Der Spiegel and ARD released excerpts of the talk with Obama ahead of the screening of the entire interview on Thursday night. ___ 1:50 p.m. White House press secretary Josh Earnest says the Obama administration has ""put a lot of diplomatic capital on the table"" to resolve the protracted civil war in Syria and acknowledges it ""hasn't worked,"" but says military force is no solution. Interviewed on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" show Thursday from Berlin where he's accompanying Obama on a visit to Germany, Earnest was asked about the continuing loss of life, including children, in the Syrian city of Aleppo.  ""What is true is that the tactics that have been used by the Assad regime and the Russians are frankly disgraceful,"" Earnest said, accusing them of seeking to target ""innocent civilians"" and saying it was an ""outrage.""  ""The question really is"" what the United States and the international community can do to end the violence, Earnest said, adding that Secretary of State John Kerry ""has been working doggedly"" to bring relief for the suffering. ___ 12:05 p.m. President Barack Obama is opening his first full day in Berlin by having lunch with U.S. Ambassador John Emerson. The White House says they're having a private lunch at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. Obama also spent part of his morning taping a joint interview with the Der Spiegel newspaper and German public TV station ARD. Obama plans to meet later Thursday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and hold a joint news conference with her. ___ 9:08 p.m. President Barack Obama is stressing a message of solidarity on his final visit to Germany -- a top trade partner, key NATO ally and home to thousands of American troops, as well as a nation critical to solving Europe's migrant crisis and debt woes. Obama arrived Wednesday night in Berlin from Greece, making his sixth and final visit as president to Germany, where he has been popular since even before he was elected. His eight years in office have helped erase much of the anti-American sentiment that had grown during the administration of George W. Bush over the Iraq war and other policies. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who worked well with Bush before Obama's election, dined with Obama Wednesday night at his hotel and was to hold talks with him Thursday afternoon.

He was 79. Marquette was a large man with an outsized personality and someone fellow photographers sometimes referred to as ""Condor,"" the White House News Photographers Association said in announcing his death. Marquette spent a decade with The Associated Press and also worked for several other news organizations, including UPI, Reuters and the Philadelphia Inquirer. In 1999, along with a team of other AP photographers, he won a Pulitzer in the category of feature photography for coverage of the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Marquette's career gave him a front seat to some of the most important events of the 20th and 21st centuries. He initially covered sports but eventually moved to politics. Space launches, the Olympics and Super Bowl games were among his specialties. His 1984 Super Bowl picture of John Riggins scoring the winning touchdown for the Washington Redskins became a popular poster that hung in offices and restaurants all over the Washington area. His photo of Britain's Sebastian Coe winning the gold medal in the 1,500-meter race at the Moscow Olympic Games won first place in sports in the World Press Photo contest. Ron Edmonds, a retired Associated Press photographer who knew Marquette for almost 40 years as a colleague and as a competitor, described him as extremely well liked by his peers because he was ""60 percent comedian in dealing with everyday life, but on top of that, he was one of the best photojournalists in the business."" Edmonds said that before the age of cell phones and laptop computers, a large portion of a wire photographer's job was just finding a way to transmit an image quickly. He said Marquette would plan way ahead on a story and arrange to use phone lines in people's homes if need be, allowing him to send his photos while competitors were still scrambling.  ""Joe was probably one of the best at getting pictures out of some of the worst places you can imagine,"" Edmonds said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
