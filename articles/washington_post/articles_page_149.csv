Danny Davis says his grandson was the victim of an environment where guns ""become commonplace, it's almost, just the way it is."" The Chicago Democrat told The Associated Press his grandson, 15-year-old Javon Wilson, was a ""pretty regular kid"" who loved basketball and music and was a ""pretty solid student."" Davis says he has been told a 15-year-old boy had traded slacks for gym shoes with Wilson's 14-year-old brother and went to Wilson's house with a 17-year-old woman to reverse the trade when the boy shot Wilson. Davis wonders how the 15-year-old boy obtained a gun and who allowed him to have it. He says the answer is that ""the availability of guns is so prevalent in America you almost can't tell who has a gun"" anymore. ___ 12:45 p.m. U.S. Sen Mark Kirk is sending condolences to the family of Illinois Rep. Danny Davis after Davis' grandson was fatally shot. The Republican issued a statement Saturday on the death of 15-year-old Javon Wilson. He says that ""no family should have to experience the tragedy of losing a loved one to gun violence."" The shooting occurred in the impoverished Englewood neighborhood, which Kirk says he has visited many times while working with Mothers Against Senseless Killings. He says that ""we must continue to work together to protect our children."" Chicago Police say a dispute over basketball shoes led to the shooting. ___ 10:55 a.m. Chicago police say a dispute over basketball shoes led to the fatal shooting of the grandson of Illinois U.S. Rep. Danny Davis. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi (gooh-YEHL'-meeh) says the attackers went to the home of 15-year-old Javon Wilson in the Englewood neighborhood Friday night and shot him in the head after an argument. Guglielmi says Wilson knew the attackers and that the incident was not a home invasion, as reported previously. Police are looking for a person of interest in the case and say they have good leads. Guglielmi says at least two people participated in the attack and that everyone involved is a minor. Davis said Wilson's mother was not home, but Wilson's uncle and three siblings were. ___ 7:30 a.m. The grandson of Illinois U.S. Rep. Danny Davis has died after being shot and killed in a home invasion in Chicago. Chicago Police spokeswoman Officer Michelle Tannehill told the Chicago Tribune (http://trib.in/2f9HroG ) that 15-year-old Javon Wilson died Friday night at the scene in the Englewood neighborhood on the city's South Side. Davis said in a statement that a 17-year-old girl and 15-year-old boy forced their way into the home and after an argument the 15-year-old shot Wilson in the head. Davis said Wilson's mother was not home, but Wilson's uncle and three siblings were. The Democrat also questioned why the shooter had a gun and how it could have been prevented. Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the newspaper that police have a ""good lead"" but no one was arrested. ___ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the victim's name to Javon.

Leaving a meeting of the World Anti-Doping Agency executive committee, IOC representative Gian Franco Kasper dismissed the credibility of the report that detailed Russian state-sponsored doping. Manipulation of samples at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games and cover-ups of positive tests across dozens of summer and winter Olympic sports was reported by WADA investigator Richard McLaren in July ahead of the Rio de Janeiro Games.  ""I want to see the proof,"" Kasper, who is also president of the skiing federation, said in Glasgow. ""We cannot say it's correct or not. He has to bring proof with names."" Former Russian anti-doping lab director Grigory Rodchenkov told McLaren that samples of Russian athletes were passed through a concealed hole in the wall during the middle of the night at the Sochi Games, with the help of intelligence officers from the FSB, the current version of the Soviet Union's KGB.  ""You know this hole in the wall in Sochi was Hollywood for me ... they had a key for the door,"" Kasper said. ""The KGB are so stupid they have to drill a hole in the wall? Come on."" U.S. Anti-Doping Agency chairman Edwin Moses, the gold medal-winning and world record-setting hurdler from the 1970s and '80s, said it was ""ridiculous"" for Kasper to question the investigation.  ""Wave after wave of retests show that there are Russian athletes (doping),"" Moses said after attending the WADA meeting with Kasper.  ""You can go back one or two Olympic Games and it just seems like wave after wave of Russians are showing up (as having doped) which really cuts through the credibility of the results of those Olympic Games and the redistribution of medals. To me that's a horrible situation."" The latest batch of retests of samples from the 2008 Beijing Olympics saw the IOC announce on Thursday that four Russian athletes, including three medalists, tested positive for banned substances.  ""The credibility of Olympic medals has diminished and that's what the athletes are believing,"" Moses said. ""You have scores of athletes out there who should have won medals and now know they were right."" That is why Moses, like WADA, wanted the entire Russian delegation banned from the Rio Games in August, a move that provoked the ire of the International Olympic Committee. The IOC rebuffed those calls, instead allowing individual sports to rule on the eligibility of Russians. Three months after the Rio Games, the rifts remerged in public at an Olympic gathering this week in Qatar, where the IOC questioned Craig Reedie's WADA leadership, demanding a neutral president. Reedie is still set to be re-elected unchallenged for a second three-year term at the WADA Foundation Board meeting in his native Scotland.  ""There is no point at the moment walking away from this situation when things need to get done and things get difficult,"" Reedie said on Saturday. ""There are people demanding improvements in process and I want to get that finished as well."" A WADA Foundation Board meeting on Sunday will see a discussion of the WADA leadership's push for enhanced whistleblowing mechanisms, and bid to codify a sliding scale of sanctioning powers, including fines or blanket bans on entire countries or sports for the type of widespread doping scheme it believes was run by the Russian state.  ""WADA only tried it once with the Russians in Rio and the IOC said no -- it's none of their business,"" Kasper said. ""It has to be a neutral institution and it shouldn't be political. ... You cannot be the prosecutor and the judge yourself. It's the basic principle of justice."" ___ Rob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees national banks, announced the action in a statement late Friday. The OCC will require the bank to get prior approval before making changes in its board of directors and senior executive officers and also before making ""golden parachute"" payments to departing executives. In a brief statement, the OCC did not offer any explanation of why it was altering the terms of the agreement it had negotiated with the bank in September. In that document, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million fine to settle charges involving unauthorized customer accounts. In a statement concerning the new restrictions, Wells Fargo said it would comply with all requirements imposed by its regulators.  ""This will not inhibit our ability to execute our strategy, rebuild trust and serve our customers, and continue to operate the company for the benefit of all our stakeholders,"" the bank said. On Thursday, Wells Fargo disclosed signs that customers are pulling back from doing business with the bank following the disclosures of the sales practices scandal in which bank employees opened up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts without customer authorization. After the practices came to light, the San Francisco company has been reporting monthly customer traffic figures at its branches, something a bank typically would never share. The goal was to provide the public, and more importantly investors, a look into how Wells was being affected by the scandal. In its latest report, new customer account openings fell 44 percent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 percent from the previous year. The bank saw a 50 percent drop in credit card applications. Wells' own customer service metrics also plunged, with ""customer loyalty"" scores dropping to 52.3 percent, down more than 10 percent from a year earlier and from August, the month right before the settlement was announced. The sales practices scandal led to the abrupt retirement this month of the bank's CEO, John Stumpf. The bank also faces several lawsuits, as well as criminal investigations by the Department of Justice and the California Attorney General's Office. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Trump flashed a thumbs-up said the sit down ""went great."" Romney said the two had a ""far reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance."" The meeting alone was notable after the crackling rancor between the men all year. Romney assailed Trump in a stinging speech in March, calling him a ""con man"" and a ""phony."" Trump responded by calling Romney a ""loser"" who ""choked like a dog"" during the 2012 election and let President Barack Obama win. But the two have started to make amends since the election. Romney called Trump to congratulate him after his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Romney was only one of a parade of officials pouring through Trump' door as the president-elect tries to fill more members of his administration. On Friday, Trump picked Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signaling a sharp rightward shift in U.S. security policy as he begins to form his Cabinet. Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. Hosting the stream of visitors wasn't Trump's first public act of the day. First, there was Twitter. He rushed to the defense of Mike Pence on Saturday after ""Hamilton"" actor Brandon Victor Dixon challenged the incoming vice president from the Broadway stage after the show Friday night. ""Apologize!"" Trump tweeted to the actor. ""Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!"" Dixon tweeted back: ""Conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @Mike_Pence for stopping to listen."" Trump also bragged on Twitter about agreeing to settle a trio of lawsuits against Trump University, claiming: ""The ONLY bad thing about winning the presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!"" Trump then turned to meetings, perhaps about posts in his administration. Just on Saturday, Trump's schedule included retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, a potential contender to serve as Trump's defense secretary, as well as Michelle Rhee and Betsy DeVos, two well-known education activists. And on Sunday, Trump was due to meet with several people, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Trump's announcement on Friday of Sessions, Pompeo and Flynn formed the first outlines of Trump's Cabinet and national security teams. Given his lack of governing experience and vague policy proposals during the campaign, his selection of advisers is being scrutinized both in the U.S. and abroad. Trump's initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam's role in stoking extremism. Sessions, who is best known for his hard line immigration views, has questioned whether terrorist suspects should benefit from the rights available in U.S. courts. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders are ""potentially complicit"" in attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam. Pompeo's nomination to lead the CIA also opens the prospect of the U.S. resuming torture of detainees. Trump has backed harsh interrogation techniques that President Barack Obama and Congress have banned, saying the U.S. ""should go tougher than waterboarding,"" which simulates drowning. In 2014, Pompeo criticized Obama for ""ending our interrogation program"" and said intelligence officials ""are not torturers, they are patriots."" Sessions and Pompeo would both require Senate confirmation; Flynn would not. In a separate matter Friday, it was announced that Trump had agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve three lawsuits over Trump University, his former school for real estate investors. The lawsuits alleged the school misled students and failed to deliver on its promises in programs that cost up to $35,000. Trump has denied the allegations and had said repeatedly he would not settle. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who announced the settlement, called it ""a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university."" Trump tweeted to his 15 million followers Saturday that he only settled to better focus on leading the U.S. ___ Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman, Mark Kennedy, Errin Whack, Jonathan Lemire, Jill Colvin, Stephen Braun, Robert Burns and Jack Gillum and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Jonathan Lemire at http://twitter.com/JonLemire Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

He said such callousness leads toward more violence. He says about 60 juveniles and young adults were at the fight at a park, which police say started as an argument at a high school.

The consistory ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica formally inducted the churchmen into the cardinals' ranks. Francis used his homily to also caution the new ""princes of the church,"" as cardinals are sometimes called, to guard against animosity creeping into the church as well, saying ""we are not immune from this."" The pope spoke of ""our pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose and condemn"" and cautioned somberly against those who ""raise walls, build barriers and label people."" Earlier this year, when asked about the plan by Donald Trump, then a Republican U.S. presidential candidate and now president-elect, to build a wall to keep Mexicans and others from illegally entering the U.S., the pope replied that anyone advocating building walls isn't a Christian. Francis, in a message a few days earlier to U.S. bishops, had urged them to help heal a society facing growing polarization. On Saturday, after receiving his red hat, Mexican Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes, archbishop of Tlalnepantla, expressed concern about Trump's plans, including deporting large numbers of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, soon after assuming the presidency.  ""You can't divide a family. You can't divide a community. You can't divide the world,"" the prelate said in reply to a question by The Associated Press about Trump. The Mexican churchman added: ""One thing is the election campaign. Another thing is reality."" In Saturday's homily, Francis commented on how ""we see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. An enemy because of the color of their skin, their language, or social class."" He added: ""The virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting."" Francis also lamented the tendency to ""demonize"" one's opponents, ""so as to have a 'sacred' justification for dismissing them."" Cardinals serve as papal advisers and someday elect popes' successors. Popes look to cardinals who share their approach to the church's mission in the world. Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin is among the newly made cardinals. Tobin defied the governor of the U.S. state of Indiana, Mike Pence, by welcoming Syrian refugees. Tobin in January will become archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, while Pence will be installed as U.S. vice president. Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich, after being made a cardinal at Saturday's ceremony, said the church has a special role in trying to bring people together across the political spectrum. He noted that on Sunday, Masses are celebrated in 26 languages in his diocese.  ""People feel disenfranchised"" from sharing in the common good, the cardinal said in an interview with The Associated Press. Another American in the latest crop of cardinals is Irish-born Archbishop Kevin Farrell, who led the Dallas diocese before Francis appointed him to head the Vatican office dealing with family issues. At a post-ceremony reception, Farrell acknowledged that polarization is felt within the church, too.  ""We've become gods on both sides -- gods on the left, and gods on the right, and neither one of these are correct,"" Farrell told an AP reporter. The clash of mentalities between the conservative camps and the so-called progressives chosen by Francis has played out publicly in recent days. Four prominent, disgruntled cardinals, including a U.S. prelate, Raymond Burke, who is one of Francis' most vocal critics, in a letter to the pope aired their doubts about his more compassionate approach to the contentious issue involving divorced Catholics. They fear his approach could sow confusion among the faithful. Church teaching forbids divorce, and says Catholics who remarry without annulments of their earlier marriage are essentially adulterers who can't receive communion. In a document earlier this year, Francis suggested that clerics could decide case-by-case if these Catholics could receive Communion. Farrell, asked about the tensions over the divorce issue, appeared to be open toward the pope's prescription for more compassion.  ""There is no situation in life that's black and white. Anybody that's lived in this world will have encountered those situations in their personal lives,"" Farrell said. The new cardinals, who pledged loyalty to the pope, come from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America. One of them, an 88-year-old Albanian priest, Ernest Simoni, spent 18 years in prison because of his faith during the communist regime in his homeland. Since cardinals are usually bishops already, Francis bestowed a rare honor in giving that rank to Simoni, a simple priest. When Francis visited Albania in 2014, he was brought to tears when Simoni told him how he was persecuted. The pope's envoy to Syria is now Cardinal Mario Zenari. The Italian archbishop remarked how the bright crimson hue of the cardinals' cassocks and of the square, peaked headgear evokes the color of the blood spilled by innocent children killed in the five-year-old civil war there. Also among the new cardinals is Archbishop Dieudonne Nzapalainga, of Bangui, Central African Republic. Last year, Francis visited Nzapalainga's country, bloodied by sectarian violence between Christian and Muslim militants. Thirteen of the 17 new cardinals are under 80 years old and thus eligible to vote in a secret conclave for the next pope. Francis has now appointed 44 of the 120 cardinals young enough to elect his successor. The others were named by the previous two pontiffs, John Paul II, whom Francis made a saint, and Benedict XVI, who retired in 2013, and generally reflect a more conservative leaning on church issues. After the ceremony, the new cardinals and Francis took minibuses to the monastery on Vatican grounds where Benedict lives so they could greet him. One of the cardinals, an 87-year-old bishop from Lesotho, Africa, was too frail to come to Rome for the ceremony. ___ Daniela Petroff contributed to this report. ___ Frances D'Emilio is on Twitter at www.twitter.com/fdemilio Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

That could be good news for Hillary Clinton. At least 46.27 million people have cast ballots by early voting -- by mail or at polling stations, according to Associated Press data, surpassing the level seen in 2012. Record levels have been reported in 28 states and the District of Columbia. Millions more ballots are still coming in. The AP estimates that early votes could top 50 million. That comes to nearly 40 percent of all ballots in a presidential election expected to have higher turnout overall due to intense public interest. Four years ago, there were 46.22 million early votes, or 35 percent.  ""Interest in early voting has been unprecedented in many states,"" said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor and expert on voter turnout who is a consultant to AP. The latest numbers show declines in voting from blacks in North Carolina -- a drop-off after historic levels for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. But higher turnout by Latinos, who often lean Democratic, may be buoying Clinton in Florida. Both are must-win states for Donald Trump. The Hispanic vote is also surging in Nevada and Colorado, where Democrats are running near or above their successful 2012 pace. Trump could be holding an edge in Ohio and Iowa, but that won't be enough if Latinos drive Clinton to victories in other battleground states. A look at early voting trends: ___ TOP BATTLEGROUNDS: FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA Trump's campaign acknowledges he can't win without Florida and North Carolina. In Florida, a record 6.4 million early ballots are already in, or more than three-fourths of the expected vote. Democrats are ahead, 39.9 percent to 38.5 percent. Democrats had slightly wider margins in 2008 and 2012. Obama narrowly won the state both years. While the black share of the vote is lower, ballots from Hispanics have nearly doubled to more than 976,000. Roughly one-third of those did not vote in 2012, according to an analysis by Daniel Smith, a University of Florida professor. That could help Clinton. Democrats are seeking to draw in new and sporadic voters to boost overall turnout. In North Carolina, more than two-thirds of the expected votes have been cast. Democrats lead in ballots submitted, 42 percent to 32 percent. Democrats were apparently hampered by fewer polling locations in the first week of early voting. After more locations opened, the party made up ground, but black turnout remains lower by nearly 65,000, or 8.6 percent. Republicans are running ahead of their 2012 pace, when Mitt Romney narrowly won the state. Scott Tranter, co-founder of the Republican data firm Optimus, said the outcome may hinge on unaffiliated voters and ticket-splitters. ""It's unclear whether Trump can consolidate 90 percent of the Republican Party,"" he said. ___ GOOD SIGNS FOR CLINTON Latinos may be boosting Clinton in the West. In Nevada, more than three-fourths of the likely vote has been cast. Democrats lead, 42 percent to 36 percent. That pace is largely comparable to 2012, when Obama won by 6 percentage points. Latino and Asian-American turnout are up by double-digits while black participation is down slightly. The white share of the vote is down, from 77 percent to 75 percent. In Colorado, the two parties are virtually tied at 35 percent. More than 70 percent of the ballots are in. At this point in 2012, Republicans held an advantage. Clinton also appears to be holding ground in other states won by Obama, but targeted by Trump. In Virginia, early voting has surpassed 2012 levels, lifted by higher turnout in Democratic-leaning northern counties. The state does not provide breakdowns by party. Turnout is also outpacing 2012 levels in Wisconsin, with bigger shares coming from Democratic counties such as Dane and Milwaukee. ___ GOOD SIGNS FOR TRUMP Trump may hold a slight edge in Iowa and Ohio. In Iowa, Democrats currently lead in early ballots, 41 percent to 35 percent. That is a narrower gap than in 2012. Republicans are matching 2012 levels while Democrats are running below. Obama won the state by 5 percentage points. Ohio does not provide breakdowns by party. But voter modeling for the AP by Catalist, a Democratic analytical firm, shows that black turnout continues to lag 2012 levels. African-Americans make up about 9 percent of the vote share, compared to 12 percent in 2012. Ballots from whites have risen. In Georgia, where early voting has already exceeded 2012 levels, turnout is up across racial groups. But ballots from whites have risen more. In all, blacks made up about 30 percent of early votes compared to 36 percent in 2012. White ballots rose from 63 percent to 66 percent. In Utah, Trump may be holding ground despite a challenge from third-party candidate Evan McMullin. Republicans lead in returned ballots, 49 percent to 13 percent for Democrats; no-party voters make up 34 percent. The Republican share is down from 2012 but has been improving, according to Catalist. ___ HOW MUCH WILL LATINOS BOOST CLINTON? Rising Latino participation could benefit Democrats in two Republican-leaning states. In Arizona, with more than two-thirds of the expected total votes cast, Republicans lead in balloting, 40 percent to 34 percent. That is a narrower gap compared to 2012, when the GOP led by roughly 10 percentage points. At least 4.5 million votes have been cast in Texas' top 15 counties, up 32 percent. The state does not provide party breakdowns, but voter modeling by Catalist found sharper rates of increases among Latinos. ___ AP's Election Research and Quality Control Group contributed to this report. ___ Follow Hope Yen on Twitter at http://twitter.com/hopeyen1 Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The Democrats asked for restraining orders to prevent what they characterized as ballot-box vigilantism by Trump's Republican presidential campaign and his friend Roger Stone's political organization, Stop the Steal. But the Supreme Court issued a one-page denial in a case out of Ohio, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noting that state law already forbids voter intimidation. And the Democrats' arguments in federal courts in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada fell flat in those crucial battlegrounds, too. Warning repeatedly that the election is about to be stolen from him, Trump has called on his supporters to act as election observers in parts of the country to prevent fraud. That has stirred fears of minority voters being confronted and challenged by self-appointed poll watchers. In Las Vegas, a lawyer for Stop the Steal promised Monday that volunteers who conduct exit polls will be advised in a last-minute conference call that federal law prohibits voter intimidation. Attorney Adam Fulton told U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware that an email will tell the 65 or so people planning to visit Nevada polling sites they can't talk with people within 100 feet of a polling place, and can't photograph or use video or audio to record people without that person's permission. With that promise, the judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order that Democrats had sought in a lawsuit alleging that Stone, the group, the Nevada Republican Party and the Trump campaign plan to harass Nevada voters. But Boulware said he'll keep time open Tuesday to hear complaints if they arise during morning voting. In North Carolina, U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles said she saw insufficient evidence the state's Republicans and Trump want supporters to intimidate minorities on Tuesday. But she said she will keep an eye on the balloting and could revisit the case quickly if there's evidence of a conspiracy to suppress voting.  ""These are difficult times,"" Eagles said at a hearing. In Pennsylvania, U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond denied a request to pre-emptively ban Republicans from polling places, saying that Democrats had not produced any evidence there would be problems. He faulted the effort as a last-minute ""mad scramble"" and said it would be wrong to ask the Pennsylvania GOP chairman to travel across the state on a day's notice for the hearing. A federal court in Nevada also planned a hearing Monday in a similar dispute. Last week, a federal judge in Cleveland issued a temporary restraining order warning that anyone, regardless of political affiliation, who engages in intimidation or harassment near or inside polling places will face contempt of court charges. But a federal appeals court blocked the order on Sunday after the Trump campaign argued that it tramples on the First Amendment right to free speech and was issued without evidence of voter intimidation during the early balloting that has been going on in Ohio for weeks. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to reinstate the restraining order. Ginsburg criticized Trump over the summer before apologizing for her remarks. Her comments raised questions about her impartiality and whether she would participate in election disputes involving Trump. ___ Associated Press writers Emery Dalesio in Greensboro, North Carolina; Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia; Ken Ritter in Las Vegas; and Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/06/chris-christie-saw-his-political-career-end-this-week/	Chris Christie watched his political career end this week	"   (Randall Hill/Reuters)  It has been a very tough few years for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. He has gone from the hottest thing in Republican politics (circa 2012) to, well, not.  From his never-really-got-started presidential campaign in 2016 to his decidedly odd surrogate work for Donald Trump, Christie has watched his relevance as a major figure within the GOP ebb away. And through it all has been Bridgegate, the scandal caused by two of Christie's top gubernatorial aides exacting retribution on a Democratic politician by shutting down several lanes of traffic in Fort Lee, N.J. Those two aides -- Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly -- were last week found guilty of all nine charges brought against them, another black mark on Christie's time in office. But the biggest takeaway from the seven-week trial was this: Everyone involved believed Christie should have been charged as well.      Two former allies of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni, say they will appeal their conviction for their roles in the ""Bridgegate"" lane closure scandal. (Reuters)   Baroni attorney Michael Baldassare said the trial was a ""disgrace,"" adding: ""One of the things the U.S. Attorney's Office should be ashamed of is where it decided to draw the line on who to charge and who not to charge.... They should have had belief in their own case to charge powerful people, and they did not."" ""Yes, the system worked, and the rule of law has been vindicated,"" wrote Tom Moran, a member of the Star Ledger editorial board. ""Both Kelly and Bill Baroni are now felons. But the big guy got away. Gov. Chris Christie was smart enough to hide his tracks, guided no doubt by his years as a federal prosecutor. He is the firefighter who knows the tricks well enough to get away with arson."" Oomph. Three of Christie's top staffers admitted under oath during the trial that, contrary to Christie's continued assertions, he was very much aware of the plan to exact revenge on Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for his refusal to endorse the governor's walk-over 2013 reelection race. (Editor's note: This isn't entirely correct. What the staffers said was that Christie was made aware of the lane closures but not of the revenge plot behind it.) Kelly, in particular, painted an image of Christie behind closed doors that was decidedly unappealing; in one instance that she recounted, he allegedly threw a water bottle at her. Christie's political career was probably over the second he endorsed Trump. Or maybe when he decided to go fully into Trump world as a transparent attempt to curry favor for a potential cabinet post. But the Bridgegate trial seals it: Christie has no future in Republican Party politics. Unless, of course, Trump wins on Tuesday -- a possible but far from likely prospect. Chris Christie, for watching your political career get caught in a traffic snarl, you had the Worst Week in Washington. Congrats, or something."
