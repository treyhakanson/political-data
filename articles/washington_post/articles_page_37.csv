Demonstrators flooded the streets of Buenos Aires and marched to the Congress building waving flags representing some of Argentina's most powerful unions and chanting slogans demanding passage of the ""social emergency law."" Supporters of the stimulus measure say it would create a million jobs and it also would raise child welfare payments 15 percent. The bill introduced by opposition lawmakers recently passed in the Senate but has yet to be considered by the lower house. Argentina's conservative government says the measure would strain the budget. Since taking office in December, President Mauricio Macri's market-friendly reforms have been praised by international investors. But his hiking of utility rates, a sharp devaluation of the peso and other measures have fanned one of the world's highest inflation rates and spiked poverty levels, causing social unrest. Argentines have staged other protests against Macri's firing of thousands of state workers and his cuts to subsidies that have increased the cost of everything from bus rides to electricity bills. Macri says the measures are vital to revive Argentina's weak economy. The government says nearly one of every three Argentines lives in poverty. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

But those protesters should be peaceful and remain optimistic, the iconic civil rights leader said on a visit to Nashville, where as a college student in the 1960s he helped desegregate lunch counters and movie theaters.  ""I would say to the young people, the young protesters, and those not so young: Accept a way of peace, believe in the way of love, believe in the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence,"" Lewis told The Associated Press. ""Never become bitter. Never become angry. And do whatever you can to speak truth to power, and be hopeful, be optimistic.  ""The struggle is not a struggle that lasts one day or a few weeks or a few years. It is a struggle of a lifetime."" Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, made the remarks during an interview in Nashville, where he was arrested, beaten and jailed more than half a century ago. He's receiving the Nashville Public Library Literary Award this weekend. He recently published ""March,"" a three-part graphic novel about his life in the civil rights movement. Lewis also questioned Trump's decision to choose Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama as attorney general. The Senate, Lewis said, once refused to confirm Sessions as a federal judge. During the 1986 confirmation process, the Alabama senator was dogged by racist comments he was accused of making when he was a U.S. attorney in Alabama. Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy is the only one who voted against him still in the Senate.  ""I think we all ought to be concerned if he's confirmed as the next attorney general,"" Lewis said. ""He'll have a great deal to say about civil rights, about voting rights."" Lewis said he hopes Sessions' outlook has changed.  ""Sometimes people get in a different position, they change their views, they change attitudes,"" Lewis said. ""If he's confirmed by the Senate and becomes the attorney general, I hope that he would change some of his views."" Lewis said Democrats must look inward to learn the lessons of an election many of them are having trouble swallowing.  ""I think it's important and it's a must for the Democratic Party to come together and speak on one accord, for us to have what I call an 'executive session' with ourselves,"" Lewis said, ""and listen to the people, learn from the American people.""

I don't say this lightly, and I sincerely fear that loss of faith in journalism ultimately will cause more harm to the nation than any outside enemy could hope to. Only 18 percent of Americans trust national news and just 22 percent trust local news, according to the Pew Research Center. That said, three-fourths of Americans think news organizations keep political leaders in line, though about the same percentage think the news media are biased. Not surprisingly, Republicans more than Democrats think this way. It hasn't helped that Republican politicos and conservative cable and radio outlets have convinced their constituents that the media are the enemy. It seems we've forgotten that the purpose of a newspaper, as Chicago Evening Post journalist and humorist Finley Peter Dunne put it in an 1893 column, is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.  Could there be a better reason to give Donald Trump a rough ride?  Nevertheless, distrust of legitimate journalism is no joking matter. What happens to democracy when an uninformed, misinformed or disinformed populace tries to make sound decisions? The simple and terrible answer is, democracy fails.  We've reached this critical juncture thanks largely to the digital revolution. Until relatively recently, most people relied on a limited number of trusted news sources, which provided a basis for what we referred to as ""common knowledge."" The country more or less also shared a set of common values. Today, of course, we have thousands of news sources -- millions if you count social media. Everyone can pick his or her own outlet for consumption as well as a venue for invention. Personal journalists -- that is, anyone with a smartphone to photograph or record video in real time -- have created virtual newsrooms of one that can communicate with countless others through tweets, retweets and created buzz on fact or fiction. If you're suddenly put in mind of insects, you're not far off. Deafened by the dizzying din, it's hard to hear the angels sing. To those who complain that Trump received more negative coverage than Hillary Clinton did, I would merely point out that correctly quoting the man was inherently negative. He said a lot of awful stuff and offered little of substance to offset the headlines. Moreover, the media have covered every follicle of Clinton's scalp for 25 to 30 years. Her flaws and failures are well-known to anyone who's been half-awake, while Trump was essentially new on the political stage. Trump's own criticism of the press was as trumped-up as many of his other campaign slogans, created to rile the crowd and deflect attention from, among other things, the fact that his manipulation of the media was the engine that propelled him to the top of the heap. But he knew that media bashing was popular among his base and gave them what they wanted.  Also contributing to the growing distrust is the perceived blurring of news and opinion, which can be a legitimate beef. Advocacy journalism, in this opinion writer's view, belongs on the editorial and op-ed pages, though many news organizations subscribe to the notion that advancing a social cause or, perhaps, derailing an unfit candidate justifies aggressive, Page 1 coverage, objectivity be damned.  Thus, one shouldn't wonder why so many have lost faith. It is worth noting, however, that when a mainstream reporter or editor is found to be deliberately dishonest, he or she is quickly dispatched to the outer darkness. The same can't be said of the alternative news world or of social media. On Facebook, ""fake"" news creator Paul Horner recently marveled that his viral, made-up stories helped get Trump elected.  Fortunately, only 4 percent of Americans trust social media ""a lot"" as a news source, and 30 percent trust it ""some,"" according to Pew. But sometimes it's hard to tell fake from true, or advocacy from propaganda, and therein lies perhaps the greatest challenge of our time.  What's clear is that news consumers must be extra-vigilant in selecting news sources, while also being self-critical about those choices. The mainstream media need to work harder at presenting balanced reporting to rebuild trust. And education programs aimed at teaching students how to evaluate news, such as those created by the News Literacy Project, need greater public support and an accelerated timeline.  Words to this effect from our next president wouldn't hurt. Trump would see headlines change quickly in his favor, the world would rejoice, and the Trump brand would be golden forever.

The naming of Trump's picks for attorney general, CIA director and national security adviser drew public condemnations from Muslim civil rights groups as well as private expressions of concern from several Arab states that cooperate closely with the United States in the fight against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Some current and former government officials worried that the appointments could reinforce perceptions among the world's Muslims that the United States is at war against Islam itself.   Trump's security picks known for hard-line views   American civil rights organizations and faith leaders said Friday they were disturbed by Trump's appointment of retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn to be his top national security adviser. Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has repeatedly referred to Islam as ""a cancer,"" claimed that a ""fear of Muslims is rational"" and warned -- despite a lack of evidence -- that Sharia or Islamic law is spreading throughout the United States.  Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the president-elect's designee for attorney general, has supported Trump's call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants and has suggested that a ""toxic ideology"" lies at the root of Islam. And Rep. Mike Pompeo -- Trump's pick for CIA director -- has co-sponsored a bill to ban the Muslim Brotherhood, an Egypt-based Islamist organization that conspiracy theorists on America's far right have accused of plotting to infiltrate the government.     President-elect Donald Trump named retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn his national security adviser on Nov. 18, but Flynn has a history of making incendiary and Islamophobic statements that have drawn criticism from his military peers. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)    [Trump's CIA pick seen as both fiercely partisan and a serious student of national security issues]  The elevation of Flynn, Sessions and Pompeo to key positions triggered a rash of Googling in Middle Eastern capitals, where none of the three is particularly well known. But what seemed quickly apparent was that all ""carry a clear hawkish line against Islam"" -- something that could complicate regional efforts to battle terrorist groups, said Marwan Muasher, a former Jordanian ambassador to the United States. ""While the region has the same commitment to fight terrorism, it needs a nuanced view of Islam and of Muslims, rather than treating all Muslims with a broad brush,"" said Muasher, now vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank. ""The cause of fighting terrorism will not be helped if the new administration treats the Muslim world as a problem rather than as part of the solution.""    Proposed CIA director vows to take aim at Iran nuclear deal   American civil rights advocates and Muslim leaders echoed those concerns.   ""All Americans should be really concerned,"" said Talib M. Shareef, who serves as imam and president of Washington's Masjid Muhammad, the capital's oldest mosque. An Air Force veteran, Shareef said he worried that the appointments would alienate allies as well as American Muslims serving in the armed forces and in government.     In this clip from Al Jazeera's UpFront, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn was asked if he was afraid of Muslims after he tweeted earlier that this year that fear of Muslims ""is rational."" (Al Jazeera UpFront)   Five of Shareef's children are active-service military, and they have already experienced discrimination while in uniform, he said. ""When you're needed but you're not made to feel comfortable, it's going to be difficult for you to give 100 percent. . . . You are not going to excel at whatever you're needed in. And we need everybody.""   Flynn's digital record includes tweet saying ""Fear of Muslims is ""rational""   ""We need them, and they need us,"" he said. ""I don't care how powerful we say we are as a military, we will never be able to fight the battles on our own."" The Trump transition team dismissed the concerns. ""President-elect Trump will surround himself with talented individuals who will be uniquely qualified to enact the agenda set forth by the Administration. As a leader who will unite Americans of all backgrounds, President-elect Trump was elected on his vision to fight for everyone and will have one of the most inclusive presidencies in history,"" the team said in an emailed statement. Trump's picks have largely echoed the views of the president-elect himself, who at various points in the campaign called for religious tests for immigrants as well as surveillance of American mosques. Terrorism experts and human rights groups have warned that such rhetoric drives support for extremist groups by making Muslim citizens feel unwelcome in their own country. ""The danger is that they're going to pass legislation that not only alienates Muslim countries on which we depend for our security, but also it may alienate American Muslims and push them in the direction of our enemies,"" said Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Both Flynn and Sessions have dismissed criticisms of their views on Islam as oversimplifications. In his 2016 book, ""The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies,"" Flynn distinguishes between radical Islamists and ordinary Muslims, though he at times resorts to harsh terms in describing the fight against the former. He calls Islam a ""political ideology"" disguised as a religion.   Trump's Cabinet choices have much in common: Nearly all are white men   ""We're in a world war against a messianic mass movement of evil people, most of them inspired by a totalitarian ideology: Radical Islam,"" he writes. Flynn joined the board of Act for America, an alt-right activist group that has helped introduce bills to ban Islamic Sharia law in nearly two dozen U.S. states, shortly after he joined the Trump campaign. Act for America's founder, Brigitte Gabriel, has assailed a ""cancer called Islamofacism"" that permeates a Muslim world in which ""extreme is mainstream."" Sessions has repeatedly blasted the Obama administration over its policies for admitting Syrian refugees into the country and suggested that a religious test could be part of the process for determining who is admitted as an immigrant. ""We have to understand that most Muslims do not adhere to this extreme ideology, but there is nothing wrong to refuse admittance to those who distance themselves from our values,"" Sessions told the American Thinker, a conservative magazine. ""We need to use common sense with the who-what-where of the threat: It is the toxic ideology of Islam."" Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, likened such views to a ""kind of raw bigotry that would disqualify anyone from serving in public office."" ""Why it's okay to be an anti-Muslim bigot and have a powerful post in the administration is a mystery,"" Hooper said. Of Flynn, whom Hooper described as ""beyond the pale,"" he said: ""He should not be in public office. We can only imagine what policies will flow from the fact that he believes Islam is a cancer, and that he's been at war with Islam.""   New Cabinet appointees likely to have easy route to confirmation   Pompeo was not an outspoken Trump supporter during the presidential campaign and has been generally more measured in his views on immigration. But following the Boston Marathon attacks in 2013, he accused Muslim American leaders of being ""potentially complicit"" by failing to condemn extremist views more forcibly. Trump has gone further, repeatedly accusing American Muslims during his campaign of knowing about terrorists in their midst.    A number of Middle Eastern leaders -- most notably Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Egypt's Abdel Fatah al-Sissi -- cheered Trump's surprise victory last week, applauding the Republican's leadership style and predicting improved relations with the White House under a Trump presidency. Erdogan also specifically praised Flynn after the retired general published an op-ed last week supporting the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, the exiled Turkish cleric and Pennsylvania resident whom Erdogan blames for inspiring the foiled July 15 coup against his government.

The Justice Department says in a statement issued Wednesday that Issac Lanier Avant failed to file timely returns between 2008 and 2013 despite earning more than $165,000 annually. The website Legistorm lists Avant's position as chief of staff to Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. Thompson's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department says Avant filed returns in 2006 and 2007, but those filings each contained false deductions. Sentencing is scheduled in January. Avant faces a statutory maximum sentence of one year in prison. As part of his plea agreement, Avant has agreed to pay a restitution of more than $153,000 to the IRS.

(Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post)  Shocked. Numb. Terrified. For many people who had expected to celebrate a Hillary Clinton victory on Nov. 9, the election instead marked what has felt like a descent into a frightening, surreal place. Across the Washington area, as President-elect Donald Trump met with President Obama and fired up his transition machinery, Clinton supporters and others scrambled to come to terms with living next door to an administration they fear will threaten their understanding of what America stands for. Since the election, some have already experienced harassment; some have agonized over how to explain the election results to their children or their overseas relatives. Over the past week they have struggled to absorb the news, regroup with friends, family and strangers, and figure out how to move forward. Here is how some of them are doing that. Finding resolve in civil rights giant Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) Samira Mehta wore a hot-pink shirt bearing the likeness of Gloria Steinem as she went off to vote on Election Day. It was a good day to be a feminist: The nation was poised to elect its first female president. Waiting in line for lunch at Panera, Mehta, a 38-year-old college professor, smiled at a young mother wearing a Clinton T-shirt, before she turned to face the woman behind her, who was saying something under her breath. ""You dirty Muslim, we shouldn't let you vote,"" the woman said.   [After Trump's win, some minorities feel unsafe. Now, thousands want to protect them.]   Mehta was taken aback, but not entirely surprised. She is actually a convert to Judaism, but her father was Hindu, an immigrant to the United States from India, and in the years since 9/11, she has heard worse, she said. The story she told friends later that day had a positive spin, focused on a little boy who had come to her rescue. ""That's not nice, you should say sorry,"" he had said, before the woman recoiled and left the restaurant.    Samira Mehta, who has a research fellowship at the Library of Congress, wears a pink T-shirt with the likeness of Gloria Steinem.(Courtesy of Samira Mehta)  That night Trump was elected president, and Mehta said she woke up in a new country feeling afraid. In the days to come, she replayed that lunch conversation more fearfully. She said that she felt a pit in her stomach as she absorbed the notion that a quarter of eligible voters had chosen a candidate whose campaign had often appeared to hinge on racism and misogyny. Trump's election felt like a referendum on her, she said, as an intellectual, a woman, a person with brown skin, a Jew. She began to regard strangers with caution. On the Metro two days after the election, she began an initially ""charming conversation"" with a couple from Kansas, but soon became guarded as she wondered how they voted ""in the privacy of the voting booth."" A turning point in her mood came on the weekend, when she went to hear her former student sing at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, a 175-year-old D.C. church with roots in the anti-slavery movement. She was buoyed to hear the preacher call for the community to rally together to fight racism, homophobia and Islamophobia. She also had tickets to the new Museum of African American History and Culture, where she was inspired by an exhibit about Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) who has dedicated his life to civil rights. ""That's where my despair turned into something like resolve,"" she said. 'The trees are still beautiful' Spirits were high at the election night party Larry Bauer attended on Capitol Hill, but as returns showed an irrepressible lead for Trump, the mood shifted. Bauer caught a ride home to Silver Spring at midnight. He watched till the ""bitter end,"" then sat outside in the cold on his balcony until 5 a.m. He left a message for his boss that he would not make it to work, then he went to bed and stayed there for most of the day.    Larry Bauer  Bauer, 60, came out as gay when he was 18. ""The struggle for gay rights has been such a big part of my life, and the potential to undo that, it strikes me at the core of my being,"" he said. Trump's position on gay issues has been unclear, but his running mate Mike Pence has opposed gay rights efforts throughout his career as Indiana's governor and in Congress, and so have many Trump voters. Bauer, who works for the federal government, said he has felt restless in the days since Trump's election, as he tried to understand what a conservative Supreme Court appointment would mean for gay marriage or abortion rights. He downloaded the history of the Senate, the House and the presidency since 1907 to analyze how often one party had controlled all three, and what that could portend for the coming years. He also searched for things he could do to reverse course -- to help reform the Democratic Party or the electoral college system, perhaps, or take part in a demonstration. ""I'm so ready to hit the streets,"" he said. The past several days have also been about self-care: a lunch with friends, where no one talked politics; a night at the Baltimore symphony with his sister (although the two had tickets for Mahler's ""Tragic"" Sixth Symphony). And he took his Norfolk terrier for long walks. ""One of the things that helps me the most is getting out in nature and reconnecting with the parts of the world that have not changed,"" he said. ""The sky is still the same sky. The trees are still beautiful."" 'Stages of grieving' On Nov. 8, Fran Forman wore a pantsuit to work. ""I was absolutely, 100 percent expecting her to win,"" said Forman, a retired cataloguer for the Library of Congress who lives in Tenleytown and works the front desk at Iona Senior Services. Even at midnight, when it was painfully clear that Clinton stood little chance, ""I felt like maybe if I shut off the TV and went to bed, maybe I'd wake up and it would all be different."" It wasn't, and on Nov. 9, she wore black to work. The election had meant so much to her, as the child of an immigrant, as a 73-year-old, as a woman. She had contributed to Clinton's campaign and made phone calls to register voters. Now, it felt as though she hadn't done enough.   [This election has divided the country. Getting Clinton and Trump voters talking is one way to heal.]   At work, she held back her feelings. ""I can't be political, sitting at the front desk,"" she said. But inside, she felt broken.    Fran Foreman wearing a pantsuit on Election Day 2016 at Iona Senior Services in Tenleytown. (Courtesy of Fran Foreman)  ""This may sound ridiculous, but the worst thing I have ever gone through was grieving - my husband passed away 15 years ago - and it was like that. Stages of grieving,"" she said. ""First you're in shock, then you're numb, then you're mad, angry, and then you just want to take action."" And so, the day after the election, she sent money to Planned Parenthood. Over the weekend, she and her daughter-in-law decided to join the ""Women's March on Washington"" being planned in Washington for the day after the inauguration. On Monday, she saw students protesting at Montgomery Blair High School and remembered being 17, a student at that very school, helping to organize a rally there for presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. Even though she was too young to vote then, she said: ""I was very passionate and active. I want to become more politically active now. ... I'm going to research, talk to people, find some kind of grass-roots to work for in preparation for two years from now, find out what I can do to do my part."" 'I can't let this happen to other people' It didn't take 24 hours for Andres Perez to be attacked. The day after the election, the Montgomery Blair High School junior was standing at a bus stop in Hyattsville when a stranger smirked and said, ""Well, now you're going back to your country."" ""Excuse me, sir?"" ""Because you're all getting deported, now that my man Trump won."" His heart pounding, terrified of getting into an argument, Perez walked away. But the fear persisted. The man at the bus stop wouldn't have known it, but Perez, 18, came here three years ago from El Salvador, and he is undocumented. Thursday was no better. At the College Park restaurant where he works, a group of customers overheard him speaking Spanish to a co-worker and began shouting ""Build a wall, build a wall."" ""That,"" he said, ""was the first time someone had talked to me like that."" It was enough. On Monday, putting aside his fears of going public with his status, Perez organized a protest march at his school that drew about 1,000 people and helped galvanize protests at other schools. ""I was like, 'I can't let this happen to other people,' "" he said. Noting that people in less immigrant-friendly states than Maryland are in a worse position than he is, he said: ""If I don't get people moving and speaking up for their rights, then who's going to do it? I want to be the one making it happen."" Focusing on finding a permanent job The last time Chanel Marbley voted was two decades ago for Bill Clinton. After a felony conviction soon after that, she thought that she couldn't participate in elections. But two weeks ago, she learned that former felons do have voting rights in the District, so she went to cast her ballot for Hillary Clinton.    Chanel Marbley  ""It makes you feel like you can make a difference,"" she said. On her way into the polling place, her 6-year-old son Qadir, asked her, ""Mommy, do we have to pray?"" She stopped on the sidewalk and held his hands in hers and asked the Lord to guide the country in the right direction. The next morning, as she rose at 4:45 a.m. to get to work at a construction site, her heart sank as she learned that Trump had won. ""After the vulgar and mean things that he says about different races ... how is he able to be president?"" she asked. In the days since, she has alternated between trusting in God for things she cannot control, and feeling as though she has a lot to get done before January, when she thinks the country is going to take a turn for the worse for people who are black and poor. Since Election Day, she is more focused than ever on succeeding at her temporary job, where she does logistics and general labor for $15 an hour.  She hopes to make it permanent soon so that she can get benefits and training to become an electrician. Then she can move out of the rodent-infested subsidized housing where she lives with her five children. Marbley is also focused on supporting her kids, who have been affected by the election. Her 11-year-old daughter came home upset because she learned that the principal at her private school had supported Trump. Marbley has watched on the news as teenagers walk out of school to demonstrate, and she feels encouraged. ""If they feel so strongly about what is going on, a lot of people need to take heed,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, it's about the kids. They are growing up and they are about to be our future."" Comfort in others Maureen Betz was not a die-hard Clinton fan. She supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the primary, but she never dreamed Trump would be elected president. After casting her ballot on election night, Betz helped her neighbors, who had campaigned for Trump outside their polling place, by driving home their heavy sign, before turning into her driveway confident that Clinton would win. At work the next day, at a nonprofit organization in the District, she struggled to maintain composure and offer support to staff members who were breaking down about the election results. She herself was devastated.   [What was the election missing? Empathy for Trump voters?]   How could her country have chosen a person who bragged about his own sexual behavior?    Maureen Betz demonstrates outside Nov. 9, 2016 when Donald Trump made his first visit to the White House to meet with President Obama. Courtesy of Maureen Betz  The licensed social worker, who works in mental health, likened her reaction to what victims of trauma feel. ""They don't feel safe, like they don't have control,"" she said. To begin healing, she said, you have to ""name"" the trauma ""and to say it's not okay."" So on Thursday, she took time off work and went to the White House.  She stood outside the gates of the north lawn, while Trump was inside meeting with Obama, and held up a sign. It said: ""Welcome to Washington! Please be advised that Sexual Assault is a crime according to local and federal statutes. Enjoy your stay!"" She stayed there for hours. People offered hugs and thanked her for her message. ""There was some comfort in being around people who were having similar feelings,"" she said. ""Other people saying, this is not acceptable, this is not okay."" A clearer path forward Driving to work that Wednesday morning, Tori Paide tuned in to Hillary Clinton's concession speech. When Clinton said, ""to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable,"" Paide thought of her own elementary school daughters and had an urge to pull to the side of the road to weep. But the tears wouldn't come. This was not how she'd expected the day to unfold. Paide, of Glenelg, Md., had planned a ""happy hour"" of free acupuncture that night at Still Point, the wellness spa she owns in Takoma Park. The idea would be to help people de-stress after the drawn-out, painful election, to  help them move on from Donald Trump. Now, her clients were even more stressed. As the evening progressed, Paide ushered people upstairs to lounge chairs and popped needles into their hands, feet, and heads. Afterward, several joined her to drink rooibos tea and commiserate. They hadn't slept well. They had stumbled through the day. They felt numb and choked and scared. ""It was kind of the feeling you have after a major breakup or some unexpected life change - maybe you didn't see it coming and you're like, 'Oh, where do I go now?'"" one woman, a yoga teacher, said.    Tori Paide in Columbia, MD. (Courtesy of Tori Paide)  Paide nodded. The day had felt like a bad dream. But over the next 24 hours her mind raced, and something kicked awake. She was 44, and it had been ten years since she'd opened her business. She liked what she'd built, but perhaps she should be contributing more, somehow. ""Today I was just having idea after idea of how I can impact our community,"" she said. ""It  kind of feels like a midlife crisis."" But she still felt gummed up and frightened. And she still hadn't cried. It wasn't until the weekend, as she was driving home from the grocery store, that the tears finally came. And with them, a clearer path forward. ""I grew up with my mom saying, 'If you don't like something, write your congressman. And here I am with all my faculties, completely capable of engaging with my government, local and larger, and I haven't been, and it's just time to be.""

Gathering for the first time since last week's upset election, members of the Republican Governors Association (RGA) said that Trump's win will be a boon for them as well. ""We're headed in the right direction,"" Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Wednesday at the closing public session of the two-day conference. ""I think there's a road map."" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott recalled in an interview that, as his state's attorney general, he had filed 31 lawsuits against the current administration over policies including President Obama's signature health-care law, greenhouse-gas rules and the Dodd-Frank financial regulations. ""The Trump administration is going in there and doing exactly what the states have been calling for,"" Abbott said of the president-elect's promises to dismantle all of those measures starting on Inauguration Day.

Nikki Haley once said that Trump represented ""everything a governor doesn't want in a president"" and jabbed at him in her response to Obama's State of the Union address this year as ""the siren call of the angriest voices."" But on Tuesday, she told reporters she is ""just giddy"" about what lies ahead in a Trump administration. ""I've never known what it's like to have a Republican president,"" she said. ""I can tell you, the last six years, Washington was the hardest part of my job.""  [Key figures purged from Trump transition team]  She and other state chief executives also noted frequently that Trump has chosen one of their own -- Indiana Gov. Mike Pence -- to be his vice president and run his transition. Pence spoke to the group in a private session Monday. The governors here are well aware that the collective fate of their party at the statehouse level could hinge on whether Trump succeeds in the early years of his presidency. The GOP holds 33 governorships, the highest level of either party since 1922, when Warren G. Harding was president. But the map for them will be challenging in the 2018 midterm elections. Of the 36 states where governorships will be on the ballot, at least 15 will be open seats now held by Republicans. Only three of the gubernatorial offices that will be vacated because of term limits are in the hands of Democrats.   Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, left, speaks alongside Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson at the Republican Governors Association conference Nov. 15 in Orlando. (John Raoux/AP)  The celebratory atmosphere here at the conference, heavily attended by lobbyists and donors, was a decided contrast from the RGA's meeting four years ago in the wake of GOP nominee Mitt Romney's defeat. At that meeting, Louisiana's then-governor, Bobby Jindal -- then the incoming RGA chairman and considered among his party's brightest presidential prospects -- had admonished Republicans that ""we need to stop being a dumb party"" and become more inclusive. Jindal turned out to be one of 16 Republican contenders vanquished by the outsider Trump in the GOP primary. He folded his campaign even before the Iowa caucuses, saying, ""This is not my time."" Four years ago, former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour spoke to the RGA of the need to ""give our political organization a very serious proctology exam."" In an interview Wednesday, he said: ""People here are upbeat. They want Trump to succeed. They want governors to be part of helping him to succeed.""  [President Obama warns of a 'crude sort of nationalism' in the U.S.]  If Trump does follow through on some of his biggest promises, however, there will also be challenges for Republican governors -- among other things, what to do about health coverage for the estimated 20 million people who have gained it under the Affordable Care Act. Abbott argued that the problems of the revamped health-care system, including higher premiums and fewer choices for some who purchase policies, will put pressure on Democrats in Congress to work with Republicans in fashioning something to replace it. Obamacare ""was subject to the death penalty already. The question was when it was going to die,"" Abbott said. ""It will atrophy and die within two years, regardless of the hissy fit the Democrats in Congress are going to throw."" The governors here said they have been largely impressed by the discipline Trump has shown most of the time since the election and the moderate tone of his public comments. ""I hope he can continue to be that same person, using that same tone,"" South Carolina's Haley said Tuesday. But she added that Trump must also convince the country that real change is occurring on his watch. ""The key is communication, communication, communication,"" she said. ""Communicate what is being done. His goal should be to do something every day. Communicate every day to the American people on what you've changed today."" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker -- another failed GOP primary candidate -- said it would be ""a good use for his Twitter feed."" Thus far, governors said, they have not been concerned about Trump comments such as when he indicated he would ""amend"" Obamacare, which sounded less ambitious than his pledge to repeal and replace it. But Florida Gov. Rick Scott cautioned that as president, Trump will have to choose his words more carefully. ""If you're going to work with your legislature, you're going to have to be precise,"" Scott said in an interview. ""He will. He has to."" Some also called for more clarity in Trump's dealings internationally. ""In the first 100 days, he's got to give assurance to our allies and confidence in his leadership,"" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said during a panel discussion. ""He needs to provide clarity on immigration and border security. Those are expectations of the American people, and during the campaign it was opaque."" In an interview afterward, Hutchinson said, hopefully, ""I think we will be reassured in the coming weeks.""  "
9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/13-red-purple-state-dems-face-re-election-in-age-of-trump/2016/11/11/9c5803e4-a856-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	13 red, purple state Dems face re-election in age of Trump	" WASHINGTON -- A long list of Senate Democrats who face re-election in 2018 are from states Donald Trump won or nearly won on Election Day. That could mean a politically excruciating next two years for many of them and for party leaders trying to chart a legislative path as the new age of Trump begins. The election two years from now had already looked difficult for Senate Democrats, who must defend 25 seats compared to just eight held by Republicans. The Democrats' list includes two independents, Vermont's Bernie Sanders and Maine's Angus King, who align with them. Of those 25 senators, 13 are from states Trump captured or nearly won. Among those are Maine, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which hadn't backed a GOP presidential candidate since the 1980s, leaving both parties trying to discern how much Tuesday may have reordered the lineup of blue, red and swing states. Five Democrats are from states Trump easily carried, by 19 percentage points or more -- Indiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Missouri and Montana.  ""They should be terrified,"" Ward Baker, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP's political organization, said of the Democrats. Republicans are expected to control the Senate next year 52-48, including a Louisiana runoff in December the GOP is expected to win. With Democrats able to use filibusters to force the GOP to secure 60 votes on major issues, likely new Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., should often be able to block Republicans, especially on issues Democrats broadly support such as consumer protection and curbs on Wall Street. But it will probably be harder for Schumer to keep Democrats together on issues crucial to conservative voters including the Supreme Court, abortion, guns and weakening the Environmental Protection Agency. Some Democratic senators could also be drawn to Trump's efforts to revamp portions of President Barack Obama's health care law and tighten curbs on immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters in Louisville on Friday that he believes Democratic senators from deeply Republican states are ""going to want to be cooperative with us on a variety of things."" Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democratic leader, said that as his party's vote counter he's long listened to concerns of senators from Republican-leaning states.  ""I know a half-dozen people, I think that list will get a little longer now, that I go to first to find out where senators are on issues,"" he said. At the same time, Schumer must try to satisfy his party's liberals, who include Sanders and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. On some issues, perhaps efforts to expand coal use, Schumer could see up to seven Democrats defect to the GOP and still keep Republicans short of the 60 votes needed to prevail.  ""I'd probably line up more with Donald Trump's economic package,"" said Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, seeking re-election next year from West Virginia. ""I sure don't adhere to his social rhetoric."" In some ways, Clinton's defeat made political decisions easier for senators facing 2018 re-election. That's because midterm elections, when a president is not on the ballot, are often cruel to the president's party in Congress. Democrats lost nine Senate seats in 2014 and six others in 2010 under Obama, and presidents' parties have gained Senate seats just once in the past eight midterm contests. Democrats had already been privately fretting over how to persuade some of their senators to back Clinton initiatives that could have been unpopular in GOP-leaning states. The Trump victory and retention of congressional control makes it easier for Democrats to blame the GOP for problems.  ""The onus is on Donald Trump and Republicans, who now own all of the federal government,"" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., whose term is up in 2018. Her state's presidential vote remained too close to call Friday. All of that -- plus voters' disgust with the Washington establishment -- could put pressure on congressional Republicans for achievements, which may require them to cut deals with Schumer or with Democrats they hope to pick off from Trump states.  ""I think everybody is saying, 'We have to put something on the board here to restore some of our credibility,'"" said Patrick Griffin, a former Senate Democrat aide and White House official under President Bill Clinton. But in the 2018 campaigns, Republicans are sure to come after Democrats from states Trump won, using votes they take over these next two years that might displease conservative voters. In one indication of hardball politics, Baker -- the chief of the Senate GOP political committee -- told reporters this week that ""We're not done yet with Evan Bayh,"" the former Democratic Indiana senator who lost a bid this week to return to the chamber. Baker offered no specifics but said Republicans had more research material on Bayh that they still wanted to use. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
