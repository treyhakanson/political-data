North Eastern Regional Coordinator Mohamud Saleh said Sunday that police killed the men while ambushing a group of about 20 suspected members of a cell of al-Shabab militants on Saturday. Saleh says the group allegedly was planning an attack on a police station. He says police recovered four rifles and Somali army military jackets. Al-Shabab, the al-Qaeda affiliate in East Africa, has vowed retribution on Kenya for its troop presence in Somalia. Kenya deployed troops to Somalia in 2011 to fight al-Shabab, which is waging an insurgency against Somalia's weak U.N.-backed government threatening instability in the region.

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) speaks during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in late July. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)  Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) on Monday formally launched his bid to become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, offering a show of strength by simultaneously releasing the endorsements of 40 elected officials, state party chairmen and labor leaders. ""Democrats win when we harness the power of everyday people and fight for the issues they care about,"" Ellison said in a statement. ""It is not enough for Democrats to ask for voters' support every two years. We must be with them through every lost paycheck, every tuition hike, and every time they are the victim of a hate crime. When voters know what Democrats stand for, we can improve the lives of all Americans."" Ellison's name emerged as a likely candidate almost immediately after Hillary Clinton's stunning loss last week to Republican President-elect Donald Trump.   [What's next for Democrats? For starters, a battle for the soul of their party.]   It was clear from the outset that he was a favorite for the position among liberal advocacy groups and lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), the runner-up in this year's Democratic presidential primaries.  But Ellison has also already won the backing of some establishment party figures, including outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.), who announced his support on Sunday, and Reid's expected successor, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). On Monday, Ellison's list of endorsers also included Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D). In his statement, Ellison said that Democrats ""did not motivate enough people to the ballot box"" on Tuesday. ""We must champion the challenges of working families and give voters a reason to show up at the polls in 2018 and beyond,"" he said. ""We must build a bench not just for federal candidates, but for state and local candidates across the nation."" The next chairman is scheduled to be picked early next year by DNC members across the country, who may or may not take their cue from elected officials. Besides Ellison, several other names have emerged as possible successors to interim chairwoman Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic operative who stepped in after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) announced her resignation in July. Among them is Howard Dean, a former Vermont governor, who is seeking to return to a job he held from 2005 to 2009. Dean has argued that the party needs a full-time chairman with Trump about to step into the White House. ""You cannot do this job if it's not full time. Period,"" Dean said Monday morning during an appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" Noting his experience leading the DNC, Dean added: ""This is not something I have to do. This is not something I'm going to push people out of the way for."" Wasserman Schultz, who continued to serve in Congress during her DNC tenure, was driven from the position after a trove of hacked emails showed favoritism among DNC staff for Clinton over Sanders during the Democratic primaries. Others who have said they are considering bids for DNC chairman include former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison and the DNC's national finance chairman, Henry Munoz III. In all, more than a dozen names have already been floated. Ellison, first elected to Congress in 2006, represents a district that includes Minneapolis and its surrounding suburbs. A former Minnesota state lawmaker, he was the first Muslim elected to Congress -- a fact his boosters have said would send a strong signal about the Democratic Party's commitment to diversity during a Trump presidency. Among his legislative accomplishments was authoring a provision of the Credit Cardholders Bill of Rights in 2009 which prevents the practice of ""universal default,"" which allowed lenders to increase the interest rates charged to customers if they had late payments with another lender. A Detroit native, Ellison worked as a criminal defense lawyer before joining Congress."

""He's going to be the next president and regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office,"" said Obama, who met with Trump for the first time last week. ""This office has a way of waking you up."" Obama faced reporters crammed into the James S. Brady Briefing Room on Monday before leaving Washington for a week-long foreign trip to Greece, Germany and Peru, where he will meet with more than a dozen foreign leaders with their own set of worries about where the United States is headed under its next president. At moments the president offered advice to his successor that sometimes sounded like a warning. He urged Trump to respect ""those norms that are vital to a functioning democracy,"" such as ""civility and tolerance and a commitment to reason and facts and analysis."" For months Obama had accused candidate Trump of breaching those norms during a bitter and contentious campaign. After last week's shocking election results, Obama struck a more sanguine note. ""I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful president and moving this country forward,"" Obama said. ""I don't think any president ever comes in saying to himself, 'I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country.' ""     President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it's ""healthy"" for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. ""When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,"" Obama said. (The Washington Post)   The president sought to reassure U.S. allies, noting that in his conversation with Trump last week, the New York businessman ""expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,"" including the one with NATO. As he visits with world leaders, Obama vowed to let them know ""that there is no weakening of resolve"" when it comes to America meeting its commitments and defending its allies. Throughout the hour-long news conference, Obama sought to calm and reassure a jittery and divided country, choosing his words carefully and emphasizing unity over division. On many issues the president conceded that he and Trump continue to have competing visions on where to take the country and that his worries about Trump's fitness for office and temperament haven't disappeared. ""Of course I have got concerns,"" Obama said. He sought solace in the notion that change in Washington usually takes time. ""The federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat. It's an ocean liner,"" Obama said. And he expressed hope that on issues such as the Affordable Care Act, the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Trump would modify his position. ""I don't think he is ideological. I think, ultimately, he is pragmatic,"" Obama said. ""And that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.""     President Obama said that his administration ""stands ready"" to assist President-elect Donald Trump and his staff as they transition to the White House in January. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)   The president declined to comment on Trump's highest-profile and most controversial appointment so far -- senior counselor and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, former chief executive of the conservative website Breitbart News. Bannon is closely associated with the alt-right movement, which white nationalists have embraced. ""Without copping out, I think it's fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the president-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we are going to try to facilitate a smooth transition,"" Obama said. The president declined to answer a question on whether he still saw Trump as unfit to serve in the Oval Office -- a criticism he had leveled more than once during the campaign -- and instead emphasized that he had counseled the president-elect to reach out to some constituencies that had not supported his bid. ""It is important to send some signals of unity"" to minorities, women and other groups ""that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign,"" Obama said.     In a sign of how Obama has been working doggedly to influence Trump to preserve some of his administration's landmark achievements, the president spoke of the need to improve the Affordable Care Act rather than jettison it. He made a passionate case for not forcing children of undocumented immigrants to leave the country. ""I will urge the president-elect and the incoming administration to think long and hard before they are endangering the status of what, for all practical purposes, are American kids,"" he said. Going before the media soon after a major election is a rite of passage for the president. In Obama's case, only one of these exchanges has been celebratory. While he could embrace his 2012 reelection victory, both the 2010 and 2014 midterms and now the election of his successor have amounted to serious setbacks. Six years ago, Obama called the Democrats' congressional losses a ""shellacking""; in 2014, he declined to characterize the results, saying instead to the American people, ""I hear you."" Obama spent much less time talking about what contributed to Democrats' latest losses, which were punctuated by disappointing turnout among some minority groups and a poor showing in rural areas and some key suburbs. But he acknowledged that Democrats need to engage in ""some reflection"" about the way they campaign and connect with the American people. ""I believe that we have better ideas, but I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them,"" he said. ""We have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere."" Much of the president's hour-long news conference was dominated by questions of his view of Trump's character, temperament and fitness for office. Obama offered careful praise for Trump's ability to galvanize his constituency. ""What's clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxieties, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive,"" the president said. He observed that Trump was ""impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate. That's powerful stuff."" But Obama cautioned that Trump would not be able to govern as he campaigned: ""There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them.""

Believing that the time to act is now, as the U.S. president-elect begins to shape his foreign policy, top Israeli ministers voted unanimously Sunday in favor of a bill that would allow Israeli settlements and outposts that were built on property owned by Palestinians to avoid court-ordered demolitions. On Monday, Israeli politicians dug in for a fight over the legislation, which would retroactively offer legal protection to thousands of homes built both in long-established settlements and in newer wildcat outposts that were constructed on private Palestinian land. Palestinian landowners would be given money or alternative land parcels in exchange for their seized property. Israel considers most of its settlements legal but has acknowledged that some are either built without approval by the military or were erected on private Palestinian lands.     The move by Israeli leaders is one of the first concrete responses to the Trump election on the international stage. Trump and his advisers have signaled that the incoming administration will be more supportive of Israel than was President Obama, whose State Department has sharply criticized settlements as ""an obstacle to peace,"" even as the White House awarded Israel an unprecedented $38 billion in military aid over the coming decade and has staunchly defended Israel in political forums.  [Top Trump adviser says Israeli settlements are not an obstacle to peace]  Naftali Bennett, Israel's education minister and the leader of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, said the Trump victory means that ""the era of the Palestinian state is over,"" a direct challenge to the official government position of backing a two-state solution. Bennett and his allies view the full legalization of the settlements built on Palestinian land as only a first step. Bennett wants Israel to formally annex the 60 percent of the West Bank where the Jewish-only settlements are located, thereby ending any prospect for a viable Palestinian state. Speaking to foreign correspondents Monday, Bennett said the Trump election and shifting politics in Europe ""provide Israel with a unique opportunity to reset and rethink everything."" As for the idea that Israel should wait and see where Trump is going, Bennett said it is important for Israel to declare what it wants. The draft legislation was opposed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the move ""childish and irresponsible."" Even so, senior members and top ministers of Netanyahu's fellow Likud party approved a bill that their leader considers ill-timed and needlessly provocative. Netanyahu finds himself in a tight spot. If the draft legislation is eventually passed by the parliament -- not a sure bet -- the Israeli leader fears a wave of condemnation by Europe and the United Nations, where pro-Palestinian voices can insist that the settlers are ""stealing"" Arab-owned land with government approval. Netanyahu is also wary of what Obama may do in his last months in office. The outgoing president, many Israelis fear, could formally outline what the Americans consider a fair resolution to the long-running conflict, including the parameters for a future Palestinian state. Obama could do this in a speech or by allowing a resolution to pass in the United Nations. Daniel Friedmann, a former Israeli justice minister, said, ""Netanyahu really wanted to avoid this."" He said the Israeli prime minister ""could stop it if he really wanted to, but he is not in an easy position, because he does not want the settlers to think that he is the one who threw it out."" Netanyahu could still stall or derail the legislation, but the clock is ticking. The first of three readings of the bill is scheduled for Wednesday. The State Department condemned the proposed law, saying it further endangers the prospects for peace. ""This legislation would be a dramatic advancement of the settlement enterprise, which is already gravely endangering the prospects for a two-state solution,"" State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said on Monday. ""This only makes clear the choice Israel faces between building more settlements and preserving the possibility of peace."" Trudeau added that the State Department hopes the proposal does not become law but declined to say whether the administration plans any response if it is enacted.  [State Dept. criticizes Israeli settlement expansion, demolitions]  The move to press ahead with the ""legalization bill"" was spurred by the Israeli Supreme Court, which ordered that a Jewish settlement called Amona be evacuated and demolished because a portion of it was built on privately owned Palestinian land. On Monday, the high court rejected a government appeal for a delay and gave the Israeli military until Dec. 25 to clear the settlement. Demolition orders against other settlements built on private Palestinian land are also looming. Today about 400,000 Jewish settlers are living on 125 settlements and 100 outposts in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, on territory that Palestinians want for a future state. Most of the world considers the settlements illegal under international law. The United States calls the communities ""illegitimate."" Israel disputes that. In the past year, the Obama White House and the State Department have condemned settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem with sharply escalating rhetoric, openly questioning whether Netanyahu is truly committed to a two-state solution. Shai Ben Yosef, a leader of the Ofra settlement, which also is partly built on private Palestinian land, told the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that ""Trump's election removes that excuse of, 'Oy vey, what are they going to do to us?' "" He added: ""The person about to move into the White House is a man whose motivation to pressure Israel is much smaller. We can reach agreements with him about legalizing the settlements."" Yosef said Netanyahu has often cited Washington as the reason for his insistence that settlements grow slowly, out of fear of upsetting the Americans. With Trump's election, he said, ""our government needs to drop all those old excuses.""  [Some Israelis see $38 billion U.S. military aid offer as a failure]  As usual, the Palestinians were on the sidelines as their fates were being debated in the Israeli parliament and courts. The Palestinian government condemned the move to legalize settlements built on private Palestinian land as ""theft."" Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, vowed that the Palestinians would go to the U.N. Security Council to seek to block the legislation's implementation. He called the move ""a dangerous escalation in the region."" The move is not universally embraced in Israel, either. Isaac Herzog, leader of the opposition in parliament, said the proposed bill is a ""serious stain on Israel's law books, because it authorizes theft and robbery. There is no precedent, nothing like it, in which the Israeli government authorized a law that allows taking land from private people."" Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit warned that legislation contradicts international law and said he wouldn't be able to defend the bill in front of the high court. ""I think that it is too early and premature for politicians to make statements and I think it is not wise,"" Israel's former national security adviser Yaakov Amidror said of the Israelis who think they know what Trump's intentions are toward Israel and the Palestinians.

The spirited demonstrations on college campuses and along downtown streets were mostly peaceful following previous outbreaks of window-smashing and fire-setting. Organizers said several thousand people gathered on Boston Common to publicly object to the election of Trump. The evening event was billed as a rally for love and peace rather than a protest. Hundreds of people attended another ""love rally"" in Washington Square Park in Manhattan. Leslie Holmes, 65, a website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, took an hour-long train ride to the demonstration -- her first protest since the 1970s, when she hit the streets of San Francisco to oppose the Vietnam War. She described herself as an armchair liberal but declared, ""I'm not going to be armchair anymore.""  ""I don't want to live in a country where my friends aren't included, and my friends are fearful, and my children are going to grow up in a world that's frightening, and my granddaughters can look forward to being excluded from jobs and politics and fulfilling their potential, so I'm here for them,"" she said. In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. In Chicago, multiple groups planned protests through Saturday. Nadia Gavino, 25, learned about the rallies on Twitter and protested Thursday evening. Gavino, whose father is from Peru and whose mother is of Mexican and Lithuanian heritage, said she took Trump's harshest statements about immigrants and Latinos personally.  ""I obviously agree that he's racist, he's sexist, he's phobic, he's misogynistic. He's all these things you don't want in a leader,"" she said. Ashley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver.  ""I have a leader I fear for the first time in my life,"" said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Hillary Clinton.  ""It's not that we're sore losers,"" she said. ""It's that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation."" Demonstrations also were planned Saturday in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other areas. Previous demonstrations drew thousands of people in New York, Los Angeles and other large urban centers. The largely peaceful protests were overshadowed by sporadic episodes of vandalism, violence and street-blocking. On Thursday night, some marchers in Portland, Oregon lit firecrackers, set small fires and used rocks and baseball bats to break the glass of businesses and cars parked at dealerships. Police used pepper spray and flash-bang devices to force people to disperse and made more than two dozen arrests. A protest organizer decried the vandalism and said the group planned to help clean up. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Still, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets -- whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. Sources of spurious information have ranged from news articles produced by ""content farms"" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to ""hyperpartisan"" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. Case in point: ""FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE"" -- a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. Is it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? Zuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. During an interview Thursday with ""The Facebook Effect"" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a ""profound lack of empathy"" for supporters of Donald Trump.  ""Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,"" he said. Given the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. This, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. But isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? While Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be ""uniquely angry and disrespectful,"" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. FILTER BUBBLE? When it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the ""other side."" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a ""filter bubble"" -- that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle.  ""By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,"" Zuckerberg said. ""But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that."" A DIFFICULT LINE Facebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan -- to make the world more ""open and connected"" -- seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. But it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth.  ""We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,"" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. ""We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation."" Facebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. Over the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its ""trending"" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. Subsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

GOP incumbents around the country faced energized Democratic challengers trying to oust them in costly and caustic battles shadowed every step of the way by the polarizing presidential race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. As voting progressed Tuesday, it looked like it could go either way in GOP-held North Carolina, Missouri and New Hampshire. The races were also close in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Nevada, the one Democratic-held seat that was hotly contested this election. Republicans hold a 54-46 majority in the Senate, including two independent senators who caucus with the Democrats. That means Democrats need to pick up just four seats to take the majority if Clinton wins the White House and can send her vice president to cast tie-breaking votes in a 50-50 Senate. Democrats would need to pick up five seats if Trump wins. The GOP retook the majority just two years ago. And even though control of the Senate is likely to be razor-thin whichever party ends up on top, the advantages of being in the majority are significant. The controlling party holds the committee chairmanships, sets the legislative agenda and runs investigations. First up is likely to be a nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Democrats were counting on two likely pick-ups in Wisconsin and Illinois, though in Wisconsin polls tightened in recent weeks in favor of GOP Sen. Ron Johnson. Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada was retiring after five terms and trying to engineer a Democratic successor. Democrats were optimistic that a strong Latino vote, and Republican hopeful Rep. Joe Heck's stumbles with Trump, would keep Nevada in their column. In Florida, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio had a narrow lead in polling going into Election Day over Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, who was abandoned by his own party after Democratic bosses decided to pull ad money from expensive Florida and invest it in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana, instead. But it was a different story in Indiana, where another star recruit, Evan Bayh, former Democratic governor and senator, was struggling in his comeback bid against Republican Rep. Todd Young. Ohio and Arizona, forecast to be competitive early on, were poised to be walks for the GOP incumbents, Rob Portman and John McCain. North Carolina and Missouri, on the other hand, were two GOP-friendly states that turned unexpectedly competitive as incumbent Republican Sens. Richard Burr and Roy Blunt seemed caught unawares by the nation's restless mood. Throughout the campaign the Senate races provided moments of drama, not least as GOP candidates grappled with sharing a ticket with Trump. That tripped up Sen. Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire after she asserted at one point that Trump could ""absolutely"" be a role model for the nation's youth. Ayotte quickly retracted, then went on to renounce her endorsement of Trump after audio emerged last month of him boasting of getting away with groping women. But damage was done with GOP voters, and it didn't stop Ayotte's opponent, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, from trying to tie Ayotte to Trump throughout the campaign. In Nevada, Heck un-endorsed Trump to boos after the groping audio, but later seemed to backtrack. He ended the campaign refusing to say whether or not he'd vote for Trump. Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, too, kept voters in suspense until the end about who he would vote for. There were poignant moments, too. McCain, at age 80, was seeking his sixth term in quite possibly his final campaign. The 2008 GOP presidential nominee struck a reflective note in a final pre-election rally in Prescott, Arizona, the same place his Senate predecessor, Barry Goldwater, began his Senate and presidential bids.  ""While as Yogi Berra said, 'I hate to make predictions, especially about the future,' I'm not sure how many more I have in me,"" McCain said. ""It's fair to say, then, that tonight is very meaningful to me."" Republicans faced hurdles from the outset, starting with an unfavorable map that had the GOP defending 24 seats, including several in Democratic territory, compared to 10 for the Democrats. If Clinton wins and Democrats seize control, expect them to summon FBI Director James Comey to testify about his handling of the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server. Comey's bombshell announcement late last month that he was examining a new batch of e-mails in connection with the probe gave a number of GOP Senate candidates momentum heading into the final days. Comey told Congress on Sunday that there were no grounds for further action. ___ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

On the last day of the presidential campaign, Clinton seemed to be a clear but not overwhelming favorite. She held a small lead in national polls and in key battleground states. Both candidates were hoping that these polls had missed something: Trump hoping for a surge in white voters that would allow him to win the White House; Clinton hoping for a surge in Latino voters that would put the race away. In Grand Rapids, Clinton talked about bringing the country together after the election was over. ""We've got to heal our country, or, as the Bible says, 'repair the breach,' because we have so much divisiveness right now,"" she said. ""We've got to start listening to each other, respecting each other.""   Donald Trump holds up a mask depicting himself as he speaks during a campaign event at Robarts Arena at the Sarasota County Fairgrounds in Sarasota, Fla., on Monday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Trump, on his final day, offered a starkly different message, full of dark warnings about what it would mean if he didn't win. He said the country was on a downward slope, hampered by a favor-trading political elite and a mismanaged economy. His opponent was corrupt. The system was rigged in her favor. And -- if Trump could not win on Tuesday -- he said his long and surprising campaign had been worthless for everyone involved. ""If we don't win, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy . . . and money,"" Trump said during a campaign stop in Raleigh. ""If we don't win, honestly, we've all wasted our time.""  [A year in Trump's America: Frustration, racial angst and a political movement]  Trump was scheduled to make stops in five states Monday: Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. He returned to themes familiar from his run to victory in the Republican primaries, attacking the news media as corrupt and protective of Clinton. These were the last rallies for Trump, the last gatherings of an unexpected movement that had begun with his ride down the escalator at Trump Tower in summer last year. The last crowds of Trump's campaign were boisterous, reflecting the GOP nominee's anger and magnifying it. They broke into shouts aimed at Clinton: ""Lock her up!"" In Raleigh, when Trump mentioned President Obama, some yelled out the same for the president: ""Lock him up!"" The atmosphere grew especially rowdy at a late afternoon stop in Scranton, Pa., where shouts of ""She's a demon!"" and ""She's a witch!"" could be heard as Trump lambasted Clinton.     At a rally in Raleigh, N.C., Nov. 7, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said it would be a different story if the United States had debt but was in ""tippy top shape."" But instead, Trump said ""everything"" from roads to schools to hospitals in the country is ""a mess."" (The Washington Post)   Clinton was scheduled to be in several states, making two stops in Pennsylvania and a stop here in Michigan, before planning to end the day with a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. President Obama also made four stops -- events that ended a chapter in his political career. Obama had begun his rise to the White House by defeating Clinton, the clear favorite, in the 2008 Democratic primaries. In making his last campaign appearances as president, he tried to help Clinton win the office he'd denied her eight years before. ""I am asking you to trust me on this one,"" Obama said at a stop in Ann Arbor, Mich. Later in the day, in the college town of Durham, N.H., Obama grew reflective, noting it was his final solo rally as president. He recounted the story of Edith Childs, the Greenwood, S.C., city councilwoman who coined the 2008 Obama campaign slogan, ""Fired Up! Ready to Go!"" -- the same story he told at his last rally on the eve of his first election. ""It's not often you have a chance to shape history. The world is watching us,"" the president told thousands of cheering supporters who filled an arena at the University of New Hampshire. ""This is one of those moments,"" Obama added. ""Don't let it slip away."" Later in the evening, Clinton held a massive rally with more than 33,000 supporters outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia, featuring a performance by rock-and-roll icon Bruce Springsteen. Clinton told that crowd that ""every issue that you care about is at stake."" Joined by former president Bill Clinton, their daughter, Chelsea, President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, the Democratic nominee pivoted away from the email controversy that dogged much of her campaign, casting the election as a choice ""between division and unity."" ""We choose to believe in a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America,"" she said. Michelle Obama, widely regarded as Clinton's most effective surrogate, spoke emotionally about the prospect of electing the first female president. ""Speaking here tonight is the last and most important thing I can do for my country as first lady,"" she said. Warning that presidential campaigns are ""breathtakingly close,"" Obama declared that the election ""is in our hands."" ""If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win,"" she said. ""But if we stay home or we play around with a protest vote, then Hillary's opponent will win. Period, end of story."" At the same time, Trump held a rally in Manchester, N.H. -- scene of his first primary victory -- in which he returned to themes of his aggressive primary campaign. He attacked the media. He called Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from nearby Massachusetts, ""Pocahontas."" He talked up his crowd size: ""Hillary can't fill a room. Look at this, look at this, this is called filling a stadium,"" Trump said, in an arena that seats less than 12,000. He then told the crowd he had received support from New England Patriots star Tom Brady and the team's coach, Bill Belichick.   [Among the few winners of this bitter election: The Obamas]  Polls will open across the country Tuesday morning, and the first polls will begin to close at 6 p.m. Eastern time. Although millions of Americans voted before Election Day, there were still some key states -- notably Pennsylvania and New Hampshire -- where nearly all voting will take place on Tuesday. Those states got special focus from both camps on Monday. For Trump, his message Monday was heavily influenced by the big news from the day before, when FBI Director James B. Comey said the bureau had completed its examination of newly discovered emails belonging to a Clinton aide -- an examination that had roiled the presidential race when it was first revealed last month. He said there was nothing in the emails to change the bureau's months-old decision not to seek charges against Clinton, the former secretary of state, for using a private email server to conduct government business. Trump, who had been trailing badly in many polls when the new emails were revealed, has since narrowed the gap, leaning on a message that Clinton was ""crooked"" and likely to be charged. On Monday, Trump changed his message about the emails, but only slightly -- adding Comey to his target list for criticism. At a midafternoon rally in Raleigh, N.C, where a supporter held up a sign reading, ""Comey You're Fired,"" Trump said the FBI director was ""obviously under tremendous pressure"" to conclude the inquiry. At the same rally, Trump painted a bleak picture of an America under Clinton, warning of imminent ""disaster,"" a hobbled economy and politics dominated by special interests. ""It's up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow,"" he declared. ""We're going to win."" ""Drain the swamp!"" his supporters chanted moments later. In the last few days of the campaign, Trump has invested time and resources in blue-leaning states, including Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Most recent opinion polls show Clinton leading in all three, but Trump is hoping for a surge among white voters who lack college degrees.  [She was born the day women got the vote. And then a century passed. . .]  ""The miners are going to come out. The steelworkers who lost their jobs are going to come out,"" Trump said Monday. He said that polls showing him behind were simply rigged. ""The women are going to come out big. It is all a phony deal. They are telling you a lot of phony stuff."" Trump also claimed -- without presenting any evidence -- that he was doing better than expected among African Americans and Hispanics. In fact, there are signs that strong Hispanic turnout could provide a big boost to Clinton. Polls have shown black and Hispanic voters overwhelmingly favor Clinton, and Clinton's campaign has touted heavy turnout among Hispanic and Asian Americans in early voting in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. More than 6.4 million voters in Florida have voted early, up nearly 35 percent over 2012, according to the Clinton campaign, with big early surges in majority-Hispanic Miami-Dade County. ""We are on the path to see more Americans vote than we have ever seen in our history,"" Clinton said in Pittsburgh. ""If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait."" Clinton made no mention of the conclusion of the FBI's email investigation during her campaign appearances. In a TV interview, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook criticized Comey's handling of the probe as ""bizarre.""  [For FBI, email investigation yields little but criticism]  ""We were glad obviously that this was resolved,"" Mook told ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""I don't understand why he couldn't have just looked into the matter and resolved it and not created such a ruckus in the campaign, but we're just glad in this last day Hillary can get back on the road.""  At her events, Clinton assailed Trump, ticking through the groups of people she said the businessman and reality TV star had targeted or offended. Clinton also criticized Trump for apparently paying no federal income taxes for several years and for refusing to release copies of his tax returns. ""There must be something really terrible in there,"" she said in a mocking tone.     The Justice Department said Monday that it would deploy more than 500 poll watchers from its Civil Rights Division to monitor voting in 67 jurisdictions in 28 states, including at least three in each of the swing states. Many of the jurisdictions have large Native American, black, Latino and Muslim populations. The department said its lawyers would be working to enforce federal voting rights laws ""to ensure that every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot."" It also has a hotline (toll free at 1-800-253-3931 or 202-307-3931) to register complaints.  Sullivan reported from Raleigh. David Nakamura, in Durham, N.H., and Matea Gold and Scott Clement in Washington contributed to this report. "
