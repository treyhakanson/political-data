A grand jury returned the indictment against Montgomery police Officer Aaron Smith for the February shooting death of 58-year-old Greg Gunn. The fatal confrontation began when the 23-year-old officer stopped Gunn as he was walking through his neighborhood shortly after 3 a.m. Montgomery County District Attorney Daryl Bailey announced the indictment in a press statement Friday. Prosecutors had charged Smith with murder shortly after the shooting, and a judge sent the case to a grand jury. A state investigator testified in a March hearing that Smith had given conflicting stories about what happened before he shot Gunn. Smith's lawyer Mickey McDermott maintained Friday that Smith acted appropriately after Gunn ran, fought back and then swung some sort of object at the officer.  ""It was Mr. Gunn's actions that resulted in his death,"" McDermott said. McDermott said he believed Smith was charged because of ""emotion and politics."" Friends said Gunn was walking home from his weekly card game to the house he shared with his mother. McDermott said Smith was a young officer, patrolling by himself in a high crime district, when he stopped Gunn because he thought he was suspicious. A lawyer representing Gunn's family could not immediately be reached for comment. The fatal confrontation was not captured on Smith's body camera or dash camera. Patrol car cameras automatically switch on when an officer activates his or her blue lights, but Smith didn't activate his patrol car lights. The shooting death roiled the Deep South city. Yellow lawns signs reading ""Justice for Greg Gunn"" lined the streets in the neighborhood where Gunn was shot. More than 200 mourners packed a memorial service for the 58-year-old. Bailey in a statement said he wanted to stress that the indictment against Smith was not an indictment of the entire Montgomery Police Department or any law enforcement agency.  ""They are truly the thin blue line between a peaceful community and anarchy,"" Bailey said ___ This story has been corrected to show that an investigator testified Smith gave conflicting stories about the shooting.

Bill Haslam. According to a court notice filed Friday in Franklin County, Ohio, Jimmy Haslam was served with a notice to appear at the deposition in Knoxville on Dec. 13. The lawsuit was filed by companies that declined to participate in an $85 million settlement between Pilot and 5,500 trucking companies in connection with a scheme to cheat customers out of promised discounts and rebates. The company also paid a $92 million federal penalty. Haslam has denied knowing about the scheme. The scheduled deposition was first reported by journalist Walter F.

She fell asleep, then awoke to learn that Donald Trump was defeating Hillary Clinton.  ""And then I threw up,"" said Passmore, 54. ""My body totally rejected the result."" Hours later, she found herself writing an email to her kids saying how terrified she was for the country's future: for the Supreme Court, for health care, for international relations. Shock. Despair. A punch to the gut. Hopelessness. Countless female Clinton supporters used those words Wednesday to describe their feelings. Some spoke of collapsing in tears, or seeing strangers do the same -- on the subway, or on the street. For many women, the election was a one-two punch. A huge milestone that had seemed so tantalizingly close -- the election of a woman as president -- was now out of reach. And the victorious candidate was one who had denigrated women, mocked a beauty pageant contestant for her weight, described grabbing women by the genitals with impunity, and been accused of multiple instances of sexual assault. By the time Trump had called his opponent ""such a nasty woman,"" it had seemed that women might hand him a defeat at the ballot box. But when the dust cleared, the unprecedented gender gap -- 13 points in Clinton's favor, assuming exit polls hold up, the largest since the exit poll began in 1972 -- wasn't enough. And the fact is that millions of American women did vote for Trump.  ""Listen, I didn't love either of the candidates,"" said Susan Paarz, 69, of Somers Point, New Jersey. ""But I voted against corruption and dishonesty."" For Clinton supporter Jan Risher, Election Day had begun joyously. She'd rustled up the best pantsuit she could -- not matching, but no matter -- and headed to downtown Lafayette, Louisiana, to take a happy photo with some similarly attired women. Hours later, instead of celebrating the first woman president as she'd expected, she was searching online for how to immigrate to Canada.  ""I have never felt so forlorn in my life,"" said Risher, 52. ""I just feel such alienation from my country today."" On social media, many women asked: What will we tell our daughters? Clinton herself addressed the issue in an emotional concession speech. ""To all the little girls watching: Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world,"" she said. Not all of the women who voted for Trump completely condoned his behavior. They just preferred him to the alternative. To Trump supporter Diane Massaroli of Staten Island, New York, the candidate's vulgar, caught-on-tape comments were disgusting -- but not a dealbreaker. And the series of women who accused him of sexual assault didn't persuade her, she said. (Her 15-year-old daughter, though, was a Clinton supporter -- and in tears at the result.)  ""A lot of people said that to me: How could I vote for him, being the mother of a daughter? ... But I think everything else is far greater"" than his comments, Massaroli said. ""I think people just didn't trust her as much as they would trust him."" Said Paarz of Trump's vulgar comments, ""Any woman would have been offended. But guys talk that way in a locker room. Is he different? Probably not."" A clearly disappointed Kathy Spillar, executive director of the Feminist Majority Foundation, preferred to accentuate the positive in the election: Clinton, she noted, won among young women, not to mention winning the popular vote. And the subject of sexual assault made it front and center in the campaign.  ""A sleeping giant has been awakened on this issue of sexual assault,"" Spillar said. ""Women have made it very clear that they're not going to be treated this way by men."" In Florida -- a key battleground state won narrowly by Trump -- Phyllis Towzey of St. Petersburg watched election night returns from her sofa, and started to cry. ""I've dreamed about a woman president since I was a little kid,"" the 57-year-old attorney said. ""And if she couldn't win over a grossly less qualified male candidate, I don't think there's any hope in my lifetime to have a woman president."" Nora Rubel and her two daughters were among throngs of people who went to suffragist Susan B. Anthony's gravesite Tuesday to celebrate voting for Clinton -- the Rochester, New York, graveyard had extended its hours, expecting the crowd.  ""The energy was incredible, and it felt prophetic,"" she recalled. A day later, her 13-year-old daughter was sobbing so hard over Clinton's loss that the girl stayed home from school. Rubel struggled with what to say to her despondent children Wednesday, but settled on this: ""We're all disappointed. There are checks and balances, although not as many as we want, and we all have to take care of each other."" _ Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Jennifer Peltz in New York contributed to this report.

Here's a look at some of the other results of exit polling conducted for The Associated Press and television networks in Virginia. ___ GENDER, RACE AND AGE Clinton was buoyed by robust support from women and minorities in Virginia, while Trump led among white voters. The vast majority of black voters and roughly two-thirds of Hispanic voters cast ballots for Clinton. Clinton won with more than half of women voters while Trump captured about six in 10 white voters. Clinton also had the advantage with young voters, winning in age groups 18 to 29 and 30 to 44. ___ EDUCATION Clinton was the favorite among the more educated voters, capturing 61 percent of the vote of those with a post-graduate degree and 51 percent of those with a college degree. About three-quarters of white voters without a college degree chose Trump. ___ ALL ABOUT THE ECONOMY Virginian voters had the economy on their minds. More than half of Virginia voters -- split between Trump and Clinton supporters -- said the economy was the most important issue in the country, outweighing foreign policy, immigration or terrorism. Among the fraction of voters who saw immigration as the key issue, 68 percent voted for Trump. Clinton had the advantage among voters who pointed to foreign policy as the most pressing concern, with 67 percent of those voters in her camp. Some 57 percent of voters said they believe they condition of the nation's economy is not so good or poor while about two-thirds said they believe the U.S. economy favors the wealthy. ___ OPTIMISM VS. PESSIMISM Trump was the favorite among voters who are pessimistic about the future of the country while Clinton carried those who are more optimistic. About six in 10 voters who said they believe life will be better for the next generation voted for Clinton. Roughly seven in 10 voters who said they believe life will be worse for the next generation voted for Trump. ___ CHANGE VS. EXPERIENCE Trump was strongly favored by those seeking a candidate they believe can bring about change, capturing 81 percent of those voters who saw that quality as the most important in a president. Of voters who cited experience as the most important quality in a leader, nearly 9 in 10 of those cast their ballots for Clinton. ___ WOMEN AND EMAILS Some 62 percent of voters said that Clinton's use of private email as secretary of state bothered them at least some. Nearly three-quarters said the same thing about Trump's treatment of women. ___ IMMIGRATION Clinton won among voters who say that immigrants working in the U.S. after coming to the country illegally should be offered a chance to apply for legal status. Meanwhile, 85 percent of those voters who said those immigrants should be deported voted for Trump. Similarly 80 percent of those who said that immigration hurts the country voted for Trump while about three-fourths of those who said that immigration helps the country voted for Clinton. ___ RELIGION AND GUNS Eight in 10 white voters who say they are evangelicals or born-again Christians voted for Trump. Clinton won among voters who say they never attend religious services. Meanwhile, almost six in 10 voters who said someone in their house owns a gun voted for Trump. Trump also won more than three-quarters of voters who said they oppose stricter gun-control measures. ___ The exit poll of 2,942 Virginia voters was conducted for AP and the television networks by Edison Research in a random sample of 50 precincts statewide.

Meanwhile, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault is calling on President Barack Obama to stop the project before he leaves office in two months. Obama had raised the prospect of rerouting the pipeline to alleviate the tribe's concerns last week, and said his administration is monitoring the situation but will ""let it play out for several more weeks."" The 1,200-mile, $3.8 billion pipeline being built by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners is to carry oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point at Patoka, Illinois -- a route that skirts the tribe's reservation. The Standing Rock Sioux fear the pipeline will harm drinking water and cultural sites and is trying to stop the project through a lawsuit and with protests that have been ongoing in southern North Dakota for months, resulting in more than 400 arrests. Archambault issued a statement Wednesday, saying ""halting the Dakota Access pipeline presents a unique opportunity for President Obama to set a lasting and true legacy and respect the sovereignty and treaty rights of Standing Rock and tribal nations across America."" Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, whom Trump has leaned on for energy policy advice, said it's not feasible to reroute a pipeline that the company says is nearly complete. The only holdup, according to ETP, is a section under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, near the protest site. That's where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is reviewing its permitting for the crossing in the wake of tribal concerns. The corps has given no timetable for a decision, and officials did not respond to numerous telephone and email requests for comment. But in a statement on Election Day, ETP said crews are preparing to tunnel under Lake Oahe.  ""Dakota Access expects that its mobilization of equipment will be completed over the next two weeks and that it will commence drilling activities upon completion of mobilization,"" the statement said, adding that the company is confident the matter of corps permission will be resolved ""in a time frame that will not result in any significant delay."" Cramer said he expects the matter to be resolved before Trump enters the White House in January, but that if it isn't, ""Donald Trump has been very clear he wants to rebuild the infrastructure of this country.""  ""He's been very clear he wants to replace foreign energy with domestic energy,"" Cramer said. ""He's been very clear he wants to celebrate the shale oil revolution, not quash it."" During an oil conference in Bismarck in May, Trump unveiled an ""America first"" energy plan that includes reducing and eliminating ""all barriers to responsible energy production."" ___ Follow Blake Nicholson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/NicholsonBlake Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Nearly four of every five voters in the nation's capital gave their support to a statehood referendum on Tuesday. The District also voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, who won its three electoral votes with just over 90 percent of the vote. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 12-to-1 in the nation's capital, and most Republicans oppose statehood for both Constitutional and practical reasons: Making the District a state would dramatically shift the balance of power by all but guaranteeing two new Senate seats for Democrats. Still, city leaders hoped that a Democratic president and gains by Democrats in Congress would make the climate more favorable for statehood.  ""Part of our strategy was to be ready when we had like-minded people elected in the White House and in the Congress,"" Bowser said. ""We are prepared for that day when it comes."" Bowser said Trump would have to work to mend relationships in a city where 93 percent of voters wanted someone else to be president. Hillary Clinton also won Maryland and Virginia, and the immediate suburbs of Washington in both states are Democratic strongholds.  ""Many of our residents are anxious, are angry, and are hurting,"" Bowser said. Bowser, too, has been vocal about her dislike of Trump. She called his comments about immigrants ""idiotic,"" and while she attended the groundbreaking of his Washington hotel, she skipped its grand-opening festivities. However, she said she would welcome him to his new home and attend his inaugural festivities. Michael D. Brown, one of the city's elected ""shadow senators"" -- who are essentially unpaid lobbyists for statehood -- said advocates should alter their approach after the Republican triumphs.  ""We need a nationwide PR plan, because we need to take our fight to the people,"" Brown said, urging the city to make a major funding commitment to its advocacy efforts. Bowser said the city needs to debate how much money should be poured into that effort. The other shadow senator, Paul Strauss, pointed out that Vice President-elect Mike Pence was one of a few Republicans who supported a 2009 bill to give the District's delegate to Congress a vote on the House floor. Trump, too, has said that while he doesn't support statehood, a vote in the House for the District ""would be OK."" With the statehood referendum, voters endorsed a draft constitution that would have the city's 670,000 residents electing a governor, not a mayor, and a 21-seat state legislature instead of a city council. The constitution includes borders for the proposed state, with the White House, the Capitol and the National Mall carved out as a separate federal enclave. Congress could admit the District into the union simply by voting to approve the document. Despite its bleak prospects, Bowser and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said they would respect the will of the voters and submit it to Congress for consideration. ___ Follow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols.

From left, Trump, his son Barron, wife Melania, son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump. (Evan Vucci/AP)  As Tuesday night wore on and it became increasingly clear that Donald Trump would become our country's 45th president, Democratic strategist Van Jones articulated how the half of America who did not vote for the Republican nominee might be feeling at that moment. He called the results a ""nightmare."" ""It's hard to be a parent tonight for a lot of us,"" the former Obama White House adviser said on CNN. ""You tell your kids, 'Don't be a bully.' You tell your kids, 'Don't be a bigot.' You tell your kids, 'Do your homework and be prepared.' And then you have this outcome, and you have people putting children to bed tonight, and they're afraid of breakfast. They're afraid of 'How do I explain this to my children?'"" Whatever your political beliefs, this year's election battle -- covered 24/7 by online news outlets, cable channels and your Twitter feed -- was one of the most polarizing and bitter in history. And it ended with a populace that is on edge. Even before the final results, the American Psychological Association said, 52 percent of Americans said the race was a very or somewhat significant source of stress. Trump's surprise upset over Democrat Hillary Clinton appears, at least anecdotally, to have made the situation worse for many people. Children may be especially vulnerable. Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets are full of reports (some verifiable and some unsubstantiated) about how their anxiety is playing out: kids who are gay or Muslim being too fearful to get on the school bus Wednesday morning. Episodes of bullying in which kids repeated things Trump has said. Children expressing fears about conflict, war and their future.   [How parents can help disappointed kids cope with the Trump win]   Daniel Griffin, a psychologist in the Washington area -- a Democratic stronghold that supported Clinton -- said in an interview that many patients were walking into his office ""shellshocked."" Griffin, who has been working for more than 30 years in counseling, said many families are reacting as if they had gone through a personal tragedy and that the first thing he reminds parents is that ""kids really do pick up on parents' emotions."" So it's important to put on a positive face. ""Politics is pretty complicated, and their parents' emotional expression is what kids rely on just to say if a situation is safe and manageable or whether it's a catastrophe,"" he explained. Griffin also said that parents need not excuse or minimize behavior or remarks by Trump that don't conform to their value system but could instead explain that how there's a ""system of checks and balances"" in the country so that the government is more than a single person. ""It's impossible to shield most kids from this, but you should marshal the reserves to normalize the situation,"" he said. Explain that we've been through many many difficult things in the history of this country ""and we'll get through this one.""    A woman outside the London Embassy wipes away tears as she takes part in an anti-racism protest against President-elect Donald Trump winning the U.S. election. (Matt Dunham/AP)  Similarly, Michael W. Yogman, a pediatrician in Cambridge, Mass. and the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on psychosocial aspects of child and family health, said the most important message a parent can give to a child is that ""we as adults will protect you."" ""There are democratic processes in this country and institutions that will protect all Americans and not allow bigotry to take over. That includes children with same-sex parents, gay children, disabled children and minority children,"" he said, describing how one African American boy came in with the heartbreaking worry that all African Americans might be jailed or deported and wondered what might happen if he changed the color of his skin. Yogman said that in such situations, parents might consider borrowing from President Obama's morning message about the values at the heart of the American democracy being bigger than whomever is elected. Griffin advises parents to keep their initial sharing ""Twitter-sized,"" meaning that they don't need to get into all the details of why they are upset, but to offer some information, watch the child's response and then follow his or her natural curiosity. Young children may have already picked up on a parent's fears that may have translated into their own. For older children, teens or college students, it can help to get others in the community involved as they deal with their feelings. ""Especially around here in Washington, there are a lot of sources. If a child has a strong emotional feeling, they can share some of this concern with other folks over breakfast or dinner or something like that and get other perspectives,"" he said. Another idea parents can emphasize is that even children have the power to make a difference in their lives and in the lives of others. ""Children have a choice and don't need to be quiet and live in fear when they feel like something is wrong -- whether they are being bullied or discriminated against or mean to,"" Yogman said. Griffin said parents could tell their children that ""it's okay to be vulnerable and have feelings and worries, but here is something you can do something about."" ""It is important for them to know we live in a participatory democracy,"" he said. Depending on the issue that concerns a particular child, a course of action may involve things like creating a petition or writing a letter to a member of Congress -- or even to the president-elect himself.

LePage accused of voter intimidation after he says college students must establish residency if they choose to vote in Maine	"   A flier found on the Bates College campus (Courtesy of Sarah Frankie Sigman)  The governor of Maine told college students Monday to establish residency in Maine if they choose to vote there, and warned that state officials would pursue every legal means to verify that students who voted were complying with state law. That prompted critics to say he was illegally intimidating voters, and to call on federal officials to investigate. Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican known for controversial comments who supports GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, made his statement Monday in response to questions about fliers found on the Bates College campus in Lewiston over the weekend, which Maine's secretary of state said ""appear to be targeting college students in order to discourage them from registering to vote.""   ['We need a Donald Trump to show some authoritarian power,' says Maine governor]   The posters warn of ""hundreds of dollars"" in likely taxes and fees for students who register to vote, which Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, a Democrat, said is untrue because registration does not immediately trigger things such as excise taxes on a car. The debate escalated tensions that were high the day before the election, in a state where people can register to vote at the last minute. ""Democrats for decades have encouraged college students from out of state to vote in Maine, even though there is no way to determine whether these college students also voted in their home states,"" LePage said in a statement. ""Casting ballots in two different states is voter fraud, which is why Maine law requires anyone voting here to establish residency here. We welcome college students establishing residency in our great state, as long as they follow all laws that regulate voting, motor vehicles and taxes. We cannot tolerate voter fraud in our state."" LePage continued, ""After the election, we will do everything we can that is allowed under state and federal law to verify college students who voted here are following Maine law, which is clearly displayed on the Secretary of State's website.""   [Tiny Maine is getting outsize attention from Clinton and Trump]   That prompted a call from the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine asking the U.S. Justice Department to investigate. ""The governor's statement seems designed to make college students afraid to vote,"" Zachary Heiden, legal director at the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. ""Voter intimidation and harassment is illegal, and we call on the Department of Justice to investigate the intent of the governor's comments. ""College students who live in Maine have the right to vote in Maine, and they are not subject to different laws than anyone else. Many of these young people are voting for the first time in a presidential election. The governor should be encouraging that civic participation, not doing everything in his power to undermine it."" A spokesperson for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment.      Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) left a threatening voicemail full of expletives to a state lawmaker on Aug. 25. It was hardly the first or last time his words sparked controversy. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   A Bates College student, Sarah Frankie Sigman, said she and some friends noticed a young man with a bunch of fliers in the dining hall over the weekend. When she read the fliers, her immediate reaction was ""rage,"" she said Monday evening, calling from a rally at which President Obama was speaking. ""This is obviously meant to scare Bates students from voting, which is not right."" She and her friends took down more than 30 of them, she said, from the dining hall and the walls of a dorm. Sigman is from a very politically engaged family, she said, and ""the need to vote has been instilled  in me since birth."" At 19, the politics and women and gender studies major from New York will vote in her first presidential election Tuesday, and said she was upset that the fliers had caused a lot of confusion on campus. ""The false information contained in these fliers is a deliberate attempt to suppress the millennial vote,"" Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett said in a statement. ""There is nothing in Maine law that states that college students must change their driver's licenses in order to vote. ""In fact, the Secretary of State's office has made explicitly clear that a dorm can be a student's legal voting residence, and that paying out-of-state tuition does not preclude a student from voting. Maine also has same-day voter registration, so students who are not registered to vote in Maine can still register on Election Day. We urge all Bates students to spread the word to their fellow classmates about their voting rights here in Maine."" Dunlap said in a statement Monday afternoon that ""It says a great deal that these fliers have been distributed with no attribution as to who paid for them or who is responsible for their content -- which is illegal. Attempting to prevent American citizens from participating in their democratic process of self-governance through intimidation and fear is shameful, and it should be treasonable."" Dunlap said LePage's message underscores that in the fliers, and ignores the fact that the public policies around driver's licenses, vehicle registrations and taxes are not related to the right to vote. ""Sadly, his statements only inflame an atmosphere of doubt and fear among the voters. I think it speaks loudly to how powerful the individual right to vote is when there are those who would keep citizens from wielding it."" Lewiston is in the state's 2nd Congressional District, which has a tight race between an incumbent Republican and the Democrat he narrowly defeated in the 2014 election. Lewiston is very much a battleground, said Jason Savage, executive director of the Maine Republican Party. It has more registered Democrats than Republicans but is an area where the high proportion of Catholic and antiabortion Democrats has eroded traditional support for the party, he said. Savage said he wanted to make clear that the GOP had nothing to do with the fliers found at Bates. Anything the party puts out it stands behind, he said. ""We have worked hard to get our votes on campuses across the state to get out and vote, worked incredibly hard to grow our support on campuses. This hurts us.""    Maine Gov.

(Ben McCanna/Portland Press Herald via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT  LePage referred students to the secretary of state's website, and wrote in his statement, Consequences of Declaring Your Voting Residence (by Registering to Vote) in Maine * You should be aware that if you register to vote in Maine, you will be deemed to have declared residency in Maine, which may have consequences for compliance with other Maine laws, including the motor vehicle laws and tax laws. * If you drive a car in Maine, you are required to obtain a Maine driver's license within thirty days of establishing residency here. Driving without a Maine license more than ninety days after you have established residency in the state is a crime under Maine law. * If you are a resident of Maine and own a vehicle here, state law also requires you to register that vehicle in Maine within thirty days of establishing residency. By declaring Maine as your voting residence, you may be treated as a resident of Maine for income tax purposes and be subject to Maine income tax. A spokesman for the governor, Peter Steele, added in an email that the language comes directly from the secretary of state's website. ""No one is saying students have to register their car or get Maine licenses to vote. But the law is very clear. If students vote, then they have established residency in Maine and will be subject to all laws that regulate voting, motor vehicles and taxes."" U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, the Republican incumbent who is running for re-election, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Clayton Spencer, the president of Bates, said in a statement that ""this is clearly a deliberate attempt at voter suppression. We are proud of our students' interest and participation in the electoral process, and I am deeply disturbed that anyone would seek to deter their exercise of the most basic form of citizenship. We at Bates College are doing everything possible to ensure that our students have clear information about how to register and vote."" She said by phone Monday afternoon that she has heard a lot from students and faculty who were very concerned about the fliers. ""The right to vote is one of the most fundamental rights in a democratic society. It's also a civic duty."" In most cases at Bates, it will be their first opportunity to vote in a presidential election, she noted. According to a spokesman, about 90 percent of the school's 1,750 students are from out of state. There are about 26,400 registered voters in Lewiston, according to the city clerk's office there. The issue of college students voting has been an issue in Maine before, said John Baughman, an associate professor of politics at Bates. In 2011, the state Republican chairman asked the secretary of state to investigate more than 200 college students whom he said had voted illegally, but  after an investigation by the secretary of state at the time, who was Republican, no evidence of voter fraud was found. At Bates, the student population is very liberal, much more so than the community that surrounds the campus, said Baughman, (who said he studies political science in a non-partisan manner but noted in the interest of full disclosure that his wife is communications director for the Democratic caucus in the Maine state house.) That partisan imbalance has been a point of controversy, with people asking whether students who will live in the state for just a few years should have the right to vote locally. ""Of course, under Maine law they do,"" he said. Savage said the Maine GOP chairman is proposing that the two parties embark on an effort, after this election is over, to start educating students about voting on campus, ""to make sure everybody knows how to obey the law, follow the law, so this type of intimidation and scare tactics won't work."""

"  STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. -- On one level, this Detroit suburb where Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to appear Sunday evening makes plenty of political logic. It's the hub of Macomb County, with a white working-class electorate that in 1980 gave rise to the term ""Reagan Democrats."" Trump, it would seem, is looking for a boost from their economic disaffection and frustration with the effects of foreign trade. Yet Sterling Heights is also synonymous in these parts with religious tensions between one of the state's fastest-growing Muslim populations and a powerful community of Chaldean Christians, a Catholic denomination that includes thousands of people who have fled Iraq over the past decade. All of it makes Sterling Heights, the state's fourth most populous city, a reminder of what the Trump candidacy has meant for jittery Muslim Americans. The city is currently facing a federal civil rights lawsuit over its planning commission's rejection last year of a proposed mosque, which would have been the third built here since 2011. ""It is unnerving to have him here, so close,"" Syed Razvi said as he left Saturday evening prayers at the American Muslim Diversity Association mosque. ""Before Trump's candidacy, if you meet anybody around here, no problem. Now everybody's like: 'Oh, you're a Muslim. We need to stay away from them.' ""     In an election that has put American Muslims under the spotlight, three voters from different parts of the country reflect on how the political rhetoric has affected them. (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Leaming,Alice Li/The Washington Post)   Trump's appearance in Sterling Heights is part of a surprising level of attention being paid to the Wolverine State in the final throes of the 2016 presidential race. Both campaigns say the polls have tightened, and both are spending an outsize amount of time here as a result.  [The 15 states that will decide the election]  A Detroit Free Press poll published Friday had Clinton at 42 percent to Trump's 38 percent, with Trump gaining four points in the past two weeks. In addition to his scheduled appearance in Sterling Heights, Trump has also scheduled a rally in Grand Rapids on Monday. Also on the GOP side, Eric and Ivanka Trump; Trump's running mate, Mike Pence; and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin all popped in over the past few days. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who spoke in Detroit on Friday, is due in Grand Rapids on Monday. Former president Bill Clinton appears Sunday in Lansing. President Obama is scheduled to rally minority voters, which Democrats worry may not turn out in the numbers they need; he will appear in Ann Arbor on Monday, too.  [Trump in final stretch pursues new opportunities to reach 270 electoral votes]  ""To rile up his base on one of the last days before the election, I would say Macomb County is a great place for Trump to go,"" said Susan Demas, editor and publisher of Inside Michigan Politics. ""He did very well in the primary in Macomb County, and his support there has really never wavered. He's really tapped in to the anger there with white voters.""     At a rally in Detroit, Nov. 4, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton compared rival Donald Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. She uttered a bewildered laugh and shook her head after claiming Trump wants innocent people to ""be locked up."" (The Washington Post)   Sterling Heights, about 18 miles north of downtown Detroit, has long been a magnet for ethnic immigrants from various war-ravaged or oppressed regions. A century ago, many Polish immigrants set down roots here; waves of Albanians, Serbian and Macedonian emigres joined them in the 1980s and 1990s. Chaldean migrations have occurred in spurts since the 1970s. They escalated in the past decade after the fall of Saddam Hussein unleashed sectarian violence from al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Islamic State that targeted non-Muslim minorities. Chaldeans make up roughly 5 percent of Sterling Heights's population of 130,000, and the Detroit area in general is home to the most Chaldeans in the United States, according to the 2010 Census. The Detroit suburbs are also well-known for having the nation's biggest population of Arab Americans and Muslims.  [After security scare, Trump resumes battleground sprint; Clinton doubles back to Ohio]  ""There's a very strong anti-Muslim sentiment among the old-time residents and the Christian refugees from the Middle East in Sterling Heights,"" said Dawud Walid, executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""It's not just a sentiment coming from Republicans. It emanates the Reagan Democrat-type crowd."" Sterling Heights Mayor Mike Taylor (R) took umbrage at that notion, questioning the premise that Trump is actually anti-immigrant or anti-Muslim. ""There have been comments made by the Trump campaign regarding Muslims, and I understand what Muslims are concerned about with a Donald Trump presidency,"" Taylor said. ""It's been blown out of proportion. We need to be sure that the refugees are properly vetted and that they have the country's best interest. I'm confident the Muslims in Sterling Heights have the country's best interest at heart."" Perhaps, but in the parking lot at Holy Martyrs Chaldean Catholic Church on Saturday, it was not difficult to find anti-Muslim sentiment as the basis for many worshipers' support of Trump. The harshest of them, including a woman who said Muslims ""want to take over and kill us all,"" refused to give their names. A group of 12-year-olds emerging from a children's Mass were giddy when told that Trump would be visiting the Freedom Hill Amphitheater six miles away. ""Most of us want Donald Trump to win because he can defeat ISIS and let us go back to our countries,"" said Ray Poles, whose family emigrated from Iraq in the past year. ""I hope we can go see him.""  "
