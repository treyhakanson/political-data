Sasse, here are some answers to your questions about ‘paid rioting’	"   Students march through campus at the University of California at Los Angeles on Nov. 10, during a ""Love Trumps Hate"" rally in reaction to Donald Trump's presidential victory. (Frederic J. Brown/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  Sen. Ben Sasse, a freshman Republican senator from Nebraska, earned accolades from many in his party (and elsewhere) over the course of the 2016 campaign cycle thanks to his principled opposition to Donald Trump's presidential candidacy. A long Facebook note he wrote in February describing why he wouldn't support the man who went on to become his party's nominee included quotes from Trump that cast him in an unflattering light. Sasse's opposition continued through the general-election campaign. On one point, though, Sasse and Trump appear to be in agreement: Those protesting out in the streets are there because they are being paid. On Thursday morning, Sasse had some questions about the whole thing.   Why don't we have more reporting on paid rioting? Who pays for it?How much?Why?Through what orgs?Who are the ""workers""?Who recruits? -- Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) November 17, 2016   Thank you for writing, Senator! I'm happy to answer some of your questions. ""Why don't we have more reporting on paid rioting?"" Well, it's probably important that we take a step back and point out that there isn't any good evidence that the people who are protesting (and who shouldn't be called ""rioters,"" save that crew of self-described anarchists in Portland, Ore.) are actually being paid to do so. There's plenty of questionable evidence and tons of bad ""evidence"" -- but nothing to suggest that Sasse's core assumption is accurate. Yes, I've seen the bus video. Yes, I've seen the Craigslist posts. Yes, I've seen the James O'Keefe videos. I've seen all of the same little wisps of smoke that Sasse and others have, and I've written about them. The bus video is of a street where there are always buses, and there was no evidence that they were used for protests. The Craiglist posts are either fake or advertising organizing jobs. The O'Keefe videos show individual people who don't actually say that they paid anti-Trump protesters. The wisps exist because some people are certain that there's a fire. The initial assumption is that the protests must be manufactured -- the fire -- and so signs that this is the case are hunted down and tacked on. Sasse's question is a bit like asking why we don't have more reporting on the fact that the moon is preparing a superweapon with which to annex Antarctica. Now, it is absolutely the case that there are progressive organizations -- MoveOn, labor unions -- that help organize protests and opposition to any number of things. That's what organizers do. Those groups hire people to help coordinate political action, which can include protests. The organizing aspect of that is creating fliers and calling folks to try to turn them out. Often, no one shows up. Sometimes, these organizations glom onto already successful actions to take credit for them. Their goal is to make manifest existing political attitudes by getting sympathetic people to take action. That's organizing, and organizers who try to get volunteers to take those actions are paid. (Most of the Craigslist ads I saw were for these sorts of jobs, and it's mostly this work that the O'Keefe targets appear to be describing in those out-of-context comments.) The people participating in mass action don't get paid, except maybe with a T-shirt. Why? A few reasons. First, there's no need. The tens of thousands of people outside Trump Tower in New York last week were part of a city of 8 million that voted against Trump by a 3-to-1 margin. You don't need to pay people in large Democratic cities to protest; there will always be people willing to do so. Second, paying all those people would be expensive, and despite this idea that these groups are rolling in cash, they're nonprofit groups. A grant of $1 million sounds like a lot (assuming such a grant exists; this is just an example), but when you figure that organizations need rent and salaries and Internet connections and so on, there's not a lot left over. Third, paying people to attend would be fairly easy to uncover and undermine the protest in precisely the way that Trump and his allies hope to undermine last week's. The idea that Donald Trump can get 20,000 people to roll up to a rally in Alabama without raising Sasse's eyebrow but that the left would have to pay to get 10,000 people to protest Trump in Manhattan is goofy. So. Back to the senator's questions. ""Who pays for it?"" No one. ""How much?"" Nothing. ""Why?"" Like asking why the moon wants to invade. ""Through what orgs?"" None. ""Who are the 'workers'?"" They are ""regular people."" ""Who recruits?"" The Internet, mostly, based on what I heard when I talked to people at the protest I covered last week. This is admittedly a bit flip. I can't say definitively that no person received any money to protest Trump, because I haven't investigated every single person who attended every single rally. They say you can't prove a negative, which is both true and generally applicable here: I can never completely satisfy those who believe that the protests are insincere and willing to grasp at wisps of smoke as evidence of it. What's the news media's responsibility in situations like this? Should we set aside everything else and focus on an idea for which there's no immediate evidence besides rumors and innuendo? Reporters frequently spend hours and days chasing down leads that end up nowhere; I have had that happen half a dozen times this year alone. Sometimes you strike gold, such as when The Washington Post's David Fahrenthold began poking around on the Trump Foundation. Often, you come away with nothing. A slew of conservative websites have worked to dig up evidence of protesters being paid, without any luck beyond what's articulated above. Would the resources of The Post have more luck? Perhaps. But the more likely determination is that there is nothing to be found. An absence of evidence makes it less likely, not more, that a media outlet will throw resources at something. That Sasse calls the protesters ""rioters"" sort of tips his hand on this whole thing. That's the lens through which he wants to depict the almost-entirely-peaceful demonstrations that flared up after Election Day. Sasse may have opposed Trump in the primary and in the general election, but by reinforcing Trump's inaccurate (but intentional) framing of the people who have taken to the streets to express their frustration with his victory, Sasse is doing Trump a big favor now."

Forestry and Water Works Minister Veysel Eroglu told the state-run Anadolu Agency Thursday that one or more vice-presidents would assist the president under the proposed system. Eroglu says 'Turkey's legislative and executive branches would remain separate. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long sought a presidential system that would give the country's largely ceremonial presidency executive powers. Until recently, opposition parties had opposed a presidential system, fearing it would allow Erdogan to rule unchecked. The government is now engaged in talks with the country's nationalist party, which has recently suggested it could support putting a presidential system to a referendum vote in the spring.

And it’s going to get worse.	   Protesters demonstrate against President-elect Donald Trump outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia on Nov. 13. The Republican lost the popular vote by about 1 million votes but won the electoral college. (Mark Makela/Getty Images)  Donald Trump won the United States presidency with 290 votes in the electoral college. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote with 62,568,373 votes, as of Nov. 16, to President-elect Trump's 61,336,159. The electoral college has overruled the popular vote for the second time in the last five presidential elections. If all votes were weighed evenly, Clinton would have received 259 votes in the electoral college. Trump would have 256. Candidates from other parties would also have received electoral college votes.   [Without Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton might have lost Virginia as well]   The United States has faced this conflict between the electoral college and the popular vote only four times in the nation's history (five, if you include John Quincy Adams's election). But it's happening more and more often. Here's why the electoral college's results are, increasingly, diverging from the results of the popular vote. The electoral college is designed to favor sparsely populated areas. It was created to strengthen the agrarian elite, offer more federal power to slaveholding states, and counterbalance factionalism and polarization.   [Trump's election is a return to normal -- at least, in U.S. attitudes on race]   But it's not doing any of this today. Rather, the electoral college values some votes above others, while entirely disenfranchising the 4 million Americans who live in overseas territories. Every election system has to balance such goals as proportionality, stability and accountability. Elections need to legitimately translate votes into winners; winning parties need to be able to govern effectively; and elected officials need to be accountable to voters. The United States uses a simple system that is easy to understand, that helps keep the government stable, and that keeps officials accountable to the citizens who elect them. But the results are not proportional to the population. Nationally, parties often fail to win office in the same proportion that they win votes.   [The electoral college has serious problems. So do any alternatives.]   U.S. elections are winner-take-all events. Presidential elections use an indirect, majoritarian system. Winners need a majority of votes within the college, but not necessarily a majority of the people's votes. In theory, this system brings stable leadership, moderate politics  and coherent opposition. Why should this keep politics moderate? First-past-the-post elections, in which the candidate with the most votes wins, usually produce two-party systems with big-tent parties, pushing extremists to the margins. Larger parties tend to be centrist, needing to appeal to a wider segment of the population to earn votes -- although it doesn't always work that way.   [This book helps explain the surprising rise of Donald Trump]   In practice, the electoral college disenfranchises voters in more populous areas and overseas The electoral college distorts the popular vote, because small states get more votes than populous states. Each state has the same number of votes in the EC as it has representatives in Congress. Sparsely populated states have a minimum of two Senate seats and one House district, so they have at least three votes. The most populated states have a ceiling, since the number of seats in the House of Representatives does not increase. That means that even the least populous state -- Wyoming, with 586,107 residents -- gets three electoral college votes. How disproportionate is that? Consider that California, the most populous state, has 39,144,818 residents and 55 electoral college votes.   [The education gap among whites this year wasn't about education. It was about race.]   That means that in the electoral college, each individual Wyoming vote weighs 3.6 times more than an individual Californian's vote. That's the most extreme example, but if you average the 10 most populous states and compare the power of their residents' votes to those of the 10 least populous states, you get a ratio of 1 to 2.5. When the electoral college was first instituted, the ratio of vote weight from state to state was much smaller. Direct parallels are difficult to draw, given the distortions in population caused by the three-fifths compromise and the fact that many residents were not able to vote. But in the election of 1792, residents of Delaware, the least-populous state, had a vote that weighed 1.6 times that of residents of Virginia. Why is the ratio now so much more distorted? It's because Americans are, increasingly and rapidly, moving into big cities. According to the Census Bureau, urban populations increased 12 percent between 2000 and 2010. Cities are growing especially in the biggest states, where each individual vote means the least: in California, New York, North Carolina, Illinois and New Jersey. And it means the residents of the increasingly sparsely populated Southern and Midwestern states have electoral college votes that are growing in power. That distortion will be even greater in the 2020 presidential election. Most voters' votes will increasingly count for less. Or to put it more clearly, the electoral college devalues most American votes. It also disenfranchises millions. U.S. citizens and nationals in overseas territories that have no congressional representatives have no vote in the presidential election. Roughly 4 million Americans live in the United States' five permanently populated overseas territories -- and they have no voice in selecting a president. That includes Puerto Rico, the United States' most populous overseas territory, whose population is larger than that of 21 states and the District of Columbia. (D.C., with 658,893 residents, has three electoral college votes, despite its lack of congressional representation.) The U.S. presidential election system has a legitimacy crisis In 2000, Al Gore edged out George W. Bush in the national popular vote for president -- although he did so with less than a majority, gaining 48.4 percent of votes cast. And yet Bush won 271 electoral votes, while Gore won 266. This year, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in the popular vote -- although once again, neither won a majority. The electoral college was designed to help knit highly varied and independent states into a union. It guarantees legitimacy by ensuring that the president receives a majority of some body's votes. But it now distorts the popular vote in a way that disproportionately rewards those who live in scarcely populated areas, and it disenfranchises millions. More and more, the United States is likely to elect presidents who haven't won the popular vote -- awarding the presidency to a party that has no popular mandate. The compromises behind the U.S. election system are failing at their goals. Katy Collin has a PhD in international relations from American University's School of International Service.

And how your generation is going to fix everything mine screwed up.If you Google ""baby boomers are bad,"" you get hundreds of hits, including these: ""Baby boomers ruined America."" "" 'Disgusting, Selfish, Immature': 10 reasons baby boomers are the worst generation."" ""Who destroyed the economy: The case against the baby boomers."" And my favorite, ""Boomer scumbag.""  Most of these articles were written by millennials.Their argument, in general, is that boomers are responsible for all of the ills of the past 30 years, including unnecessary wars, political gridlock, economic recession followed by economic stagnation and, finally, that they are responsible for creating the toxic, miasmic ideological swamp out of which crawled the malevolence that is Donald Trump. I am here to respond.  The easy and thin-skinned response -- the Trumpian response -- would be to attack the accuser. I wouldn't even have to lie, as Trump did. I would simply point out, say, that a political awareness advocacy group recently interviewed students at George Mason University in Virginia -- millennials all -- and found that dozens of them couldn't identify either Joe Biden or Ronald Reagan from photographs. (In fairness, they didn't all completely draw a blank on the photos: One thought Biden was John McCain and two thought Reagan was Richard Nixon. All of them, however, instantly recognized Kim Kardashian.) In a separate poll , 10 percent of recent college grads believed Judith Sheindlin -- Judge Judy -- is on the U.S. Supreme Court. The fact is that those anecdotal, unscientific facts prove nothing, really, except that a certain unknown proportion of millennials -- it could be 5 percent, or 25, or every single one of you -- are entertainment-benumbed dimwits, civically disengaged to the point of treason. Also, I believe historians will find that the most significant invention by people of your generation -- as opposed to inventions by people of my generation, which include, for example, the Internet -- is the ""selfie.""    (Illustration by Eric Shansby)  But I am above that sort of calumny. Besides, it doesn't address the real question of whether your criticism of boomers is fair and accurate.I'll handle that right here. Yes. Yes, it is. We have fouled everything up for you, just as every generation, with the possible exception of our Founding Fathers, fouled everything up for the next one.  Consider the ""Greatest Generation."" Sure, they defeated the Nazis and rebuilt Europe, but they also gave birth to, and raised, my generation. How much more horribly could they have screwed up?I do understand your need to scapegoat us boomers, inasmuch as things are not going so splendidly for millennials. And for millennials, when the going gets tough, the tough get whiny. And soft. Consider the wave of unattractive uber-sensitivity afflicting your generation. And no, I am not talking about college campuses being obsessed with ""trigger warnings, ""safe spaces"" and ""micro-aggressions.""  These preoccupations seem positively stoic when compared with the newest obsession, the ethnic food holocaust. In some colleges, millennials are protesting tacos and egg rolls and falafel and other such fare that is being prepared by white people of European descent, because it is said to be appropriating the soul of other cultures. Let us all consider this, intellectually and sociologically, and barf. But really, millennials, we need not fight. I am not upset or offended by your criticism. I have only warmth in my heart for you sweet simps. I want nothing but the best for you. That is because I have just turned 65 and am in the process of applying for Social Security benefits.

The president-elect has made it clear that he is hostile to the kind of free trade deals that tend to be the focus of the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, taking place this year in Peru's capital. He's also singled out group members China and Mexico in a populist campaign standing up for displaced American workers. That has likely changed the tone and the agenda of a meeting that was expected to be part of a valedictory tour for U.S. President Barack Obama. It will be his last international summit before he leaves office Jan. 20 and those in attendance are to include Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Instead of promoting a now all-but dead trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, economic experts expect Obama will field uncomfortable questions about Trump's pledges to overhaul U.S. trade policy, crack down on illegal immigration from Mexico and withdraw from a global agreement to fight climate change.  ""World leaders like everyone else are hoping he will be more moderate in office than he was on the campaign trail,"" Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""But they are going to be worried."" APEC's 21 member-nations comprise more than a third of the world's population and half of global trade. It was established three decades ago to accelerate economic growth by removing trade barriers and helping integrate global supply chains. The group's annual summits also deal with current international challenges such as security following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, or in Paris last year or the global economic crisis of 2008. This year, the big issue is Trump.  ""As you can imagine, the issue of the day will consume a lot of the energy,"" said Scott Miller, a senior adviser to the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously advised the U.S. on APEC matters. Manufacturing has been declining in the U.S. since the 1950s and today represents less than 10 percent of employment. Despite Trump's promises to revive industry, those jobs are unlikely to return in large enough numbers, said APEC executive director Alan Bollard. At the same time, developing nations -- the biggest beneficiaries of globalization -- are more upbeat about free trade.  ""The pessimism about trade does seem to be more of a developed, affluent country phenomenon,"" Bollard said in an interview. Bollard, a former central banker in New Zealand, said world leaders haven't done a good enough job selling the benefits of globalization and cited studies that credit trade for helping lift half a billion people out of poverty in the APEC region. He said there has also been an overriding focus on manufacturing, what Bollard called the ""old wave"" of globalization, instead of helping companies in the services industry navigate complex, cross-border regulations.  ""With the advantages of electronic commerce, it's possible for small, remote businesses to be world traders in a way they never could before,"" he said. While Trump has threatened a trade war with China, vowing higher tariffs and declaring it a currency manipulator, the Asian giant has emerged as an unlikely champion of borderless buying and selling. The leaders gathering in Peru will be presented with a joint U.S.-China study ordered up in 2014 about the feasibility of a vast free trade area including all APEC members. Beijing is also promoting a regional trade partnership grouping it with 10 southeast Asian economies as well as Japan, India, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. That proposed pact has become more relevant with Trump's victory all but killing the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, which excludes China and was widely seen as an attempt by the Obama administration to keep Asian trading partners in the U.S. orbit. When it comes to U.S. trade, said Miller, Trump's actions as president seem unlikely to be as dramatic as he sounded on the campaign trail. He said 48 of the 50 states have either Canada or Mexico as their leading trade partner, which means disruptions to business from tearing up NAFTA could be politically as well as economically devastating.  ""He's a skeptic of trade agreements, and he's held that position for a long time as a private citizen,"" Miller said of Trump. ""What he has not been in a position to do is consider and then represent the broader interests of the American people. That's usually how presidents become free traders."" ___ AP Writers Joe McDonald in Beijing and Franklin Briceno and Nestor Ikeda in Lima contributed to this report.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/13/how-rural-resentment-helps-explain-the-surprising-victory-of-donald-trump/	How rural resentment helps explain the surprising victory of Donald Trump	"   (Charles Ommanney/The Washington Post)  Making sense of this presidential election requires figuring out what happened in rural places across the country. This is especially true in the Upper Midwest, where there were sharp swings toward Donald Trump that helped produce surprising victories in states such as my home state of Wisconsin. So what is going on here? A crucial part of the story is what I call ""the politics of resentment"" -- a feature of the rural Midwest that has been brewing for years. It clearly anticipates what happened on the national stage in Tuesday's election. Since May 2007, I have been studying this resentment by inviting myself into the conversations of people in dozens of communities across Wisconsin. Groups of regulars in gas stations, diners, churches and other gathering spots have allowed me to listen as they visited with one another. The typical person in these groups was a white, older male, but not exclusively so. I had not intended to study a rural-urban divide when I sampled the 27 places I had been visiting. But about a year into this project, one thing was inescapable: People in these small communities and rural places deeply resented the two main metropolitan areas of Madison, the state capital, and Milwaukee. I grew up on the northern edge of the Milwaukee metro region, but the depth and the intensity of this resentment surprised me. Simply put, the people I listened to felt like they were on the short end of the stick. They felt they were not getting their fair share of power, resources or respect. They said that the big decisions that regulated and affected their lives were made far away in the cities. They felt that no one was listening to their own ideas about how things should be done or what needed attention. They also resented the way resources were allocated. They believed that Madison sucked in all of their taxpayer dollars and spent them on itself or Milwaukee, not on their own communities. They were struggling to make ends meet, and yet all the money seemed to be going to the cities. Finally, they resented that they were not getting respect. They perceived that city folks called people like them ignorant racists who could not figure out their own interests. To them, urban types just did not get small-town life -- what people in those places value, the way they live, and the challenges they face. Onto this terrain trod Trump. And he found firm footing, just as Scott Walker did in his rise to the governorship. His message was basically this: ""You are right. You are not getting your fair share. And you should be angry about it. You work hard, you are deserving, and yet you are not getting what you should. Instead, the people currently in charge are giving some people way more than they deserve. Elect me and I'll make American great again. I'll give you back what you deserve and a way of life you are sorely missing."" For people who were feeling ignored, disrespected and overlooked by the urban elite, the Trump campaign had a strong appeal. This election has seen a protracted debate about how much support for Trump is rooted in racism. Indeed, much in American politics is, at a very basic level, about race. But to dismiss as racism the views of the people I've listened to is to ignore the key role of economic anxiety and resentment toward the white urban establishment. It also misses how racism plagues our cities, not only smaller places. The rural-urban divide in Wisconsin is in many ways a microcosm of the nation as a whole. Trump may not have known that his message would so vigorously take root in rural America. It very clearly has.
