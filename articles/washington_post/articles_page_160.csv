A group of climate-change activists lay down across an access road to the airport early Saturday. Others gathered nearby holding signs reading ""Heathrow expansion will destroy thousands of homes"" and ""Protect the planet, no more runways."" London's Metropolitan Police force says officers made 15 arrests ""for obstructing the highway and public order offences."" Last month, the British government approved plans to build a third runway at Heathrow despite concerns about air pollution, noise and the destruction of hundreds of homes. Protest group Rising Up! said the runway had been approved ""despite mass opposition from local residents and the fact that doing so is incompatible with the U.K.'s own laws on climate change.""

Court filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. The settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.

Making it even harder are today's trends toward naturalistic acting and training singers to be good colleagues and good sports -- both things that essentially undermine the kind of overblown, over-the-top performances that can make such a thing come to life. Fortunately, the Washington National Opera's ""The Daughter of the Regiment"" had Ruth Bader Ginsburg up its sleeve. The Supreme Court justice made her official opera debut on Saturday night at the Kennedy Center -- after a scattering of supernumerary roles in the past -- as the Duchess of Krakenthorp, a small spoken part.  In a fraught postelection week, the mere sight of Ginsburg was enough to spark a prolonged ovation. But Ginsburg's dialogue -- read in English, into a body mic -- was also retooled to fit the speaker and this historic moment, even if that moment might not have been quite what WNO expected when the lines were written. Talking about the illustrious past of the House of Krakenthorp (a word she delivered with a little sarcastic twist that got funnier each time she said it), she said its best members had been ""persons with open but not empty minds,"" and added, ""Is it any wonder that its most valorous leaders have been women?""  The house roared. It roared at that line; it roared when she said she needed to see the birth certificate of the heroine, Marie, before she could approve her; it roared when she turned, at Marie's joyful embrace of her future husband Tonio, and said, ""Quel scandale!"" with relish; and it roared with love at the curtain call, which she took after all the other performers -- dropping, as she did so, a most elegant little curtsy.  Ginsburg is a well-known opera lover and beloved of the audience (which also included another WNO political regular, Newt Gingrich), and everyone knew she would be among the evening's highlights. But having her steal the show, to such a degree, is arguably a problem. Relevance like this can blow a hole in the slender tissue of the entertainment that surrounds it. But it might not make such a disproportionate impact if you had real powerhouse performances in the other roles.  WNO did as well as you can do these days, especially with Lawrence Brownlee, the wonderful lyric tenor who tossed off the nine high C's of Tonio's aria ""Ah! mes amis"" as if they were no trouble at all. Brownlee's voice is growing slightly darker with time; where once it was strikingly sweet, now it rings with virility, and his pleasant stage manner conveys sweetness aplenty. Lisette Oropesa, who has kept busy at WNO this fall -- she was Susanna in ""The Marriage of Figaro"" that opened the season -- had some really lovely moments as Marie and threw herself into energetic acting, to the extent of deliberately singing badly in a scene in which her newly discovered birth mother, the Marquise of Birkenfeld (Deborah Nansteel, delightful and robust of voice) is having her taught singing and dancing to prepare her for polite society. All of this was lovely and certainly provides a fine musical distraction from the real world in Robert Longbottom's straightforward, innocuous, not-too-hammy production. Kevin Burdette, as the officer Sulpice, was the performer who seemed most to embrace the buffo tradition, enjoying snappily marching around the stage and offering a voice a couple of sizes larger than the others'. And the whole thing was supported by vital conducting by Christopher Allen, as well as an orchestra still bearing traces of its Wagner triumph last spring in the solid brass solos in the overture. It adds up to a pretty, polished evening.  Whether ""The Daughter of the Regiment"" should be played naturalistically is a separate debate. But this evening did make me think that those who say that opera singers ought to look more like the characters they are supposed to be playing may be missing the mark. Brownlee and Oropesa certainly make a visually more convincing pair of naive young lovers than, say, Luciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland, who were vocally glorious but visually a bit ridiculous. That ridiculousness, though, was actually part of the fun, as we realize when it's not there. It's not just a question of prioritizing music over acting; it's that bad acting, or mismatched casting, actually enhanced the entertainment value. That particular kind of larger-than-life buffoonery, though, has been bred right out of opera. So it remains to Ginsburg to bring in the laughs -- or remained to her, since, alas, her appearance was a one-off. The role will be taken by Cindy Gold in the rest of the performances (through Nov. 20). This lighthearted cream puff of a piece will still be a welcome diversion.  "

The president-elect is at work on identifying appointees for his new administration. Both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani have been floated as possibilities for the role of attorney general. Neither appointment would serve the work we most need at the Justice Department: a restoration of impartiality, fairness, nonpartisanship and thoroughgoing avoidance of conflicts and the appearance of conflict. A Christie aide and an appointee have just been convicted in the ""Bridgegate"" scandal over the closing of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, N.J. Christie, who was not himself indicted, claims he did not know about the lane closings, but three people contradicted him under oath: Bridget Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff when the closings occurred; Bill Baroni, a top Christie appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; and David Wildstein, a political ally of the governor and also a senior official at the Port Authority at the time of the scandal. According to the New York Times, ""It was impossible for even casual trial observers not to discern, from witness after witness, the evident viciousness and grubbiness of the governor and his administration.""  Kelly and Baroni were found guilty on all charges of fraud, conspiracy and depriving the residents of Fort Lee of their civil rights.  Wildstein, who pleaded guilty in 2015,  testified that the purpose of the lane closings was to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for refusing to endorse Christie's reelection bid. According to the Times, Wildstein testified that Christie laughed when told of Sokolich's frustration over the traffic.  Earlier in the scandal, in an effort of self-protection, Christie commissioned what the Times called, ""a friendly Bridgegate investigation by Randy Mastro, a former aide to Mr. Giuliani.""  The attorney general must embody impartiality, integrity and public service. Christie does not. Then we have Giuliani, who boasted during the final days of the election that he had inside access to the FBI. Matt Zapotosky reviewed for The Post precisely what Giuliani said and concluded that ""Giuliani is claiming to have known not of the development in the Clinton email case, but of frustration over the Clinton Foundation matter."" But the conversations reveal close, and possibly problematic, involvement with a bureau that appears to be politicized. Also, during the campaign, to advance the cause of candidate Trump, Giuliani frequently offered prejudgments about criminal guilt on the part of Hillary Clinton. For instance, in a statement on the subject of the Clinton Foundation, Giuliani said: ""It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office; they sold access and specific actions for money. This makes a mockery of her promise to Congress and the president to keep the Clinton Foundation and the State Department entirely separate. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton family racketeering enterprise.""  The legal views Giuliani expressed here were fully entangled with his political goals; no stable justice system can be built on such a starting point. The attorney general must avoid not only conflicts of interest but also all appearances of a conflict of interest. The attorney general must be equipped to embody and protect the impartiality of investigations and decisions to prosecute. On all these counts, Giuliani has already disqualified himself for this role. In his acceptance speech, Trump said this:      Following a New York Times report alleging that Donald Trump could have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Oct. 2 said Trump's handling of tax laws was ""genius."" (The Washington Post)   ""I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.""  Here's a piece of guidance then: We need to de-politicize the judicial branch to preserve our constitutional fabric, so don't appoint Christie or Giuliani to the role of attorney general. Appoint a nonpartisan legal figure with a deep record for integrity and public service, who is squeaky clean with regard to conflicts and the appearance of conflict. We need such an appointment to de-politicize the Justice Department and the FBI. Only such an appointment will make it clear that the Justice Department will protect liberty and justice for all Americans. There could be no more important early signal for the president-elect to send.

"       Asra Q. Nomani is a Muslim, an immigrant, a woman and a Trump supporter. Here's why this long-time liberal voted for Donald Trump. (Video: WUSA9 / Photo: Asra Nomani)   Asra Q. Nomani is a former Wall Street Journal reporter and a co-founder of the Muslim Reform Movement. She can be found on Twitter at @AsraNomani. A lot is being said now about the ""silent secret Trump supporters."" This is my confession -- and explanation: I -- a 51-year-old, a Muslim, an immigrant woman ""of color"" -- am one of those silent voters for Donald Trump. And I'm not a ""bigot,"" ""racist,"" ""chauvinist"" or ""white supremacist,"" as Trump voters are being called, nor part of some ""whitelash."" In the winter of 2008, as a lifelong liberal and proud daughter of West Virginia, a state born on the correct side of history on slavery, I moved to historically conservative Virginia only because the state had helped elect Barack Obama as the first African American president of the United States. But, then, for much of this past year, I have kept my electoral preference secret: I was leaning toward Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Tuesday evening, just minutes before the polls closed at Forestville Elementary School in mostly Democratic Fairfax County, I slipped between the cardboard partitions in the polling booth, a pen balanced carefully between my fingers, to mark my ballot for president, coloring in the circle beside the names of Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence.      Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump rejoiced across the nation on Election Night as their candidate defied the polls. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   After Hillary Clinton called Trump to concede, making him America's president-elect, a friend on Twitter wrote a message of apology to the world, saying there are millions of Americans who don't share Trump's ""hatred/division/ignorance."" She ended: ""Ashamed of millions that do."" That would presumably include me -- but it doesn't, and that is where the dismissal of voter concerns about Clinton led to her defeat. I most certainly reject the trifecta of ""hatred/division/ignorance."" I support the Democratic Party's position on abortion, same-sex marriage and climate change. [Did you vote for Donald Trump? Tell us why.]  But I am a single mother who can't afford health insurance under Obamacare. The president's mortgage-loan modification program, ""HOPE NOW,"" didn't help me. Tuesday, I drove into Virginia from my hometown of Morgantown, W.Va., where I see rural America and ordinary Americans, like me, still struggling to make ends meet, after eight years of the Obama administration. Finally, as a liberal Muslim who has experienced, first-hand, Islamic extremism in this world, I have been opposed to the decision by President Obama and the Democratic Party to tap dance around the ""Islam"" in Islamic State. Of course, Trump's rhetoric has been far more than indelicate and folks can have policy differences with his recommendations, but, to me, it has been exaggerated and demonized by the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, their media channels, such as Al Jazeera, and their proxies in the West, in a convenient distraction from the issue that most worries me as a human being on this earth: extremist Islam of the kind that has spilled blood from the hallways of the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai to the dance floor of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.      Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Nihad Awad, addressed the media following Donald Trump's election win Nov. 9. Awad said the group accepted the outcome of the election and reassured U.S. Muslims that America is their home. (Reuters)   In mid-June, after the tragic shooting at Pulse, Trump tweeted out a message, delivered in his typical subtle style: ""Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!"" Around then, on CNN's ""New Day,"" Democratic candidate Clinton seemed to do the Obama dance, saying, ""From my perspective, it matters what we do more than what we say. And it mattered we got bin Laden, not what name we called him. I have clearly said we -- whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism, I'm happy to say either. I think they mean the same thing."" By mid-October, it was one Aug. 17, 2014, email from the WikiLeaks treasure trove of Clinton emails that poisoned the well for me. In it, Clinton told aide John Podesta: ""We need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL,"" the politically correct name for the Islamic State, ""and other radical Sunni groups in the region."" The revelations of multimillion-dollar donations to the Clinton Foundation from Qatar and Saudi Arabia killed my support for Clinton. Yes, I want equal pay. No, I reject Trump's ""locker room"" banter, the idea of a ""wall"" between the United States and Mexico and a plan to ""ban"" Muslims. But I trust the United States and don't buy the political hyperbole -- agenda-driven identity politics of its own -- that demonized Trump and his supporters. I gently tried to express my thoughts on Twitter but the ""Pantsuit revolution"" was like a steamroller to any nuanced discourse. If you supported Trump, you had to be a redneck.   [Why this Frenchman plans to resist President Trump -- by becoming a U.S. citizen]   Days before the election, a journalist from India emailed me, asking: What are your thoughts being a Muslim in ""Trump's America""? I wrote that as a child of India, arriving in the United States at the age of 4 in the summer of 1969, I have absolutely no fears about being a Muslim in a ""Trump America."" The checks and balances in America and our rich history of social justice and civil rights will never allow the fear-mongering that has been attached to candidate Trump's rhetoric to come to fruition. What worried me the most were my concerns about the influence of theocratic Muslim dictatorships, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia, in a Hillary Clinton America. These dictatorships are no shining examples of progressive society with their failure to offer fundamental human rights and pathways to citizenship to immigrants from India, refugees from Syria and the entire class of de facto slaves that live in those dictatorships. We have to stand up with moral courage against not just hate against Muslims, but hate by Muslims, so that everyone can live with sukhun, or peace of mind, I finished in my reflections to the journalist in India. He didn't get the email. I didn't resend it, afraid of the wrath I'd receive. But, then, I voted.      $(function(){SubmissionPlatform.services.displayForm(""5824e62aaeeddccd05b2e5f7"",""prod"")}); "

Mikulskiâ€™s replacement	" ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland voters stood in long lines Tuesday to decide whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump will win Maryland's 10 electoral votes, and they also voted to pick the replacement for one of the state's most popular politicians: Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring after 30 years in the U.S. Senate. The state's congressional seats also are on the ballot, with all incumbents seeking re-election. Polls opened across the state at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. Three polling places in Baltimore opened late, but Maryland's elections Administrator Linda Lamone said she had not heard of any other problems around the state. The Baltimore polling places that opened late did so by only a few minutes, Lamone said. Social services worker Sebiina Odin, 56, an African-American Democrat, said she voted for Hillary Clinton partly because she seems thoughtful and patient.  ""She thinks about what she says before it actually comes out of her mouth,"" Odin said after casting her ballot at an elementary school in Hagerstown. Sam Hyde, a 20-year-old Annapolis resident voting in his first election, said he cast his ballot for Trump.  ""I think it's really time that America needs kind of a big bombastic leader to start taking charge again,"" Hyde said. Polls have shown Clinton with a big lead over Trump in Maryland, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1. Maryland is traditionally a blue state. Democrats have won Maryland in the past six presidential races. George Bush was the last Republican to win Maryland, 28 years ago in 1988. Voters also will choose who will fill a rarely open Senate seat. Van Hollen, a seven-term Democrat, is running against Del. Kathy Szeliga, a Republican and the minority whip in the House of Delegates. Van Hollen has run as an experienced lawmaker willing to reach across the political aisle to do important work. Szeliga has worked to use that experience against him, casting him as an insider of dysfunctional Washington. Maryland residents also will vote for the state's eight U.S. House members. All of the incumbents are running for re-election. With heavy turnout anticipated, Maryland's House incumbents are expected to be safe. Maryland has seven Democrats and one Republican in the House. Baltimore will choose a new mayor. State Sen. Cathy Pugh, a Democrat, is running against Republican Alan Walden in the heavily Democratic city. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Here are some myths about its culture and power.   Myth No. 1 The FBI isn't political. One of J. Edgar Hoover's first acts when he became director of the FBI in 1924 was to clean house of the bureau's political appointees -- and ever since, directors have proudly bragged that the FBI is completely nonpartisan. It's simply a ""fact-finding agency,"" Hoover often promised. This summer, Comey himself assured that the Clinton server investigation had been conducted ""in an entirely apolitical and professional way.""  But while the FBI may technically be nonpartisan, it has long been one of the most politically astute institutions in the government. Its files have regularly been deployed as political weapons, from the 1948 election -- in which Hoover backed Thomas Dewey over Harry Truman -- to Watergate, where leaks from then-Deputy Director Mark Felt helped bring down Richard Nixon. Moreover, the bureau spent much of the 20th century as something akin to America's ""morality police,"" shifting resources decade by decade to combat perceived threats to the nation's social fabric, from Harlem Renaissance authors in the 1930s to antiwar activists in the 1960s to ""deadbeat dads"" in the 1990s. During his 48-year tenure, Hoover used the power of the traditionally conservative bureau to cozy up to powerful politicians and to bludgeon, publicly and privately, civil rights leaders, political dissidents, gays and especially communists.  Comey has made a point to try to stand against that era: FBI recruits visit the Holocaust Memorial Museum to understand, Comey has said, ""in a palpable, nauseating and gut-wrenching way, the consequences of the abuse of power on a massive scale."" He's ordered new recruits to learn about the bureau's history with the Rev. Martin Luther King, whom Hoover tried to blackmail into giving up his efforts. But the bureau (and particularly its director) retains a black belt in behind-the-scenes political judo: It skillfully navigated the politics of the 9/11 Commission, halting a move to break it apart following its failure to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks. It uses its reputation for integrity, moral authority and justice to push presidents and lawmakers to back its programs and budget requests. Presidents know: You don't want to be on your FBI director's bad side. Myth No. 2 The FBI director can't be fired. While many national security roles, such as CIA director, typically turn over at the beginning of a presidential term, the FBI directorship over the past 40 years has been seen as an apolitical post. Ever since director-for-life Hoover died in May 1972, FBI chiefs have been appointed to a congressionally mandated, nonrenewable 10-year term. When Comey's predecessor, Robert Mueller, reached the end of that term, President Obama asked him to stay an additional two years -- a move that required a special act of Congress.  But that fixed term doesn't limit how or why a president can remove an FBI director, and, according to U.S. law, a firing doesn't have to be ""for cause."" When Bill Clinton took office in 1993, Director William Sessions was already under siege for mismanagement. A scathing 161-page inspector general report said he misused government transportation and engaged in other abuses of his office. Clinton, with the recommendation of Attorney General Janet Reno, fired Sessions outright after the director refused to resign.  Myth No. 3 The White House controls the FBI director. The FBI is part of the Justice Department, so technically the director reports up through the attorney general and to the White House itself -- which is why this summer's ""social"" meeting on the tarmac at a Phoenix airport between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch raised alarms about whether they'd struck an ""inside deal"" not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. Similar questions were sparked by President Obama's comments to ""60 Minutes"" that seemed to prejudge the investigation's outcome, when he said that he didn't think her server was a ""national security problem.""  But the FBI, which runs public-corruption and espionage investigations, operates with nearly unprecedented independence within the executive branch, especially when it comes to political inquiries. Past attorneys general have almost always deferred to the bureau -- a habit that repeatedly rankled Reno during the 1990s, when Director Louis Freeh called their frequent battles ""the worst-kept secret in Washington."" Top Justice Department officials didn't want Comey to inform Congress of the new Clinton inquest before the election, but he did it anyway. An FBI director's perceived mantle of integrity can be a powerful bureaucratic weapon. In 2004, when Comey was deputy attorney general and provoked a showdown with the George W. Bush White House over the legality of the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program, he enlisted the help of Mueller. Comey has said he knew that if he alone threatened to resign, he might fail, but if Mueller threatened to join him, the White House would be forced to revise the program. The gambit worked. Myth No. 4 The FBI had been trying to help Hillary Clinton. After Comey announced in July that the FBI didn't think the former secretary of state had committed any crime with her email server, critics blasted him for letting her off the hook, GOP congressmen summoned him to the Hill to explain himself, and Donald Trump said the FBI was corrupt.  In fact, the bureau is decidedly not Clinton territory; a Guardian article this past week quoted an agent as saying it's ""Trumpland."" Generally, in my reporting, I've found agents to be conservative, and there's probably no political family in America with whom the bureau has had a worse relationship than the Clintons. The first best-selling anti-Clinton tell-all -- a now-hefty publishing genre -- came from an FBI agent, Gary Aldrich, posted to the White House in the 1990s, who trashed the family in ""Unlimited Access .""  The relationship only went downhill from there. After firing Sessions, Bill Clinton appointed Freeh as his FBI director, calling him a ""law enforcement legend,"" only to see Freeh dedicate much of the rest of the 1990s to investigating him for scandals from Filegate to Whitewater to Monica Lewinsky. Freeh even gave back his White House visitor pass to ensure that no one thought he was too cozy with the president, and he told one reporter that he and Clinton didn't speak for the final three years of the administration, a time when the threat of terrorism was rising around the world. The antipathy was mutual: According to Bob Woodward's book ""Shadow,"" President Clinton used expletives to describe Freeh behind closed doors.      The Post's Matt Zapotosky explains why FBI Director James Comey informed lawmakers Friday that the bureau would examine newly discovered emails linked to Hillary Clinton. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Myth No. 5 The new probe didn't need to be revealed before the election. Numerous critics, including almost 100 former prosecutors, have argued that Comey -- who announced that the bureau had begun looking into Clinton's emails again less than two weeks before Election Day -- should have tried harder not to affect the election. They pointed to Comey's own argument that the United States shouldn't accuse Russia of meddling in the election until officials were sure about what they'd found, and to Justice Department practices to keep mum about ongoing investigations.  According to his aides in multiple news reports this past week, Comey thought the news would probably have leaked anyway, making the bureau look even more like it was protecting Clinton. While most FBI offices are tight-lipped and unlikely to hint of an unfolding investigation, the New York field office -- the bureau's largest and most powerful, and home to the investigation of Anthony Weiner that uncovered the new laptop -- is notoriously leaky and hard for an FBI director to control. Field offices in general operate with a great deal of independence, able to adjust resources to respond to local threats or problems. But every FBI director has struggled in particular to control the New York office, one of just three sites -- along with the Washington and Los Angeles offices -- led by an assistant director. Agents in cities across the country worry about their cases leaking out of New York, they tell me. The 2009 Najibullah Zazi terrorism investigation, for instance, was worked quietly for days by the FBI in Denver, only to leak almost the moment Zazi arrived in New York to execute his attack.   garrett.graff@gmail.com   Five myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

Hereâ€™s how to fix it.	"   Copies of President Obama's Fiscal Year 2017 Budget at the Government Publishing Office in Washington. (Pete Marovich/Bloomberg)  +How can the next president improve the uncooperative atmosphere in Washington?  So far, the ""The Missing Debate"" has covered a wide range of policy imperatives, from the future of the Federal Reserve to housing policy to K-12 education. While we've discussed a wide range of potential solutions, we're under no illusion that they are likely to make headway in Washington's current political climate. When this vicious electoral season comes to a close, we're likely to be left with a further divided government and an increasingly polarized electorate. Perhaps the biggest question regarding any policy agenda is whether there is any hope for lawmakers to break through the dysfunction that has paralyzed Congress over the past few years. For that reason, the final question of the series focuses on reforms that could improve relations between the two parties and make lawmakers more willing to cooperate and pass needed legislation. What is the one most important reform the next administration and Congress should champion to improve the political atmosphere in Washington?    Reid Ribble is a Republican congressman representing Wisconsin's 8th congressional district. The details of budget process policy aren't usually exciting enough to make it onto the evening news, but they are an extremely important part of our federal political system. In fact, reforming the way we conduct our budgeting from an annual to an every-other-year process could be an essential tool for reducing gridlock in Washington. It would remove budgeting from election years and ensure that spending our nation's money does not become a political football. Unfortunately, this discussion has been completely absent in the 2016 election discussions You show me your budget, and I will tell you what your priorities are. The same is true for members of Congress when determining how to spend taxpayer dollars: We fight to spend money on the priorities of the people we represent, and we are judged by how we vote on spending bills. In order to budget the nation's money, Congress is required to pass a budget specifying our overall spending cap and then 12 appropriations bills every year, roughly one bill to fund each federal agency. This process is meant to stretch over the year with each bill's merits debated in public, and then voted on by Congress so that constituents can easily understand what their representatives are prioritizing.   [Let's shine some light on dark money]   However, the process very rarely works that way, and in election years, it's even worse -- we have failed to pass a budget altogether in three-quarters of the past eight election years. In order to fill the gap and avoid a government shutdown, Congress usually passes short-term funding bills that are negotiated behind closed doors by congressional leadership. These funding measures roll all spending provisions into a single vote, can be thousands of pages long, and usually can't be amended by members of Congress, who often have only 24 hours to read them. This effectively silences the voices of millions of Americans by denying their representatives the opportunity to work on their behalf. This is a failure to govern, and it's inexcusable. Many reforms have been suggested to improve the process, but none has garnered more bipartisan support -- or total support -- than my Biennial Budgeting and Enhanced Oversight Act. The bill would change our broken annual budget system to an every-other-year budget process. By switching to a biennial budgeting system, we would finally remove budgeting from election years. Instead, Congress would spend the second year in each biennium conducting the detailed oversight of government agencies and programs that is currently being neglected. Having a two-year budget would encourage transparency and cost savings by allowing federal agencies to plan ahead and budget money over a longer term. Perhaps more importantly, it would significantly reduce the brinkmanship of shutdown politics, which has become all too common in recent years. This brinkmanship has harmed our political system, our economy and our international reputation, and it is well past time for it to end. Biennial budgeting reform is supported by both a Republican majority in Congress and a Democratic executive branch. People across the political spectrum agree the budget process is broken, but there has been absolutely no debate in this election season about how we dice up trillions of dollars each year. I would suggest that we start by debating the solutions like biennial budgeting that already have broad support.  Read more: Jason Grumet: Bring back earmarks Ellen L. Weintraub: How to fix Congress?
