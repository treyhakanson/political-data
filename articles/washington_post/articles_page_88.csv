"   Melania Trump and Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention. (Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters)  Any president provides endless material to late-night television hosts -- but President-elect Donald Trump is already a special case. All bets are off for any boundaries, from the straightforward (Seth Meyers called him ""a racist and a liar"") to the creative (Samantha Bee dubbed him a ""crotch-fondling slab of rancid meatloaf."") Since the election, late-night comedians have doubled down on their Trump content, including many jokes tinged with actual concern for America. Some hosts also appear to be ramping up their shots at Trump's wife, Melania. Comedians often incorporate presidential spouses in their material, but will the vitriol toward Trump also extend to the first lady? Just how far will late-night hosts go with Melania jokes?   [Late-night TV hosts react to Trump's presidency with disbelief, lots of jokes]   Generally, comedians tread carefully around the members of the first family, especially if it's clear they did not sign up for life in the spotlight. ""I don't like Barbara Bush jokes,"" former ""Tonight Show"" host Jay Leno told the Deseret News in 1992, in the last year of George H.W. Bush's presidency. ""She just happens to be a nice woman married to someone in the public eye."" Leno added that his predecessor, Johnny Carson, also would never target an elected official's wife -- ""unless it's Nancy Reagan, who's running the government."" Melania Trump couldn't be further from a political spouse, as she mostly stayed off the campaign trail to stay home with her 10-year-old son, Barron. But she provided fodder for comedy at her most significant appearance: her controversial speech at the Republican National Convention in July, when it was revealed that several passages were cribbed from a Michelle Obama speech. (The incident prompted Stephen Colbert to invite actress Laura Benanti onto to show to impersonate Melania.)   [Laura Benanti on impersonating Melania Trump, tweeting about politics and her SNL dreams]      Donald Trump appears with his wife, Melania, at an NBC town hall. (Peter Foley/European Pressphoto Agency)  The Melania Trump late-night jokes were plentiful this past week and mostly fall into three categories: the plagiarism incident, how her immense wealth makes her out of touch and speculation that she is repulsed by her husband. A sample: Jimmy Kimmel: ""Poor Melania, I've been thinking about her a lot today. She had it made. Except for the part where Donald Trump climbed on top of her between four and seven times a month, she had it made."" Meyers: ""According to new research, with a guided meditation process called erotic hypnosis, it may be possible to experience a 'touch-free' orgasm. 'Let's try it,' said Melania."" Bee, on Trump's speech in which he said hair spray in a sealed apartment couldn't affect the ozone layer: ""I don't know what's more disturbing: that he believes what he's saying or that his apartment is sealed. Probably because he caught Melania trying to escape.""    Jimmy Fallon: ""So Michelle actually had a nice time showing Melania around, although it got weird when they walked into the Lincoln Bedroom and Melania said, 'Wow, what a lovely closet.'"" Four hosts -- Fallon, Kimmel, James Corden and Trevor Noah -- all did virtually the same bit about Melania and Michelle Obama's meeting at the White House last week, with Melania repeating the first lady's phrases. (Kimmel: ""It went something like this: Michelle said, 'Welcome to the White House, Mrs. Trump,' and Melania said, 'Welcome to the White House, Mrs. Trump.'"") Colbert noted that ""future first lady Melania was there for a private meeting with Michelle Obama to ensure the peaceful transition of speeches."" It's a stark contrast to some of the mild jabs over the years about Michelle Obama, poking fun at her health initiative (Fallon: ""A year ago, Michelle Obama started her campaign to end childhood obesity called 'Let's Move.' I think Americans have been very clear in their answer: no."") or using her to make fun of President Obama (Conan O'Brien: ""His popularity is so low that he's running on the slogan 'I'm Michelle Obama's husband.'"")   [Melania Trump and Michelle Obama carry on an awkward tradition, too]   Similarly, in the early 2000s, comedians made fun of George W. Bush through his wife, Laura. Jay Leno: ""First lady Laura Bush will deliver a speech about the joys of reading. And then President Bush will give the rebuttal."" David Letterman: ""Happy birthday to first lady Laura Bush. Laura is 60 years old. It's honestly nice to see a Bush with numbers going up."" O'Brien: ""People magazine named Laura Bush as one of the 50 most beautiful people and President Bush is quoted as saying he already knew that. ... The president's exact quote was: 'I don't need People magazine to tell me what's going on. I need Dick Cheney to tell me what's going on.'"" Typically, comedians are toughest when the spouse is very involved in the campaign, as Nancy Reagan was. At the beginning of Ronald Reagan's first term, in 1981, when she drew criticism in Washington for spending thousands of dollars on clothing and china at the White House, Carson joked about how her favorite junk food was caviar. The first lady who received harshest jokes was, as it happens, Hillary Clinton. Throughout Bill Clinton's years in the Oval Office in the 1990s, topics ranged from the Whitewater real estate scandal (Letterman: Hillary Clinton ""made a beautiful holiday wreath out of shredded Whitewater documents."") to her husband's infidelity (Leno: ""She said Bill and her had a long stretch in their marriage where he was faithful. I think it was called the honeymoon."") and their relationship (O'Brien: ""Hillary Clinton testified before Ken Starr. ... Reportedly, this time she broke down and admitted to having a sexual relationship with President Clinton."") Which way will Melania fall? Although the late-night hosts may be a bit preoccupied with jokes about Donald Trump, it's clear they won't hold back on her, regardless of how they treated other first ladies. As Leno said in 2002 when The Washington Post asked him why he went after Hillary Clinton but held back on Laura Bush, he explained it in a simple phrase: ""They're two different people.""      President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet appointments have caused a stir so far, and late-night comedians Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Samantha Bee and others have a lot to say.

(Reuters)   CLAY, W.Va. -- Officials in this tiny West Virginia town are fighting for their community's reputation following a nationwide uproar over racist comments about Michelle Obama that prompted the mayor to resign. Mayor Beverly Whaling, who had commented approvingly on a Facebook post comparing the first lady to an ape, turned in her letter of resignation Tuesday. Joe Coleman, the town recorder, said the resignation was effective immediately; officials here are now scrambling to replace the mayor, who had three years left on her term. Whaling resigned a day after the director of a government-funded nonprofit was removed from her position amid the backlash over her Facebook post. After Donald Trump's election as president, Pamela Ramsey Taylor, who was director of the Clay County Development Corp., took to social media to comment on the upcoming shift from Obama to Melania Trump, writing: ""It will be so refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady back in the White House."" She added: ""I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels."" NBC affiliate WSAZ reported that Whaling, the mayor, then replied, ""Just made my day Pam.""   [A man in KKK robes waved a Trump flag at a bonfire in Connecticut, police say]   The comments were later deleted -- as were both women's Facebook pages, according to reports -- but images of Taylor's post and the mayor's response had already gone viral.      A non-profit director in Clay, W.Va., is facing backlash after reportedly posting a Facebook message about first lady Michelle Obama. ""It will be so refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady back in the White House. I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels,"" the post reportedly said. (WSAZ NewsChannel 3)   Taylor was placed on leave from her position at the government nonprofit, which uses state and federal funds to provide services to elderly and low-income residents, according to the Associated Press. But a representative at the organization told The Washingon Post that the board ""removed"" Taylor from her position. The social media comments drew ire across the country and on the Internet pulling this quiet central West Virginia town and its residents into the center of a nationwide firestorm. Joshua Shamblin, a former council member, said Tuesday that ""the county is sorry that this has been placed upon everyone instead of just the few who made hurtful remarks."" He said local officials were ""shocked"" by the incident but were preparing to push past it. At a previously scheduled meeting Tuesday night, council members condemned the comments and accepted Whaling's resignation. But they also urged outsiders to understand that the incident was not reflective of the community. ""Come see us,"" council member Joyce Gibson said, according to the Associated Press. ""Spend a day with us. If I knew you would come, I would bake a cake. We're very decent people.""    Jason Hubbard of Clay, W.Va., (seated) issues a public apology on behalf of the town council following the resignation of Beverly Whaling as mayor. (Lexi Browning/For The Washington Post)  Another council member, Jason Hubbard, publicly apologized to the first lady on behalf of Clay, according to the AP. But, Hubbard said, ""please don't judge the entire community for one or two individual acts."" Whaling did not attend the Tuesday meeting. But in a statement sent to The Post, she apologized: ""My comment was not intended to be racist at all. I was referring to my day being made for change in the White House! I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused! Those who know me know that I'm not of any way racist! Again, I would like to apologize for this getting out of hand!"" By Wednesday morning, more than 175,000 people had signed an online petition that, for days, has been calling for the two women to be fired. The council now has the immediate task to name a new mayor to complete three years left on Whaling's term. ""She was a good mayor, I thought, and she knew how to get things done,"" Gibson said, according to the AP. ""It's just a shame that this has happened. But, you know, there could be good things come out of it.""   [Police officer who drove with Confederate flag at 'Love Trumps Hate' rally resigns]   Taylor could not be reached for comment, but WSAZ reported that she had also issued an apology. The station reported that Taylor said she understood why her post may have been interpreted as racist, but that was not her intention. She said she was referring to her own opinion about the first lady's attractiveness, not about the color of her skin, according to the news station. Taylor also reportedly told WSAZ that the heated public response to her Facebook post had become a ""hate crime against me,"" saying that she and her children had received death threats. Taylor said she was planning to file a lawsuit against people who had slandered or libeled her amid the uproar, according to the news station. There is a long and ugly history of comparing black people to apes. ""In the 19th century and well into the 20th, popular media from movies to fiction to political cartoons frequently portrayed blacks as more simian than human,"" social psychologists Phillip Atiba Goff and Jennifer L. Eberhardt wrote in the Los Angeles Times. ""It was an association that provided cover for slavery itself, as well as anti-black violence. Lynchings in the United States were often justified by relying on this dehumanizing association, and it surfaced in the Rodney King controversy in Los Angeles: LAPD Officer Laurence Powell had referred to a black couple as 'something right out of 'Gorillas in the Mist' moments before he was involved in the King beating,"" they wrote. ""Like nooses, the 'N-word' and white sheets, referring to blacks as apelike is among the most violent and hurtful legacies of our nation's difficult racial past."" Racist ape memes have surfaced repeatedly around the Obamas. Several years ago, the Awl catalogued them in a piece called ""Primate in Chief: A Guide to Racist Obama Monkey Photoshops."" The town of Clay has approximately 467 residents, according to a 2015 census estimate. The estimated population of Clay County is 8,910. Two-tenths of 1 percent of Clay County's residents are African American, according to census data. More than three-quarters of the presidential votes cast in the county went to Trump. Officials and local residents have tried to make sense of the Facebook comments and the intense backlash. At the council meeting, Clay Sheriff Garrett Samples said he did not think the post was meant to be racist. ""It wasn't necessarily a joke, but it was stupid,"" he said. ""I've never heard either of them say anything racial before."" Tina Goode, a town clerk, said: ""It wasn't right, what was posted. We're not like that. They are good women, and I don't think they meant anything by it. We're not a racist town."" Goode said she believed that Hillary Clinton's supporters were responsible for making the post go viral. Katie Payne, 16, who is black, said she was surprised by the reaction because ""normally when people say things like that around here, it's swept under the rug."" The teen's grandmother, Doris Neal, said the post was ""disgusting,"" but was not the first time something like this has happened. ""Katie's come home several times with complaints of [peers'] racist remarks,"" she said. ""One time, when she ran for student body president they teased her about buying watermelons."" Lish Greiner, a native of Parkersburg, W.Va., who lives in Belpre, Ohio, drove two hours to go to the meeting. ""I came tonight to say that I refuse to tolerate any hate and hateful rhetoric,"" she said. ""Any person in a position of power should not be able to spread this hateful rhetoric.""

If only there were something they could have done!	"      The Fix's Chris Cillizza explains how Donald Trump beat expectations in rural areas and among Latino and black voters, propelling him to a surprising election win. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Of America's 320 million-odd residents, only about three-quarters are eligible to vote (mostly because they're over the age of 18). Of the group that could vote in the presidential election, the U.S. Election Project's Michael McDonald estimates that about 58.1 percent did -- meaning that 41.9 percent of eligible Americans didn't vote last week. Using the most recent national splits from the Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman, that means that Donald Trump was elected president with the support of fewer than 1 in 5 Americans.     So be it. That's the system. You vote; you shape the government. You stay home, you don't. The Post partnered with the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University to survey Americans in the wake of last week's voting. Among the questions we asked was a simple one: How do you feel about the election of Donald Trump as president? It was an open-ended question, and we noted what people said in response.     The most common sentiment was happiness and excitement, followed by those who indicated that they were upset. Many said they were hopeful (in one way or another); many expressed that they thought the results were terrible or that they were scared or worried about the result. The graph above groups responses by type, but the overall most common reply we heard was ""disappointed"" (which fits into that ""upset"" category). Of course, the responses varied depending on who we were asking.     Trump voters were much more likely to be happy and hopeful; Clinton backers more likely to be upset, scared and shocked. Not hugely surprising. But then we also broke out responses from those who didn't even bother voting.     It's a small sample size, but the responses were more evenly distributed. More nonvoters said they thought the results were terrible than expressed happiness about them, for example. To which I say: Are you kidding me? Some people aren't able to vote on Election Day because they're working or have some sort of emergency that prevents their doing so. Those people are excused from the following critique. For those who were eligible to vote but chose not to: Your opinion is bad. Voting is the price of admission for complaining about the results. Nothing's stopping you from complaining, of course; the First Amendment protects complaints more than anything else, really. But don't roll up to America and say ""you made a bad choice"" after not weighing in on that choice. It's like showing up to dinner with a group of friends an hour in and complaining about what they ordered. Tough luck, man; eat your liver.

The ICC is one of a number of international courts set up since the end of World War II to prosecute war crimes and other atrocities in conflicts around the world. Here is a rundown of some of the various courts and tribunals meting out international and local justice: ___ INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT Established in 2002, the Hague-based ICC is the world's first permanent criminal court with a global reach. It was set up to prosecute suspects considered the most responsible for the worst crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. It currently has 124 member states, although three African nations recently announced plans to quit. The U.S., Russia, China and Syria are among countries that haven't signed up to the court. So far, all of the court's trials have focused on crimes in Africa, but the court is conducting preliminary probes around the world, including the examination of allegations of atrocities in Afghanistan and the use of harsh interrogation techniques there by U.S. forces and the CIA that a prosecution report says may amount to war crimes. ____ NUREMBERG and TOKYO TRIBUNALS The two tribunals set up by the victorious allies after World War II laid the foundation for modern international tribunals. They prosecuted political and military leaders from Germany's Nazi regime and Japan's wartime establishment. Unlike more recent tribunals, which seek to prosecute crimes committed by all sides in conflicts, the Nuremburg and Tokyo courts only indicted suspects from the losing sides. ____ INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA Based in a former insurance company office in The Hague, the U.N. court was set up to prosecute the worst atrocities of the wars that erupted as Yugoslavia crumbled in the 1990s. The court indicted 161 suspects and is currently trying the last of them, former Bosnian Serb military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic, on genocide and other charges. It also has convicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic of genocide. The man alleged to have fomented conflicts throughout the former Yugoslavia, former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, was put on trial but died before his case finished. ____ INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA The U.N. court established to deal with the 1994 genocide in Rwanda indicted 93 suspects. Eight of them remain fugitives. The tribunal, which had its headquarters in Arusha, Tanzania, convicted dozens of people for their roles in the slaughter of some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. A former prime minister, Jean Kambanda, pleaded guilty and was given a life sentence. The tribunal formally closed its doors last year, passing on any remaining legal cases to a mechanism set up in The Hague to deal with legacy issues from both the Rwanda and Yugoslavia tribunals. ____ EXTRAORDINARY CHAMBERS IN THE COURTS OF CAMBODIA A U.N.-backed court set up in 2006 to bring to justice leaders of the notorious Khmer Rouge. The court applies both local and international law in its cases, which deal with the Khmer Rouge's brutal 1975-79 reign that led to the deaths of 1.7 million Cambodians though execution, starvation and inadequate medical care. The tribunal has convicted suspects including Khieu Samphan, the regime's head of state, and Nuon Chea, the right-hand man of the group's late leader, Pol Pot, and sentenced them to life imprisonment. ____ SPECIAL COURT FOR SIERRA LEONE Set up in 2002 to prosecute atrocities in Sierra Leone's brutal 1991-2002 civil war, it finished its work in 2013. The U.N.-backed court was funded by voluntary contributions and was the first international tribunal to be based in the country where the crimes it prosecuted were committed. The court put 10 suspects on trial and convicted nine of them, including former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who was sentenced to 50 years for his role in the conflict. ____ SPECIAL TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON Another court based in the Netherlands, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon opened in 2009 to prosecute those responsible for a truck bombing in Beirut on Feb. 14, 2005, that killed former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others. The court has a mix of international and Lebanese judges and works using Lebanese law. The court is currently trying in absentia four suspected members of the Hezbollah militia on suspicion of carrying out the assassination of Hariri. The case against one other suspect was halted earlier this year after he was killed in Syria. ____ KOSOVO SPECIALIST CHAMBERS Dealing with crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes committed in Kosovo between 1998 and 2000, the European Union-backed chambers are part of the Kosovo system, applying Kosovo law, but based in The Hague. The chambers haven't yet publicly issued any indictments. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

They held on to their historic majorities in virtually all levels of governance. They control both chambers of Congress. They'll have an opportunity to reset the Supreme Court back to its original 5-4 conservative ideological lean (and perhaps make it even more conservative if any of the older liberal justices retire during Trump's presidency). They'll hold at least 33 governorships, the most since 1922. And results are still trickling in, but it looks like Republicans will also keep control of 69 of 99 legislative chambers. According to population calculations by the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, that translates to roughly 80 percent of the population living in a state all or partially controlled by Republicans. It doesn't get much more dominant than that. BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO DEMOCRATS Things can't get much worse. Even though they gained a handful of seats in the U.S. Senate and House and flipped four statehouse chambers, Democrats are in the minority at almost every level of governance. (See above.) The good news for them is that simply losing the presidency may help them regain control. It's not unusual to see the party locked out of the White House pick up seats in Congress and state government because American voters like a check and balance on power. (This was particularly pronounced during the Obama years, as more than 900 Democratic state legislators were defeated.) But the reality is that there is more bad news than good news for Democrats right now. Come the 2018 midterm elections, Senate Democrats could very well lose seats as they defend their members running for reelection in at least five red-leaning states. -- Amber Phillips  58%  The percentage of the white vote Trump received, compared with Clinton's 37 percent. That's a record margin of victory for a Republican presidential candidate. (In 1984, Ronald Reagan won the white vote by 20 points; in 2012, Mitt Romney matched that.) 70%  The share of the voter pool of the white vote in 2016, down from 86 percent in 1984. 1%  The increase in the electorate of the Hispanic vote in Tuesday's election, from 10 percent in 2012 to 11 percent. The slim increase suggests there was no surge in Hispanic voter turnout, despite Trump's talk of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Gary Johnson says he has no regrets about running for president for the second time and finishing a distant runner-up as a Libertarian candidate. He's already talking about his next challenge, and it won't be another try for public office. Johnson, 63, said he plans to be a bicyclist, riding nearly 3,000 miles along the Continental Divide from Canada down into New Mexico sometime in early June. The Taos resident and ardent triathlete is referring to the 2,768-mile Great Divide Mountain Bike Route from Banff in Alberta, Canada, to Antelope Wells in New Mexico's Hidalgo County.  ""I'm dedicating myself to health and fitness,"" Johnson told the Albuquerque Journal (http://bit.ly/2g84jd7). ""Maybe I stay politically active, but not as a candidate. I will leave that to others."" In the presidential race, Johnson said was just hoping to secure 5 percent of the nationwide popular vote, enough to achieve major-party status for the Libertarian Party and qualify the party for federal funding in the next election.  ""This is a head-on effort to get on the ballot in all 50 states,"" he said. ""I'm hoping this is going to end the two-party system."" But Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, fell short. Latest totals show they garnered more than 4 million votes, 3 percent of the total. Johnson pointed out that he and Weld ""garnered more votes than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot,"" who ran as independent in the 1992 presidential campaign.  ""Given that we spent less than 1 percent as much as (Donald) Trump and (Hillary) Clinton, the level of support we received is historic,"" Johnson said. ""We made a credible third-party ticket part of the national conversation. Both major parties will be doing a lot of soul searching in the weeks and months ahead. We can hope that the results will be policies that reflect the priorities of people, not partisans."" Johnson and Weld did get 9.3 percent of the New Mexico vote, making it possible for the Libertarian Party to get major-party recognition and public funding for elections in that state. They also got 6.3 percent of the vote in North Dakota, Johnson's native state. In Johnson's 2012 bid for the presidency, also on the Libertarian ticket, he received 1.2 million votes, just shy of 1 percent. Johnson ran as a Republican in his successful bids for New Mexico governor in 1994 and 1998, but he said he has identified as a Libertarian since the early 1970s. He believes a third party is necessary to focus the national discussion on issues rather than character assassinations and thinks the next election will see Libertarian candidates up and down the ticket. ___ Information from: Albuquerque Journal, http://www.abqjournal.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Fearing it's becoming more divided, too, survivors and victims' families marked Sunday's anniversary of the violence by pleading for national unity instead. Tourism is hurting, armed forces roam streets and France is still under a state of emergency that rights groups call abusive and ineffective -- and that the prime minister now says may be extended yet again.  ""We always have this fear that weighs heavily in our hearts. We always try to be careful. And every time we pass by here, we think of them,"" said Sabrina Nedjadi, paying respects Sunday at two cafes in her diverse eastern Paris neighborhood targeted in the attacks. At midday, hundreds of balloons were released to honor the memories of the victims; at dusk, paper lanterns were released into the Canal Saint Martin, bearing red, white and blue lights representing the French tricolor. Onlookers, including many families with children, lined the canal and surrounding bridges, watching silently as the lanterns drifted. Some fear that France itself is adrift, its government unable to defeat the amorphous extremist enemy even as authorities encroach on liberties the French hold dear. While French warplanes are targeting IS strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the state of emergency at home allows broadened police powers to search homes and monitor communications. But it could not prevent further attacks on France over the past year, including a truck rampage in Nice by a man claiming allegiance to IS. ""Yes, terrorism will strike us again,"" Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned this weekend The International Federation for Human Rights warned in a recent report: ""France is now in a situation where an 'exceptional' regime is becoming permanent, in the name of combating terrorism. But there is little evidence that this approach is working and it comes at a cost to fundamental rights."" As silence descended Sunday on Paris for a series of commemorations, the son of the first victim of the attacks spoke out for tolerance in the face of hate. Manuel Dias, an immigrant from Portugal, was killed by a suicide bomber outside the national stadium during an international match Nov. 13, 2015. Under heavy security, President Francois Hollande unveiled a plaque in his memory Sunday near the Stade de France. Dias' son Michael said his father was ""living proof that integration is possible, necessary"" to end such violence. Learning to live again after extremists killed his father was ""a personal challenge, but it concerns us all,"" Dias said. ""Long live tolerance, long live intelligence, long live France."" Some people cried, others simply lit candles or laid flowers at ceremonies Sunday near the six bars and eateries where gunmen opened fire on unsuspecting crowds enjoying an unusually mild November Friday night. Notre Dame Cathedral held a special commemorative Mass on Sunday evening. Across the Seine River, mourners, tourists and residents streamed to the Bataclan concert hall, where 90 people were killed by three attackers who also took hostages. The concert hall reopened Saturday night with an emotional concert by Sting. Jesse Hughes of Eagles of Death Metal, the California band whose concert that night ended in a bloodbath, paid respects at the Bataclan ceremony, placing his hand on his heart as he departed. Nine people remain hospitalized from the attacks; others are paralyzed. Hundreds are still receiving psychological treatment.  ""After this November 13th we lost part of our insouciance. The state of emergency has also contributed to set in a climate of fear,"" said Daniel Psenny, a Le Monde journalist who is still recovering from a shot in the arm while trying to rescue a Bataclan victim. But while some are moving out of his neighborhood, he refuses to cede to fear and remains proud of its diversity -- a reflection of an increasingly heterogenous France.  ""We must live. We are the ones who enshrine the spirit of this district, the way we live, the way we work, the way we get together. We perpetuate that. If we abandon (this area), that means terrorism has won,"" he said. The coordinated attacks were a wake-up call for France and for Europe. They followed the January 2015 newsroom massacre at the satiric newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris and a Kosher grocery store that left 17 dead. But the complex planning behind the Nov. 13 attacks and the high number of deaths revealed a degree of French vulnerability not previously suspected by authorities. Neighboring Belgium, the starting point of the attacks in Paris, was hit on March 22 with attacks on its airport and a metro station that killed 32 people. Yet a sign scrawled and posted near the Bataclan, ""Love for all, hate for no one,"" captures the sense of defiance shared by many. Since the Charlie Hebdo attacks, ""even if there is still worry in the minds of all French people, fear, there is a bit more love ... to the reverse of what you might think, it gives us a desire to be together,"" said Gregory Reibenberg, whose wife Djamila died in his arms in his cafe, La Belle Equipe, along with 18 other friends, colleagues and patrons.  ""It unifies us more than the other way around,"" he said. ""Even if it affects us all deeply, forever."" ___ Jeffrey Schaeffer, Masha Macpherson, Oleg Cetinic and Milos Krivokapic contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

On Tuesday, that movement propelled him to the White House. Trump's stunning, come-from-behind victory over Hillary Clinton -- a far more organized and experienced rival -- served as a raised middle finger to the political establishment from his fervent backers.  ""I have been so ready for this,"" said Oklahoma resident Holly Berry, who flew all the way from Tahlequah to celebrate at Trump's victory party in Manhattan. Berry, who works in sales, said that she can no longer afford her health insurance, which has spiked 86 percent.  ""People are sick and tired,"" she said. ""This country's fed up with everything. We're ready for a change. We're ready for lower taxes, ready for our economy to grow, we're ready for jobs."" But to millions of others, the billionaire businessman's elevation to the presidency is a shocking and terrifying reality that will take time to comprehend. Many see the president-elect as a bigot and a misogynist unfit for the office.  ""He scares the daylights out of me,"" said Wendy Bennett, a Democrat and government worker from Reno, Nevada, who cast her ballot for Clinton. ""I think his personality is going to start World War III. He reminds me of Hitler."" Lisa Moore, a registered Republican from Glen Rock, New Jersey, crossed party lines to vote for Clinton, who would have been the nation's first female president.  ""As a woman, in good conscience, and as the mother of a daughter, I can't vote for somebody who's so morally reprehensible,"" said Moore, an exercise instructor. The 2016 election also serves as vindication for Trump, a former reality TV star who was underestimated from the start. While pundits assumed his poll numbers would sink as soon as voters started taking the race seriously, Trump was drawing thousands each night to rallies packed full of angry, largely white supporters who felt ignored and lied to by Washington. While statistics showed the U.S. economy improving overall, it didn't feel that way in places like upstate New York, Pennsylvania's coal country and former manufacturing towns across the Midwest devastated by outsourcing and globalization. Chaos abroad only added to the feeling that the country was sliding backward. Together, those factors drove a yearning to return to a simpler time when America was the world's undisputed superpower and middle-class wages were on the rise.  ""We have our fingers in too many baskets,"" said Joe Hudson, 49, an engineer and registered Republican from Virginia Beach, Virginia, who said he would be voting for Trump because ""we're not taking care of our own people.""  ""We're trying to be too involved in world politics. And our country is imploding from within,"" he said. ""We need a new direction, a new attitude, and people to stop arguing and letting the media affect how we feel."" Trump's vow was simple: He'd ""Make America Great Again."" His outsider status, coupled with his personal business success, lent credibility to a populist message that emphasized recapturing manufacturing jobs, restoring American strength abroad and curtailing legal and illegal immigration. Trump promised to immediately create new jobs, end conflicts abroad and -- in Trump's words, ""win again"" Trump, early on, painted his supporters as a ""movement"" larger than himself.  ""This isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country. And they're talking about it all over the world,"" he said at a rally in Miami last week during the race's furious final stretch.  ""There has never been a movement like this in the history of our country -- it's never happened. Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump, have said it's the single greatest phenomena they have ever seen."" But as he worked his base into a frenzy and locked down one primary win after the next, Trump was also repelling large swaths of the populace -- including women, college-educated whites and minorities -- with his deeply divisive rhetoric. Trump launched his campaign with a speech that accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals across the border. He later questioned 2008 Republican nominee and former POW John McCain's status as a war hero, saying he preferred people who hadn't been captured. He mocked a disabled reporter. And he called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"" -- a blanket religion test denounced by many as un-American. After securing his party's nomination, Trump questioned a federal judge's ability to treat him fairly because of the judge's Hispanic origin, repeatedly insulted a Muslim-American family whose son had been killed in Iraq, and got into an extended spat with a former beauty queen, at one point instructing his millions of Twitter followers to ""check out"" her non-existent sex tape. Again and again, Trump appeared poised to close the gap with Clinton, only to go off on a tangent that would send his poll numbers tumbling. Then came the release of shocking old video footage from an ""Access Hollywood"" bus in which Trump bragged about being able to grope women because he was famous. The video's release was followed by a string of allegations from women who said Trump sexually harassed or assaulted them. Trump denied the accusations, at one point threatening to sue the women. But one October surprise was overshadowed by another. Trump's numbers had already been rising with news of health care premium increases when the FBI director informed Congress that the bureau had found a new trove of emails potentially relevant to its investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server a secretary of state. While the FBI eventually announced that there was nothing in the emails to merit criminal prosecution, the damage appeared to have been done. On Tuesday, Trump won a commanding victory, buoyed by a new Trump coalition.  ""It's time to get together,"" he said. ___ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj.
