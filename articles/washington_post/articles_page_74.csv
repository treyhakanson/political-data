Rallying supporters on social media with the hashtag #SanctuaryCampus, organizers said actions were planned at more than 80 schools, including Vermont's Middlebury College, where about 400 people gathered, and Yale University, where demonstrators numbered about 600. Students sought assurances that their schools would not share their personal information with immigration officials or allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on campus.  ""Can you imagine the fear that it would inflict on college campuses if having ICE agents walk into a campus becomes the status quo?"" organizer Carlos Rojas of the group Movimiento Cosecha, said by phone from New Jersey. ""It would be terrifying."" The actions continued days of demonstrations that have broken out in cities and high school campuses following Trump's election victory last week. The Republican's campaign promises included a vow to deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally.  ""I'm very fearful,"" Miriam Zamudio, whose parents brought her to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, said by phone as she prepared to join a protest at Rutgers University in New Jersey. She worries that the family information she provided on her application for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status will endanger her parents, who are living in the country without legal permission.  ""We don't know what Trump is going to do,"" Zamudio said. ""We don't know if he is going to demand this information, and we want our administration and our school to stand with us."" Several hundred people, mainly high school and college students, rallied at the federal building in downtown San Diego to protest Trump's election. Some held signs or banners saying ""we are not criminals"" and ""make racists afraid again."" An 18-year-old was arrested after he allegedly punched a police officer, police said. In one non-campus protest on Wednesday night, hundreds of people rallied on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall to protest Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon as a senior adviser. Faculty and staff at several universities have signed petitions in support of making their campuses sanctuaries for people threatened with deportation -- or anyone who faces discrimination.  ""We are alarmed at the vitriol that students and community members are experiencing across the United States in the aftermath of the recent election,"" the petition to administrators at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign said. ""Reports of gross imitations of disabled youth, threats to aid in the deportation of students and their families, renewed deployments of the 'N' word, sexual aggressions against young women, bullying of Muslim and LGBTQ+ youth, reappearances of swastikas, among other acts, point to hostilities that infiltrate our campus."" At the University of Memphis, students chanted ""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here"" and ""No racists, no KKK, no fascist USA,"" The Commercial Appeal reported. Junior Luke Wilson stood nearby, holding a sign that said ""You're all cry babies."" Similar sentiments appeared on Twitter and other social media platforms, along with messages of support.  ""We know that there are going to be people on both sides of the issue,"" Rojas said. ""But I think that what no one could argue with is that a university and a college campus have a moral responsibility to make the students that are paying tuition and just want to get an education feel safe."" Department of Homeland Security Press Secretary Gillian Christensen said existing ICE and Customs and Border Protection policies guide enforcement at ""sensitive locations,"" which include colleges and universities.  ""The ICE and CBP sensitive locations policies, which remain in effect, provide that enforcement actions at sensitive locations should generally be avoided, and require either prior approval from an appropriate supervisory official or exigent circumstances necessitating immediate action,"" Christensen said by email. ""DHS is committed to ensuring that people seeking to participate in activities or utilize services provided at any sensitive location are free to do so without fear or hesitation."" Yale Ph.D. student Ramon Garibaldo told the crowd to remain hopeful.  ""I fear for my existence every day,"" said Garibaldo, whose parents brought him from Mexico. ""My mom, my dad they crossed borders for me to be here. So we aren't going to bow down to the orders of one man."" ____ Thompson reported from Buffalo, New York.

A week after his upset victory, Trump said the enormous endeavor was proceeding ""so smoothly."" Trump dished out his rebuttal on Twitter, spending yet another day ensconced in his New York skyscraper, beyond the public eye. Aides and allies vouched for the transition efforts on his behalf, suggesting some commotion was to be expected.  ""The beginning of any transition like this has turmoil because it's just the nature of the process,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said as he left Trump's transition headquarters in Washington. He said the picture of Trump's administration would become clearer over the next two or three weeks. Others close to the transition process described advisers ""fighting for power."" Trump has long stoked internal rivalries among his staff -- both in his businesses and his campaign -- and has created ambiguity in his transition about who has authority to make key decisions. Eric Trump, one of the president-elect's sons, raised expectations of imminent progress Wednesday, telling reporters in the morning that appointments were ""likely"" to come during the day. Then, other Trump aides suggested a slower pace. ___ 10 Things to Know for Thursday Your daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Thursday: 1. TRUMP: TRANSITION PROCEEDING 'SO SMOOTHLY' The president-elect and his team reject charges that infighting is roiling efforts to set up his White House, national security and economic teams. 2. HILLARY CLINTON REFLECTS ON DEVASTATING DEFEAT In her first public appearance since her emotional concession speech, she acknowledges the difficulty of her loss for her supporters and urges them to persevere through the Trump era. ___ Giuliani's foreign work complicates candidacy for top post WASHINGTON -- Rudy Giuliani, President-elect Donald Trump's top candidate for top diplomat, has advised foreign political figures and worked for lobbying and security firms whose clients have had complicated relationships with the U.S. government. While not personally involved in lobbying, Giuliani spent years at firms which represented governments and multinational companies, some of which had interests that diverged from those of the United States. He also made speeches demanding the State Department remove an Iranian opposition group from a U.S. terror blacklist. As the former New York mayor waits to discover if he is Trump's choice for secretary of state, Giuliani's extensive consulting and advising work for foreign and corporate clients could expose him to the same criticisms he raised about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's ties to foreign governments and corporations that had donated to her family charity, the Clinton Foundation.  ""What she did with the Clinton Foundation and all the favors the State Department did for hundreds of millions of dollars is, to me, clear violation of the conflict of interest law,"" Giuliani told CNN in August. But when Clinton was secretary of state, she was the one concerned about Giuliani after he took a trip to Belgrade and met with leaders of a Serbian political party once allied with Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic. ___ Clinton reflects on loss, urges backers to 'stay engaged' WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton reflected on her devastating defeat on Wednesday evening, acknowledging the difficulty of her loss for her supporters and urging them to persevere through the Donald Trump era. In remarks that were equal parts pep talk and funeral dirge, Clinton encouraged her backers to ""never, ever give up.""  ""I know this isn't easy. I know that over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves whether America is the country we thought it was,"" Clinton said at the annual gala of the Children's Defense Fund, the child advocacy organization where she started her legal career. ""But please listen to me when I say this: America is worth it."" She added: ""It's up to each and every one of us to keep working to make America better and stronger and fairer."" Clinton never cited the president-elect by name in her remarks, making only an oblique reference to the controversial policies that fueled his rise to the White House. ___ Obama urges nations not to give in to isolationist impulses ATHENS, Greece -- Standing in democracy's birthplace, President Barack Obama on Wednesday issued a parting plea to world leaders not to let the fear of globalization tugging at Europe and the U.S. pull them away from their core democratic values. He argued it wasn't too late for a course correction. On his last foreign trip as president, Obama has repeatedly tried to draw lessons from Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election, hoping it can serve as wake-up call in the U.S. and abroad. Conceding that many feel left behind by globalization, Obama said there was an understandable impulse toward isolationism and that if people feel their futures are at risk, ""they'll push back.""  ""People have to know that they're being heard,"" Obama said in a speech to the Greek people in Athens. But, he added, ""We can't look backward for answers. We have to look forward."" While fewer people in the U.S. are looking to Obama for direction now that his successor has been chosen and his agenda largely rebuked, Obama has retained significant clout abroad. His message Wednesday appeared aimed at other world leaders facing pressures of nationalist movements and economic anxiety, exemplified by Britain's recent vote to leave the European Union. From Greece, Obama took a short flight to Germany, which has emerged as one of the strongest voices for preserving a unified, inclusive Europe. Yet even German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces her own threat from a nationalist right-wing movement, fueled in part by anger over her generous policy toward resettling Syrian migrants pouring into Europe. ___ Officer charged in shooting that was streamed on Facebook ST. PAUL, Minn. -- When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: ""I wasn't reaching for it."" On Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook.  ""No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,"" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. Prosecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. If convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. ___ Drug prices don't budge even after pressure from Congress WASHINGTON -- Congress's routine of publicly shaming drug company executives over high prices works no better than a placebo: It may make some people feel better, but it doesn't treat the problem. In the last two years, House and Senate committees issued more than a dozen subpoenas to price-hiking drugmakers, collecting hundreds of thousands of documents and berating executives for more than 16 hours of public hearings. But a review by The Associated Press of the list prices of nearly 30 brand-name medications and generic versions targeted by congressional investigators shows most haven't budged since coming under federal scrutiny, according to figures from Truven Health Analytics.  ""These companies have made clear that they are not going to change course on their own -- they will keep bilking the American people for all they can unless Congress acts,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Unlike most countries, the U.S. doesn't regulate drug prices. That means drugmakers, like other businesses, are largely free to set prices as high as the market will bear. ___ Extensive cultural damage found in historic Iraqi city NIMRUD, Iraq -- Nearly a month into the fight to retake Mosul, government forces pushed Islamic State militants out of nearby Nimrud, home to some of Iraq's richest archaeological treasures. And when soldiers finally surveyed the extremists' destruction of the ancient sites, one said that those who carried it out ""don't have a place in humanity."" Intricate reliefs that once stood at the gates to the magnificent Assyrian palace lay in pieces: stone carvings of a face, half of a claw, part of a wing, fragments of script. In April 2015, the Islamic State extremists released a shocking video that showed how they had hammered, bulldozed and blew up parts of the 13th century B.C. Assyrian capital in the Tigris River valley south of Mosul. Iraqi officers accompanied journalists to the site Wednesday, wandering through the piles of rubble and snapping photos of the damage that U.N. officials had once called ""a war crime."" The Assyrian Ziggurat, nearly 3,000 years old and once one of the tallest surviving buildings of the ancient world, has been leveled. On palace walls, only small fragments of stone carvings remained. Two Assyrian winged-bull statues that once marked the palace entrance have been completely destroyed. In a palace doorway, four deep cracks defaced a large carving of an Assyrian guardian spirit. ___ Nationals' Scherzer, Boston's Porcello win Cy Young Awards NEW YORK -- Max Scherzer celebrated aboard a boat off the British Virgin Islands, doused by college pals on a floating party. Rick Porcello enjoyed the moment at his parents' home in New Jersey, surrounded by family, friends and a few bottles of wine. As for Justin Verlander, well, fuming supermodel Kate Upton brought the heat for her fiance. Rotation mates for five seasons in Detroit, the three right-handers topped the Cy Young Award talk Wednesday: Scherzer easily won the NL prize, Porcello edged out Verlander for the AL honor.  ""That's just the weird thing about these,"" said Scherzer, who ruled the majors with 284 strikeouts and topped the NL with 20 wins for Washington. ""It's the voting."" ___ Police: Airport shooting likely case of workplace revenge OKLAHOMA CITY -- A man who gunned down a Southwest Airlines employee outside of Oklahoma City's airport likely did so in retaliation for having lost his own job with the airline last year, police said Wednesday. Lloyd Dean Buie, 45, killed 52-year-old Michael Winchester on Tuesday as Winchester was leaving work and walking to an employee parking lot, police Capt. Paco Balderrama said at a news conference. Buie fired the shot from the fourth floor of a parking garage when Winchester was about 50 yards away, he said. Buie was later found dead in his pickup truck in the garage.  ""We know his intention was to go to the airport to hurt someone,"" Balderrama said. ""The suspect knew where the employees parked and where they would be walking."" Winchester died from a single gunshot wound to the chest, the Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office ruled Wednesday. Buie's death was ruled a suicide from a single gunshot wound to the head. Buie quit his job as a ramp agent for Southwest in April 2015 after he refused to take an alcohol screening, airline spokeswoman Brandy King said Wednesday. She said co-workers had suspected Buie was under the influence at work, but she declined to say if Winchester, a ramp supervisor who had worked for Southwest for 29 years, was involved.

Czech Army Gen. Petr Pavel said NATO's Article 5 mutual defense clause is quite clear and NATO will come to the defense, unconditionally, of any fellow member who is attacked. Pavel, chairman of NATO's Military Committee, made the remarks to The Associated Press ahead of this weekend's Halifax International Security Forum -- the first major national security conference since Trump's election. Trump's mere musing during the presidential campaign that he would review allies' financial contributions -- in this case contributions owed by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- before acting under NATO's Article 5 mutual defense clause if they were attacked by Russia could rock the foundations of the security architecture that has underpinned European stability since the end of World War II. Trump has also called NATO ""obsolete"" and a bad deal for America.  ""The continuity of the trans-Atlantic relationship, spanning almost 70 years, is simply so binding that no American president would dare be able to change it, and even not willing, because we understand on sides on both sides of the Atlantic that NATO is as important to European allies as it is to North America and we have a treaty that is binding to all of us,"" Pavel said.  ""I really think that there is no serious threat there to challenging the principles of NATO."" U.S. administrations have complained, often bitterly, that many NATO members are not footing their share of the alliance's bills. The U.S. accounts for more than 70 percent of all NATO defense spending. Only four other allies -- Britain, Estonia, Greece and Poland -- meet the minimum 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense that NATO requires. But Trump's floating the idea that that spending target would be a prerequisite for the U.S. to defend them is an abrupt break for the most powerful member of NATO, which styles itself as the most successful military alliance in world history.  ""Article 5 is quite clear,"" Pavel said. ""I believe this commitment will be met whatever the situation. I also believe that it is necessary that all European allies do their best to meet their commitments."" Pavel said it is ""absolutely justified"" that pressure will be stepped up on members to meet their obligations and said the U.S. is carrying too much of the burden but he took issue with Trump slagging NATO. ""I would absolutely not call NATO obsolete. NATO is relevant as ever,"" he said. Pavel said Russia is pursing political objectives through military force and that's unacceptable in the 21st century.  ""We are witnesses to the first illegal change of boundaries since the second World War by force,"" he said in reference to Crimea. Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014 from Ukraine following a hastily called referendum, a move that led to crippling Western sanctions. A separatist insurgency also erupted in eastern Ukraine the following month, backed by Russia. Pavel said he hopes Trump will moderate his remarks now that he's the president elect. In its eighth year, the Halifax International Security forum attracts top defense and security officials from Western democracies. About 300 people gather each year, and Robert Work, U.S. deputy secretary of defense, and Admiral Michael Rogers, director of the U.S. National Security Agency, are among the speakers as are Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain. Kaine will be honored at a dinner on Friday night for leading the Democratic delegation to the forum for the fourth year, a tribute the forum decided to give him before he was named Hillary Clinton's running mate.  ""Issues and conversations related to Mr. Trump's election are going to be happening the whole weekend,"" Forum President Peter Van Praagh said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Obama is due in Athens Tuesday morning for talks with the country's political leadership. He is scheduled to deliver a speech on Wednesday before heading to Berlin as part of his last major trip abroad. Greek police announced a ban on public gatherings in central Athens, as well as near the city's international airport and a southern suburb where one of the city's luxury hotels is located, effective from several hours before Obama's arrival until his departure. At least 5,000 police are to be deployed, including teams with sniffer dogs, while major avenues and roads in central Athens will be closed to vehicles and at times to pedestrians. Parking restrictions were to go into effect Monday night. Anarchist and left-wing groups are planning protest marches. A communist party-linked union slammed the ban on demonstrations ""against the representative of imperialist powers"" and called for mass participation in a central Athens rally planned for Tuesday evening.  ""Nobody can remain apathetic before the visit of the hawk of war,"" the PAME union said in a statement. An armed anarchist group has called for ""attacks and clashes"" to disrupt Obama's visit. In a website posting Friday, the Conspiracy Cells of Fire group urged anarchists to ""return a little of the violence we receive daily."" The group has claimed responsibility for a string of bomb attacks on judges, police and other figures of authority, causing minor injuries but no fatalities. Extensive violent demonstrations greeted the last official visit to Greece of a sitting U.S. president, by Bill Clinton in 1999. Many leftists in Greece regard the U.S. with misgivings, stemming mostly from America's backing of the military dictatorship that governed the country from 1967 to 1974. Obama's visit comes just days before the Nov. 17 anniversary of the junta's 1973 bloody crackdown on a student uprising. The anniversary is marked by an annual protest march to the U.S. Embassy, which frequently turns violent. Greece's left-led coalition government, struggling to pull the country out of six years of a vicious financial crisis that has devastated its economy, has hailed Obama's visit as being of ""huge importance"" for both Greece and Europe. It has expressed the hope that U.S. pressure could persuade some of its more reluctant international creditors, such as Germany, to grant significant debt relief, without which it says Greece cannot hope to recover economically. Greece has been relying on emergency loans from three consecutive multi-billion euro (dollar) international bailouts since 2010. In a briefing note last week on the visit, Greece's press ministry said that the United States, ""and particularly of President Obama,"" had supported Greece on several issues including ""on the issue of dealing with Greek debt, as a decisive step toward a period of development and prosperity."" Rights organizations have urged Obama to use his visit to highlight Europe's response to the refugee crisis. Reluctance by many richer European countries to take in refugees has left more than 60,000 people stranded in Greece, living in often poor conditions in overcrowded camps, particularly on eastern Aegean islands. Obama should ""shine the spotlight not only on abysmal conditions for the tens of thousands of refugees stranded in Greece, but also on the failure of world leaders to adequately address the wider global refugee crisis,"" John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Europe director, said in a statement. Human Rights Watch said Obama ""should call on EU leaders to defend universal human rights and show greater responsibility for refugees."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Khatiya Dekanoidze, who also was a deputy interior minister, told a televised news conference Monday that her official powers were ""not enough for dramatic changes."" Dekanoidze complained of pressure by government officials and members of parliament who ""interfered"" in police work. One of the pledges of the new Ukrainian government, which took over in February 2014 after pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country, was to combat rampant corruption in Ukraine's police. The overhaul of the national police has so far been the new government's most visible reform. The entire Kiev traffic police corps was disbanded and replaced by a new force last year.

After a meeting Monday, the Alliance for Changes coalition called Dodik a ""dictator"" who is violating the constitution and said that he is using ""fascist methods"" to punish the opposition. Most voters in the Bosnian Serb mini-state of Republika Srpska voted for Dodik's party, which has been ruling there for over a decade. But opposition says Dodik threatened the handful of municipalities where voters elected opposition leaders with no support from his government. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

He was 83. The cause was acute leukemia, said his manager, Matthew Sullivan. From 1964 to 1968, Mr. Vaughn was one of the most recognizable stars in Hollywood, playing Napoleon Solo in the NBC spy spoof ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" The character was developed by Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, as something of a small-screen Bond. Darkly handsome, with a prominent chin and a distinctive, cultivated voice, Mr. Vaughn starred alongside David McCallum, playing the Russian spy Illya Kuryakin. Together, they were an international crime-fighting duo defying Cold War convention in a tongue-in-cheek series that was one of the most popular shows of its time. Each week, the pair from the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement, a private organization ""involved in maintaining political and legal order anywhere in the world,"" accepted a mission from their boss, played by Leo G. Carroll. With wit and panache, they overcame the deadly gadgets and thugs put in their way by their nemesis, THRUSH -- while finding time to romance glamorous women.   Actor Robert Vaughn. (Anonymous/AP)  No matter how perilous their travails, they always managed to escape with their well-fitted suits, stylish hair and debonair manner intact. ""There was something cool about it,"" Ron Simon, curator of television and radio at the Paley Center for Media in New York, told the Los Angeles Times last year. ""It created an emotional resonance for TV. It became the most popular show on campus in 1964, '65 and '66 -- the first two seasons. It was a cultural phenomenon."" Mr. Vaughn and McCallum had a genial screen chemistry, trading quips and maintaining a blithe sang-froid in the face of danger. They received thousands of letters a week from fans, and when the Beatles came to the United States in 1966, they asked to meet Mr. Vaughn. Throughout a six-decade acting career, Mr. Vaughn appeared in more than 100 films and as many television productions. In his early years in Hollywood, he was known as a man about town, often dating beautiful actresses (including Natalie Wood) and indulging in revelry with actor friends, including Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Richard Harris. In 1959, he played opposite Paul Newman in ""The Young Philadelphians,"" a film about upper-class hypocrisy. He portrayed a ne'er-do-well from a wealthy family who loses an arm in the Korean War, becomes an alcoholic and later stands trial for murder. Mr. Vaughn was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actor but lost to Hugh Griffith from ""Ben Hur.""  Mr. Vaughn was the last surviving principal actor from the classic 1960 western ""The Magnificent Seven,"" in which he played a reluctant gunfighter alongside Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Coburn and McQueen. He and McQueen were reunited in the 1968 drama ""Bullitt,"" in which Mr. Vaughn played a corrupt politician. The film, which starred McQueen as a rogue police officer and featured one of the great car chases in cinematic history, was a box-office success. Beyond his acting, Mr. Vaughn had a serious side and was an engaged political activist throughout his career. He was a friend of Robert F. Kennedy and in 1966 took an early stance against U.S. involvement in Vietnam. He often spoke on college campuses and, on separate occasions, debated the Vietnam War with Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and conservative writer William F. Buckley Jr. on Buckley's ""Firing Line"" TV program.   Robert Vaughn with his Emmy Award for outstanding supporting actor for ""Washington: Behind Closed Doors."" 1979 photo. (AP/AP)  While making ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,"" Mr. Vaughn took graduate courses at the University of Southern California, from which he received a doctorate in mass communications in 1970. His dissertation, about the chilling effects of the House Un-American Activities Committee on the theatrical world and Hollywood, was revised and published as a book, ""Only Victims: A Study of Show Business Blacklisting,"" in 1972. It is still in print. ""Probably the greatest harm done to the theater,"" Mr. Vaughn said in 1972, ""was in an area that you cannot easily document -- that is the words that were not written through intimidation and fear of future investigations. The committee's methods and procedures silenced perhaps a generation of writers who might have contributed bounteously to a healthy theater in a democratic society."" Robert Francis Vaughn was born Nov. 22, 1932, in New York City. Both of his parents were actors, but they separated when he was an infant. He grew up with his grandparents in Minneapolis. He occasionally appeared in radio serials as a child and began acting in stage plays at 12. In 1956, he received a bachelor's degree in theater arts from what is now California State University at Los Angeles. He received a master's degree in the same field in 1960 from USC and was an early acting teacher of Jack Nicholson's. Mr. Vaughn served in the Army and had a few small film roles before he was cast in ""The Young Philadelphians."" A major role in the short-lived TV military drama ""The Lieutenant"" led to his star turn in ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" He appeared in the 1969 World War II film ""The Bridge at Remagen"" before returning to television in 1972 in ""The Protectors,"" a detective show produced in England. He often acted in miniseries in the 1970s, including the political drama ""Washington: Behind Closed Doors"" (1977), for which he won an Emmy Award for best supporting actor. He received another Emmy nomination for his portrayal of President Woodrow Wilson in ""Backstairs at the White House"" in 1979. Mr. Vaughn played four other presidents in various stage and television productions -- Richard M. Nixon, Harry S. Truman, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Over the years, he had recurring roles in several TV series and was in such films as ""The Towering Inferno,"" ""Superman III"" and ""Delta Force."" He also appeared in many theatrical productions, including A.R. Gurney's ""Love Letters"" with Polly Bergen on Broadway in 1990. From 2004 to 2012, Mr. Vaughn starred in the popular British TV series ""Hustle,"" playing an aging mentor to a group of con artists. He published a memoir, ""A Fortunate Life,"" in 2008 and appeared in a London production of the play ""Twelve Angry Men"" from 2013 to 2015.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)  Veterans Day - a great time to reflect on the sacrifices of others or that great sale at the mall. Coming just three days after an election that left the nation bitterly divided, Friday's holiday was a bit of relief. Although wounds remain raw, the parades and ceremonies invited those weary of an especially negative campaign season to focus on the veterans whose service allows us to have unpredictable elections. Many government offices and schools were closed, parking meters were free and some places like the District postponed trash collection. ""Whenever the world makes you cynical, whenever you doubt that courage and goodness and selflessness is possible, stop and look to a veteran,"" President Obama said at Arlington National Cemetery. Certainly, the election of Donald Trump, whose reputation defies the definition of goodness and selflessness, left many with a degree of cynicism that looking to a veteran won't cure.  Without mentioning the president-elect, Obama noted how a political campaign ""lays bare disagreements across our nation."" But ""when the election is over,"" he added, ""as we search for ways to come together -- to reconnect with one another and with the principles that are more enduring than transitory politics -- some of our best examples are the men and women we salute on Veterans Day."" How America treats those men and women has been especially controversial since a scandal broke in 2014 over the cover-up of long wait times for patients at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. The VA's inspector general's office has completed more than 80 criminal investigations related to the outrage. Noting the tragedy of 20 veterans taking their lives every day, Obama said ""we have to get them the help they need.  We have to keep solving problems like long wait times at the VA.  We have to keep cutting the disability claims backlog.  We have to resist any effort to outsource and privatize the health care we owe America's veterans."" Trump promises every veteran will have ""the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice."" Obama also had good news, including an 85 percent increase in funding for veterans. ""We've cut veteran homelessness almost in half.  Today, more veterans have access to health care and fewer are unemployed,"" he said. ""We helped disabled veterans afford prosthetics.  We're delivering more mental health care services to more veterans than ever before because we know that not all wounds of war are visible."" The White House listed other accomplishments, including 1.7 million people getting $68.9 billion in education benefits since 2009 under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The administration also has launched a multi-agency military apprenticeship program to help service members ""improve job skills and obtain industry-recognized credentials and certificates while on active duty."" Acting Office of Personnel Management Director Beth Cobert's Veterans Day message pointed to the increase in the percentage of veterans among federal hires. It was 24 percent when Obama signed a November 2009 executive order establishing a federal veterans hiring program. At the end September 2015, that had increased to 32.5 percent, with more than 500,000 vets hired by 24 agencies since fiscal 2009. ""Not only is hiring veterans the right thing to do, it makes good business sense,"" Cobert said. ""The skills, leadership, and discipline that veterans bring to Federal workplaces across this great nation are essential to our ability to meet our mission to serve the American people."" While problems with VA medical care have captured much of the attention during the last two years, issues involving veterans' benefits have received relatively little notice. A congressionally requested report released last week by the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) cites a major decline in disability claims processing time. The number of vets waiting more than 125 days has fallen from 611,000 in March 2013 to between 70,000 and 80,000 recently. That's about an 87 percent drop. But it's not all good news. The number of veterans appealing benefit determinations doubled from 2014 to 2016. There were more than 443,000 waiting a final decision in January. ""VA now projects that 'by the end of 2027, under the current process, without significant legislative reform, Veterans will be waiting on average 10 years for a final decision on their appeal,'"" according to the NAPA report. ""The pending inventory could climb to over 2 million cases in the appeals inventory by 2027."" Trump pledges ""no more waiting backlogs."" Good luck on that. It's easier promised than accomplished.

(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   As the reality of President-elect Donald Trump settled in very early Wednesday morning, MSNBC's Chris Hayes summed up an explanation common to many on the left: The Republican nominee pulled ahead thanks to old-fashioned American racism. But the attempt to make Trump's victory about racism appears to be at odds with what actually happened on Election Day. Consider the following facts. Twenty-nine percent of Latinos voted for Trump, per exit polls. Remarkably, despite the near-ubiquitous narrative that Trump would have deep problems with this demographic given his comments and position on immigration, this was a higher percentage of those who voted for GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Meanwhile, African Americans did not turn out to vote against Trump. In fact, Trump received a higher percentage of African American votes than Romney did.   [Donald Trump wins the presidency in stunning upset over Clinton]   And while many white voters deeply disliked Trump, they disliked Democrat Hillary Clinton even more. Of those who had negative feelings about both Trump and Clinton, Trump got their votes by a margin of 2 to 1. Votes for Trump seemed to signal a rejection of the norms and values for which Clinton stood more than an outright embrace of Trump. He was viewed unfavorably, for instance, by 61 percent of Wisconsinites, but 1 in 5 in that group voted for him anyway. The most important divide in this election was not between whites and non-whites. It was between those who are often referred to as ""educated"" voters and those who are described as ""working class"" voters. The reality is that six in 10 Americans do not have a college degree, and they elected Donald Trump. College-educated people didn't just fail to see this coming -- they have struggled to display even a rudimentary understanding of the worldviews of those who voted for Trump. This is an indictment of the monolithic, insulated political culture in the vast majority our colleges and universities.       Anti-Trump protests took place near some college campuses on election night. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)     [How Donald Trump broke the old rules of politics -- and won the White House]   As a college professor, I know that there are many ways in which college graduates simply know more about the world than those who do not have such degrees. This is especially true -- with some exceptions, of course -- when it comes to ""hard facts"" learned in science, history and sociology courses. But I also know that that those with college degrees -- again, with some significant exceptions -- don't necessarily know philosophy or theology. And they have especially paltry knowledge about the foundational role that different philosophical or theological claims play in public thought compared with what is common to college campuses. In my experience, many professors and college students don't even realize that their views on political issues rely on a particular philosophical or theological stance. Higher education in the United States, after all, is woefully monolithic in its range of worldviews. In 2014, some 60 percent of college professors identified as either ""liberal"" or ""far-left,"" an increase from 42 percent identifying as such in 1990. And while liberal college professors outnumber conservatives 5-to-1, conservatives are considerably more common within the general public. The world of academia is, therefore, different in terms of political temperature than the rest of society, and what is common knowledge and conventional wisdom among America's campus dwellers can't be taken for granted outside the campus gates.    [World gasps in collective disbelief following Trump's election]   While some of the political differences between educated and working-class voters is based on a dispute over hard facts, the much broader and more foundational disagreements are about norms and values. They turn on first principles grounded in the very different intuitions and stories which animate very different political cultures. Such disagreements cannot be explained by the fact that college-educated voters know some facts which non-college educated voters do not. They are about something far more fundamental. Think about the sets of issues that are often at the core of the identity of the working-class folks who elected Trump: religion, personal liberty's relationship with government, gender, marriage, sexuality, prenatal life and gun rights. Intuition and stories guide most working-class communities on these issues. With some exceptions, those professorial sorts who form the cultures of our colleges and universities have very different intuition and stories. And the result of this divide has been to produce an educated class with an isolated, insular political culture.    [Considering what America's choice of Donald Trump really means]   Religion in most secular institutions, for instance, is at best thought of as an important sociological phenomenon to understand -- but is very often criticized as an inherently violent, backward force in our culture, akin to belief in fairies and dragons. Professors are less religious than the population as a whole. Most campus cultures have strictly (if not formally) enforced dogmatic views about the nature of gender, sexual orientation, a woman's right to choose abortion, guns and the role of the state as primary agent of social change. If anyone disagrees with these dogmatic positions they risk being marginalized as ignorant, bigoted, fanatical or some other dismissive label. Sometimes the college-educated find themselves so unable to understand a particular working-class point of view that they will respond to those perspectives with shocking condescension. Recall that President Obama, in the midst of the 2012 election cycle, suggested that job losses were the reason working-class voters were bitterly clinging ""to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them."" The religious themselves, meanwhile, likely do not chalk their faith up to unhappy economic prospects, and they probably find it hard to connect with politicians who seem to assume such.  Thus today's college graduates are formed by a campus culture that leaves them unable to understand people with unfamiliar or heterodox views on guns, abortion, religion, marriage, gender and privilege. And that same culture leads such educated people to either label those with whom they disagree as bad people or reduce their stated views on these issues as actually being about something else, as in Obama's case. Most college grads in this culture are simply never forced to engage with or seriously consider professors or texts which could provide a genuine, compelling alternative view.   [Trump's victory has enormous consequences for the Supreme Court]   For decades now, U.S. colleges and universities have quite rightly been trying to become more diverse when it comes to race and gender. But this election highlights the fact that our institutions of higher education should use similar methods to cultivate philosophical, theological and political diversity.  These institutions should consider using quotas in hiring that help faculties and administrations more accurately reflect the wide range of norms and values present in the American people. There should be systemwide attempts to have texts assigned in classes written by people from intellectually underrepresented groups. There should be concerted efforts to protect political minorities from discrimination and marginalization, even if their views are unpopular or uncomfortable to consider. The goal of such changes would not be to convince students that their political approaches are either correct or incorrect. The goal would instead be educational: to identify and understand the norms, values, first principles, intuitions and stories which have been traditionally underrepresented in higher education. This would better equip college graduates to engage with the world as it is, including with their fellow citizens.  The alternative, a reduction of all disagreement to racism, bigotry and ignorance -- in addition to being wrong about its primary source -- will simply make the disagreement far more personal, entrenched and vitriolic. And it won't make liberal values more persuasive to the less educated, as Trump victory demonstrates.  It is time to do the hard work of forging the kind of understanding that moves beyond mere dismissal to actual argument. Today's election results indicate that our colleges and universities are places where this hard work is particularly necessary.          1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flare up from opponents of the president-elect.

Trump always believed otherwise and in stunning fashion proved all the experts wrong. But his victory over Hillary Clinton left open the biggest question of all: What kind of president will he be and what kind of country will he lead?  It's impossible to overstate how uncertain the road ahead is at this point. But how will Trump govern, and how effective will he be? His core issues -- trade, immigration, and law and order -- offer clues but no clear road map for the future. Even in pursuit of the goals he outlined in those three areas, his proposals lack real specificity. But then, his campaign was not about policy white papers. It was instead a thumb in the eye of the establishment, an American version of the populist uprisings against open borders and globalization that have been seen in other Western societies. Trump always said he smelled an American Brexit in the making -- a reference to the unexpected victory in Britain in June by those who wanted to take the country out of the European Union. That vote caught the elites and the establishment totally by surprise. It was an uprising that went unseen until it struck. Trump's victory was by far even more shocking. It was the kind of ""can't happen here"" event that will go down as one of the great upsets in political history. What happened Tuesday was a victory powered by an outpouring of voters, overwhelmingly white and many without college degrees, who felt left behind by the economic recovery, ignored by Washington and disdained by the political, cultural and economic elites. In the end, that was enough to topple Clinton and her dream of becoming the first female president in the nation's history. The shock waves will be felt for months and maybe years.  Trump insulted Hispanics, women, a prominent senator who was a former POW, and a disabled reporter. He called for a ban on Muslims entering the country, later modified and softened. Can he make room in the America he now leads for all those who loudly and vigorously opposed his candidacy? Trump suggested he might not accept the outcome of the election if he lost. How will those who oppose him now respond to his victory? Those are far from incidental questions.         1 of 46       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What Election Night looks like as results roll in      View Photos   Americans anxiously await the results of the 2016 election.

Yet even she acknowledged that what fueled his candidacy, at least in part, was the feeling of alienation and economic anxiety on the part of a wide swath of the population. One Clinton adviser described it as ""a quiet rage"" that existed in the privacy of living rooms and around kitchen tables, frustration with the political system and the lack of tangible results from government's actions for many hard-working Americans.  Clinton's ""deplorables"" comment became a rallying cry in the final months of the campaign. Trump attracted an army of loyal followers who saw in him the mechanism to break the hold of those in power and to shake Washington to its core. They also loathed Clinton, no small part of the reason she lost. It was that combination and that power, seen but underestimated during the campaign that produced an election night shocker that sent world markets plunging and left the country on edge. Trump succeeded for many reasons, easier to describe in retrospect than many who view politics through traditional lenses saw throughout the campaign. His mistakes always seemed to overwhelm his attributes. What the experts overlooked was how many people were willing to forgive or discount the most controversial aspects of his candidacy -- and what no one can measure is just how many agreed with what he said. This was an uprising by Americans who had lost faith in institutions. Trump gave them a voice they felt they haven't had in a changing America. Clinton tried to make the campaign all about temperament. As a political strategy, it failed. But that doesn't negate the questions about whether Trump can successfully translate the style of his campaign to the demands of the Oval Office. So many questions now rise up for answers. How will he govern? Can he forge a true working relationship with Republican congressional leaders whom he belittled as they equivocated about his candidacy?  His foreign policy pronouncements lacked both consistency and coherence. He had no fixed ideology. He leaned right on tax cuts and left on trade. He has operated on instinct and impulse. He said whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. What he showed is that huge numbers of Americans cared little about ideological consistency or political correctness. What they wanted was a send-a-message candidate. His most important relationship will be with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). At one point Ryan described Trump's insults about U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel as the definition of racism, yet he still voted for him. As Trump offered his agenda, Ryan countered with one of his own. Whose will take precedence?     The Post's Dan Balz explores some of the factors behind President-elect Donald Trump's victory against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   In the closing weeks of the campaign, Trump went to Gettysburg, Pa., where he laid out an agenda that provides some indication of what he might do. It was a speech akin to the 1994 House Republicans' Contract with America, a series of pledges designed, as Trump put it, ""to drain the swamp"" of privilege and special interests in Washington. Others have promised as much in the past.  This was an election about fundamentals and first principles, bringing to the surface an acrimonious argument about the values and beliefs that provide the underpinnings of any society. It was an election that involved big questions about race, gender, religion and economic inequality, as well as the relationship between the central government and an increasingly distrustful people. It highlighted the gulf between society's elites -- political, economic and cultural -- and the rest of the population. Above all it was a campaign about the identity of a nation. The campaign brought to the fore the tensions of a nation in transition and the pull and tug felt on each side of dividing lines that define far more than just our politics. At its best, this can produce a conversation in which different sides bring heartfelt attitudes about what makes America the great nation it was, is and will be. At its worst, it can give voice to racism and misogyny, anti-Semitism and religious bigotry. The election exposed the rawest edges of a diverse and changing America. The campaign pitted group against group, injected tension into everyday interactions even among friends and neighbors. Social media stoked those tensions and widened the divisions.  Clinton ran a campaign she could never have anticipated. She was thrust into the maelstrom of a Trump-generated cyclone, and she and her campaign tried to adapt on the fly. She represented history in the making, but through much of the campaign the possibility of breaking the gender barrier provided a far more modest lift than Obama received on his way to becoming the nation's first African American president. Trump did what Clinton could not do, delivering margins in predominantly white areas of battleground states that far eclipsed those of Mitt Romney in 2012. Clinton failed to do what she needed, which was to combine elements of the Obama coalition -- Hispanics, African Americans and young voters -- and add to them college-educated white voters turned off by Trump's rhetoric. His rallies were always bigger and more passionate than hers, and on Election Day, that energy helped deliver the victory. Big elections are supposed to help settle some of these disputes, or at least point a direction for the new leader. Yet, as the campaign ended Tuesday, the question remained as to what had been resolved, if anything. No one was prepared to predict what kind of presidency Trump would fashion, only that if it followed the patterns of his campaign, it would continue to divide the country and, at its start, certainly, alarm allies around the world. And yet Trump vowed he could find a way to make it work. Michael Leavitt, the Republican former governor of Utah, said as the polls were closing: ""I think the country is desperate for a jolt of optimism. In their own way, what most people have wanted to find is functionality [in Washington]. Those who support Trump believe the only way you can find functionality is to 'drain the swamp.' "" For months, Americans have been apprehensive as they neared Election Day, never able to turn away from the spectacle that was on their television screens and smartphones. Record numbers watched the debates during the primaries, and the biggest audience ever tuned in for the first of three Clinton-Trump faceoffs this fall.  Everyone knew the campaign was unlike anything they had seen in the past. Everyone wanted it to end. Now it falls to Trump, the unlikely winner of the most traumatic election in memory, to chart the course ahead and try, if he can, to prove that he can lift the whole country out of its morass and make Washington work.
