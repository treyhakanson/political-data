They formed a 20-person-strong unit of a volunteer militia over the summer. They are armed. And they have been training. Baltic leaders, scarred by the Soviet takeover in 1940 that lasted for more than half a century, are worried that they could be cut out of any deal that Trump makes with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The president-elect repeatedly praised Putin on the campaign trail as a stronger leader than President Obama and has vowed to prioritize cooperation with the Kremlin on anti-terrorism efforts. Trump and Putin spoke on the phone on Monday in a conversation that made no mention of Russia's annexation of Crimea or support for rebels in eastern Ukraine, according to the Kremlin.  [Kremlin: Trump, Putin agree in call to improve U.S.-Russia relations]  Here in Latvia, a nation of 2 million where the annual government budget is one-sixtieth what the United States spends on its military alone, security officials are responding to the U.S. push to bolster their military capabilities in big and small ways. That includes the scrappy effort to protect the Defense Ministry, a fallback plan that employees were preparing even before Trump's victory.   ""We will have weapons in the ministry and we will be ready to defend ourselves,"" said Defense Ministry State Secretary Janis Garisons, a mild-mannered former diplomat who is the senior civil servant in the ministry -- and who has been drilling with his colleagues since summertime. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2004 and received commitments of thousands of allied troops just this summer. But they were spooked by Trump's campaign-time view that NATO was ""obsolete"" and his vow that he would not automatically come to the aid of U.S. allies if they were attacked by Russia and instead would review ""if they fulfill their obligations to us."" Now Baltic leaders are waiting to see how Trump actually shapes his evolving relationship toward Putin and NATO. Mindful that Baltic states have little ability to shape U.S. policy, many here say that they have no choice but to continue with their current plans, which include bolstering defense spending above their NATO commitments. But Latvian officials also say they are ramping up planning for the last-ditch scenario if they need to fend off Russia on their own. Though the countries would be vastly outmatched if the Kremlin invaded using its conventional forces, they say they have the will to mount a fierce insurgency. Latvia is expanding its part-time volunteer force, the National Guard, to 8,000 people and in the wake of Trump's election hopes to push the numbers higher. Estonia has enrolled more than 25,000 volunteers in its similar Defense League. Lithuania has published guides about what to do in case of Russian invasion. ""The dreams that Americans or God will save us, it's somehow over,"" said Artis Pabriks, a former Latvia defense minister who is now a lawmaker in the European Parliament. ""We simply have to stick to the view that if something should happen, we will fight like the Finns in 1939, so the West will have to help us."" Angst about Trump suffused Latvian Independence Day celebrations Friday, even making its way into the official benediction at the 13th-century Riga Cathedral as leaders and military officials prayed for Latvia's continued freedom. The service ended with Latvia's national anthem, which was a crime to sing during the half-century of Russian domination that ended in 1991. ""For the first time we're worried about our future, our kids,"" said Ivars Aboltins, 41, a civil engineer who brought his family to the banks of the Daugava River on Friday to watch a military parade marking the holiday. A handful of U.S., British and Canadian troops stationed in the country also took part. ""At home, we don't talk about politics, but he can tell we're worried,"" Aboltins said of his 8-year-old son. But amid the concerns, Latvians also take comfort that despite the country's size, they believe it has pulled its weight in recent years. Latvian forces fought alongside U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, and seven soldiers were killed.  ""We are not going to panic,"" said Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics. ""We really don't see the end of the world as we know it."" He noted that Presidents George W. Bush and Obama also tried to reset relations with Putin before abandoning those efforts when the Kremlin proved more obstreperous than they expected. Despite the concerns from national leaders, voices in Latvia's ethnic Russian minority, which is about a third of the population, welcome the prospect of reconciliation between the United States and Russia. ""If we can get back to the relations we had in 2013,"" before the Crimean annexation, ""we'd welcome that,"" said Nils Usakovs, the mayor of Riga and the leader of the Harmony Center party, which draws most of its support from Russian speakers. ""It was very relaxed. There was trade, tourism."" Over the summer, the United States, Britain, Canada and Germany committed to lead battalions of about a thousand troops each in Latvia, Poland, Lithuania and Estonia. Despite Trump's questioning of NATO, the U.S. troops who will be deploying to Poland early next year have already begun the complex logistical arrangements to transit across the ocean. And it is unclear whether the new president would be willing to accept the international opprobrium that would come from backing down on the plans. ""People who go to Moscow and think we can offer peace in our time, they don't understand that from every encounter like that, Putin takes something very substantial,"" said Juri Luik, the head of the International Center for Defense and Security, based in Tallinn, Estonia . ""If you are ready to give it to him, you have to be ready to look like a real loser, someone who rolls over and plays dead."" Still, some leaders here say they fear the Trump administration may abandon long-term commitments to NATO or the U.S. advocacy of sanctions against Russia -- and they say that if the United States backs out, European nations may be quick to follow. On a tour of Europe this week, Obama said that Trump was committed to NATO. But many U.S. allies would prefer to hear that from Trump. Most officials here doubt that their security is immediately on the line. Trump's apparent unpredictability may lead Putin to be cautious about making mischief inside NATO countries -- and Trump even said before the election that under his command, the U.S. military would shoot down Russian jets if they showed disrespect by buzzing U.S. ships and planes. Unlike in Ukraine, which the Kremlin appears to covet because of its historical ties to Russia, Baltic officials say they feel they are targets only because attacking them would challenge NATO and the European Union as a whole. ""If President Trump could work a deal with President Putin that would reverse the annexation of Crimea, remove all Russian troops from Ukraine and remove the buildup of troops on the Baltic border, then we say more power to him,"" said Ojars Kalnins, the chairman of the foreign-affairs committee in Latvia's parliament. ""But if a good relationship is at the expense of the Ukrainian people or security on our borders, that does trouble us."" Kalnins and other Baltic lawmakers are planning a trip to Washington in early December to meet with Republicans in Congress in a bid to appeal to their traditionally hawkish position on Russia. It remains unclear how much influence the Republican establishment will have on Trump's foreign policy. Trump is expected to award his most influential national security position to retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency who astonished his former colleagues by traveling to Moscow last year and sitting next to Putin at a gala dinner sponsored by Russia Today, the state-owned Russian television network. Flynn has called for tighter ties with Putin to battle the Islamic State in Syria. ""It's a present, current security threat for us. We do not need to be told that it is. We know it,"" said Lolita Cigane, who is the head of the European-affairs committee in the Latvian parliament and said she is counting on Trump to hold to U.S. commitments.  But her family has a fallback, she said: Her husband recently signed up for the National Guard.  Read more:           Russian warplanes keep buzzing the Baltics. Here's how NATO scrambles.

In a strongly-worded statement, London-based Amnesty International urged President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on Friday not to sign the proposed law, calling it ""draconian"" and the ""most repressive"" for the authority it gives the government over civil society work. The call comes days after the parliament, packed with el-Sissi supporters, voted in favor of the law. It was debated for only two days, and comes into immediate effect once ratified by el-Sissi. Among the new law's provisions, groups carrying out field research and surveys without permission could be punished by up to five years in prison. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

About 500 police officers were deployed in anticipation of protests outside the meeting at a swanky resort in the northeast city of Fajardo, a one-hour drive from the capital of San Juan. But the protest in Fajardo was small and peaceful, while a clash came in San Juan, where demonstrators pushed into the board president's office floor as they clutched Puerto Rican flags made in black and white to signify mourning and called the board a ""dictatorship."" The nearly six-hour meeting in Fajardo was closed to the public, unlike the previous two other meetings in New York. Board members warned they will have to make very hard decisions in upcoming months as the island struggles to overcome a decade-long economic crisis and pushes to restructure nearly $70 billion in public debt.  ""The current situation is unsustainable for all stakeholders,"" said Carlos Garcia, one of the seven board members. ""We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rebuild this."" Friday's meeting focused mostly on a 10-year fiscal plan that Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla submitted last month as he warned of a $58 billion financing gap in the next decade. Critics who testified during the meeting said the fiscal plan was weak, incomplete and does not allow for negotiations with creditors hit with multimillion-dollar defaults. Among the more outspoken people opposed to Puerto Rico not paying its debt was Jorge Irizarry, executive director of a local group representing Puerto Rico bondholders. He said creditors are ready to work with Puerto Rico officials and his group would accept the government not paying principal for the next five years.  ""All creditors are willing to make concessions,"" he said. ""Puerto Rico can work its way out of this."" Puerto Rico has defaulted on nearly $1.4 billion worth of bond payments since August 2015, and the government warned this week that it will run out of money by February if a debt moratorium that expires that month is not extended. Irizarry, however, told the board that the moratorium should be repealed to help move negotiations with creditors forward. Board President Jose Carrion III said members will approve a fiscal plan by Jan. 31, but stressed that the proposed plan needs to be revised, in part because it assumes a lot of federal help.  ""What troubles me the most about the plan is that I view it as a missed opportunity,"" he said. ""Puerto Rico is likely not to receive everything that this government is asking for. One needs to be realistic when planning and budgeting."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

The newspaper claimed Friday that two payments from Oryx Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), an investment fund linked to the Qatari government, were made to Pamodzi Sports Marketing in October and November 2011, days before the vote. Pamodzi is held by Papa Massata Diack, a former marketing consultant at the IAAF who has been banned for allegations of extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars from a Russian marathon runner to avoid a doping ban before the 2012 Olympics. Qatar eventually lost out to London but was later awarded the 2019 worlds. Papa Massata Diack is the son of former IAAF president Lamine Diack. Interpol has issued a global notice for his arrest in connection with a separate French corruption investigation that also implicates his father. According to Le Monde, which claims the documents were gathered by U.S tax authorities, a bank transfer of nearly $3 million was made to Pamodzi on Oct. 13, 2011, with another nearing $500,000 sent on Nov. 7, four days before London won the vote. In an email to The Associated Press, the IAAF declined to comment since the case is currently being investigated. Papa Massata Diack is also at the center of a French investigation into possible corruption in the bidding for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In ""Bellevue: Three Centuries of Medicine and Mayhem at America's Most Storied Hospital,"" David Oshinsky has written a meticulous, if somewhat too narrowly focused, history that lays out the progress of medicine in the United States as well as the contextual history within which it has unfolded.  Bellevue was one of the first public hospitals in North America. From its first incarnation as a small infirmary in the 1660s up to its role in the AIDS crisis and beyond, it has been central to the invention of the American hospital as we know it. Oshinsky's narrative reveals how hospitals, once a public service only for desperate people unable to pay a doctor to visit them at home, became the central locus of modern health care.  Bellevue contained an almshouse in its early days, and one of its buildings more recently served as a homeless shelter; no one, sick or otherwise, has ever been too destitute for its charity. Oshinsky delineates the squalor in which impoverished immigrants have lived in New York and the pestilence associated with their misery. He writes of the hospital's function in times of plague: yellow fever, cholera, puerperal fever, tuberculosis, swine flu, AIDS, even Ebola. Unlike many parallel institutions, Bellevue has never turned away incurable patients, offering them whatever mitigating treatment was possible, often risking doctors' lives in the process.  Oshinsky's book also chronicles the gradual professionalization of medicine, describing the 18th-century grave robbers who enabled early medical students to learn anatomy and how those amateurish operations evolved into the highly competitive, technologically sophisticated medical schools of today. The author traces the invention of the modern American civilian ambulance following the use of medical evacuation vehicles during the Civil War. He describes the infancy of anesthesia in the mid-19th century. He takes us through the gunfire to which Presidents Abraham Lincoln and James Garfield succumbed. He reflects on the debates about germ theory, quoting the once-prevalent medical wisdom that the removal of a bullet should always be done with the ""thumb and fore-finger,"" usually unwashed, a prejudice that endured even after the advent of sterile procedures.    ""Bellevue: Three Centuries of Medicine and Mayhem at America's Most Storied Hospital,"" by David Oshinsky (Doubleday)  He reports on how Florence Nightingale's visionary practice of nursing in the Crimean War provided a model for the nursing school at Bellevue, where only women who were ""moral"" and ""cultivated"" were allowed to assist; he also recounts the hospital's flirtation with training male nurses, which was quashed by scandal amid rumors of homosexuality. He reviews the popularization of circumcision, led by a Bellevue physician. He depicts the emergence of a ""chest service"" in the 1920s that affiliated cardiology and pulmonology.  Oshinsky writes with particular vigor of Bellevue's refusal to subscribe to popular prejudices, noting that the hospital welcomed Jewish doctors as well as Christian ones, female doctors as well as male ones, and African American staff as well as Caucasian. Implicitly, he tells the story of a nation riven with bigotry, where the social advancement of stigmatized groups was contingent on their irrefutable courage, brilliance and ingenuity. He is particularly impassioned about the achievements of early female doctors.  In the public imagination, Bellevue is synonymous with psychiatry, but its psychiatric facility did not achieve real prominence until the late 19th century, though the hospital had long included a small wing for the insane. In the 1840s, the issue of mixing the mentally ill with the physically ill began to attract troubling notice. ""The invalid, the aged, the infirm, the vagrant, and half lunatic [are] now confined together, and are allowed the most unrestrained intercourse,"" a grand jury reported, calling such arrangements an affront to ""every Christian."" Journalist Nellie Bly, in a famous 1887 undercover assignment, exposed the appalling conditions in which the mentally ill were being held for supposed treatment. Funding for and attention to their care soon increased by vast multiples.  Doctors at Bellevue have since championed some of what came to be seen as best practices and some of what came to be seen as the worst. Locked wards for the criminally insane engendered their own legal system, allowing people to be tried before a clinically trained judge in a hospital courtroom. Oshinsky narrates Lauretta Bender's alarming midcentury experiments using electroconvulsive therapy for children with a broad range of diagnoses, some of whom seem to have been helped and many of whom were certainly traumatized.  All in all, Oshinsky portrays ""a place where bold, creative, if sometimes bizarre and Frankenstein-like, experimentation prevailed."" The gist of the book is that caring for impoverished populations, criminals, the insane and AIDS victims has always been steeply challenging work that all too often goes unacknowledged. It makes you feel better about humanity to learn about people who have chosen this noble work over the centuries; indeed, Oshinsky's greatest strength may be his capacity for admiration. But seldom do we really get to know these people; they appear in vignettes -- largely professional ones -- until the AIDS chapter, where he expands more liberally on the personalities involved.  If you are already interested in the history of Bellevue, this is the book for you; if you are not thus invested, you may not feel compelled to stick out some of the tough sledding. Oshinsky has done a great deal of homework, and his researcher's pride in detail leads him to provide a weight of gratuitous information -- long sequences about how one building was designed, another built, yet another planned but never built, and who in which office of the city government favored or opposed a particular project. We get a rather too-thorough roster of hospital administrators. ""Bellevue"" is curiously lacking in emotional punch, expressing an almost hagiographic veneration for the very real accomplishments of the hospital, its doctors and its programs, but without deeply moving the reader. You find much to respect about medical progress, but your heart does not swell with the advancements. The prose can be academic even when the content has the potential to be electrifying.  Oshinsky also has an irritating habit of overstating the case. He is given to assertions such as ""The stakes for American medicine could hardly have been higher,"" or ""A political tragedy of epic proportion struck the United States, bringing esoteric terms like Germ Theory and antisepsis into the national dialogue in an unimaginable way,"" or ""These two men didn't simply revolutionize the field of forensics science, they were the field.""  The history of Bellevue is not the story of American medicine. It is a story within the bigger context of American medicine, and Oshinsky does a less-than-adequate job of universalizing from his material. Despite frequent digressions into social history or the larger medical narrative, the book remains more descriptive than insightful; the author seldom looks up from the story he is telling.  Though Oshinsky paints the dire medical circumstances poor people face and contrasts them with the experiences of those with means, we hear little of the long-running public debate about whether health care is a right or a luxury. Though he comments on the hard-pressed staff at an underfunded and crumbling facility, he doesn't pursue the social factors that have enabled such decay. He brings up private hospitals, but he never really unpacks the class privilege that has engendered our tiered system of care. Aside from brief allusions to physicians who immigrated or trained abroad, he makes no parallels between the development of public health care in the United States and its more liberal growth in Europe.    Without this context, his narrative of Bellevue feels admirable but limited, a lively rendition of a hospital's history but not a book relevant, as it might have been, to the ongoing crisis in American health care.

Conceding Hillary Clinton's staggering loss, Obama vowed to do all he could to facilitate a smooth transition and to ensure Trump would be well-positioned to run the country when he takes office Jan. 20. In a brief conversation, he'd congratulated Trump by phone and invited him to sit down together Thursday at the White House.  ""We all want what's best for this country,"" Obama said. Obama delivered his sunny call for unity while standing in the Rose Garden, much as his predecessor President George W. Bush did after Obama's victory in 2008. It was a symbolic moment meant to signal the calm transfer of power from one president to the next. But it was also a bit of counseling for devastated Democrats. Obama spoke to more than a hundred of his White House staffers, who stood silently, dazed, some crying, before breaking out into a prolonged round of applause that continued long after Obama returned to the Oval Office. Obama made no direct reference to Trump's vows to erase much of what Obama has accomplished. He downplayed the notion that Trump's presidency would mean an about-face for the nation. He said the U.S. has a tendency to ""zig and zag"" rather than move in a straight line, and he added, ""That's OK."" Obama remarks were striking after a campaign in which the Democrats declared Trump was unfit to serve and Obama told voters that ""the fate of the republic"" rested on defeating Trump. The brief call between Obama and Trump in the wee hours of Wednesday, after Trump claimed victory, was a ""warm conversation"" and a ""gracious exchange,"" Trump's campaign manager said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans would first target the heart of Obama's legacy, the health care law they have tried and failed to repeal since it was passed in 2010. With control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, they'll soon be in position to virtually gut it. It's not clear exactly how Trump and GOP allies would go about it. But Republicans last year passed legislation that eliminated Obama's Medicaid expansion, government subsidies for insurance bought on marketplaces and some new taxes used to cover costs. The replacement would have increased the number of uninsured by about 22 million, according to nonpartisan analysts. Obama vetoed it. White House officials said they could continue to make the case against repeal as they walked out the door. But they were largely left hoping that Republicans wouldn't follow through on their repeal pledge, once put in the uncomfortable position of taking away people's health insurance. Other parts of Obama's legacy even more vulnerable, largely because he's relied on executive actions. A hefty list of Obama's initiatives rest on regulation, executive orders or unenforceable international agreements the next president is under little obligation to follow. Trump has supported reinstating waterboarding and other extreme forms of torture that Obama banned. He's also vowed to tear up Obama's immigration actions and discard the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal Obama painstakingly negotiated. The Republican has pledged to ""cancel"" U.S. participation in the international Paris climate change deal. Withdrawing would take four years under the terms of the agreement, but Trump could also decide to simply ignore its U.S. commitments to reduce carbon emission. Trump has also criticized Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran. But he's suggested he wants to renegotiate it, rather than scrap it. It's unclear, though, how he might persuade Iran to accept less favorable terms. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest tried to be optimistic, arguing it wasn't a given that Trump would follow through on vows to roll back Obama's key accomplishments.  ""I think it is too early to tell what decisions Trump will make and what impact they will have in the priorities that President Obama has so proudly achieved,"" Earnest said. ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP and Kathleen Hennessey at http://twitter.com/khennessey Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The U.S. Secret Service later said in a statement that it took action after ""an unidentified individual shouted 'gun'"" in front of the stage. Agents apprehended the person, but found no gun, the statement said, adding that an investigation into the incident continues. The man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites, 33, was released shortly after the incident, according to reports. He said he was holding a ""Republicans against Trump"" sign.  ""When I pulled out the sign, people around me were trying to grab the sign,"" Crites told reporters, according to reports on the local Fox and NBC affiliate websites. ""And so all that was occurring was booing, of course. That's what you would expect."" People from the surrounding crowd tackled him, Crites said. They started ""kicking me and grabbing me in the crotch and just, just beating the crap out of me,"" Crites said.      View Graphic      Trump concluded his rally without further incident. The GOP presidential nominee later released a statement thanking the Secret Service and local law enforcement for their ""fast and professional response,"" adding that ""nothing will stop us -- we will make America great again!"" Meanwhile, a press bus carrying reporters covering Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen Tim Kaine's stops in Florida was hit at high speed, according to reporters traveling with the senator. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Kaine was several cars ahead of the press bus, according to reporters in his motorcade. Earlier in the day, Hillary Clinton's campaign announced she will campaign in Michigan on Monday, as polls show her once-comfortable lead in the state eroding and as Trump eyes it as a potential way to come from behind in the hunt for electoral votes. That announcement from the Clinton campaign came as Trump also rejiggered his itinerary, making plans for last-minute stops in Virginia, where Clinton has led but Republicans are catching up.  The GOP nominee spent Saturday hopscotching the country, rallying with supporters in North Carolina, as well as Florida, Colorado   and Nevada  -- and he announced plans to visit Minnesota, a traditionally Democratic state where polls showing him trailing by about five points. In his speech in Nevada late Saturday, Trump attacked elections officials for allowing a predominantly Hispanic early voting site in the Las Vegas area to stay open for ""hours and hours."" President Obama will also campaign in Michigan on Monday, suggesting that Democrats see danger signs there. Clinton will be in Grand Rapids, Obama in Ann Arbor. Former president Bill Clinton will make a stop in Lansing on Sunday.     What one state shows us about political polarization View Graphic     What one state shows us about political polarization   [Clinton maintains narrow four-point edge, pushing past concerns about honesty]  ""There are just three days left in this most consequential election,"" Clinton told a cheering crowd of about 10,000 an open-air rally and concert in Philadelphia on Saturday night. Clinton noted the millions of people of have voted early and urged Pennsylvania voters to help ""send a message"" about American values and ideals. ""I believe they are standing up for a hopeful, inclusive vision of America and I'm asking you to stand up for that same vision,"" Clinton said. Over the last two weeks much of Clinton's focus has been on Florida and North Carolina, as well as Nevada, where early voting is now winding down.  But her campaign manager Robby Mook, conceded to reporters on Saturday that ""we have seen tightening in the Midwest generally this cycle, and we are taking that seriously."" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters Saturday that in addition to a previously announced stop in Manchester, N.H., on Sunday night, Clinton will add a rally in Cleveland earlier Sunday. On Monday in addition to Michigan, Clinton will add a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. Another large evening rally had also been announced for Philadelphia that night. Palmieri said that Khizr Khan will speak at the New Hampshire rally. Khan is the father of fallen soldier Humayun Khan, whose challenge to Trump over the Republican's proposed ban on Muslim immigration was among the most memorable moments of the Democratic convention. Trump's focus on Saturday night was Nevada, where polls show the race tied. Campaigning in Reno, Trump denounced a decision by elections officials to keep open an early voting site ""for hours and hours.""  Early voting totals in Clark County, Nev., which encompasses Las Vegas, topped 57,000, according to local officials. A supermarket doubling as an early-voting site in the county was allowed to stay open for two additional hours on Friday night as thousands of people remained in line to vote. It is customary for state elections officials across the country to authorize keeping a polling site open later if there are long lines at closing time.  Regardless, Trump claimed that officials allowed Clinton supporters to ""bus and bring Democratic voters in. Folks, it's a rigged system. It's a rigged system and we're going to beat it. We're going to beat it. I've been saying it's a rigged system.""  [An early sign Trump is being out-organized: A big Democratic advantage in Nevada voting]  Trump continued his emphasis on Clinton's emails controversy throughout the day Saturday, citing the FBI's announcement last week that it would revive an inquiry into her use of a private email server at the State Department. In Reno, he said that if Clinton were elected, her presidency would lead to ""an unprecedented constitutional crisis."" ""We could very well have a sitting president under felony indictment and ultimately a criminal trial. It would grind government to a halt, of course that's what we have right now under Obama anyway,"" he told the crowd in Reno. ""We need a government that can work, and work well from day one for the American people. That would be impossible with Hillary Clinton, the prime suspect in a far-reaching criminal investigation."" In the aftermath of the event's disruption, when security officers removed Trump from the stage and later said they found no weapon, Trump campaign aides and the candidate's son, Donald Trump Jr., retweeted a supporter who credited Trump for returning to the stage after an ""assassination attempt"" and noted that Clinton had cut an event short earlier Saturday in Florida because of rain. Trump, Pence and key campaign surrogates also will swing through Virginia this weekend and into Monday. Trump will hold a 10 p.m. rally Sunday at a fairgrounds in the Northern Virginia swing territory of Loudoun County, his campaign announced on Saturday. Pence was scheduled to appear at a suburban Richmond Saturday afternoon and at a rally at George Mason University at 8 p.m. Saturday. Two of Trump's children -- Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump -- are planning stops in Northern Virginia on Sunday and Monday, respectively. In the closing days of the campaign, polling averages compiled by The Washington Post continue to show a close contest in several battleground states. In Michigan, Clinton now holds just a two-point edge over Trump, 43 to 41 percent. She also holds a slim lead in New Hampshire (43-41), which accounts for the renewed attention there in the closing days.  In Colorado, Clinton is up 43 percent to 41 percent. In Arizona, Trump leads by three points (46-43). Clinton is ahead by six points in New Mexico (40-34) and five points in North Carolina (48-43), Pennsylvania (47-42) and Wisconsin (45-40). She's up by four points in Virginia (45-41).  Trump holds a five-point lead in Ohio (46-41), where Clinton held a star-studded campaign rally on Friday night with rapper Jay-Z and Beyonce, his wife. The race remains tick-tock tight in Nevada, where the candidates are tied at 44 percent each. In Florida, Clinton has a one-point, 47 to 46 percent advantage. Trump leads in Georgia (47-45); Iowa (46-41); and Utah (35-28) where third-party candidate Evan McMullin has been polling well.  Poll averages calculated by The Washington Post for Clinton and Trump reflect recent polls that also include McMullin, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein where they are on the ballot and where results are available. As the race enters its final stretch, the Clinton campaign continues to push back aggressively against the FBI's decision to revive the inquiry into Clinton's email. Campaigning in Florida on Saturday, Kaine (D-Va.), the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, sharply criticized the FBI and its director, James Comey, for the development. In an interview with the Fusion television network, Kaine faulted Comey for breaking agency protocol by discussing a politically sensitive case so close to an election.  Comey's decision to alert Congress about his review of the Clinton case ""suggests that it's probably more likely explained that [Comey] knew that the FBI is not only a leaky sieve but there were people within the FBI actively working -- actively working -- to try to help the Trump campaign,"" Kaine said. ""This just absolutely staggering, and it is a massive blow to the integrity of [the FBI].""

(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: One in five voters in 2012 were college-educated white women. Mitt Romney won them by six points, according to exit polls. Our fresh Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll, which has Hillary Clinton ahead by just two points among all likely voters nationally, finds that Donald Trump is losing college-educated white women by 27 points. If the Republican nominee were anywhere close to Romney's 52 percent support level among this traditionally Republican-leaning constituency, he would likely win the election. But drilling into the crosstabs of our polling and reviewing credible, state-level data demonstrate how highly unlikely it is that this constituency will waver in the final days. It is one of the reasons that, even though the race has tightened pretty dramatically, Clinton retains a significant structural advantage.    A supporter holds a sign as Hillary Clinton speaks in Manchester, N.H. (Scott Eisen/Getty Images)   A gender gap is nothing new. Democrats tend to perform exceptionally well with unmarried and minority women. A Pew study in July found that there was no difference in candidate support between men and women in 1972 and 1976, but since 1980 women writ large have preferred Democratic presidential candidates by an average of eight points. Our national tracking polling shows that the race has moved back toward something close to this historic norm. Men prefer Trump by 11 points (51-40) and women prefer Clinton by 11 points (52-41). Clinton is ahead only 11 points among women overall because Trump is running up his margin among white women without college degrees. They favor him by 28 points, 61 percent to 33 percent, despite the dozen women who have now come forward publicly to accuse him of sexual misconduct. But the preference for Clinton among college-educated, white women matters a great deal because they habitually turn out to vote at higher rates than almost every other group of voters, including less-educated women. So, in an election with lagging enthusiasm, this constituency packs a bigger punch.    A young girl looks up to watch Clinton speak in Tempe. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- The chasm among women is getting picked up in several battleground surveys. The Post's Virginia poll this week, conducted with the Schar School, found Clinton up six points overall. She led by 14 points among white women with a college degree, and Trump was ahead by 39 points among non-college white women. The Marquette Law School poll, released yesterday afternoon, placed Clinton up six points in Wisconsin. Hillary is ahead by 21 points among college-educated white women and two points among non-college white women. ""It's just brutal,"" said Ted Kanavas, a former Wisconsin GOP state senator who co-chaired Romney's 2012 campaign in the state and reluctantly supports Trump. ""The gender gap is important and very real. It's been a trashy election. The race that [Trump] ran has made for a trashy election. So we've got to acknowledge that, and next time we've got to do better.""    Melania, Tiffany and Ivanka Trump cut the ribbon at the Trump International Hotel last week. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)   -- The Trump campaign is trying to make a late play for college-educated white women. His wife, Melania, will give a speech today in the Philadelphia suburbs, her first public address since the Republican National Convention, when she plagiarized Michelle Obama's 2008 convention speech. The campaign said she will preview ""the kind of first lady she will be."" Meanwhile, Ivanka Trump will make four stops -- starting the day in the Detroit suburbs and then flying to New Hampshire for talks in Manchester, Hollis and Nashua. These are suburbs where Donald is underperforming. Lara Trump, Eric's wife, is traveling around Ohio as part of a ""Women's Tour,"" accompanied by two African American women with a following on YouTube (Diamond and Silk), her husband's executive assistant and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault. These might not be the best surrogates to woo the kinds of college-educated women Trump needs, but they will probably still be more effective than Jeff Sessions, the Alabama senator who was recently deployed to Iowa to headline a ""Women for Trump"" event....  -- Clinton has explicitly focused on women in her closing argument. She stumped in Florida on Tuesday with Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe whom Trump called ""Miss Piggy."" Clinton is on TV with a 60-second spot that features clips of Trump saying that letting women work outside the home is dangerous, that he goes ""through the roof"" if dinner is not ready when he arrives home and bragging about being able to grab women by their genitals because he is a celebrity. Trump is also seen in the ad talking about going into dressing rooms to look at underage girls as they change. -- Many of the final ads in down-ballot races are aimed at female voters. Evan Bayh's wife Susan, for example, talks to camera in his closing commercial about how the former Indiana senator trying to make a comeback was her ""nurse"" after she was diagnosed with brain cancer:  House Majority PAC, the main Democratic outside group focused on the House, uses the ""Access Hollywood"" video in several of its closing spots. Hitting the Republican candidate in an open seat just west of Philadelphia, a female narrator says: ""He supports Trump even after he was caught bragging about sexually assaulting women. Despite Trump calling women bimbos, dogs, disgusting and fat pigs, [Lloyd] Smucker supports Trump stronger than ever.""  Vulnerable Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who rescinded her Trump endorsement after the 2005 video emerged, told a New Hampshire radio station yesterday that she would not want her teenage daughter to be alone with either Trump or Bill Clinton.

""The officials said that Comey was told that there were new emails before he received a formal briefing last Thursday, although the precise timing is unclear."" The information goes beyond the details provided in the letter that Comey sent to lawmakers last week, in which he declared that he was briefed just one day before his announcement about the additional emails. -- Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, the Wall Street Journal's Devlin Barrett and Christopher M. Matthews report. Agents, using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption probes, thought they had found enough material to merit ""aggressively"" pursuing the foundation investigation that began in 2015, based on claims made in the conservative book ""Clinton Cash."" Beginning in February, FBI investigators and public-corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other -- laying bare tensions that still exist today. The roots of the dispute reportedly lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, broadly centered on whether Clinton Foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the State Department. ""At the center of the tension stood the U.S. attorney for Brooklyn, Robert Capers, who some at the FBI came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear,"" the Journal reports.    -- President Obama faulted Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation, addressing the FBI director's decision for the first time in an interview and emphasizing there is ""no evidence"" that Clinton violated the law. ""I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations, we don't operate on innuendo, and we don't operate on incomplete information, and we don't operate on leaks,"" Obama told NowThis News. ""We operate based on concrete decisions that are made. When this was investigated thoroughly last time, the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department ... was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn't anything there that was prosecutable."" (David Nakamura) -- The North Carolina teen who reportedly received the lewd ""sexts"" from Anthony Weiner triggering the events leading to this 11th-hour donnybrook blasted Comey, accusing the FBI director of putting politics ahead of her own well-being and subjecting her to a rash of unwanted media attention. ""The FBI asked for me to speak to the media as little as possible. I have tried to stay quiet, but Comey has upset me,"" the now 16-year-old told BuzzFeed (though she isn't named in the story). ""The last thing that I wanted was to have this become political propaganda. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators. I thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated ... my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. I have been even been blamed for ... costing Hillary the election. Why couldn't your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle? I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me."" -- Weiner has checked himself into a sexual addiction treatment center, according to an unconfirmed Daily Mail report. (Emily Heil) -- The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), suggested that Republicans may try to impeach Clinton after she takes office. ""Assuming she wins, and the investigation goes forward, and it looks like an indictment is pending at that point in time,"" he said on Fox News. ""Under the Constitution, the House of Representatives would engage in an impeachment trial. They would go to the Senate and impeachment proceedings and removal would take place."" (Washington Examiner)    Hairdresser Deir Dos Santos and investment manager Gina Miller, the two lead claimants in a case at England's High Court, welcome the court's ruling today that the British government requires parliamentary approval to trigger the process of exiting the European Union.    -- A British court dealt a ""severe blow"" to Prime Minister Theresa May's plans to begin the Brexit process next year, ruling that she first must obtain Parliament's approval before acting. From Griff Witte: The decision ""greatly complicates"" May's stated plan to trigger Article 50 by the end of March at the latest, and will involve members of a Parliament that largely opposed the Brexit this summer. May will now have to decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court -- a move that could extend proceedings well into next year. -- Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke participated in a U.S. Senate debate at Dillard University, sparking violent student protests over his appearance at the historically black college in New Orleans. ""No Duke, no KKK, no fascist U.S.A.,"" students chanted outside the venue. Duke, who is polling in the low single digits to replace the retiring David Vitter, attacked Jews and the media during rambling tirades. The voters of Louisiana are poised to soundly reject him and his hateful ideology next week. (Travis M. Andrews recaps. Esquire also just posted a long profile of Duke by Olivia Nuzzi.)

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   FRESH POLLS SHOW A TIGHTENED RACE: -- In The Post-ABC tracking poll, enthusiasm for Clinton is back on par with enthusiasm for Trump after a dropoff. Over the weekend, after the FBI announcement, 43 percent of Clinton supporters in our tracking poll said they were ""very enthusiastic,"" below Trump's 53 percent. Trump's advantage in enthusiasm has shrunk to only two points in the last two days of interviewing. Now 48 percent of Clinton supporters call themselves ""very enthusiastic,"" compared to 50 percent for Trump. (Our pollsters Scott Clement and Emily Guskin explores this further here.) -- The CBS-New York Times poll shows Clinton up three percentage points (45-42) nationally. She was up nine in their mid-October survey. Six in 10 voters said Comey's bombshell announcement is unlikely to change their vote. Another third say it makes them less likely to cast their vote for Clinton. -- CNN-ORC polling puts Clinton up two in Florida and four in Pennsylvania. Trump tops her by four in Nevada and five in Arizona.  -- WBUR shows Trump up one in New Hampshire (40-39), with Kelly Ayotte ahead by six. Clinton led by three in their poll three weeks ago. Both results are well within the margin of error. The survey was in the field Saturday through Tuesday, immediately after the Comey news. -- The University of Denver has Clinton and Trump tied in Colorado at 41 percent. Clinton holds a 45-38 advantage among early voters, however. -- Quinnipiac University has Clinton leading by five in Pennsylvania, three in North Carolina and one in Florida. Trump holds a five-point lead in Ohio. -- Monmouth University finds Clinton up four in Pennsylvania. She led by 10 in October and eight in August. Democratic Senate candidate challenger Katie McGinty leads Republican incumbent Pat Toomey by three. The race was tied in October, while McGinty had a four-point lead in the summer. -- A Fox 2 Detroit Mitchell Poll finds Clinton's lead eroding in Michigan to only three points.

Clinton remains the favorite (in both the popular and electoral votes), though a less comfortable one than a week ago."" ""In the fight for the Senate, Republicans are now close to even money to hold their majority,"" Stu adds. ""Open-seat hopeful Joseph J. Heck (R-Nev.), Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Sen.

Obama greets supporters at a rally for Clinton. (Reuters/Kevin Lamarque)   THE AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTE: -- President Obama expressed concern about early data that shows lower-than-expected black voter turnout in critical states, including North Carolina and Florida. ""The African American vote right now is not as solid as it needs to be,"" Obama said on ""The Tom Joyner Morning Show,"" explaining that his record is on the line. ""I need everybody to understand that everything we've done is dependent on being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things I believe in."" A few hours later, he hit the theme again in North Carolina: ""So I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders."" (Greg Jaffe) -- Alarmed by the problematic numbers, Democrats are going into overdrive to activate African Americans.

It will run in Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina. (Listen here.) The Democratic National Committee launched another radio ad titled ""When You Vote,"" which will air on urban stations in those same states (as well as markets like St. Louis, Milwaukee and Indianapolis). It features the president saying, ""Civility is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Respect for women is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Equality is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot."" (Listen here.)  -- The Republican National Committee responded last night by releasing its own ad aimed at black voters, but the narrator notably does not mention or allude to Trump at any point during the 30 seconds. She merely says ""vote Republican"" over stock footage of smiling African Americans. The committee said it will air on BET and TVOne. -- Meanwhile, white nationalists are plotting an Election Day show of force, with the KKK, neo-Nazis and militias detailing plans to monitor urban polling places in a bid to suppress the black vote. From Politico's Ben Schreckinger: ""Neo-Nazi leader Andrew Anglin plans to muster thousands of poll watchers across all 50 states. His partners at the alt-right website 'the Right Stuff' are touting plans to set up hidden cameras at polling places in Philadelphia and hand out liquor and marijuana in the city's 'ghetto' on Election Day to induce residents to stay home. The National Socialist Movement, various factions of the Ku Klux Klan and the white nationalist American Freedom Party all are deploying members to watch polls, either 'informally' or, they say, through the Trump campaign."" (The Southern Poverty Law Center said Anglin and his cronies are ""serial exaggerators."")    THE DAILY DONALD: -- Trump struggled to stay on point in Pensacola, Fla., last night, stopping mid-speech to give himself a pep talk. ""We've gotta be nice and cool,"" he said, speaking during his final rally of the day. ""Nice and cool. All right? Stay on point, Donald. Stay on point. No sidetracks, Donald!"" ""Trump has a reputation for parroting information that he hears, whether it be statistics, an idea for a victory speech, a circulating conspiracy theory or a particular turn-of-phrase,"" our Jenna Johnson explains from the trail. ""Campaign staffers have found that those who are physically closest to Trump, especially for conversations on his plane, have the greatest opportunity to influence him. Campaign CEO Stephen Bannon and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner have been traveling alongside the nominee in recent days; a possible explanation for the surprisingly on-message Trump. He has even lavished an unusual amount of praise on fellow Republicans -- and has, in turn, seen party leaders more publicly embrace him."" -- The Donald called for an immigration ""merit"" system at the rally, saying his administration would accept ""tremendous"" numbers of legal immigrants. ""I want people to come in. I want tremendous numbers of people to come in,"" Trump said in Pensacola. ""And we're going to have that big, beautiful door in the wall. This isn't the first time Trump has called for an immigration merit system, Jenna notes, though such remarks are not typically part of his campaign speeches. It's unclear what would qualify as a ""merit"" in such a system, however. -- Trump will ring in election night at the Hilton Midtown hotel in Manhattan, Sean Sullivan scooped -- a relatively low-key affair for the ""superstitious"" Republican nominee: ""The hotel is couple of blocks away from Trump Tower, where the GOP presidential nominee launched his campaign last year. But the atrium in Trump Tower is a privately owned public space, making it a problematic spot for a private campaign event. Trump was fined $10,000 by the City of New York for holding his launch there. It's also quite small for an election night event. The campaign rented a ballroom in the Hilton but expects to do a small event -- at least compared to most of Trump's big rallies."" In 2012, Mitt Romney spent $25,000 on a fireworks show over Boston Harbor that never went off after he lost to Obama. No such plans are in the works for Trump. A source said Trump ""doesn't want to jinx things"" by planning a big victory celebration. -- ""Some Who Saw Change in Obama Find It Now in Trump,"" by Yamiche Alcindor in the New York Times: A CBS poll found 7 percent of voters who supported Obama in 2012 now back Trump. Interviews with more than a dozen of them revealed a common theme: The message of change that inspired them to vote for Obama is now embodied by Trump, whom they see as a ""brash outsider"" to shake things up. Gary Kerns, 42, called himself a ""bandwagon voter,"" drawn to the most popular candidates. In 2008, Kerns voted for Obama because he was moved by his charisma. ""Obama was blazing hot,"" he said. ""There was momentum with him."" Now, he sees Obama-like energy in Trump's candidacy. ""Let's roll with the hot hand,"" he said."" Others felt duped by Obama and frustrated by personal circumstances. Some complain that the first black president bungled his response to racially charged killings. ""Have you ever seen somebody that talks so good and makes you feel that he is in your favor, he's in your corner, but the truth of the matter he's not?"" said Chuck Linton, a retired military veteran. ""That's Obama.""    Ted Cruz drops out on May 3 in Indianapolis. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)   -- Ted Cruz will join Mike Pence on the trail today, stumping alongside the Republican vice presidential nominee for the first time at events in Iowa and Michigan. The joint appearances come as a shift after Cruz and Trump's hostile rivalry during the Republican primary, in which Cruz slammed Trump as ""utterly amoral"" and Trump linked Cruz's father to the JFK assassination. (Politico) -- ""Life on the Inside: Pence's Turbulent Trip with Trump,"" by National Review's Tim Alberta: ""We struck the runway with a thud and felt the wheels clawing for traction on the rain-blanketed tarmac, but it hardly seemed an emergency. Except that it was: The plane had slid off the runway altogether and sliced through a concrete track.... 'I didn't realize it,' Pence told us of the accident, 'until I saw mud on the front windows.' Of course, it's impossible to survey the wreckage from inside the plane. This has been the story of Pence's time as Trump's running mate. [Pence] is not oblivious to external perception; he has been stung by criticisms from onetime allies in the evangelical and conservative worlds. Yet down the stretch of this campaign he has tuned them out, retreating deeper into the safe confines of Trump's bunker to block out the antagonism and gloom. Pence is now willfully insulated -- from the possibility that Trump may indeed have committed sexual assault; from the harshest critiques of his decision to join the GOP ticket; and from the reality that its defeat is likely."" -- Mitch McConnell broke his self-imposed silence on Trump yesterday, making his strongest statement of support yet on behalf of the Republican nominee. ""We need a new president, Donald Trump, to be the most powerful Republican in America,"" McConnell said, speaking at a Kentucky rally. ""If America votes like Kentucky, we'll be fine."" (AP) -- Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said he's now ""inclined"" to vote for Trump, sharply reversing himself after urging his party's nominee to drop out of the race just last month. ""I wait on events,"" he said in an MSNBC interview. ""I've just been surprised so much in this race. I don't have to cast my absentee for another four or five days and I wait on events.... I'm inclined to cast it for [Trump] but I have to wait and see what happens..."" -- Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon characterized Trump's campaign as part of a ""sea change"" reshaping American politics, seeking to tie the campaign to a broader nationalist movement. ""This whole movement has a certain global aspect to it,"" Bannon said on Breitbart News Daily, a radio program he formerly hosted and said he will host again after the election. ""People want more control of their country. They want borders. They want sovereignty. It's not just a thing that's happening in any one geographic space."" (BuzzFeed) -- Jerry Falwell Jr. cut a radio ad for Trump to shore up wavering evangelicals that is airing on Christian radio stations: ""I believe Jesus was instructing us to be good citizens and to vote when He said, 'Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.' ...

(Listen here.) -- Plaintiffs in the Trump University lawsuit are arguing that statements made by the real estate developer on the campaign trail this year should be admissible in court.

The Trump University trial is slated to begin at the end of this month. (CNN) -- A Trump presidency could imperil Los Angeles's bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. From USA Today: ""A Trump presidency would make it very difficult for Los Angeles to try to win over IOC voters from Islamic and Latin countries, as well as female IOC members, four people involved with U.S. Olympic efforts [said]....

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   THE DAILY HILLARY: -- Clinton made her final pitch to undecided voters in Las Vegas, asking Americans to imagine how a President Trump would conduct himself in the Oval Office. From Abby Phillip, Jenna Johnson and Matea Gold: ""Someone who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults Latinos and African Americans,"" Clinton asked, ""What would it be like to have that person in the most powerful office in the world?"" She continued, ""The truth is, we really don't have to guess. We just have to look at everything he has said and done in his career and in this campaign."" Clinton painted a dire picture for women, immigrants, Muslims and African Americans in a Trump administration, urging supporters to persuade ""everyone they know"" to vote. -- Clinton's campaign is doubling television ad spending in Arizona to more than $1 million, even as new polling suggests that Trump is reversing his slide in the state. From Anne Gearan: ""Part of the Democratic strategy is to force Trump, with less cash on hand and a much smaller ground operation, to work for a state that has been seen as an easy Republican victory in recent presidential elections. Arizona has voted for Republican by large margins in each election since 2000, but Democrats hope that a large and growing Latino population can begin to change that in the long term."" In addition, her campaign is expanding its air presence in Colorado, Virginia, Michigan and New Mexico with six-figure buys. -- Clinton's decision to resume ads in Colorado and Virginia and launch new ad campaigns in New Mexico and Michigan is vindicating many Republicans, who use the purchases as evidence her campaign is failing in its final days. But this is not necessarily so, writes James Downie. In fact, Obama's campaign used the very same strategy in 2012. ""With a week to go in 2012, [Obama's] campaign expanded where it was buying advertising, adding Pennsylvania and Michigan after weeks of no commercials."" At the time, some observers considered these moves a sign that Obama was on the defensive. In the end, he won Pennsylvania by five points and Michigan by nine. ""With three weeks to go, Clinton had $171 million in cash of hand. There is simply no reason for her not to spend every penny to win. These are not the moves of a campaign trying to change the electoral math. They are the moves of a campaign confident of where it sits today and how it will do on Nov. 8.""    -- Obama blasted Sen. Richard Burr by name while stumping in North Carolina, slamming the Republican senator's ""troubling"" rhetoric and his failure to distance himself from Trump. Referring to the fact that Burr was just caught on tape joking with gun owners about shooting Clinton -- something he has since apologized for -- Obama said, ""That's not something we do."" ""If a Democrat did it, I would condemn it in a hot second,"" Obama added, saying it was unacceptable to joke about committing violence against public officials. (Juliet Eilperin) POTUS also lit into Burr and other Senate Republicans for suggesting an indefinite blockade of Supreme Court nominees: ""Right now, because a lot of them think that Trump will lose, they're already promising even more unprecedented dysfunction in Washington, which is pretty hard to do,"" he said at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. ""They're promising years of investigations, years of hearings.  More shutdowns.  More obstruction. ... More repeal votes. Some are saying they won't appoint a ninth Supreme Court justice at all. ... Senator Burr, just said that, if Hillary wins, he'll do everything he can to block all Supreme Court nominations. Now, keep in mind that the reason they said they would not have a hearing or vote for my Supreme Court nomination, bucking all of American history, was because we thought the American people should decide the next Supreme Court justice. Now they're saying, well, if they don't decide the way we want them to decide, maybe we won't even do that. Eleven years ago, Richard Burr said a Supreme Court without nine justices would not work. Well, what changed? Only Republican presidents get to nominate judges? Is that in the Constitution? I used to teach constitutional law. I've never seen that provision!"" -- Joe Biden in Palm Beach Gardens: ""You win here in Florida, it is all over. We can go to bed early on election night!"" -- Some women are organizing Clinton supporters to wear WHITE as they head to the polls, harking back to a color often worn by suffragists in protests during the early 1900s. One woman in Little Rock organized a gathering of 200 Clinton supporters to wear white and vote early on the Democratic nominee's birthday. (Boston Globe)  PUNDITS INVEIGH AGAINST TRUMP: -- ""To vote for Trump as a protest against Clinton's faults would be like amputating a leg because of a sliver in the toe; cutting one's throat to lower one's blood pressure,"" former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum writes in an op-ed for The Atlantic: ""I more or less agree with Trump on [immigration]. ... But that was before Trump expanded the debate to include such questions as: 'Should America honor its NATO commitments?' 'Are American elections real or fake?' 'Are handicapped people comical?' We don't have to analogize Trump to any of the lurid tyrants of world history to recognize in him the most anti-constitutional personality ever to gain a major-party nomination for the U.S. presidency. I cannot predict whether Trump would succeed in elevating himself 'on the ruins of public liberty.' The outcome would greatly depend on the resolve, integrity, and courage of other leaders and other institutions.... What we should all foresee is that a President Trump will certainly try to realize Washington's nightmare. He must not be allowed to try."" -- ""It is mystifying that so many Republicans, after criticizing Mr. Obama for eight years for showing insufficient pride in the United States, would attach themselves to someone who has such contempt for the country, its institutions and its values,"" The Post's Editorial Board writes. ""We believe, as we have said, that Ms. Clinton is well-prepared to serve as president. But even voters who disagree -- who believe that Ms. Clinton is unqualified or ethically distasteful -- cannot realistically argue that she represents a danger to the republic. Mr. Trump is such a danger. Only by forgetting or ignoring what he has told us could Americans decide otherwise."" -- Conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat argues that it is irresponsible for the pro-life community, if they're playing the long game, to support Trump: ""So long as your polity offers mechanisms for eventually changing unjust laws, it's better to accept the system's basic legitimacy and work within it for change than to take steps, violent or otherwise, that risk blowing the entire apparatus up. ... Not because it is guaranteed long-term victory in that scenario or any other. But because the deepest conservative insight is that justice depends on order as much as order depends on justice.""

(Libby March/For The Washington Post)   -- ""Was 2016 a missed opportunity for libertarians?"" by David Weigel: ""In 2015 and 2016, for months at a time, the rise of libertarian-minded candidates sparked questions about whether a 'libertarian moment' had arrived. Sen. Rand Paul's high-profile run for president rattled Democrats who worried about the shifting millennial vote. [And Gary] Johnson, an asterisk in the 2012 campaign, found hundreds of reporters following his 2016 bid. 'I think the Libertarian Party will grow by leaps and bounds,' he said. Some of that has happened. But it's less than libertarians expected, and it comes as both the Democratic and Republican parties sprint further from their views. [Sanders], not Rand Paul, became 2016's breakout star with young voters; his campaign found millions of them saying they preferred socialism to capitalism. [Meanwhile, Trump's] takeover of the Republican Party moved it further from the Koch sweet spot on immigration, policing and entitlements.

Armstrong argues that the Postal Service got more than its money's worth as his sponsor from 2000 to 2004 and was at court as his four attorneys pressed the point, sunglasses folded on the table in front of him, jotting notes and leafing through case exhibits.

The U.S. could owe billions.	"   A banner reads ""Thank you -- stop CETA"" (EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) on the facade of the Walloon parliament building in Namur, Belgium. (Nicolas Lambert/AFP/Getty Images)  Should multinational corporations be able to sue other countries' governments, including the U.S. government? The current international Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) system allows multinational corporations to pursue international arbitration when they believe a foreign government has violated their property rights. Thousands of international treaties, including NAFTA and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), enable ISDS. Giving special rights to multinational corporations under international law is controversial, to say the least. Even in the United States, the system is under pressure, although U.S. multinational corporations have sued foreign governments more than corporations from any other country.   [Investors have controversial new rights to sue countries. Here's why this matters for the U.S.]   The TPP doubles down on ISDS. Is that reason enough for the United States to reject the TPP? The well-known economist Tyler Cowen says, ""No."" According to Cowen, ""large and powerful countries"" like the United States don't have too much to worry about when it comes to ISDS, and the United States could renegotiate the TPP if downsides become apparent. We can't tell you whether the United States should accept the TPP. However, we think that Cowen's case in favor of TPP rests on some major misperceptions. As scholars who do research on ISDS, we believe that the following issues are key to any analysis of TPP. First, under TPP, the U.S. government could eventually owe millions or billions of dollars directly to a foreign multinational corporation. Second, governments and interest groups have less power than usual under ISDS. Third, leaving a treaty is harder than it sounds.   [Why do people hate ISDS and why does it matter?]   The U.S. could owe millions -- or billions -- to a foreign multinational corporation When a foreign multinational corporation sues a government, the state wins about 38 percent of the time, the parties settle about 33 percent, and the investor wins an award in about 29 percent. Half of public awards are for $16 million or more, and a handful of awards are for $1 billion or more. (For more information on trends, see here.) Unsurprisingly, there is often public outrage when governments are forced to pay taxpayer dollars directly to private, foreign multinational corporations. Backlash against ISDS has led eight countries so far to withdraw from some enabling treaties. ISDS cases have shaped political campaigns -- and gotten governments voted out of office -- around the world. True, the United States has not lost any of the 13 cases brought against it thus far. But it is risky to bet that the United States will always win. Now, TransCanada, the Canadian corporation that was supposed to build the Keystone Pipeline, has sued the United States for $15 billion, under the terms of NAFTA's ISDS chapter. If the United States loses this case, or another one in the future, it will likely lead to public backlash. Governments and interest groups have less power than usual under ISDS -- and multinational corporations have more The special rights available to multinational corporations under ISDS are not available to other firms -- for example, businesses that are just exporting their products to another country rather than investing in it. Problems with exports and imports are treated as trade issues, which means that only governments can sue other governments at the World Trade Organization or via other trade treaties. This means a firm with a problem has to petition its national government to file a case on its behalf. That's why disputes over Chinese steel exports are between the United States and China, not a particular steel firm and China. Moreover, the government that loses a trade dispute doesn't owe a cash award to the foreign firm that had the problem. Despite heated political rhetoric, especially in this campaign season, the United States does not start an official trade dispute with China (or any other country) every time a U.S. exporter has a problem. That would be bad politics. But under ISDS, U.S. multinational corporations can file cases whenever they want. That means the U.S. government can't filter cases, and diplomats can be sucked into disputes that they might prefer not to be involved in. Furthermore, other interested parties can't sue governments under ISDS. TPP allows violations of labor and environment provisions to be enforced as trade violations -- which means that an environmental group would have to persuade its government to formally accuse another government of violating the Convention on Illegal Trafficking of Endangered Species, which is wholly subsumed in the TPP. Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine has suggested giving interest groups the same kind of power as multinational corporations. But this could easily worsen another problem that concerns Cowen: excessive litigation.   [The TPP agreement is over 5,000 pages long. Here's why that's a good thing]   Governments can't just walk away from treaties So what if the United States gets sued too much, or U.S. multinational corporations use ISDS in ways that diplomats don't like? Why can't the United States ratify the TPP and then walk away later if it doesn't like its terms? In fact, that's very difficult. In a forthcoming article in Global Policy, we document that even governments vehemently opposed to ISDS haven't fully withdrawn from the system. That's because withdrawal from treaties with ISDS is hard. Crucially, most treaties have ""sunset clauses,"" meaning that the treaty remains in force for some time (often for a decade) after one party terminates it. Governments like Ecuador and Indonesia that have withdrawn from treaties see an increase in ISDS cases against them, because foreign multinational corporations scramble to file ISDS cases while they still can. Renegotiating treaties is difficult, too -- because renegotiation requires agreement from all parties. Large and powerful countries like the United States do have an advantage when it comes to writing treaties, and today's ISDS-enabling treaties contain new transparency and flexibility provisions as a result. U.S. negotiators got much of what they wanted into the TPP. Australia pushed for a provision in the TPP that specifically says tobacco companies cannot sue under ISDS. Their negotiators were responding to an ISDS case by Philip Morris which claimed that Australia's ""plain packaging"" law, which required that cigarettes be sold in plain packets, violated their investment rights. Australia eventually won that case -- but it delayed regulations and roiled domestic politics in the meantime. Is ISDS reason enough to reject the TPP? So is ISDS so bad that the United States should reject the TPP because of it? Cowen says no, because it's been a ""largely unobjectionable part of the status quo for some time."" That's an easy position to take in a country that hasn't lost an ISDS case yet. An alternative perspective might point to the political difficulties that TPP is encountering, and argue that it suggests that attaching ISDS provisions to trade deals is likely to weaken the coalitions for these deals rather than strengthening them. ISDS provisions reduce the TPP's appeal for important groups that might otherwise like the TPP's progress on labor, environment, and a variety of other issue areas (including freer trade). This is true outside the U.S. too -- the E.U.'s trade deal with Canada nearly foundered in mid-October because of localized opposition to ISDS, and it was only saved when negotiators agreed to refer the ISDS provisions to the European Court of Justice. Special rules that advantage foreign multinational corporations over domestic interests are arguably becoming increasingly politically unsustainable, in ways that may have long-term consequences for trade and globalization.
