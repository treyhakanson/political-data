Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi told The Associated Press that his special forces were searching homes in areas retaken from IS, looking for militants and vehicles rigged to be used in suicide bombings. Another Iraqi army commander, Brig. Gen. Haidar Fadel, said a suicide car bomber attempted to drive his vehicle toward troops in the city's Tahrir neighborhood, but was shot dead and his explosives-laden car detonated at a safe distance. However, Fadel said the car exploded close to a house, causing it to cave in. Four civilians were killed and four others were wounded, Fadel said. The troops fighting their way toward Mosul's center from the city's eastern side laid siege to the Al-Zohour neighborhood. The arrival of the troops at the neighborhood's fringes prompted hundreds of civilians to emerge from their homes waving white flags and seek safety behind army lines.  ""The biggest hindrance to us is the civilians,"" declared al-Aridi of the special forces. ""We are soldiers who are not trained to carry out humanitarian tasks."" The Iraqi military began the campaign one month ago to retake Mosul, Iraq's second largest city and the last major urban center in the country still held by the militants. The campaign has been slow, with IS putting up stiff resistance. Most gains thus far have been made by the special forces operating in the section of Mosul east of the Tigris river. The campaign is being assisted by airstrikes from the U.S.-led military coalition. IS captured Mosul in the summer of 2014 as part of a blitz that placed nearly a third of Iraq under the militants' control. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

New signs touting nationalism and unity now line a main highway since Iraqi forces drove the extremists from the Tigris River Valley town in August. Deeper inside Qayara, however, fresh graffiti has appeared on some streets, revealing bitterness, anger and lasting fissures among the population.  ""Blood for blood,"" reads the Arabic script spray-painted outside a destroyed home on the town's northern edge. Neighbors said the house belonged to a man who joined IS when the group first rose to power in 2014. Slang and obscenities against the owner also are written on a partially destroyed garden wall. When Qayara was retaken by Iraqi security forces, it was hailed as an early triumph over the extremists as the country prepared for the long-awaited offensive to liberate the second-largest city Mosul that began Oct. 17. But for some residents, the ouster of IS doesn't feel like victory. Government services have failed to return. Oil wells set ablaze by the militants continue to burn uncontrollably. Violence persists, with residents carrying out revenge attacks in the wake of the brutal reign by the militants. Mahmoud Shaker, who lives down the street from the destroyed house, said a group of local tribal fighters and policemen reduced it to rubble a few weeks after IS militants were pushed out of Qayara.  ""We know this wasn't done legally, but for us, this is justice,"" the 25-year-old Shaker said. It was ""common knowledge"" that the man who lived there was a senior IS leader, he added, although he said he personally never saw the man commit a crime.  ""Before the town was retaken, he fled with his family to Mosul,"" Shaker said. On the edge of Qayara, Ala Hussein has lived under darkened skies for months. A short distance from her home, several oil wells have been burning uncontrollably since June. The IS fighters first torched some of the wells as Iraqi forces began the operation to retake Qayara, hoping the thick, black smoke would obscure the town from warplanes of the U.S.-led coalition. In late August, as it became clear they were losing the town, the militants lit the rest of the wells before fleeing north toward Mosul. Hussein's garden is covered with sticky, black droplets of oil that fall like light rain from the clouds of smoke. One of her fruit trees has died, and another is covered with a plastic tarp to try to save it. Her children's hands and feet are stained black by the pollution. In the fields around the town, grazing sheep and cows all have turned a dark gray from the soot. Firefighters show up every few days, spraying the flames with water and occasionally trucking in sand to try to snuff out the blaze, Hussein said, but it never improves.  ""This is not liberation. We haven't yet had the taste of freedom,"" she said. ""Where is our government? We don't have a government."" In central Qayara, doctors at a small clinic that serves as the only working hospital treat patients by the light of mobile phones. Dr. Abdul Salam Ali Ahmed said he can only afford enough fuel to turn on his generators for three hours a day. When the hospital receives casualties from the ongoing Mosul operation 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the north, those who can't be saved must be buried within hours because there is no refrigeration to preserve the bodies. A sign in the hospital's front hallway says that newborns cannot be issued birth certificates.  ""The Ministry of Health hasn't sent us the required paperwork yet,"" Ahmed said. ""We just keep our own records for now."" The central government in Baghdad has sent intelligence officials to Qayara to screen civilians for any ties to IS. A detention center has been set up in a mosque and an adjacent office houses an interrogation room. Unlike the destruction of homes, their work is achieving justice through legal methods, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.  ""It's better than tribal revenge,"" one of the intelligence officers said. ""When we arrest someone it's safer for him. It protects him."" Since the operation to retake Mosul began last month, they have detained thousands of people, with hundreds formally arrested and sent to Baghdad, the officials said. At a cluster of homes near the oil fires, a young man flaunted a video on his phone that he said was taken in Qayara after its liberation. The video showed the corpses of IS fighters being abused by residents. It also showed a group of children punching and kicking one of the bodies. Hussein, the woman whose house was covered by oil, believes that the Iraqi security forces were complicit when Islamic State militants overran northern and central parts of the country more than two years ago. Many of the security forces fled in the face of the militants' advance, and some blame Iraq's political leadership with facilitating the fall of Mosul by ignoring months of warnings that the group was growing in power.  ""The government sold us to Daesh in the first place,"" Hussein said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.  ""And now they want to accuse us of being terrorists!"" she said, cursing both the militants and the government with an obscenity. ___ Associated Press writers Salar Salim and Mstyslav Chernov in Qayara, Iraq, contributed.

The move, one of the first key decisions as Trump pivots from campaigning to governing, amounted to a demotion for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been running the Republican's transition planning for months. On the heels of Trump's upset victory this week, his team has begun to embark upon building a government, an enormous undertaking that likely requires Trump to alter his hands-on management style and consider going outside his small, insular group of loyalists. He has been scrambling to identify people for top White House jobs and Cabinet posts, a herculean task that must be well in hand by the time Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20. In a statement Friday, Trump said Pence would ""build on the initial work"" done by Christie.  ""Together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation -- specifically jobs, security and opportunity,"" Trump said. Christie was a loyal adviser to Trump for much of the campaign, offered a key early endorsement and came close to being the businessman's pick for running mate. But Trump ultimately went with Indiana Gov. Pence, a former congressman with Washington experience and deep ties to conservatives. In a statement, Christie said he was ""proud to have run the pre-election phase"" of the transition team and thanked Trump for the ""opportunity to continue to help lead."" Christie will still be involved in the transition, joining a cluster of other steadfast Trump supporters serving as vice chairs: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. In addition, three of Trump's adult children -- Don. Jr., Eric and Ivanka -- are on the transition executive committee, along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband. Kushner played a significant role in Trump's campaign and was spotted at the White House Thursday meeting with President Barack Obama's chief of staff. The children's inclusion raises questions about the role the Trump family will play in the White House -- as well as Trump's ability to sever ties between the administration and sprawling family business -- after the celebrity businessman repeatedly said during the campaign that his grown children would not follow him to Washington and instead run the Trump Organization. For Trump, who ran on a pledge to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington insiders, the team is strikingly heavy on those with long political resumes. And another apparent contradiction emerged Friday as Trump, who repeatedly vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act ""on day one,"" said that he would be open to maintaining portions of President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. Trump told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published Friday that, after speaking with Obama at the White House the day before, he was considering keeping the clause that allows children to stay on their parents' insurance policies. He has previously said he may keep the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of patients' existing conditions. He also said that he wants ""a country that loves each other"" but said he did not regret his incendiary rhetoric during the campaign.  ""No. I won,"" Trump told the newspaper. By appointing Pence, Trump became the first incoming president since at least Jimmy Carter to use his vice president-elect to run his transition team. Trump and Christie grew apart through the last stretch of the campaign. The governor became increasingly frustrated that Trump wouldn't listen to his advice, particularly over the response to the release of a video in which the businessman is heard making predatory comments about women. Christie is also facing calls for impeachment in New Jersey following the conviction of two former aides in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing trial. Christie has denied any knowledge of the lane closures until weeks or months after they occurred in September 2013. The governor was notably absent from the steady stream of advisers entering Trump's eponymous skyscraper in New York for meetings Friday. Among the first decisions facing the president-elect is whom to choose as chief of staff, a key post that will set the tone for Trump's White House and be a key conduit to Capitol Hill and Cabinet agencies. Trump is said to be considering Steve Bannon, his campaign chairman and a conservative media executive, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus for the role. Neither has significant policy experience, though Priebus is well-liked in Washington and has ties with key lawmakers. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, is also said to be in the mix for a senior job. Conway is a veteran Republican pollster who formed a strong rapport with the candidate after taking the helm of his campaign in the general election. Giuliani, who emerged as Trump's frequent travel partner and close aide during the campaign's stretch run, is on the short list for several positions, including attorney general.  ""Donald has been my friend for 28 years,"" Giuliani said Friday after leaving a meeting at Trump Tower. ""I can see already how he is going to be a great president and I am glad I can play a small role."" ___ Lemire reported from New York.

State House	" Maryland Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) and House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) said Friday that ""it is time"" to erect statues of abolitionists Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass at the State House in Annapolis. The proposal is the latest attempt to recognize the contributions of African Americans from Maryland, and to address critics who oppose the statue of Roger B. Taney, the U.S. chief justice who wrote the proslavery Dred Scott decision in 1857, that has long stood on the State House grounds. Miller and Busch want statues of Douglass and Tubman placed in the Old House of Delegates Chamber, where they would ""appropriately look on as witnesses in the room where Maryland abolished slavery in our State and rejected the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution."" The Democrats' letter to Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford (R) -- the governor's designee to the State House Trust, which oversees any additions made to the State House complex -- referred to plans to replace President Andrew Jackson's face with Tubman's on the $20 bill. ""As the nation honors Harriet Tubman, a great Maryland historical figure, we believe it is appropriate that the State House be a place of honor as well,"" the letter said. ""In times of change, it is even more important that we teach our children about the events and people like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass who laid the groundwork for Maryland to be a place where all citizens are valued and included."" Del. Cheryl D. Glenn (D-Baltimore), the president of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus, said she was pleased with the proposal. Doug Mayer, a spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan (R), said the governor and lieutenant governor ""would gladly support"" honoring Tubman and Douglass. But Colin Byrd, a student activist who successfully campaigned last year to drop the name of segregationist Harry Clifton ""Curley"" Byrd from the University of Maryland football stadium, said Tubman and Douglass ""deserve more than to be recognized in a relatively small room that is now so obscure and infrequently visited.""  Byrd, who asked this summer for a Tubman statue, argued that statues of the two should be placed outside, saying that if Taney ""deserves to be recognized in full view, then surely Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman deserve this level of recognition."" Legislation to install statues of Tubman and Douglass alongside Taney failed in 2012 and 2013. A bill to remove Taney's statue from State House grounds died this year.     In their letter, Miller and Busch wrote that the Old House Chamber is a location that is ""interpreted at a time contemporary to Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass' contributions to our State and our nation."" They noted that a bronze statue of President George Washington stands in the Old Senate Chamber, where he returned his military commission to Congress in 1783.  ""While additional statues could be located outside the building,"" the letter said, ""we propose that the State honor both Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass as prominent Marylanders inside the State House, reflecting the importance of their contributions to our State.""

The department, under the Obama administration and the country's first two black attorneys general, has investigated about two dozen police agencies for civil rights violations and reached court-enforceable consent decrees with many of them. It refused to defend a federal law that banned the recognition of gay marriage. It sued North Carolina over a bathroom bill that it said discriminated against transgender people. And it implemented new profiling limits on federal law-enforcement agencies. But Trump's election has stirred concern from civil rights advocates that some of that work could be undone, set aside or at least minimized under a Trump administration.  ""The Civil Rights Division was just building a head of steam over the last two, three years, and it raises really serious concerns about whether we now lose traction on these issues,"" Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said of a section that former Attorney General Eric Holder called the ""crown jewel"" of the department. One overt change could come in the department's approach toward policing and relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve, an issue that's moved to the public forefront in the last two years. Trump's talk of a ""law and order"" approach to crime fighting and his praise for stop-and-frisk police tactics are out of step with a Justice Department that has advocated community policing and decried strategies it considers unconstitutional or discriminatory.  ""He talked about things like the war on police, that we need more stop and frisk, that the Black Lives Matter movement has placed police officers at risk, in ways that are really concerning,"" said Jonathan Smith, a former Justice Department civil rights official who oversaw the investigation into discriminatory practices by the Ferguson, Missouri, police force. The rhetoric resembles that of Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who's expected to be considered for the position of attorney general. Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department has opened wide-ranging investigations of 23 police departments, including those in Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson. It's enforcing 19 agreements, including 14 court-enforceable consent decrees. While those agreements are unlikely to be reversed, new attorneys could be lax in enforcing them or in requiring meaningful change when additional police departments come under scrutiny. And different leadership may see less value in some of the community meetings and round-table discussions promoted by Justice Department officials as a way to seek reconciliation between police and minorities. Also subject to change is the department's overall approach to the thousands of drug prosecutions it brings each year, embodied in a 2013 policy initiative that discouraged prosecutors from seeking harsh prison sentences for nonviolent offenders. A new administration might also seek changes on the national security front, including how terrorism cases are prosecuted and broader surveillance powers -- particularly of Muslims. Attorney General Loretta Lynch acknowledged the prospect for change Thursday, saying in a speech that ""some policies and priorities may shift over the span of time or the turn of the electoral wheel."" But she also said all Justice Department employees ""are united by a love of country and a commitment to service regardless."" Career attorneys throughout the Justice Department, including at the Civil Rights Division, are intended as a stabilizing, apolitical force across different administrations, though there hasn't always been a clear line. A 2008 inspector general report identified instances in the Bush administration when the Civil Rights Division considered political and ideological affiliations in hiring career attorneys or assigning cases. But it's the department's political appointees, who routinely change with presidential administrations, that ""set the tone and the direction and determine the vigor of civil rights enforcement,"" Romero said. At the Civil Rights Division, that includes its leader, Vanita Gupta, a former ACLU attorney who earlier in her career led an effort to overturn wrongful convictions of drug defendants in Texas. During her time at the department, the federal government has become involved in various matters that officials believe brush up against constitutional protections. That includes a directive to schools that they permit students to use the bathrooms that match their chosen gender identity, and a letter discouraging municipal courts from jailing citizens for nonpayment of fines and fees. The department's also intervened in an Idaho case to argue that police can't arrest the homeless for sleeping in public places. New department leadership could well take different stances on issues like those, or steer clear of federal intervention altogether. And while federal civil rights statutes will surely remain on the books for enforcement, advocates are concerned their causes won't enjoy the same commitment they've had under President Barack Obama.  ""We intend to fight, we intend to ensure that we do not go backwards,"" Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told reporters. ""We believe that we have the Constitution and the laws of our nation on our side."" ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Annie Leibovitz/Vogue)  The December issue of Vogue arrives with first lady Michelle Obama on its cover wearing a slinky white Carolina Herrera gown. It is sleeveless. Her hair is swept back and flowing. Her makeup is perfectly natural. She is wearing a magnificent sparkly ring and a pair of Monique Pean earrings. The backdrop offers no hint of the White House, the nation's capital or the ornate stateliness that has long attached to the occupant of the East Wing. The portrait exudes the sort of casual glamour in which Vogue specializes, but that is not typically associated with first ladies. If there is any takeaway from the images by photographer Annie Leibovitz, it is that Obama is offering up a version of herself to the public that is separate and distinct from the role she has filled for nearly eight years. The message is not brusque or without nostalgia and gratitude. But she is done. Finished. Free. The accompanying article, which was reported by Jonathan Van Meter over the course of several months, is a review of her time in the White House. A victory lap. It highlights Obama's work with students, her garden and her focus on the nation's veterans. Van Meter was there when she surprised students at Howard University and co-hosted ""Ellen."" And he takes the readers along as he moves from room to room in the White House, chatting with her staff and noshing on hummus and crudites. He gazes at the portraits of previous first ladies and muses on their legacy. There is even a moment when he wonders where a portrait of Bill Clinton -- as a first gentleman to a president Hillary Clinton -- might hang.   [Vogue just made its first presidential endorsement. Here's why.]   ""Presumably, should Hillary prevail (this story went to press just prior to the election), Bill Clinton's portraits will eventually hang in the White House in two places: upstairs on the State Floor, as president, and a new one that will replace Mrs. Obama's, which will move down the line, further into history,"" Van Meter writes. ""And who will Michelle Obama be then?"" What will she do? The first lady doesn't answer that question. (Valerie Jarrett assures him that Obama will not be running for political office.) ""I will take the same approach leaving as I did coming in,"" Obama says. ""I won't know until I'm there. I've never been the former first lady of the United States of America before. ""But I will always be engaged in some way in public service and public life,"" she adds.    The December cover of Vogue magazine features first lady Michelle Obama. (Annie Leibovitz/Vogue)  The photographs make plain that Obama is moving on from the rigors, the expectations and the limitations of the White House. Obama is photographed mostly in Atelier Versace, rather than American designers, which is more typical. And while she is standing or seated in various corners and porticoes of the White House, the background is more graphic than iconic. Her hair is tousled -- a little messy, even. And in one portrait, she is wearing a black Atelier Versace dress and matching jacket with a belt cinched neatly around her waist. Her legs are bare and her black pumps are by Jimmy Choo. She's seated on a stone staircase with her hands resting against her hips, and her head is thrown back as she leans against the steps. It is a posed look of quiet meditation, one with which regular readers of glossy magazines are familiar. It is part of the canon of sexy. Not in a plunging evening gown, pinup way, but more: ""I might take him on a flight on my chopper, I slay.""   [Letting Her Hair Down, but Still Keeping Up Appearances]   It is impossible to imagine Obama sitting for a portrait and arching her back and looking toward the sky during the early years of the Obama administration. Indeed, one of the first images of her in Vogue had her styled in a manner that recalled Jackie Kennedy -- curled alongside her husband and her children, a strand of pearls around her neck. The then-senator's wife had even nixed a mussed hairstyle, saying that it made her look as if she'd just gotten out of bed. Whether in Vogue or elsewhere, her early pictures were more formal, regal or homey. They seemed aimed at reassuring an audience that she could fit into their preconceived notions about how a first lady should look, even if she happened to be African American.    Earlier in her tenure as first lady, Michelle Obama's magazine covers tended to be more formal, regal or homey.  As Obama settled into the White House, her approach to fashion was more contemporary than her predecessors, and she brought her individuality and personality to her tenure as first lady. But she kept her promise of being a caretaker of the position's traditions. She transformed the look and feel of the role, but not the essence of it, no matter how murky that essence might be. Her successor will be freer to be more of herself rather than a two-dimensional visitor's guide version of it -- if that is her choice. These photographs speak to an exit strategy. They serve as a bridge between the symbol Obama has been and the woman she will become. Obama is a celebrity. Charismatic and influential. Other portraits have tended to put that fame in the context of politics, Washington or first ladies. These pictures remove all those modifiers."

Even with the loan, economic challenges remain ahead. The approval comes almost a week after the Egyptian government floated its currency and raised fuel prices in order to qualify for the loan. These painful measures earned praise from the IMF and the international business community, but caused price hikes for an already frustrated cash-strapped population, with President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi now risking a serious political backlash. The IMF made the announcement on Friday and said the loan aims to help Egypt ""restore macroeconomic stability and promote inclusive growth."" It added that Egypt will receive a first installment of $2.75 billion immediately. Days earlier, Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, described Egypt's reform program as ""ambitious"" and said it will put the country on a ""sustainable path and achieve job-rich growth."" Tarek Amer, the head of Egypt's Central Bank, was quoted by the state-run MENA news agency as saying that the first installment has arrived at the bank and increased foreign reserves to $23.5 billion. Egypt had $36 billion in reserves before the 2011 uprising. The government announced earlier that it's targeting an additional $7 billion loan annually from other lenders in order to secure over 30 billion of funds needed in the coming three years. Years of unrest following the ouster of longtime autocratic President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 left Egypt's economy in shambles. The vital tourism sector dried up over fears of terrorism, overseas remittances dropped because of low oil prices, and Suez Canal revenues diminished because of a decline in global trade. Investment and business activity also stalled, with inflation hitting 14 percent and unemployment 13 percent while the percentage of the unemployed youth is around 30 percent. Nearly half of the population is below poverty line; the budget deficit currently stands at nearly 12 percent of gross domestic product while the current account deficit is at almost 7 percent. A country with at least 90 million people, Egypt is heavily dependent on imports, not just of staple food items, but industrial components and raw materials to keep the manufacturing sector going. Much of the imports needed by the private sector are financed by dollars bought on the black market. Before devaluation, a thriving black market led the dollar to surge to a rate of 19 Egyptian pounds -- compared to 8.8 in the banks. Egyptians witnessed some tough scenes as a result: like mothers holding crying babies and angry men blocking a Cairo main street over a shortage of subsided baby formula. Basic commodities like sugar all but disappeared from shops, and international airlines such as the Royal Dutch Airlines suspended operations over heavy restrictions imposed by the Central Bank on the transfer of foreign currency out of Egypt. When the Central Bank devalued the pound to 13 to the dollar, and then floated it completely last week, the pound traded at around 16 to the dollar on Friday. For decades, Egyptian leaders have balked from sealing IMF loans for fear of the social unrest. In preparation for the painful measures, the government launched a public campaign on TV and with billboards and street signs. The campaign's main slogan is: ""Oh, Egypt, with bold reforms, we shorten the road."" However, the public campaign has failed to quell public rage caused by prices hikes. El-Sissi faced serious criticism for failing to live up to his promises, foremost that of improving living conditions. The army chief-turned-president led the military ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi followed by a heavy security crackdown on large protests. Some of the criticism was also directed at el-Sissi's mega projects for wasting millions of dollars . These included expansion of the Suez Canal, building a new administrative capital, reclaiming 1.5 million acres in the desert, a nationwide network of roads, and the construction of cheap housing. A call for mass protests dubbed ""the revolution of the poor"" against the latest economic measures faltered on Friday as Egyptian security forces heavily deployed on the streets of Cairo and across the country. Authorities have banned all unauthorized demonstrations and have routinely responded to protests with lethal force. Political parties for the most part distanced themselves from the Friday protest call, and authorities have accused Islamist groups like the banned Muslim Brotherhood of engineering the protests to cause chaos. In a set of Q&As posted on the IMF website, the organization said that it hasn't demanded that Egypt cut food subsidies, and that the government is planning to increase expenditure on food and cash given to the poor and low-income families.  ""The IMF supports the authorities in looking to reprioritize within the budget to protect vulnerable and poor households from the impact of food inflation,"" it said. ""Social protection is a cornerstone in the government's reform program."" The latest measures, the IMF said, will cause short-term inflation.  ""The move to a flexible exchange rate could increase inflation as imports will become more expensive,"" it said, but added that the impact will be limited and that the Central Bank is working to keep inflation ""under control."" Cairo called on the U.S.-based global lender as a last resort, after having exhausted billions of dollars in aid from wealthy Gulf Arab nations recently humbled by declining oil prices -- and now turned off by persistent bureaucratic hurdles to investing in Egypt. The loan also comes at a time when oil-rich Saudi Arabia has piled pressure on Cairo, following disputes over regional conflicts such as those in Syria and Yemen. Saudi's Aramco, the world's largest oil company, has indefinitely halted much-needed fuel shipments to Egypt. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

""Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday night.     Trump, who aggressively tweeted during the campaign, had been notably muted on Twitter in the final days leading to the election. Reports suggest that his staff had been managing his Twitter feed to avoid messaging hiccups.  Trump's tweet came after thousands of protesters took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest his victory, his character and campaign rhetoric, which was described as racist, misogynistic and inflammatory. Critics argued that Trump's tweet came when he should be working to unite the nation after one of the most heated campaigns in modern political history. By Friday morning, Trump's tweets had changed tone. ""Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!"" he tweeted early Friday morning.     "

""I'm not telling anyone what to do,"" said Brook, 67, who resumed the place alongside local roads he has occupied for much of the last year, with a sign urging passersby to vote. ""The idea is to reach as many people as I can with the message of America... If you're here, love it, be a part of it."" On Tuesday, millions of Americans marked the end of a bitterly divisive presidential campaign by joining him to do just that. They expressed both strong support and deep dislike for Brook's candidate, Republican Donald Trump, as well as for Democrat Hillary Clinton. But if they agreed on one thing it was that, after a presidential campaign laced with vitriol, they would at least have the final word.  ""I'm excited to be here and have it matter so much,"" said Gabby Formica, 24, a graduate student who cast a ballot for Clinton Tuesday in South Philadelphia, noting that Pennsylvania was a swing state. Voters' determination to be counted was evident from the moment the first polls opened in the darkness of midnight in northern New Hampshire, and dawn elsewhere. Throughout the day, long lines and passionate opinions confirmed the stakes. They waited outside churches and synagogues, community centers and schools, often with snacks and children in tow. In Los Angeles, they voted alongside the lap lanes of the Echo Park Pool and in Chicago, they cast ballots in a bowling alley over the racket of downed pins. They voted at a county fairgrounds in Moscow, Idaho, a strip mall recently swamped by 10-foot floodwaters in Denham Springs, Louisiana, a Buddhist temple in Long Beach, California, and on the run in Colorado, Oregon and elsewhere where special drop boxes accepted ballots from joggers and motorists. Some celebrated their votes, confident of the outcome.  ""We're the United States of America. We can overcome anything,"" said Melanie Draheim of Houston, after casting her vote for Trump. Others described the election as an albatross weighing on them.  ""I've been really stressed out about this election,"" said Belinda Hedrick, 62, of Mission, Kansas, who came straight from a spin class, and was still sweating, when she cast a vote for Clinton. ""It's the first time I've ever woke up at night worrying about stuff."" In Indianapolis, biologist Scott Salmon, 32, said he, too, woke up anxious, before biking to the polls.  ""We have a bottle of champagne if Hillary wins and a bottle of rum if Trump wins -- that kind of anxious,"" he said. Many voting Tuesday hewed to their established politics. But some said the accusations of the campaign had pushed them across party lines. Lisa Moore, a Republican from Glen Rock, New Jersey, said she voted for Clinton. ""I think the Republican party has gone way right of the majority of at least the residents of this section of the country,"" said Moore, an exercise instructor.  ""As a woman, in good conscience, and as the mother of a daughter, I can't vote for somebody who's so morally reprehensible"" as Trump,"" she said. Meanwhile, Democrat Jim Eul, 61, a retired plumbing inspector for the city of Chicago, said his intense dislike for Clinton had persuaded him to vote for Trump. He said he couldn't bear sitting out the election, but expressed disappointment in the choices. ""You've got two big political organizations and these are the only two they can come up with?"" Regardless of party, voters agreed the stakes of the election were tremendous. In Anchorage, Alaska, Jeanette O'Brien, 72, said she voted for Trump because he is capable of rebuilding schools and cities that she blames President Barack Obama for letting decay. But whoever wins, she expects unrest, even a possible civil war.  ""Millions of Americans will stand up to take the country back if they have to,"" she said. A fellow Alaskan, Warren Urda, explained his vote for Clinton was also about long-term consequences. ""I believe that person will select the next four Supreme Court justices and that will affect us for the next 50 years, not just for the next four years,"" said Urda, a retired dentist. Many voters expressed worries that merely counting the votes will not heal the country's divide. On Tuesday, Elizabeth Gil, a law student in Miami Lakes, Florida, would not say who she voted for, but expressed hope for what comes next.  ""I think people want to move forward,"" said Gil, who avoided early voting because she treasures the experience of going to the polls on Election Day. ""There's too much division. If we're going to work with one another, to hear each other's different points of views, that is how we can move forward together as a country."" ___ Associated Press writers Don Babwin in Chicago, Bill Draper in Mission, Kansas, Dan Joling in Anchorage, Alaska, Tom Murphy in Indianapolis, Jay Reeves in Bessemer, Alabama, Tim Reynolds in Miami Lakes, Florida, and Errin Haynes Whack in Philadelphia, Amy Forliti in Roseville, Minnesota, and Rodrique Ngowi in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire contributed to this story.

University students and professionals posed next to life-size cutouts of the two main candidates and mingled, holding glasses of ginger, bissap and baobab juice in the residence's gardens. In a mock vote cast throughout the evening, the overwhelming majority voted for Hillary Clinton over Republican candidate Donald Trump. Matel Bocoum, a 37-year-old journalist for Senegal's Le Soleil Business, said she'd vote for Clinton.  ""Never did we think a black man would become the head of the United States, and now, we have the same hopes for a woman. And if a woman becomes the head of the United States, it's a beautiful lesson for women all over,"" she said. ___ 5:05 p.m. A senior Australian government minister says he thinks Hillary Clinton will win the election easily, which would be the best outcome for Australia. Minister for Defense Industry Christopher Pyne said the Democratic candidate was better on free trade and U.S. engagement in the Asian-Pacific region than Donald Trump.  ""I think Hillary will win and win easily and I think that would be the best outcome for Australia because she does support free trade, she does support the United States being deeply engaged in our Asian region which is critical to us,"" Pyne told Ten Network television late Tuesday. Australian government leaders generally avoid commenting on U.S. politics, saying they are prepared to work with whoever occupies the White House ___ 4:25 p.m. Some Mexicans are already preparing to celebrate a possible loss by Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election. A Facebook invite is asking people to gather at Mexico City's iconic Angel of Independence statue Tuesday night for a celebration if the Republican candidate loses. At least 5,000 people have already RSVPed that they would come. Trump is unpopular in Mexico for suggesting that many Mexican immigrants are criminals or rapists, and for promising to build a border wall between the countries. ___ 3 p.m. Few countries have more riding on the U.S. election than Cuba. Republican candidate Donald Trump has promised to reverse Barack Obama's normalization of relations with the communist-run island. Clinton has pledged to continue the process. Normalization with the U.S. is almost universally popular in Cuba, where people said they were rooting for Clinton and a future of better relations.  ""We have to respect whatever decision Trump would take but we don't want him to be president,"" Havana resident Lina Osorio said. ""We need relations between the two countries."" Fellow Havana resident Rangel Galindo said simply: ""I want it to be her, not him."" ___ 1:30 p.m. Argentine Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra says a win by Republican Donald Trump in the U.S. election would stall recent moves to improve relations between the countries. Malcorra told Argentine television channel Todo Noticias that the conservative government of President Maurico Macri had opened a new phase of cooperation and trade with Washington after years of strained relations under former President Cristina Fernandez. But she said Monday night that there might be a ""big stop"" in this process if Trump wins, and ""depending on the results, there might be big changes"" in U.S.-Argentine relations. The Argentine foreign minister said the ""more closed, isolationist and xenophobic"" model represented by the Republican candidate would have a major impact on the world and relations with Latin America. ___ 12:40 p.m. Germany's foreign minister says the bitter U.S. election campaign will leave a ""difficult legacy"" for the next president because it has deepened the country's divisions. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier says both Germans and many Americans ""are glad that this special election campaign is coming to an end."" He says the campaign ""has left a more or less divided country"" and it will be difficult for the incoming president to bridge the differences. Steinmeier has been sharply critical of Republican contender Donald Trump. He brushed aside suggestions that relations between Europe and the U.S. would also become more complicated under Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton -- saying that he knows Clinton and doesn't fear that. He spoke in Berlin on Tuesday. ___ 12:30 p.m. Kenyans in President Barack Obama's ancestral hometown have held their own version of the U.S. presidential election, leaning heavily toward Obama's own favorite in the race: Hillary Clinton. Tuesday's mock poll was held in Nyangoma-Kogelo, the birthplace of Obama's father. Kenyan comedian Laurence Oyange was an organizer. He says it's a way Kenyans can connect to America. Oyange said the poll was boycotted by Malik Obama, the president's half-brother who has said he supports Trump. There were 105 voters and 78 percent of them favored Clinton. Eleven percent went for Donald Trump. Other ballots were spoiled or disqualified. Oyange says the community also held mock U.S. elections during Obama's elections. ___ 12:15 p.m. Italian Premier Matteo Renzi is offering an Election Day swansong honor to Barack Obama, saying the first black American president ""wrote an indelible page of history"" that should inspire generations to come. Renzi pointed to U.S. job creation, investment in energy and health care as some of Obama's domestic victories. Renzi cited the Cuba detente and the Iran nuclear deal as international achievements for the Obama administration. Renzi writes in his weekly e-newsletter that ""Obama was a point of reference for those who still believe in the American dream, for those who believe in the Democratic Party, for those who believe in politics."" Renzi is the leader of Italy's Democratic Party and has said he hopes Hillary Clinton wins. Renzi writes that Obama will continue ""to be a source of inspiration and encounter for the new generation."" ___ 12:05 p.m. German Chancellor Angela Merkel says a victory for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election would be a step toward gender balance among world leaders. Merkel says she's awaiting the election result ""with suspense,"" while declining to comment directly on Clinton or rival Donald Trump. But asked Tuesday about the possibility of a woman winning the White House, she said: ""Then we'd come a little bit closer to a balance of women and men in leading positions."" Germany's first female leader was speaking alongside Erna Solberg, Norway's second female prime minister. Solberg said it ""may be inspiring for many young women to see politics not just as something that belongs to men."" But she added: ""There isn't some kind of global girlfriends network that wants to rule the world."" ___ 12:00 p.m. Poland's foreign minister says Eastern Europe is closely watching the U.S. elections but will reserve judgment on who would be a better president. Witold Waszczykowski declined to say whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would better serve the region's security and political interests. He says a future U.S. president would be judged after selecting ""prominent figures to run foreign policy and the military sector."" Nine senior diplomats and foreign ministers of NATO's eastern flank members met in Bucharest Tuesday to discuss Russia, regional security and the U.S. election. Waszczykowski says he doesn't think the words and ideas expressed during the campaign are necessarily ""a guide for a future president."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
