Judge Mark Wolf on Thursday agreed with prison officials and federal prosecutors who argued that DiMasi's health issues make it difficult for him to function normally in prison. DiMasi, 71, has served five years of an eight-year sentence on public corruption charges. He was diagnosed with, and treated for, throat and prostate cancer while in prison. DiMasi's doctors say his cancer is in remission, but his treatments caused a narrowing of his esophagus that creates a risk of choking when he eats or drinks. He now requires a pureed diet and has lost about 70 pounds, his lawyers have said. In his ruling, Wolf said he found ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" to warrant releasing DiMasi early from prison. Wolf cited the opinion of the medical director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, who found that DiMasi must be monitored while he eats.  ""This opinion is central to the court's conclusion that DiMasi's release is justified,"" Wolf wrote. Under Wolf's ruling granting compassionate release, the once-powerful Democrat will be released Tuesday from a federal prison in Butner, North Carolina, to his wife, Debbie DiMasi.  ""I'm thrilled, overwhelmed, it's hard to believe,"" Debbie DiMasi told WBZ-AM.  ""More than anything I really am extremely grateful and really can't wait to get him home and get him the health care he needs because he's really been struggling."" Current House Speaker Robert DeLeo, who succeeded DiMasi, said he's ""elated and relieved"" that DiMasi will be released in time to be with his family on Thanksgiving.  ""Speaker DiMasi and his family have been, and will continue to remain, in my thoughts and prayers,"" DeLeo said. David Guarino, who formerly served as a top aide to DiMasi, called Wolf's ruling ""the right, just and fair decision."" DiMasi was first elected to the state Legislature in 1979 and worked his way up through the ranks of the House to become speaker following the resignation of Thomas Finneran in 2004. He was convicted of public corruption charges for steering state contracts to a software firm in exchange for $65,000 funneled through his private law firm. DiMasi, who served as speaker from 2004 to 2009, was the third consecutive House speaker to leave office under an ethics cloud. He was convicted in 2011. Compassionate release is intended for inmates with terminal illnesses as well as elderly inmates who have served a significant portion of their sentences. In his ruling, Wolf said once DiMasi is released from prison and returns to Massachusetts, he is requiring a six-month period of home confinement. He said DiMasi will not be required to wear an electronic monitoring device and may leave his home for medical appointments and religious observances. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Both camps organized gatherings and marches in Prague to commemorate Thursday's anniversary. Participants traded insults, but anti-conflict officers intervened before fights could break out. In one incident, riot police had to separate far-right marchers from activists on the left who tried to block them. Zeman, who is known for his strong anti-migrant rhetoric, divides the nation with his pro-Russia stance and support for closer ties with China. Meanwhile, thousands came downtown to light a candle at a monument to the November 17 student demonstration that triggered the 1989 revolution. Zeman, who welcomed Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election, remained at the presidential palace outside Prague. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post)  A year ago, I wrote a humorous piece about Thanksgiving based on a virally successful satirical guide to attending a predominantly black barbecue. I wanted to give readers of my blog a laugh while asking a serious question: Are the foods and other cultural traditions that mark African American Thanksgiving dinners just as different? ""How to Survive Black Thanksgiving as a Non-Black Guest"" was a hit because, much like the piece it was based on, it confronted, head on, ideas about the unspoken rules and understandings of our collective food culture.   [Make the recipe: Pit-Cooked-Style Turkey]  It made me realize that we lack a vocabulary that other ethnic groups have for the feelings and meanings behind, as one person put it, ""how we be."" There should be, but there is no, African American version of Michael Pollan's ""Food Rules."" American ethnic groups have different versions of the same social slips, family politics and awkward moments -- so that's not unique. What is special is the approach to the foods of African American Thanksgiving meals and the ideas and history behind them.  [Thanksgiving Central: Your essential menu planner]  The collective West and Central African cultural past and slavery are key ingredients that spice and flavor the African American table like no other. It goes without saying that much of ""white Southern"" holiday food owes its savor to the influence of black cooks and living in the vicinity of black cultures. Thanksgiving, in fact, wasn't even around during slavery; it was embraced by some black families during Reconstruction and beyond, and even then not everybody celebrated it, including the family of esteemed Southern cook Edna Lewis. Some of the foods we like to eat at the holiday are based on a repertoire established in antebellum times. Corn shucking and other harvest time celebrations -- where turkey, hot wheat bread or rolls (absolutely rare during slavery), cakes and ham might be enjoyed -- were generally held between October and November, and this was typically followed by hog-killing time and its promises of fresh offal.  The Southern groaning table and the shadow rhythms of the antebellum past were reflected in what I knew growing up in Maryland, starting with the stale corn bread dish known as kush that became corn bread dressing. The table rarely included just one kind of meat, and turkey and ham often vied for the position of favorite, while only the strong ate the chitterlings and pigs' feet. But if I could get past the sight of those, there was always the hot, slightly sweet homemade rolls glistening with butter and softer than fresh cotton. Greens, never seasoned with vinegar by either of my Southern grandmothers, were kissed by the frost and therefore at their peak at this time of year, and this was also black-eyed pea and sweet potato time, and we could count on sweet potatoes making more than one appearance on the table.    Janice Canaday's Potato Salad. (Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post)   [Make the recipe: Janice Canaday's Potato Salad]  While many of these dishes have links to the food world of slavery, some represent the glory of freedom, with deviled eggs and macaroni pie (the old Southern and Caribbean name for mac and cheese) being a prime example of the eggs, pasta and cheese that rarely if ever were enjoyed under the lash. Others, such as potato salad and peach cobbler, seem to be seasonally out of place, but they are well tuned to the communal spirit of African American foodways. Let's face it, potato salad is a relatively cheap dish to multiply in case of extra company or a large crowd. The colorful, creamy, perfectly seasoned dish whose recipe caterer Janice Canaday, a historical interpreter in Williamsburg, Va., shared with me is one of the best I've ever had.  To Adrian Miller, author of ""Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time,"" holiday food is inextricable from soul food, which he said ""is essentially the celebration food of the rural South."" In a conversation over email, he described the process like this: African Americans who left the South during the Great Migration used food as a way to recreate a sense of home, and as they prospered, special occasion food became everyday food.  ""This is a similar trajectory for the food story of most immigrant groups in the U.S."" Miller said. ""In fact, what we often think of as 'ethnic food' is usually the celebration food of 'the old country' of that people."" According to Miller, black holiday menus ""usually have soulful (spicy, sweet, pungent, and well 'larded') side dishes, desserts and some sort of red or purple drink to accompany the more universal entree (ham, turkey, prime rib, etc.)."" Pumpkin and sweet potato pies connect to the longtime British dessert carrot pie. He and I agree that sweet potato wins out over pumpkin at the African American table because of the long history of sweet potatoes in the community; before pies were popular, enslaved people ate them roasted whole, as a pone and in puddings. But sweet potato pie is never alone. ""Sweet is the flavor that means holiday soul to me because I can't help but think of that extra table for the dessert spread: lemon ice box pie, sweet potato pie, coconut cake, poundcake and peach cobbler,"" Miller said. ""Mercy! But when people assail soul food as being unhealthy, I urge them to remember that celebration food was never meant to be eaten regularly."" When I asked my social-media community on Facebook and Twitter what their African American families ate for their holiday meals, they responded with lengthy, warm memories that sparked others to remember their own family traditions. Black Carolinians such as Harold Conyers, scholar and proponent of traditional South Carolina barbecue, agree that turkey should be barbecued or should be paired with pork barbecue on the holiday table, while others insist on fried turkey (made popular by the late Chef Austin Leslie of New Orleans) and even fried chicken. Smoky, peppery, barbecued turkey is not a new invention; it's right out of the barbecue past. Conyers's recipe rejuvenates this tradition, a noted favorite of the late Harlem restaurateur Sylvia Woods. Regionalisms permeate soul traditions and help enrich the stories we tell about our food and our perspective on what constitutes edible soul.     Soul Food Mac and Cheese. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)   [Make the recipe: Soul Food Mac and Cheese]  Folks from the ""Creole Coast"" and lower Mississippi Valley said that gumbo must be on the menu -- whether it was turkey or based on the game or seafood of the season. In a community that now blends traditions or includes family from Caribbean and West African immigrant communities, oxtails and peas and rice, Jollof rice and curried goat have joined the more traditional repertoire, while other families have incorporated Latin American and Filipino dishes such as mofongo and adobo. People spoke fondly of corn bread dressing flavored with hard-boiled eggs or turkey necks, sausage or chicken giblets -- and sometimes too much sage. It was agreed across the board that sweet potato pie is the only way to go, that peach cobbler must be present (even though it's out of season) and must have a flaky, buttery crust, and that ""Sock it To Me"" cake (glazed yellow cake filled with pecans and cinnamon) as well as caramel cake should be at hand. My friend KeKe Holiwell of Atlanta probably said it best in her response post: ""Rutabagas . . . we always had rutabagas, slap-yo-mama mac-n-cheese, giblet gravy, yeast rolls, 'conebread' (not coRnbread) dressin' with chunks of turkey in it, eggs, celery and it had a slightly green tinge because my grandma always added too much sage, sweet 'tatuh souflee, or sweet yams drowning in brown 'shugah' syrup and 'buttah,' corn puddin', collards, black-eyed peas, fried turkey, glazed ham, potato salad, fresh green beans, potato casserole. . . . Pecan pie, 'nanna puddin', poundcake with lemon icing, sock-it-to-me cake, hummingbird cake, peach cobbler . . . Then I became a vegan. I have NO IDEA what in the world I will eat this holiday season.""  Of all the values that our food embodies -- honoring our past, gratitude, recognizing our own cultural diversity, communal eating, hospitality -- holiday soul food is also a way to remember people and embrace the love and nourishment their lives represent. No holiday is complete without my mother's macaroni and cheese, with its savory hints of garlic, bite of sharp Cheddar and tinges of sweetness. I would always help Mom make the Thanksgiving meal, and being the official taste tester was one of my favorite things to do between washing collards and rubbing dried sage. Whenever I make this holiday treat, I can't help but remember how our food brings us close to our ancestors. While I pray for KeKe, give me some more barbecued turkey, potato salad and Mama's macaroni and cheese. Amen, and pass the ""to go"" plates.

The Russian military meanwhile said airstrikes in the rebel-held province of Idlib earlier this week killed at least 30 members of an al-Qaida-linked group, including three commanders. The strikes are part of a major Syrian and Russian offensive launched earlier this week on opposition-held areas that has killed dozens of people. In one area, volunteer first responders dug through the rubble for four hours before pulling out a six-year-old child who was still alive. The child's mother was killed in the strikes, said Ibrahim al-Haj, a spokesman for the rescuers, known as the Syrian Civil Defense. The activist-run Public Services Authority said the Bab al-Nairab water plant was struck with a barrel bomb. Spokesman Ahmad al-Shami said the plant was damaged but is still operating.  ""This regime uses any means to add pressure to civilians. It has bombed bakeries and hospitals and has not made an exception for water and electricity,"" he told The Associated Press. Airstrikes on Wednesday struck the city's central blood bank and a children's hospital. Medical facilities have repeatedly come under attack during the Syrian conflict, with 126 such incidents this year alone, according to the World Health Organization. Doctors Without Borders said the children's hospital and a specialized surgical hospital were hit by Wednesday's strikes.  ""Hospital staff managed to move children_including prematurely born babies_from cots and incubators to the basement of the building in order to shelter them from the bombing,"" said the aid group, which sponsors both hospitals. The Oxfam aid group said the more than 250,000 residents of eastern Aleppo have limited food and clean water as winter approaches, and are at risk of disease outbreaks. No U.N. aid has reached eastern Aleppo since July, and the U.N. has warned that supplies will run out this week. Oxfam said it helped move a generator to the besieged area on Wednesday to improve the water supply.  ""Clean water is vital, but it won't stop starvation, never mind protect people from indiscriminate aerial attacks,"" said Andy Baker, who is leading Oxfam's Syria response. The Syrian Civil Defense said 28 people were killed in and around Aleppo on Thursday. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of local activists, put the death toll at 25. At least 70 people were killed in northern Syria on Tuesday and Wednesday. Russia says it is not bombing Aleppo as part of the offensive announced this week, but is instead targeting insurgents in Idlib and the central Homs province. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the strikes targeting al-Qaida took place in Idlib on Tuesday, and were launched from Russia's only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, which recently deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. He said three leading members of the al-Qaida-linked Fatah al-Sham Front -- Muhammad Helala, Abu Jaber Harmuja and Abul Baha al-Asfari -- were among those killed. He said al-Asfari had overseen the group's attempts to break the siege of Aleppo. Al-Asfari had led a moderate rebel group in 2013, and it was not clear if or when he joined the al-Qaida-linked group. An opposition media group known as All4Syria reported that the two other named militants were killed Tuesday in an airstrike in the village of Kfar Jalis, in the Idlib countryside, that also killed six civilians. The Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said the airstrike on the jihadi stronghold killed six leading militants, without identifying them. The same village was struck Thursday, the Observatory said, killing six civilians from the same family. The Russian Defense Ministry said long-range bombers dispatched from Russia fired cruise missiles at Islamic State and al-Qaida targets in Syria during a 7,000-mile (11,000-kilometer) flight. It said fighter jets from the carrier and an air base in Syria also took part in the strikes. It did not say where the strikes took place, but said they destroyed command facilities, ammunition depots and weapons factories. Months of negotiations between the U.S. and Russia failed to cement a long-term cease-fire in Aleppo, which has become the focus of the war between Syrian President Bashar Assad and rebels fighting to topple him. Al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate is fighting alongside the rebels, but the Islamic State group has no presence in Aleppo. ___ Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov and Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed.

(Carlo Allegri/Reuters)  A year ago this month, The Fix's Philip Bump wrote an article under the headline, ""Why the media won't say Donald Trump is lying."" ""The problem that arises is that we can't know his intentionality,"" Bump explained. ""Unless Trump comes out and says something equivalent to, 'I was trying to deceive people,' we can't say with certainty that this was his intention -- no matter how obvious it may seem and no matter how many times in the past we've wondered about his intentionality."" In case you haven't noticed, the media's ""we can't know"" theory was tossed out the window over the past 12 months. The word ""lie"" -- traditionally avoided, in favor of less-loaded terms like ""false statement"" or ""factual inaccuracy"" -- is now applied with some regularity to claims made by the Republican presidential nominee and his campaign.   [How the heck can voters think Donald Trump is more honest than Hillary Clinton?]   On Monday, for example, The Washington Post's Ben Terris dropped the ""L"" word on Team Trump nine times in a single, first-person article in which he recalled how the campaign tried to ""gaslight"" him after he watched then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski yank journalist Michelle Fields by the arm in March. Observe: The Trump campaign has told many lies since Lewandowski lied about grabbing Fields in that Florida ballroom. Trump lied in front of millions by claiming that Hillary Clinton's campaign started rumors that President Obama was foreign-born (it didn't). He lied when he said he started his business with a ""very small loan"" from his father (which is only true if you consider $14 million a small loan). the New York Times decided in September that ""lie"" is the only accurate way to describe some of Trump's untrue statements, most notably his repeated (and only recently relinquished) claim that President Obama was born outside the United States. Executive editor Dean Baquet explained the Times' move in an interview on NPR that month. ""I think to say that that was a 'falsehood' wouldn't have captured the duration of his claim and, to be frank, the outrageousness of his claim,"" Baquet said. ""I think to have called it just a falsehood would have put it in the category of the usual political fare, where politicians say, 'My tax plan will save a billion dollars,' but it's actually a half a billion, and they're using the wrong analysis. This was something else. And I think we owed it to our readers to just call it out for what it was."" Since January, the Huffington Post has attached an editor's note to most Trump-related news stories that describes the real estate magnate as a ""serial liar."" Other news outlets that have used the word ""lie"" in Trump coverage include the Guardian, Politico, NBC, Vox, Vanity Fair, Forbes, the Los Angeles Times, Red State, Slate and Salon. It is now standard practice in many newsrooms for journalists to identify a false statement, conclude that Trump knew it was false when he said it, then describe it to readers, viewers or listeners as a flat-out lie. Just one more political norm shattered in 2016. The question is whether Trump coverage is an exception to a rule that remains in place, or whether the rule has changed forever."

Barbara Comstock and Democratic challenger LuAnn Bennett are taking starkly different approaches to rallying voters in the final frenzied hours of one of the most competitive House races in the nation. Comstock, who is seeking a second term representing northern Virginia's 10th district, is hopscotching from supermarket to commuter bus stop and church to coffee shop, drawing on her knowledge of the district and its varied constituencies.  Bennett, a real estate executive, is traveling with popular Democrats, including Khizr Khan -- the father of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq in 2004 -- Sen. Mark Warner (Va.) and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.).  Bennett was anticipating a Monday night rally led by Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) at George Mason University, hoping it will give her a boost Election Day as Democrats cast ballots for Hillary Clinton and down-ballot races. A late Sunday night visit by Donald Trump, however, put Comstock in an awkward spot. As supporters prepared for Trump's touchdown at the Loudoun Fairgrounds in her district, Comstock -- who strongly denounced him -- went to a Korean market and a Diwali celebration. Comstock and Bennett made their pitch to the Muslim community in back-to-back visits Friday to the ADAMS Center mosque. Bennett appeared with Warner, Attorney General Mark Herring (D) and Khan, a Virginia resident who gave an emotional speech for Clinton at the Democratic convention and was recently featured in a Clinton campaign ad. He told hundreds gathered for prayers that they were obligated to defend their religion at the ballot box. ""One candidate has challenged our faith, our existence in this country,"" Khan said, referring to Trump. ""The other candidate has supported us, has encouraged us to be proud of our faith.""  At the next call for prayers, about 90 minutes later, it was Comstock's turn. She reminded the community that she called Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States ""unconstitutional"" and ""un-American"" almost a year ago.  ""She doesn't limit herself to just things that are just PR value. She's been to closed-door meetings where she's helped the community behind the scenes,"" said Sarah Cochran, Virginia state director for Emerge USA, which is dedicated to protecting minority rights, and endorsed Comstock. Bennett was endorsed by the American Muslim Women PAC. Both groups support Clinton.  Independent political analysts consider the race a ""toss up"" leaning toward Comstock but the outcome is likely to depend on Clinton's margin in the state.  Clinton had a 6-point lead over Trump in a survey released Tuesday by the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University, as both parties made their closing case to voters. There have been no publicly released polls of 10th District voters. Outside money is playing a huge role in the congressional contest as both sides flood the airwaves with ads. Groups spent $11.6 million in the district, including $6.1 million against Comstock and $5.5 million against Bennett, according the data compiled by the bipartisan Virginia Public Access Project. Comstock raised $4.6 million to Bennett's $2.2 million, reports show. The presidential race has loomed large in the congressional district -- which was drawn to favor a Republican in a part of the state that delivered Democrats wins in all five statewide offices in recent years.  The district includes all of Loudoun, where a growing population of affluent, educated and diverse residents have sometimes turned the county blue, as well Manassas, Manassas Park and Clarke and Frederick counties and parts of Fairfax and Prince William counties, where the GOP presidential nominee has more support.  While Manassas and Manassas Park reliably vote for Democrats, the rural northern Shenandoah Valley stretching the West Virginia border is a Republican stronghold where Trump is popular. Comstock is among a handful of House Republicans who urged Trump to drop out of the race last month, betting that the move would help her more with the district's independent voters than it would cost her his supporters.  The party's schism over Trump has forced Comstock to run without the support of the top of the ticket; she has focused on regional issues from Metro funding to opioid abuse, without relying on a coordinated ground game or high-level surrogates.  House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), who said he voted for Trump, visited the district twice for private fundraisers not public events.  Comstock, a former Capitol Hill staffer, Justice Department official and Republican operative, spent five years in the House of Delegates before winning the seat her former boss, Frank Wolf, held for more than three decades. Bennett, a first-time candidate and longtime Democratic donor who was married to former congressman Jim Moran, built her campaign around tying Comstock to Trump on issues such as immigration and abortion. Polls are open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday in Virginia.  "

Voters in Washington state will weigh in on Initiative 732 in the 2016 election as they consider whether to approve the nation's first direct carbon tax on the burning of fossil fuels. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)  A carbon tax proposal in Washington state, scheduled for the ballot on Tuesday, has been drawing national attention for weeks as a result of the unexpected controversy it's inspired among environmental groups, many of whom have outright opposed the initiative. And in the final days leading up to the vote, new voices have continued to join the fray, including influential players on all sides of the climate change conversation. New reports from the state's Public Disclosure Commission reveal that several prominent national fossil fuel interests have recently donated to the ""No on 732"" campaign, an effort organized by the Association of Washington Business in opposition to what is known as Initiative 732. Just last Thursday, Koch Industries contributed $50,000 to the campaign. And American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers contributed $250,000 at the end of October, making the organization the second largest donor behind Kaiser Aluminum.   Also last week, economic justice organization Rebuild the Dream, founded by former White House adviser and current CNN commentator Van Jones, released two Facebook ads -- reportedly at a cost of $10,000 -- urging Washington citizens to vote against the initiative. This is in addition to the many social and environmental justice organizations in the state, including OneAmerica, Green for All, Front and Centered and the Washington chapter of Sierra Club, that have already spoken out against I-732, citing concerns that the proposal fails to directly reinvest in disadvantaged communities and clean energy infrastructure. The result is a rare moment in which climate activists and members of the fossil fuel industry have aligned in opposition to a climate-oriented policy. It's a development that has ""twisted the usual alliances,"" said Yoram Bauman, the environmental economist who first spearheaded the effort behind Initiative 732 on the Washington ballot. However, Vien Truong, director of environmental justice initiative Green for All, noted by email that a diverse set of organizations and leaders oppose I-732. She suggested that proponents of I-732 ""crafted this initiative in hopes of courting conservative and corporate support."" For many of the opposing environmental groups, the issue boils down to the revenue generated by the tax -- and what's going to be done with it. I-732 proposes a revenue neutral carbon tax, in which additional income to Washington's coffers from the tax would be offset by a cut in the state's sales tax. Tax revenue would also be used to fund Washington's Working Families Tax Rebate, which would provide up to $1,500 annually to hundreds of thousands of low-income families in the state.   However, despite endorsements from dozens of climate scientists, as well as economists and  politicians across the political spectrum, many of the opposing environmental groups have called instead for a proposal that would redirect its revenue back into specific programs such as affordable housing, improved public transportation or free solar for working families. Cutting the sales tax and funding the Working Families Rebate, according to Truong, does not go far enough. Proponents of I-732 ""proposed these changes to mitigate future negative problems caused by the initiative; it does nothing to address the many environmental and economic problems that currently exist in low income areas and for working families,"" she said in an email. She and other local opponents of the initiative, as well as Van Jones, also expressed these concerns during a teleconference last week. ""A proposal can only be environmentally sustainable if it's politically sustainable,"" Jones said during the teleconference. But of course, the point of the policy is to tax carbon and thus reduce emissions, not to address a far broader social agenda in the state, note I-732 supporters. And a revenue neutral carbon tax is also designed to appeal to political conservatives by deliberately not increasing the size of government. It wasn't realized, perhaps until the Washington State battle, that such a move could win the center but also lose the left. Economists have generally argued that the purpose of carbon pricing is to allow the market to drive down greenhouse gas emissions on its own. ""The beauty of a carbon tax is that...it changes behavior and investments, but at the same time it returns the money back to households and businesses and it doesn't distort economic activity,"" said Werner Antweiler, a professor in the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business.  Antweiler has studied the impact of British Columbia's carbon tax, which economists have widely hailed as a prime example of a successful carbon pricing scheme. Some have pointed to the revenue-neutral B.C. tax as a potential indicator of I-732's future success, should it come to pass. However, in another unexpected development, some environmental groups have also begun to question the B.C. tax's effectiveness.   A recent report from environmental and consumer rights group Food & Water Watch suggests that the B.C. tax has not actually been effective at reducing emissions from taxed sources.  ""This data from British Columbia, where a carbon tax has been in place for the better part of a decade, is not inspiring,"" said Julia DeGraw, Northwest senior organizer for Food & Water Watch, in a recent statement. ""There is no compelling reason to believe that a carbon tax would work to reduce emissions in Washington either."" However, this suggestion is at odds with the conclusions drawn by most other reports on the B.C. carbon tax. Antweiler suggests that the report has failed to take several crucial factors into account, including recent population growth in British Columbia and the time it takes for citizens to make the energy- and carbon-saving investments that demonstrate a carbon tax's full impact.   ""I think [I-732] would be successful in Washington State, if it passes,"" said Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist who chaired as George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers from 2003 to 2005. ""And I'm hopeful that it would become a model for other states, and indeed nationwide. And indeed it really should be worldwide. ...I think this kind of thing is really the model for where climate policy needs to go in the coming years.""   In the meantime, the polls reflect the ever-rising tension over I-732 as the vote approaches. Some of the most recent poll results, released Oct. 27, indicated that 36 percent of voters were certain they would vote for the tax, while 35 percent were certain they would vote against it. Another 15 percent leaned toward voting yes, while 9 percent leaned toward voting no, and 4 percent planned to skip it altogether. ""We feel like we have a shot at it,"" Bauman said. ""There's still a lot of undecided voters. I think we've had a hard time breaking through the noise of the presidential campaign. But the more people hear about our policy, the more they like it."""

Here’s what happened instead.	"   Birgitta Jonsdottir, right, of the Pirate Party gestures alongisde party members after early results of the parliamentary elections in Iceland, Oct. 29. (Reuters/Geirix)  Icelanders voted in parliamentary elections on Saturday. Even before the results were in, it was clear that something unusual was going on. Just a couple of years ago, few would have predicted the near evisceration of the center-left Social Democratic Alliance, although it fits a pattern we are seeing throughout Europe. Also noteworthy was the fact that the anti-establishment vote did not go to the xenophobic right or the radical left, as in many other European countries, but was divided among a number of new political parties that mostly shun traditional political labels. Taken together, such parties took a third of the vote. Although this reflected a deep distaste for politics as usual, it seemed to be an unusually moderate revulsion. Meanwhile, voters who could still stomach the traditional parties opted mostly for the further ends of the political spectrum. The right-wing Independence party won 29 percent of the vote while the Left Green Party received 15.9 percent. These are substantial gains for both parties. In Iceland, then, the extremes have held, while the political landscape is being redrawn as a result of an unstable center of parties that disavow the customary categories of left and right. Of the new political movements, the Pirate Party has garnered the most media attention by far, and not without reason. The Pirates are hardly your typical politicians. Pirate Parties started cropping up in Europe in the mid-2000s. Although they were intrinsically antiestablishment -- gleefully flying black pirate flags as their symbol -- they initially were narrowly focused on a narrowly libertarian set of issues. Issues such as transparency, Internet freedom and copyright reform were at the core of their agenda. Still, in the political turmoil of the early post-crisis, these parties gained some momentum and Pirate candidates took office in a handful of European parliaments.   [The Panama Papers made Iceland's prime minister resign. Here's why.]   Their greatest electoral success was in Iceland, where they received just over 5 percent of the vote and won three out of 63 parliamentary seats in 2013. The Icelandic Pirates-turned-parliamentarians stuck to the Pirates' core agenda: One of their first parliamentary motions was to offer Edward Snowden asylum. They then set out to make Iceland a digital data haven, or ""Switzerland of bits"" in the turn of phrase of noted cyber-libertarian John Perry Barlow, offering a place where people could store data that might be politically problematic elsewhere. Radical transparency has remained a core part of their platform from the outset. However, they also quickly began carving out a broader set of policies for a range of issues. True to form, they did so largely through extensive and democratic online mobilization of their quickly expanding grass roots. While the center-right governing coalition was mired in scandal as the Panama papers revealed that three of its ministers held offshore accounts and much of the opposition was embroiled in bruising infighting, the Pirates were painstakingly, and sometimes painfully, building a platform, issue by issue. Incoming Pirate parliamentarian, journalist and stand-up comedian Gunnar Hrafn Jonsson thinks that this process was key to the Pirates' momentum: ""While other parties were either fractious or caught up in corruption scandals, we showed that we could be a force for reform. This inspired a lot of people to join us and help further hone our agenda. In this way we both broadened our appeal and proved that we could grow beyond a single-issue party.""   [When tiny Iceland did beat England: Remember the Cod Wars!]   All this, and the fact that at times they polled as high as 40 percent, made the Icelandic Pirates a bit of an international cause celebre. On the eve of the election, party leader Birgitta Jonsdottir was trailed by dozens of foreign journalists -- an unusual situation for an Icelandic politician, to say the least. A number of international media outlets framed the election as an epic confrontation between the upstart Pirates and the entrenched right-wing Independence Party. Pirate puns abounded. It made for a great story. Yet the exclusive focus on the Pirates yielded a skewed picture of the Icelandic elections. In the end, the Pirate Party got 14.5 percent of the vote and 10 parliamentary seats -- an impressive jump, certainly, but by no means the explosion in support many expected. The other big gainer from the elections, which has received scant international attention, is the newcomer Vidreisn party, which received just over 10.5 percent of the vote and seven seats. Where the Pirates reveled in their unorthodox approach to politics, Vidreisn was its virtual opposite, carefully building up an image of the respectable protector of common-sense politics. However, while market-friendly and pro-European, Vidreisn, like the Pirates, avoided explicitly positioning itself on the left-right axis. Yet a closer look at the respective agendas of the two parties shows that traditional political labels still hold analytical traction. Thus, the Pirates' agenda has some of the hallmarks of traditional social democracy, albeit mixed with a stiff dose of techno-optimism, while Vidreisn espouses policies that are considerably further to the right than the moderate image the party projects might suggest. For example, the Pirates unequivocally favor free government-sponsored universal health care, while Vidreisn supports a mixed system of private and public health-care provisions where patients would have to co-pay for their health. Although neither party offers a very detailed economic vision, their divergent emphases are telling. The Pirates stress more effective taxation with a focus on cracking down on offshore evasion and corporate inversions. Vidreisn, on the other hand, has invested a great deal of political capital in promoting the idea of a currency board as the solution to Iceland's currency dilemma. It is interesting to note that their discussion of this rather radical policy move does not discuss how this policy ties the hands of the central bank, imposes limits on public spending and encourages privatization, as scholars of political economy like Jonathan Kirshner have shown. The center-right government that has been in power in Iceland for the past three years was forced to call Saturday's election because of the revelations of the Panama papers. It has certainly lost its majority. However, if Vidreisn joins the coalition, the right coalition becomes viable again and stays in power. Although other permutations are certainly possible, this coalition seems the likeliest outcome. Other combinations would require the cooperation of a number of parties with very different politics and vocal supporters who will not let them stray far from course. The shifting terrain suggests that many former supporters of the Social Democratic Alliance opted for Vidreisn this time around, probably drawn to the party's pro-European stance. However, this sort of coalition is almost certainly not what these voters had in mind. There are at least two lessons here. One is that sometimes the real radicals aren't the ones carrying the pirate flags. The other is that explicit left-right labels can help; even parties that claim to have transcended ideological categories, usually fit better on the left or right than they might like to admit."
