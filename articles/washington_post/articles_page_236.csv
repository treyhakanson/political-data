""I got rid of my breakfast and rushed to the office and said, 'I have to see the Secretary.' I told him, 'Somebody has to go over and hold their hands; they're going to be terrified,'"" Gruber said in a 2010 interview in The Sunday Telegraph of London. That somebody turned out to be her, and as she accompanied the refugees to the U.S., she interviewed them, which became the basis of ""Haven: The Dramatic Story of 1,000 World War II Refugees and How They Came to America,"" one of her many books but only one part of Gruber's long, trailblazing life. The journalist and humanitarian died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan, according to her editor, Philip Turner. She was 105. Gruber, who was born in Brooklyn, started college at New York University at age 15 and had earned a Ph.D. from the University of Cologne in Germany by the time she was 20. Her dissertation was on Virginia Woolf, whom she later met. Gruber then went into journalism, becoming a foreign correspondent and visiting places including the Soviet Arctic and Siberia. She produced both words and photographs. During World War II, she was appointed special assistant to Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, for whom she carried out a study to see if returning veterans could settle in Alaska. In 1944, Gruber got involved in a mission to bring a group of 1,000 Jewish refugees from Europe to the United States. She lobbied fiercely for the refugees to be given American citizenship, which they eventually were granted. She returned to journalism after the war, covering stories such as the plight of other Jewish refugees and the impetus to allow some to settle in what was then Palestine.  ""I thought that wherever there was injustice we should fight it, and what better tool than journalism? I always carried my little Hermes typewriter that weighed about two pounds and my two cameras,"" she said in the Sunday Telegraph interview. She was honored with awards from organizations including the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance. Gruber married twice; both of her husbands died before her. She is survived by her son and daughter from her first marriage. ___ Associated Press writer Hillel Italie in New York contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The demonstrations stretched into a third straight night Thursday and came to a head in Portland, Oregon, where thousands of marchers chanted, ""We reject the president-elect!"" while some lit firecrackers, sparked small blazes and used rocks and baseball bats to break the glass of businesses and vehicles parked at dealerships. Officers began pushing back against the crowd that threw glass bottles and a trash can, making 26 arrests and using flash-bang devices and pepper spray to force people to disperse. The protest's organizer on Friday decried the vandalism and said the group planned to help clean up. In Los Angeles, protests were mostly peaceful, but 185 people were arrested, mostly for blocking streets, Officer Norma Eisenman said. An officer was injured near police headquarters, leading to one arrest, but Eisenman had no details about the circumstances or the injury. The officer was released after treatment. The persisting protests led Trump himself to fire back, tweeting: ""Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!"" His supporters also took to social media to accuse protesters of sour grapes and refusing to respect the democratic process, though there were no significant counterprotests. In Portland, police termed the protest a riot after some 4,000 people surged into the downtown area. After giving several orders to leave, officers fired rubber baton rounds. It was not clear if anyone was hurt. In Denver, protesters made their way onto Interstate 25, stopping traffic for about a half-hour. They also briefly shut down highways in Minneapolis and Los Angeles. In downtown San Francisco, high school students called out ""not my president"" as they marched, holding signs urging a Trump eviction. They waved rainbow banners and Mexican flags, as bystanders in the heavily Democratic city gave them high-fives.  ""As a white, queer person, we need unity with people of color, we need to stand up,"" said Claire Bye, a 15-year-old sophomore at Academy High School. ""I'm fighting for my rights as an LGBTQ person. I'm fighting for the rights of brown people, black people, Muslim people."" Nearby in Oakland, a group got into some shoving matches with police and 11 people were arrested. Protesters lit street fires, smashed windows and sprayed graffiti on at least seven businesses. In New York City and Chicago, large groups gathered outside Trump Tower. In New York, they chanted angry slogans and waved banners bearing anti-Trump messages. Police still stood guard Friday on Fifth Avenue.  ""You got everything straight up and down the line,"" demonstrator David Thomas said. ""You got climate change, you got the Iran deal. You got gay rights, you got mass deportations. Just everything, straight up and down the line, the guy is wrong on every issue."" In Philadelphia, protesters near City Hall held signs saying, ""Not Our President,"" ''Trans Against Trump"" and ""Make America Safe For All."" Officers on bikes blocked traffic for a march that spanned four street lanes and drew parents with children in strollers. Jeanine Feito, 23, held a sign reading, ""Not 1 more deportation."" The Temple University student said she acknowledges Trump as president-elect but does not accept it.  ""I'm Cuban-American. My parents are immigrants, and I'm also a woman. These are things Trump doesn't stand for,"" Feito said. ""He's bullied us, discriminated against us, is racist and encourages violence. I think it's important we stand together and fight against this."" About 500 people turned out at a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, while hundreds in Baltimore marched to the stadium where the Ravens were playing a football game. ___ Jablon reported from Los Angeles.

(Jim Bourg/Reuters )  Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley (D) said Friday that he is taking a ""hard look"" at seeking the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, becoming a third possible candidate in the wake of Hillary Clinton's defeat in the presidential race. ""Since the election, I have been approached by many Democrats who believe our party needs new leadership,"" O'Malley said in a statement. ""I'm taking a hard look at DNC Chair because I know how badly we need to reform our nominating process, articulate a bold progressive vision, recommit ourselves to higher wages and a stronger middle class, and return to our roots as a nationwide, grassroots party."" O'Malley, a two-term governor with a litany of liberal accomplishments, sought the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee but dropped out after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses. He is a former chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association.   [Schumer throws his support behind Keith Ellison for DNC chairman]   So far, former governor Howard Dean has said he's interested in the post, which he previously held. And Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) is expected to announce on Monday that he is in the running to replace interim chairwoman Donna Brazile. Ellison has already picked up endorsements from Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), expected to be the next minority leader in his chamber, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), who was the runner-up in the Democratic primaries. Though O'Malley tried to position himself as a progressive during the run-up to the primaries, he also had past ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton and the more centrist Democratic Leadership Council, a think tank that praised his data-driven method of governing while mayor of Baltimore. In the 2008 presidential race, O'Malley became one of the first governors to endorse Clinton for president."

(Ahmed Taranh/AFP)  The uprisings that became known as the Arab Spring were sparked in December 2010, when a young Tunisian fruit seller set himself on fire in response to harassment from police officers. Within months, huge protests had spread throughout the Arab world, taking down autocratic governments in four countries but also sparking horrific civil wars and giving fuel to religious and sectarian extremism in the region. Now a new report from the United Nations suggests that the turmoil in the years since 2010 has left a heavy economic imprint in the Arab region -- in particular, leading to a net loss of $613.8 billion in economic activity, or about 6 percent of gross domestic product from 2011 to 2015. The lengthy report, published by the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia on Thursday, used estimates of growth made before 2011 to help understand this loss. It is the first report of its kind to be made by a major economic body, and although it focuses only on the economic situation, it provides a rare quantification of the cost of the Arab Spring for the region's inhabitants. The commission noted that it was not just the conflict and political turmoil in the region that hurt its economic situation -- low oil prices have also led to a sharp decline in export revenue for many Arab economies over the past year. But conflict is noted as one of the largest drivers of the economic loss. The crisis in Syria, now in its sixth year, is estimated to have caused GDP and capital losses of $259 billion since 2011, according to estimates from another U.N. group, the National Agenda for the Future of Syria. The report points to some glimmers of hope, noting, for example, that in other regions, conflict and regime change has eventually had a long-term positive effect on countries. But political transitions in the Arab world have not largely not helped economic growth, the report finds, in part because there have not been reforms that addressed the issues that led to the Arab Spring unrest. The conflicts have also had huge social implications, including large-scale population displacement and rising unemployment in countries that underwent conflict or those that have received refugees because of conflicts in neighboring countries. The situation is especially difficult for women, who tend to participate in the labor market at a far lesser extent than men in Arab countries. The report also cites data from Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, finding that Arab countries are perceived as some of the most corrupt on the planet -- and despite the role of corruption in sparking protests in 2010 and 2011, corruption is actually perceived to have increased in many Arab countries over the past five years. The U.N. economic commission lists a number of policy recommendations in its report to help repair the situation, including the ""key"" aspect of financing reconstruction through domestic resources and foreign assistance. Mohamed el Moctar Mohamed el Hacene, the commission's economic development director, told Reuters that the oil downturn may force some countries to put in place ""economic reforms leading to real diversification."" But the country would need more support from the international community if it was to truly recover. ""We have seen in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Balkans the support they got in order to recover after conflict,"" Hacene said. ""We have not seen so far such support occurring for the Arab region."" More on WorldViews  Five years after Egypt's Arab Spring: 'We didn't need a revolution' "

""We'll see."" (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  Thursday afternoon, LeBron James visited the White House with his Cleveland Cavaliers teammates for the final time while President Barack Obama, a man he had come to know well, remained in office. He had not yet decided whether it would be the final time he visited the Rose Garden, period, regardless of how many NBA championships he adds to the three he already has won. James, who endorsed Hillary Clinton both at rallies and in a newspaper editorial, said Friday morning at Verizon Center he would have to consider whether to celebrate a potential future championship with President-Elect Donald Trump at the White House. ""I don't know,"" James said. ""That's something that we'll cross. We'll have to cross that road if we get there. We'll see. I would hope to have to cross that road. That doesn't mean I wouldn't want another championship."" James, sitting underneath a basket before shootaround, chuckled as he finished the answer. The past three days have been hard on him. He had a personal stake in the election. Having waded into social issues for the past several years and helped more than 1,000 underprivileged kids enter college, James gave a full-throated endorsement to Clinton. ""Only one person running truly understands the struggles of an Akron child born into poverty,"" James wrote Oct. 2. ""And when I think about the kinds of policies and ideas the kids in my foundation need from our government, the choice is clear. That candidate is Hillary Clinton.""   [Will LeBron James remain politically active after Hillary Clinton's loss?]   And then James's home state played a significant role in her defeat. Just 44 percent of Ohio, viewed as a critical swing state, voted for Clinton. The loss stung James, a wildly popular figure failing so decisively in a popularity contest. ""It was difficult,"" James said. ""It was difficult watching it. Me and my wife didn't go to bed until 4 o'clock in the morning. It was very difficult seeing what happened not only in our state, but in our country. Like I said, it is what it is. That's in the past. We need to live in the present and make our future better."" Across the NBA, a league in which the vast majority of players are black, players and coaches expressed despair about Trump's victory. Pistons Coach Stan Van Gundy denounced Trump as ""brazenly"" misogynist and racist. ""Words cannot express the honor I feel being the last team to visit the White House tomorrow,"" Cavaliers veteran Richard Jefferson wrote in an Instagram post. James vowed he would continue his advocacy and his community involvement, regardless of the presidential outcome. Friday morning, he wore a black cap with the phrase ""Always Believe"" in gold lettering above his personal logo. He insisted Trump's victory would not fundamentally change the nation and called on fellow people who felt disappointment not to let the outcome diminish their civic participation. ""He's our president,"" James said. ""No matter if you agree with it or disagree with it, he's the guy, and we all have to figure a way to make America as great as it can be. We all have to do our part. Our nation has never been built on one guy, anyways. It's been built on multiple guys, multiple people in power, multiple people having a dream and making it become a reality by giving back to the community, by giving back to the youth, doing so many great things. ""We always have a guy that has the most power, and that's the President of the United States. But it's never been built on one guy. We all have to figure out a way we can better our country. We all know, we all feel, that this is the best country in the world. We have to all do our part. It's not about him. It's not about him at all, especially not for me and what I do.""   [TNT's Ernie Johnson isn't sticking to sports after Election Day]   Though the celebration came two days after Clinton's defeat, the ceremony included typical moments of levity. Power forward Kevin Love handed Obama a jersey, the sleeved version the Cavaliers wore during their Game 7 victory, and Obama cracked, ""These sleeves get tight. Can I tear these out? Can I rip them?"" James is known in NBA circles for his propensity to tears the sleeves during games. Love reconnected with Vice President Joe Biden, whom he had met two years ago filming a PSA for domestic violence. ""Biden's a guy you'd love to have a beer with,"" Love said.""But the first lady is the star."" James took a selfie with Michelle Obama with teammate Channing Frye in the background. ""She's so cool,"" Love said. ""She did the mannequin challenge with us. She took us to the basketball court. She made the joke that Kyrie [Irving] was hanging on to the Larry O'Brien Trophy too long, and she didn't get to see it."" The Cavaliers, James said, did not speak with Obama or his staff about Trump's victory or ensuing presidency. But Obama told the crowd Thursday that James and several teammates had met with senior advisor Valerie Jarrett in the Roosevelt Room to discuss the relationship between black communities and police officers, an issue James has been outspoken about, particularly during a speech this summer at the ESPYs awards show. ""That's an ongoing conversation,"" James said. ""That's every day. We're always having that conversation. It's an open dialogue. Having that conversation, it's an open dialogue. At this point, we just have to find ways we can all be better. It's not just about one group or one person. It's about all of us having a conversation, and then having a plan and executing that plan. That's a conversation that has to go on."" ""These Cavs exemplify a growing generation of athletes that are using their platforms to speak out,"" Obama said Thursday. ""We've seen Kevin on combating campus sexual assault. LeBron on issues like gun violence and working with Michelle to help more kids go to school.""   [President Obama as Cavaliers visit the White House: 'Cleveland was always Believeland']   Thursday's visit meant more to James, even more than the first two title ceremonies he experienced with the Miami Heat, because it would be the final one with Obama. ""We made sure we was going to go before he was out of office,"" James said. In his 13-year NBA career, James has transformed from a high school phenom to perhaps the most prominent athlete on the planet. Obama praised him Thursday as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. His achievements, fame and political leanings have prompted a ""real genuine relationship"" with Obama, James said, which he called ""surreal."" James also promised his relationship with Obama would last beyond the day his term ends Jan. 20. He did not believe Thursday's visit in the Rose Garden was the appropriate time to detail how it would continue. ""But we looked at each other, and we know there is a lot to still be done,"" James said. ""We will regroup."""

Though the book won't close on his presidency until Inauguration Day, Obama's frenzied, last-minute push for Clinton was a farewell tour of the nation. As he crisscrossed Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania Monday, he waxed nostalgic, told old stories and teared up as he thanked the nation for betting, improbably, on ""a skinny guy with a funny name."" He said he'd been asked recently whether the hope that defined his campaign had somehow survived eight trying years.  ""The answer's yes,"" Obama said in Independence Mall, not far from the Liberty Bell. He said he was still a believer, ""and that's because of you.""  ""In the letters you've written me, in the tears you've shed for a lost loved one, I've seen again and again your goodness and your strength and your heart,"" Obama said. Then the Obamas and the Clintons embraced onstage: The last Democratic president and the current one; the first black president and the woman who, on Tuesday, may break yet another historic barrier. It was left to Michelle Obama, whose visceral speeches this campaign hit a nerve with many Americans, to cast both families as part of a singular American story: One of inclusive opportunity that she hoped would contrast powerfully with the vision of Republican Donald Trump. She said she marveled at a country where ""a girl like me from the South Side of Chicago, whose great-great-grandfather was a slave, can go to some of the finest universities on earth. Where the biracial son of a single mother from Hawaii and the son of a single mother from Hope, Arkansas, can both make it to the White House.""  ""Thank you for welcoming us into your communities, for giving us a chance whether you agreed with our politics or not,"" Mrs. Obama said, in her own send-off to the nation. She said ensuring Clinton wins the election was ""perhaps the last and most important thing that I can do for my country as first lady."" It wasn't always this way. In 2008, when Obama defeated Clinton in a grinding primary, there was naked bitterness between the two Democrats that only began to soften when Obama named her secretary of state. Nearly a decade later, the Obamas need Clinton as much as she needs them, to prevent their legacy from being eviscerated by a victorious Trump. After all, the president told supporters earlier in Ann Arbor, Michigan, all his accomplishments ""go out the window if we don't win tomorrow."" Clinton, too, was meditative about the bruising battles that have led her to this moment.  ""I regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became,"" Clinton said, without naming Trump. In a less-than-subtle display of political symbolism, she spoke from behind the presidential seal affixed to the podium from which Obama introduced her. The Obamas are keenly aware that whether or not Clinton wins Tuesday, their era is coming to an end, a reality punctuated by both Obamas' insistence that neither will ever run for office again. So in a parting gift to Clinton, Obama offered her his campaign mantra -- ""Fired up, ready to go"" -- and told rally-goers in New Hampshire how it had been coined by a supporter he'd never met who showed up at an obscure event eight years ago in South Carolina.  ""It just goes to show you how one voice can change a room,"" Obama said -- and then a city, a state and a nation. ""And if it can change a nation, it can change the world."" ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"  RICHMOND -- Hillary Clinton is airing ads again in Virginia. Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, will spend precious time campaigning in Northern Virginia and Richmond. Polls are tightening.  And so Republicans who long ago gave up any hope that Donald Trump could win here are starting to wonder: Is Virginia back in play? Although Virginia is considered a swing state, Clinton has for months enjoyed such a comfortable lead that both campaigns went off the airwaves here in the summer.  When Trump returned with a $2 million television ad buy two weeks ago, even fellow Republicans panned the move as a financially unjustifiable face-saver, one meant to beat back rumors that he was pulling out of the state entirely. Then this week, Clinton's campaign launched a six-figure ad buy in Virginia.     The latest Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll shows Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a dead heat nationally. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Privately, some operatives say that television time in Virginia is part of a national strategy and that Democrats are spending advertising dollars in Northern Virginia to force Republicans to match it, costing them resources in other parts of the country where Republicans could use a boost.  Still, Kaine, a popular former Virginia governor, announced Thursday that he plans election-eve rallies in his home state. And a Hampton University poll showed Trump up for the first time in Virginia.  The survey was an outlier, one that critics said gave too much weight to rural corners of the state where Trump is popular.  But others noted that a Hampton poll got the Virginia governor's race right in 2013, when Democrat Terry McAuliffe beat Republican Ken Cuccinelli II by fewer than 3 points. Hampton predicted McAuliffe would win by 1 point, while other polls had double-digit margins. Whatever the accuracy of the poll, it nudged Virginia from the ""leans Clinton"" category to ""toss-up"" in the widely cited RealClearPolitics average of polls. The buzz -- among Republicans and some neutral analysts -- was that recent WikiLeaks revelations and a reopened FBI investigation had weakened Clinton.  ""They put the flag up, claimed it as a victory, but you've got to play the whole game,"" said John Fredericks, a conservative radio host who is chairman of Trump's state campaign. ""They pulled out in the third quarter, and we played the whole game."" Voters interviewed Thursday said they were feeling anxious about Tuesday's outcome.  ""Two weeks ago, I would have told you it would nearly be a landslide,"" said Jill Pennington, a 53-year-old retired software engineer and Clinton supporter from Botetourt. ""I don't think it's going to be by a real comfortable margin because of all the hype being drummed up about the email all over again and the [FBI investigation] and all this stuff that's coming out in the 11th hour."" Catherine Smith, 44, an accounting assistant from Prince William County, said her confidence in a Clinton victory was shattered as polls showed a tightening race.  ""Within the past week or so, results of different polls that different companies have done,"" she said, left her silently seething until Wednesday when she put a ""Republican for Clinton"" sign on her car to amuse drivers in traffic - and maybe change some minds. Clinton does not need Virginia to win the White House, but Trump's path is much narrower without the state's 13 electoral votes. A Clinton loss here would be a tremendous setback for McAuliffe, a longtime personal friend and prolific fundraiser for the former secretary of state and her husband, former president Bill Clinton. McAuliffe has been determined to deliver the state for Clinton, staying in almost daily contact with the former president and Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager who also led McAuliffe's race for governor. He has said publicly for months that he expected the race to tighten. In private, he continues to express confidence in the outcome, according to two aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.  Clinton campaign officials said the TV ads and Kaine appearance show a determination to finish strong in Virginia, not a last-minute scramble to shore up a weak position. ""Hillary for Virginia and the Virginia Democratic Coordinated Campaign are working harder than ever to mobilize our support and prepare to turn out the vote for Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine and Democrats up and down the ticket on November 8,"" said Brian Zuzenak, director of Clinton's Virginia campaign. ""With so much at stake in this election, we know we cannot take anything for granted. We are proud of the organization we have built, and throughout this campaign, we have seen Hillary's message and vision resonate with voters across the Commonwealth."" Some Republicans who had privately thrown in the towel months ago were expressing newfound optimism Thursday.  ""There has been a dramatic tightening of the race across the country and the political map, including in Virginia,"" said a senior party official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal polling. ""It's looking extremely close, and I think what we're seeing is ghosts of 2014 in terms of the closeness of the race."" The official was referring to the 2014 reelection campaign of Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who narrowly defeated Republican Ed Gillespie. The result was much closer than most polls had predicted. Independent analysts were mixed on whether Virginia was back to battleground status. Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, read a lot into the ad buys and Kaine's visit.  ""The fact that the vice-presidential nominee is coming to his home state tells you everything you need to know,"" he said. ""Virginia is in play, and the Clinton campaign knows it, and they're worried."" The vice-presidential nominee is supposed to easily deliver his or her home turf - that's one of the benefits of picking a well-liked former governor from a swing state, he said. ""The fact he's coming to the state the day before the election makes it very clear that the Clinton campaign is taking nothing for granted here,"" Rozell said. ""They see Virginia as not in the bag at this point but truly competitive.""  But David Wasserman, an editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, was not convinced. ""If Virginia is now tied, Hillary Clinton would be in deep trouble,"" he said. ""But so far, there isn't convincing evidence it is. Although absentee voting has been underwhelming in heavily black localities, it's been impressive in Northern Virginia -- and, for what it's worth, in areas with pockets of Latino voters. Trump still has enormous problems with suburban, college-educated women, who are a huge voting force in places like Fairfax, Loudoun and Henrico counties."" "

(Photo by David Greedy/Getty Images)  Senior Republican lawmakers are openly discussing the prospect of impeaching Hillary Clinton should she win the presidency, a stark indication that partisan warfare over her tenure as secretary of state will not end on Election Day. Chairmen of two congressional committees said in media interviews this week they believe Clinton committed impeachable offenses in setting up and using a private email server for official State Department business. And a third senior Republican, the chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, told The Washington Post he is personally convinced Clinton should be impeached for influence peddling involving her family foundation. He favors further congressional investigation into that matter. ""It is my honest opinion that the Clinton Foundation represents potentially one of the greatest examples of political corruption in American history,"" said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), who leads the Constitution and Civil Justice subcommittee. ""Now that perspective may be disproven, time will tell. But given that conviction on my part, I think all options are definitely on the table."" The impeachment talk is the latest sign that Clinton will not be handed a clean slate -- let alone an extended honeymoon -- by Republican lawmakers should she win the presidency. It comes after months of accusations from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to his rival as ""Crooked Hillary"" before and after federal investigators announced they would not charge Clinton or her associates over the email matter.      When some in the crowd at a Donald Trump rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., started chanting ""Lock her up!"" about Hillary Clinton on Oct. 10, the Republican presidential nominee replied: ""Lock her up is right."" (The Washington Post)   Chants of ""Lock Her Up!"" coursed through crowds at the Republican National Convention and at dozens of Trump rallies. The FBI's disclosure last week that it is examining potential new evidence in the email probe has offered new fuel for the attacks.   [Trump's un-American campaign: Unleashing the worst]   ""Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency, and if she were elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis,"" Trump said Wednesday at a rally in Pensacola, Fla. ""You know it's going to happen. And in all fairness, we went through it with her husband. He was impeached. . . . Folks, do we want to go through this again?""    Republican lawmakers have aggressively questioned Clinton's State Department dealings for months, with a special committee impaneled to probe the handling of the 2012 Benghazi attacks and separate probes of the department's personnel practices and handling of classified documents found on her private email server. Top GOP leaders have previously indicated they will aggressively investigate Clinton if she is elected president. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said last month he considered a Clinton administration a ""target-rich environment"" and that ""we've got two years' worth of material already lined up"" for investigations.   [House Republicans are already prepping for 'years' of investigations]   Should they keep control of the House in the next Congress, Republicans could easily launch impeachment proceedings, with political will as the most significant obstacle. The House Judiciary Committee typically investigates charges of official wrongdoing and, if it finds them to be warranted, forwards articles of impeachment to the House floor. Articles approved by a majority of the House are then sent to the Senate for a trial, with a two-thirds majority required for conviction. Neither Chaffetz nor House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte (R-Va.) have called for Clinton's impeachment, but they have made clear they intend to continue probing her emails. In a joint letter sent Thursday, the two chairmen called on Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to preserve documents related to the email investigation, including the new evidence the FBI disclosed last week. Chaffetz and Goodlatte have also asked the federal investigators to probe whether Clinton committed perjury during 2015 testimony before the Benghazi panel. Democrats have warned voters in recent days of apparent GOP obstruction to come, citing the impeachment threats. ""It doesn't matter what evidence . . . they'll find something -- that's what they're saying already,"" President Obama said Wednesday during a campaign stop in Chapel Hill, N.C. ""How does our democracy function like that?"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that impeaching Clinton for alleged actions that took place before the election ""would be a brazen attempt to nullify the vote of the American people, outside our constitutional framework and destructive to the Framers' intent."" The Clinton campaign declined to comment. But the senior Republicans say they are convinced Clinton has broken the law and are speculating that she could be criminally charged after she is elected. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told Fox News Tuesday the probe into Clinton's emails ""will continue whether she wins or not."" ""Assuming she wins and the investigation goes forward and it looks like an indictment is pending, at that point in time under the Constitution, the House of Representatives would engage in an impeachment trial,"" he said, warning of a possible ""constitutional crisis."" In a separate Fox News interview Thursday, McCaul accused Clinton of committing ""treason"" in mishandling classified documents. FBI Director James B. Comey said in July there was no ""clear evidence"" that Clinton or associates willingly broke federal laws but ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.""   [FBI agents knew of emails in early October]   Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, told a Wisconsin newspaper Monday that Clinton could be impeached, citing federal laws against ""willful concealment and destruction."" ""I'm not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,"" he told the Beloit Daily News. ""I would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws."" Both McCaul and Johnson have political imperatives for taking a hard line on Clinton: Johnson is locked in a close race to keep his Senate seat and has moved recently to shore up his support among his Republican base. McCaul is said to be considering a possible Senate run against fellow Republican Ted Cruz in 2018. Former GOP congressman Tom Davis, who served on the House Oversight Committee during the first Clinton administration, warned lawmakers against overreach. ""The news reports don't look good, but we're a long way"" from impeachment, he said. ""There may absolutely be a place for this, I don't know, but when you jump the gun way ahead, you lose the credibility of your mission before you start. And that's my caution to both sides."" Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a current member of the Oversight panel, called the impeachment talk ""reprehensible, reckless and un-American"" and called it part of a two-decade GOP campaign to undermine Democratic presidents. But he said the failure of the 1998 Bill Clinton impeachment and President Obama's current popularity shows that perpetual opposition isn't necessarily good politics. ""We've got a base, too, and for every action in politics there is a reaction,"" Connolly said. ""If you want to fire up our base, keep on making statements like that."" Other prominent Republicans stopped short this week of suggesting that impeachment should be in the offing. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) called the talk ""premature"" during an interview on a Texas radio station Tuesday. ""She hasn't been elected or sworn into office,"" he said, according to a CNN report on the interview. ""And unless there is some additional evidence that the FBI director and the Justice Department would take to a grand jury, then she is not likely to be convicted of a crime."" Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), a former Judiciary Committee chairman who played a leading role in the 1998 Clinton impeachment, called talk of a Hillary Clinton impeachment ""speculative"" in a Wisconsin radio interview Tuesday. But he said there would be a ""constitutional crisis"" should she be indicted as president. ""We don't need to go through another Watergate,"" he said.  "
