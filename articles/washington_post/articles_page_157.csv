The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Tulsa on Friday, a day after Pawnee residents filed a separate lawsuit in state court against 27 companies they allege operate wastewater injection wells although they know the method causes earthquakes, the Tulsa World reported (http://bit.ly/2eQX5dj ). The federal lawsuit claims drilling permits and leases on tribal-owned lands held in trust have been improperly approved by the Interior Department, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.  ""In doing so, BIA and BLM also have run roughshod over Pawnee natural resource protection laws, disregarded a tribal moratorium on new oil and gas approvals, and violated the agencies' trust responsibilities to the Pawnee,"" the lawsuit alleges. A 5.8-magnitude earthquake on Sept. 3 was centered about nine miles northwest of Pawnee. The earthquake damaged structures in Pawnee, including many of the Pawnee Nation's administrative buildings, the lawsuit alleges. It also prompted the Oklahoma Corporation Commission to order 37 injection wells near the quake epicenter to temporarily shut down. The approval of the challenged oil and gas drilling permits has occurred despite an October 2015 tribal ban on new wells in Payne and Pawnee counties, the lawsuit states. The tribal resolution adopting the moratorium described hydraulic fracturing as a ""new, vastly different, and highly destructive land use posing threats of earthquakes, water pollution and impacts to Indian water rights,"" according to the lawsuit.  ""The subsurface pressures from that injected waste have caused a wave of disposal-induced earthquakes in northern Oklahoma,"" it says. The Pawnee Nation, headquartered in Pawnee, has about 3,200 members. ___ Information from: Tulsa World, http://www.tulsaworld.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Obama saluted the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers for rallying from behind to defeat the Golden State Warriors and end a Cleveland pro sports title drought stretching back to 1964. Obama honored the Cavs on the South Lawn of the White House, squeezing in another sports champion before he leaves office. He opened with: ""That's right. I said world champion and Cleveland in the same sentence."" The Cavs came back from a 3-1 deficit to win the championship against a Warriors team that set an NBA record for wins during the regular season.  ""The first team in history to dig themselves out of a hole like that,"" Obama said. ""The comeback was remarkable, and you learn about people when they're down."" That comment came shortly after Obama met with Donald Trump, who won the White House race to succeed him after a campaign in which the president declared the businessman unfit. Obama singled out several players for praise, but particularly focused on LeBron James, who won the Most Valuable Player award during the championship series. Obama called James one of the greatest players of all time and said it's not just power and speed that make James great, but his unselfishness and work ethic. ""You saw it in those last three games,"" the president said. Obama said the Cavs also exemplified a growing generation of athletes who are using their platforms to speak out. He noted, as examples, that Kevin Love has worked to combat sexual assault and James has worked to reduce gun violence. He said the team met earlier Thursday with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett to discuss steps the Cavs are taking to help build better relations between law enforcement and the Cleveland community.  ""It is part of a league-wide effort to build stronger communities all across the country, including holding open conversations so we can begin to bridge divides,"" Obama said.

(Chuck Kennedy/The White House)  Michelle Obama carried on an awkward White House tradition when she hosted Melania Trump for tea Thursday. It was their first meeting, coming on the heels of the ugliest campaign in recent history. They talked about raising children and took a tour of the White House's private residence before heading to the Oval Office to meet with the president and president-elect. The tour also included a visit to the Truman Balcony, which overlooks the South Lawn, and a tour of the State Floor of the executive mansion with the White House curator. Mrs. Obama's aides offered no further details of the meeting. Donald Trump and his wife arrived at the White House via a back door on the South Lawn, an area not visible to the public.  [Meet Melania Trump, a new model for first lady]    Still, the meeting of the current and future first ladies was a moment to consider both the fraught public relationship between the two and their differing styles.       Speaking from the Oval Office, Nov. 10, President Obama said he was ""very encouraged"" following a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Trump said the meeting lasted longer than expected and easily could have gone longer. (The Washington Post)   Michelle Obama played an unprecedented role in the failed campaign to elect Hillary Clinton, traveling the country to make the case that Donald Trump was a poor role model for the nation's children and unfit for the presidency.   [How Michelle Obama talks to voters in a way Hillary Clinton can't]  Melania Trump was less involved in her husband's campaign. She rarely gave public speeches, saying she preferred to stay home in Manhattan and care for her young son, Barron.  Mrs. Trump's most prominent moment of the campaign came during the Republican National Convention when she gave her first speech before a large national audience. It was well received -- until a journalist discovered that several phrases had been plagiarized from a 2008 Michelle Obama speech. Trump's campaign later explained that Melania was an admirer of Michelle's.  Obama addressed the plagiarism matter only briefly, when talk-show host Stephen Colbert asked her about it during a September appearance on his show. ""That's tough,"" she said.  [What's on Michelle Obama's mind? Meet the speechwriter who puts it into words.]  Aside from being mothers whose children were young when their husbands won the presidency, Obama and Trump have little in common. Trump, who is from Slovenia, is only the second first lady to be born outside the country.  Though Melania Trump has evidently read up a little on the current first lady, Michelle Obama has said she never expected to become first lady and purposely did not read the memoirs of other East Wing inhabitants before she took on the role.  There is likely to be another visit by Melania Trump to the White House prior to moving her family in. During the transition period, the spouse of the president-elect usually meets with White House staff to discuss a range of issues, from interior decor to nitty-gritty household details such as which kinds of soaps and deodorants their families prefer, said Kate Andersen Brower, author of two books about the White House, ""The Residence"" and ""First Women.""  [When first ladies meet: an awkward post-election White House tradition]  Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Trump are far from the first political spouses to be tossed together following a difficult campaign. Betty Ford had no interest in meeting with Rosalynn Carter and had to be prodded to greet her. Mamie Eisenhower never offered a seat to Jackie Kennedy, who toured the house just days after giving birth. ""They don't have to like each other personally, and given what has gone on, I would be surprised if Michelle Obama was chatty with Melania,"" Brower said.

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/c2324222-a618-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	The Latest: Clinton wins presidential contest in Delaware	" DOVER, Del. -- The Latest on Election Day 2016 in Delaware (all times local): 9 p.m. Former Delaware Labor Secretary Lisa Blunt Rochester has won Delaware's U.S. House race, becoming the first African-American and first woman elected to represent the state in Congress. Riding voter registration numbers that heavily favor Democrats, Rochester defeated Republican Hans Reigle in Tuesday's election. Rochester, a political newcomer, loaned her campaign more than $400,000 and spent almost $1 million in topping a crowded field of Democratic primary candidates before defeating Reigle, a retired military pilot and former mayor of the Kent County town of Wyoming. Rochester, who has said her focus in Congress would be jobs, the economy and equal pay for equal work, will succeed fellow Democrat John Carney, who vacated Delaware's lone seat in the House to run for governor. ___ 8:10 p.m. Democratic Congressman John Carney has won the Delaware governor's race, eight years after losing his first bid to become the state's chief executive. Taking advantage of voter registration numbers that heavily favor Democrats, Carney defeated Republican state Sen. Colin Bonini of Dover in Tuesday's gubernatorial contest. Carney has said job creation and economic development will be among his top priorities, along with improving Delaware's public education system. At the same time, he has acknowledged that the next governor faces significant challenges, given troubling revenue expectations and escalating costs for Medicaid and state employee health care. Carney will succeed Jack Markell, who defeated Carney in the 2008 Democratic gubernatorial primary. Carney, who served as lieutenant governor under Markell's predecessor, Ruth Ann Minner, was then elected to Congress in 2010. ___ 8 p.m. Hillary Clinton has defeated Donald Trump in Delaware's presidential vote. Clinton enjoyed a victory Tuesday in a traditionally blue state where Democrats have controlled the executive and legislative branches for years and have built a strong advantage in voter registration numbers. By winning Delaware, Clinton added three electoral votes to her nationwide total. Clinton and Trump each made brief visits to Delaware during their respective primary campaigns. Clinton was joined by Gov. Jack Markell and all three members of Delaware's congressional delegation at an April rally in Wilmington. Trump drew thousands of supporters to a rally at the state fairgrounds in Harrington that same month. ___ 4:45 p.m. Delaware state troopers were called to a voting location in Elsmere in response to a complaint of disorderly conduct involving a couple of supporters of Donald Trump, but no arrests were made. State police spokesman Cpl. Jeffrey Hale says troopers spoke to the men, advised them that they shouldn't talk to voters as they were coming in to Baltz Elementary School to vote, and that they needed to stay at least 50 feet away from the polling location, as required by state law. State elections commissioner Elaine Manlove said a woman called her about the ""scary white men."" Manlove says she didn't know about the nature of the complaint, but that the men did not appear to be doing anything wrong. Manlove said her office did not notify police. ___ 3:30 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden has voted at a Wilmington high school, also hugging poll workers, posing for photos and chatting with neighbors. After casting his ballot shortly after 7:30 a.m. Tuesday at Alexis I. du Pont High School, Biden declared, ""it's a beautiful day to vote."" Working the crowd, Biden said, ""What's your name?"" ''How are you?"" and ""I haven't seen you in Mass lately."" He thanked voters for performing their civic duty and saluted volunteers for helping the process run smoothly. Biden also joked that, ""The bad news is, I'm not going away."" He says he'll continue to fight against income inequality after he leaves office. Biden also visited a Newark coffee shop Tuesday and talked with a large crowd of University of Delaware students that gathered. ___ 2:30 p.m. Delaware's elections commissioner says early turnout appears to be high as voters cast their ballots for president and a host of statewide and local offices. Elections Commissioner Elaine Manlove says roughly 160,000 people had cast ballots at voting precincts across the state as of about noon Tuesday. That's in addition to about 24,000 Delawareans who voted by absentee ballot. Those combined totals represent more than a fourth of the state's roughly 675,600 registered voters. Manlove says there have been no reports of voting machine problems. Weather proved to be no deterrent to voters, with sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-60s. ___ 4:10 a.m. Regardless of the winners, Tuesday's election promises to significantly alter Delaware's political landscape. Voters will elect a new congressional representative, a new governor, and new leaders of the state's two largest local governments. Balloting in House and Senate races also will define the balance of power in the General Assembly, where Republicans are hoping to end years of Democratic rule and regain control of the Senate. The top of the ticket features a congressional race between Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester and Republican Hans Reigle, and a gubernatorial contest pitting Democratic congressman John Carney Jr. against Republican state Sen. Colin Bonini. Voters also will choose a new lieutenant governor and state insurance commissioner, a new Wilmington mayor, and new chief executive of New Castle County.

The city has over 478,000 registered voters, so turnout was around 60 percent, about what it was in 2012. Unofficial election results posted on the District of Columbia Board of Elections website show that 287,403 voters cast ballots. Hillary Clinton won the District's three electoral votes with just over 90 percent of the vote, about what President Barack Obama received in 2012. Donald Trump received 11,553 votes or about 4 percent of the total. 1 a.m. Voters in the nation's capital have decided to support becoming the 51st state, though that doesn't mean another star will be added to the nation's flag any time soon. The statehood referendum added some interest to a sleepy general election Tuesday in the nation's capital, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 12-to-1, and Hillary Clinton easily won the District's three electoral votes. On the statehood question, voters endorsed a draft constitution that would have residents electing a governor, not a mayor, and a 21-seat state legislature instead of a city council. The constitution includes new borders for the proposed state, with the White House, the Capitol and the National Mall carved out as a separate federal enclave. The city's mayor, Muriel Bowser, was scheduled to speak on statehood Wednesday morning. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

As polls closed in many eastern states, Clinton and her Republican opponent Donald Trump each claimed a handful of states and their electoral votes. But the critical states that will determine the outcome of the election, including Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, remained way too close to call. Earlier in the day, Clinton voted at an elementary school near her suburban New York home with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. By Tuesday evening there was little left for her to do but watch, wait, and play with her grandchildren. The Clintons also stepped away at one point to work on her remarks later in the night. Clinton's campaign picked a symbolic location for her election night party -- the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, which, in a nod to the historic moment, offers a glass ceiling. A number of New York politicians and top campaign surrogates were expected to speak, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, singer Katy Perry and Khizr Khan, the father of a slain Muslim-American solider whose indictment of Trump at the Democratic National Convention was an emotional high point for Clinton's campaign. Her subdued Election Day was a stark contrast from Clinton's hectic final days on the campaign trail. The former secretary of state and New York senator dashed through battleground states, encouraged get-out-the-vote efforts and campaigned with a star-studded cast of celebrities. The eve of the election included appearances with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, Jon Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga. After the divisive rhetoric of the campaign against Trump, Clinton sought to offer a positive closing message on Monday. She told supporters in Pittsburgh they ""can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, bighearted America."" In a buoyant mood, she also greeted voters who cried out ""we love you,"" smiling back: ""I love you all, too ... absolutely."" Some good news boosted Clinton's spirits in the final moments of the campaign. On Sunday, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress, informing lawmakers the bureau had found no evidence in its hurried review of newly discovered emails to warrant criminal charges against Clinton. The late October announcement of a fresh email review rocked the race just as Clinton appeared to be pulling away from Trump in several battleground states. The update from the FBI may have come too late for some: In the nine days between Comey's initial statement until his ""all clear"" announcement on Sunday, nearly 24 million people cast early ballots. That's about 18 percent of the expected total votes for president. But campaign aides projected confidence. They said they felt good about Nevada, where they said support for Clinton in early voting was strong. They were encouraged by the strong Latino turnout in Florida and felt they took a strong lead in Michigan and Pennsylvania into Election Day, when the bulk of votes are cast in those states. ___ Follow Lisa Lerer and Catherine Lucey on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer and http://twitter.com/catherine_lucey Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(All times EST): 6:50 p.m. Bernie Sanders says he's prepared to work with Donald Trump to help the working class, but will ""vigorously oppose"" other policies promised by the president-elect. The independent Vermont senator has released a statement noting Trump ""tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media."" He says that if Trump ""is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him."" But Sanders adds that if Trump ""pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him."" Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, and supported her candidacy after she won that race. ___ 6:40 p.m. The White House says Melania Trump will meet with first lady Michelle Obama on Thursday morning. President Barack Obama has invited Donald Trump to the White House as the two leaders prepare for the transition of power following a bruising, often nasty presidential election. Obama's meeting with the president-elect will take place in the Oval Office, while the first lady and Mrs. Trump will meet in the residence of the White House. Obama says former President George W. Bush could not have been more gracious after his 2008 election victory and he has instructed his team to follow that example in preparing the way for Trump. ___ 6:30 p.m. Kansas' secretary of state says he's serving on President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. Kris Kobach, a conservative Republican, told various Kansas media outlets Wednesday he has no expectation of a role in Trump's eventual administration. But he says he's open to working for Trump, if offered. Kobach will help advise Trump on policy matters leading up to his January inauguration. He advised Trump on immigration policy during the campaign, adding to the Republican Party's platform Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Kobach also served as counsel to Attorney General John Ashcroft during the President George W. Bush's administration. ___ 5:31 p.m. Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan has captured a New Hampshire Senate seat, defeating first-term Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. The Associated Press called the race for Hassan on Wednesday. Ayotte says in a statement that she has contacted Hassan to concede the close race and offer her congratulations. She is thanking the people of New Hampshire for their support. Democrats have picked up two Republican-held Senate seats -- one in Illinois, the other in New Hampshire. They had been far more optimistic about capturing GOP seats on Election Day, but lost in Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri and North Carolina. Republicans are expected to hold the Senate seat in Louisiana in next month's contest after a Republican and Democrat advanced to the runoff. ___ 5:25 p.m. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he has no interest in at least one agenda item preferred by President-elect Donald Trump: term limits for members of Congress. Trump praised the idea during the campaign, but McConnell said Wednesday the issue is going nowhere in the Senate. The Kentucky Republican tells reporters: ""I would say we have term limits now. They're called elections. And it will not be on the agenda in the Senate."" McConnell also says he hopes Vice President-elect Mike Pence follows former Vice President Dick Cheney in attending the Senate GOP's weekly luncheons. McConnell says Cheney, a former congressman, served almost as Senate liaison for President George W. Bush. He says he hopes Pence, a former Indiana congressman, will do the same for Trump. ___ 5:09 p.m. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire has conceded and congratulated her Democratic rival Gov. Maggie Hassan. In a statement late Wednesday, Ayotte said the voters have spoken and ""now it's time for all of us to come together to get things done"" for the people of New Hampshire. Ayotte, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and leader on defense issues, said it was a tremendous privilege to serve one term. She thanked her family and supporters. The Associated Press had not called the race because Hassan had a lead of just 0.1 percent. ___ 5:05 p.m. Organizers of a comedy benefit featuring performances by John Oliver, George Lopez and others have canceled Wednesday's red carpet arrivals. A spokeswoman for the Natural Resources Defense Council's ""Night of Comedy"" benefit in New York said Wednesday afternoon that ""in light of current events, we will no longer be having the red carpet."" Seth Meyers is hosting the comedy benefit, where Mike Birbiglia and Hasan Minhaj are also performing. The event was originally billed as ""the place to be the night after the presidential election."" ___ 4:38 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has spoken to President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his upset victory over Hillary Clinton Tuesday night. A spokesman says the California Democrat told Trump that she hoped to ""find common ground where possible,"" including an infrastructure bill that could create jobs. Each of the top four leaders in Congress -- the top Democrat and Republicans in both House and Senate -- has spoken with Trump since the election. ___ 4:20 p.m. The FAA has imposed temporary flight restrictions over Donald Trump's high-rise home as a safety measure in response to his presidential victory. A notice dated Wednesday bars aircraft from flying below 2,999 feet in midtown Manhattan, where Trump Tower is located, and in parts of Brooklyn and Queens. It says military aircraft supporting the Secret Service are exempt, along with police and emergency aircraft. The FAA generally issues temporary restrictions when there's a special event or hazardous condition. The notice says the New York City air space restrictions are needed because of ""VIP movement."" They expire Jan. 21. ___ 3:25 p.m. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is proposing that she and President-elect Donald Trump ""put aside our differences"" and work together to rebuild the American economy for working people. A favorite of liberals, Warren has waged a bitter war of words with Trump. She's called him a ""pathetic coward"" and worse on Twitter. He's nicknamed her ""Pocahontas"" -- a reference to claims she made about being part Native American. As recently as Monday, Trump called Warren a ""terrible person,"" ''a terrible human being"" and a ""terrible senator."" In a statement Wednesday, Warren said the integrity of U.S. democracy is more important than an individual election. She said she hopes Trump will fulfill the role of president ""with respect and concern for every single person in this country, no matter who they are."" ___ 3:15 p.m. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says President Barack Obama has congratulated the Senate's top Republican about his party's success in maintaining its majority in the Senate. Earnest said Obama and Mitch McConnell discussed priorities that should be taken up as lawmakers meet before a new Congress takes office. They spoke Wednesday, the day after the election. While he did not have details about the issues discussed, Earnest said Obama will continue to encourage Republican leaders to take up a massive trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said the president believes the trade pact will benefit the U.S. economy. President-elect Donald Trump strongly opposes the deal. Earnest says the president also hopes to talk with House Speaker Paul Ryan. ___ 3:05 p.m. The White House says the President's Daily Brief and other intelligence materials are now being made available to President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and other members of Trump's transition team. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it's a courtesy that former President George W. Bush extended to President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and a few aides as they were preparing to take office. The President's Daily Brief is a classified document delivered to the president each morning. Until his victory Tuesday, Trump had received some classified briefings but not as extensive as what he'll now be receiving. Earnest says it's part of Obama's efforts to ensure a smooth transition. ___ 3 p.m. The Senate's top Republican isn't interested in rehashing contentious comments President-elect Donald Trump made about Hispanics during the campaign. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky wouldn't say whether he thought Trump's remarks have caused lasting damage to the Republican Party with an important demographic group. Trump has called some Mexicans rapists and criminals and had claimed that a judge might be biased against him because of the judge's Mexican heritage. Several months ago, McConnell publicly worried that Trump could push Hispanics from the party as Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater had done with blacks in the 1964 election. McConnell said: ""We should look forward and not backward and rehash and re-litigate the various debates we had both internally and with the Democrats over the past year."" ___ 2:45 p.m. White House spokesman Josh Earnest is disputing the notion that Thursday's meeting between President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump will have an air of insincerity about it given the harsh things they've said about each other. Earnest said ""I'm not saying it's going to be an easy meeting."" But he said the president is sincere about fulfilling a basic responsibility he has to ensure a smooth transition of power. Earnest said the success of America's democracy depends on all citizens setting aside their partisan affiliations and political preferences, and rooting for the success of the American president. During the campaign, Obama had called Trump unfit and unqualified. ___ 2:25 p.m. Donald Trump is spending the day after winning the presidency holed up in Trump Tower, where sleep-deprived aides appear jubilant as they come and go. The usually buzzing lobby of Trump's residence and campaign headquarters is currently closed to the general public, though an impersonator of the famous ""Naked Cowboy"" --wearing a robe -- was at one point spotted strolling through. The scene outside is chaotic, with protesters and a mass of press gathered in penned-off area. Curious onlookers are clogging foot traffic as they pause to take in the scene. The east side of Manhattan's busy Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th is also closed to the public with dump trucks filled with dirt forming a protective barrier outside the building's lobby. ___ 1:58 p.m. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says President Barack Obama's top priority following Tuesday's election is not his legacy. Earnest says the president is focused on the 20 million people who gained health insurance after the Affordable Care Act went into effect. Earnest is taking questions from reporters about how the election results will affect Obama's legacy on issues such as health care and climate change. Earnest says the president is also concerned about the prospect of protections being stripped from millions of Americans who benefit because health insurers are not allowed to discriminate based on pre-existing health conditions or impose a lifetime cap on expenses. Earnest says the tearing away those protections would negatively affect a lot of people, and ""that's something Republicans will have to consider moving forward.""

This is a presidential election, more than any I can remember, that has invited Americans to view their country in a certain way -- actually, in one of two very different ways.  Donald Trump's vision is unremittingly dark -- in his words, a ""crippled America."" A nation of closed factories and crumbling bridges, flooded by illegal immigrants who are taking jobs and committing crimes, threatened by cop-killers and jihadists, exploited by foreign competitors and humiliated by the stupidity of its governing class. Trump devotes almost no attention to describing his ideal America, but his Eden is somewhere in the past, requiring recovered greatness. His stated goal is the restoration of a lost country, which he defines as a certain land and people and way of life. Liberal ideology may have contributed to the mess, but the main problem is failed leadership. ""If we don't get tough,"" argues Trump, ""and if we don't get smart, and fast, we're not going to have our country anymore. There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left."" And because the ruling class will not surrender power willingly, it must be taken by an uprising of the forgotten. Hillary Clinton is also not in the vision business, but she seems to assume a conventionally liberal conception of the country -- America the evolving. A nation with a flawed past moving toward liberal ideals of tolerance, openness and opportunity, helped along by an activist government that secures individual rights against various forms of social oppression and works for greater economic equality.  Clinton's Eden is clearly in the future. Her stated goal is to ""break down the barriers that hold Americans back, including the barriers of bigotry and discrimination."" America becomes more itself as it moves toward progressive values. Clinton cannot promise revolution, being constrained by effectively being the incumbent. But Clinton, as a sober, levelheaded Midwesterner, would not be comfortable in a revolutionary role anyway. Besides, a more liberal future is made inevitable by politically advantageous demographic change.  America the ""crippled."" America the evolving. These are two parallel, non-intersecting convictions about our country. You might think the adherents of these views would have something to learn from each other. But there has been no real dialogue -- or even real argument -- between them. We have seen a national election conducted mainly in Twitter-size ad hominems.  Though the trend is far from complete and differs among minority voters, Trump has accelerated America's movement toward political division by class and education. Many blue-collar voters, particularly white men, have been drawn strongly to his message. Many white-collar voters, particularly college-educated women, have been turned off by it. What used to be a culture war is increasingly a class conflict -- though the two generously overlap. This type of clash is bitter in its own, special way -- bringing out deep resentments toward elites and sneering condescension by elites. Gun control is a good example. Many defenders of gun rights are not merely interpreting the Second Amendment; they are defending a way of life that they believe to be under siege. Many city and suburb dwellers have almost no contact with the world of rural America, and limited sympathy for it. Gun-control advocates quote statistics while many gun owners feel they are protecting a heritage. We can see the political result. Who among our political leaders is calling for mutual understanding and practicing it? This would involve the concession of truth on both sides. It is true that the United States has two economies -- one for those who have the skills favored by globalization and one for those who don't. At the bottom of the Great Recession in 2010, the unemployment rate for people without a high school degree was 15 percent. For college graduates, it was 4.7 percent. A portion of America is in a more or less permanent recession, no matter what the stock market does. It is true many of the beneficiaries of globalization have little contact with those who bear its costs. It is true that many blue-collar and rural men and women have witnessed their way of life decline, have seen the sources of their deepest beliefs dismissed by the broader culture and increasingly feel (in Arlie Russell Hochschild's phrase) like ""strangers in their own land.""  But it is also true that for some Americans, the idealization of a lost America has little appeal. If you are an African American, or a gay person, or someone in a racially mixed marriage, or a woman seeking a leadership role in society, your life has improved greatly over the past few decades. For many Americans, the full promise of liberty has arrived lately. It is true that an ethnic definition of the American community is dangerous and unsustainable. Is the American ""us"" determined by skin pigment and Anglo-Saxon cultural heritage, as George Wallace would have described it? That view is doomed by demography and condemned by morality. Can the American ""us"" be joined by the affirmation of American ideals? Then it is hardly helpful to argue (wrongly) that migrants are somehow prone to crime and rape. It is true that discrimination against a religion -- any religion -- is inconsistent with American ideals and counterproductive as counterterrorism. As a thought exercise, imagine an American president responding to an attack on the scale of Sept. 11, 2001, with words of condemnation for Islam, casting suspicion on Muslim neighbors. There could be widespread and terrible violence.  The bitterness of the current campaign has guaranteed one certain outcome. The next American president will be someone whom a large portion of the country finds sympathetic and a large portion of the country finds utterly alien, even illegitimate.  Urging national unity is incumbent on any president. But our political culture is sicker and more damaged than usual. The worlds we live in are further apart. A message of national healing -- presenting the vision of a single nation -- has seldom been more urgent. This will require a skill the candidates have not displayed in the current campaign -- a capacity for empathy. As president, he or she must somehow be able to imagine and address the fears and resentments they have fed in the worst moments of their own campaigns. The ideals of America are a bridge wider than its current division. But they will need to be imaginatively and persistently applied by a leader showing a sudden and unexpected aptitude. A heavy bet on an unlikely outcome. Where to look for inspiration? In 1944, speaking to a group of newly minted citizens in New York's Central Park, Judge Learned Hand explained his vision of America's most basic commitment. ""What then is the spirit of liberty?"" he asked. ""I cannot define it. I can only tell you my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit that is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit that weighs their interests alongside its own without bias . . . the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten, that there may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.""  Hardly the spirit of our times, but seldom more needed.   Read more from Michael Gerson's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .

(Esteban Felix/AP)  This post has been updated. MEXICO CITY -- President Daniel Ortega cruised to victory and a third consecutive term in Nicaragua, capturing more than 72 percent of the vote in an election that opponents had condemned as undemocratic, according to figures announced Monday. The win puts Ortega, the 70-year-old former Marxist guerrilla, in line for his fourth presidential term -- a total of a quarter century leading Nicaragua -- since he helped the Sandinistas in 1979 overthrow the Somoza family that had ruled for the previous four decades. His wife, Rosario Murillo, will be vice president. After voting, Ortega described the electoral process as ""totally unprecedented."" For many Nicaragua observers, the story was about the process -- one that has looked increasingly undemocratic and authoritarian as Ortega has consolidated power over his many years in office. Over the summer, the Supreme Court blocked a leading opposition candidate from participating in the election, while the Supreme Electoral Council, another body seen as loyal to Ortega, forced 16 opposition lawmakers out of their seats. Changes to the constitution in 2014 eliminated term limits, allowing Ortega to rule indefinitely. ""This election is not free, it is not transparent, nor is it competitive,"" said Carlos F. Chamorro, the publisher of the independent magazine Confidencial before the vote. ""This is not a true election."" Ortega remains a popular figure. The results announced Monday showed that Ortega had captured 1.8 million votes, with the next closest candidate, Maximino Rodriguez, winning 373,000., with more than 99 percent of the votes counted. The Supreme Electoral Council said that 68.2 percent of voters turned out, while the opposition disputed that figure, claiming that more than 70 percent of Nicaraguans chose not to vote. During Ortega's tenure, poverty levels have fallen, and the gang violence so rampant in other Central American countries has been far more contained. Ortega has developed a pro-business reputation, and the economy has grown by an average of more than 5 percent over the past five years, surpassing many others in Latin America. But the achievements have been matched by growing concern over authoritarian tendencies. Most of the media in Nicaragua is controlled by the government. Ortega's family members hold key positions of power. For a man who came to prominence opposing an oligarchic dynasty, many see a bitter irony in his evolution. ""I think populist presidents are frequently tempted to do this"" consolidation of power, said Geoff Thale, program director at the Washington Office on Latin America, a non-governmental organization that focuses on human rights issues in Latin America. ""He's reverted to this form, and it is very troubling."" Last month, several opposition figures wrote to Luis Almagro, secretary general of the Organization of American States, arguing that Ortega's government has ""demolished one by one the pillars of representative democracy,"" by removing elected officials, banning political groups, and other actions. ""The immense majority of Nicaraguans, including the most fervent partisans of this regime, know clearly that on November 6, there will not be elections in Nicaragua but an electoral farce in which the results . . . are already determined,"" they wrote.
