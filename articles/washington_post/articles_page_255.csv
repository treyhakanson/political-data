When a disputed summary of the report was published, Russia and Qatar easily kept the hosting rights they won in December 2010. Still, exactly two years ago Friday, FIFA handed American lawyer Michael Garcia's investigation report to Switzerland's attorney general as a criminal complaint against suspected money laundering linked to the bid campaigns. That lengthy case is ongoing and confidential. Until it is completed, the main legacy of Garcia's report is a series of ethics committee sanctions for FIFA officials -- none from Russia or Qatar. Here's a look at those sanctions: ___ LIFE BAN So elusive for many years, former FIFA vice president Jack Warner was expelled from world soccer by Garcia's work in September 2015. Warner ""committed many and various acts of misconduct,"" the summary of Garcia's report noted, adding that the Trinidad and Tobago lawmaker ""was a key player in schemes involving the offer, acceptance, and receipt of undisclosed and illegal payments."" In July 2011, Warner took a $1.212 million payment from former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam, the report said. Both were then under investigation for allegedly bribing Caribbean voters. The money, Garcia said, was linked to Warner's ""decision to resign from FIFA and refuse to cooperate in the proceedings against Mr. Bin Hammam."" ___ 8 YEARS Reynald Temarii, the FIFA vice president for Oceania in 2010, was banned twice by FIFA's ethics committee -- before and after the 2018-2022 votes. The former Tahiti player got a 1-year ban for talking to undercover reporters from The Sunday Times, which alleged widespread wrongdoing. Temarii appealed, with Bin Hammam's encouragement and financial help, and so left Oceania with no vote. According to the Garcia Report summary, Temarii intended to vote for England and Australia. However, ""the difference it would have made if Mr. Temarii would have participated in the vote would not have been significant."" In May 2015, Temarii was banned for eight years for taking 305,640 euros (now $327,000) from Bin Hammam in January 2011 to pay his legal fees. ___ 5 YEARS Asia's longtime FIFA vice president until 2011, Chung Mong-joon's surprise presidential bid in 2015 to succeed Sepp Blatter was derailed. Chung was banned for six years on charges related to ""duty of disclosure"" and ""obligation to collaborate"" with investigators. It was cut to five years on appeal, and he was fined 50,000 Swiss francs ($49,850). The ethics committee opened its case ""based on findings in the (Garcia) report"" against Chung, a member of the South Korean family which owns World Cup sponsor Hyundai. Before the December 2010 vote, Chung wrote to FIFA colleagues proposing a Korean-backed ""Global Football Fund"" of almost $800 million. Those letters created ""at least the appearance of a conflict (of interest),"" the Garcia summary noted. ___ 3 YEARS Perhaps the strangest Garcia Report case related to 2010, with then Chile soccer president Harold Mayne-Nicholls leading a FIFA team inspecting each World Cup bid. He was most critical of Russia and Qatar, and mostly ignored by FIFA voters. Days after visiting Qatar, Mayne-Nicholls asked about unpaid work for three relatives at the Aspire youth academy in Doha. In 2014, when weighing a FIFA presidency run against Blatter, Mayne-Nicholls learned he was being investigated for conflicts of interest and unethically seeking gifts. Ethics judges later said he ""ignored his responsibility ... to act with utmost neutrality and integrity."" Mayne-Nicholls was banned for seven years, reduced to three on appeal by FIFA, and fined 20,000 Swiss francs ($19,900). ___ WARNINGS Franz Beckenbauer and Angel Maria Villar, both former international players and 2018-2022 voters, were found to have disrespected Garcia's investigation. Beckenbauer was provisionally banned for two weeks during the 2014 World Cup for snubbing requests for witness statements. He then complied. About 18 months later, Beckenbauer was formally warned and fined 7,000 Swiss francs ($6,975). He is now under investigation by Swiss federal prosecutors and FIFA's ethics committee over irregular payments linked to Germany hosting the 2006 World Cup. Villar verbally insulted Garcia in Spanish, and was warned and fined 25,000 Swiss francs ($24,900) last November. ___ CLEARED The first Garcia Report case announced was to clear FIFA veteran Michel D'Hooghe of all suspicion. Four allegations against the Belgian doctor were considered, including accepting a painting from a long-time former executive committee colleague from Russia. ___ ACTIVE CASES Chung and Mayne-Nicholls can still appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, FIFA told the AP, even several months after being notified of their FIFA appeal verdicts. A case announced this month could also use Garcia evidence. Former Bin Hammam aide Najeeb Chirakal faces a life ban in a case ""focused mainly on his involvement in payments to several football officials."" Those could include Bin Hammam's cash gifts to Warner and Temarii. Other FIFA ethics cases against individuals could also be ongoing but remain confidential. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The Cavaliers star is donating $2.5 million to support an exhibit honoring Muhammad Ali exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.  ""Muhammad Ali: A Force for Change"" opened in September to honor the legacy of the boxing champ, social activist and world ambassador whose contributions transcended the sports world.  ""Every professional athlete, regardless of race and gender, owes a huge debt of gratitude to Muhammad Ali,"" James said. ""His legacy deserves to be studied and revered by every generation. I am honored to partner with the Smithsonian to celebrate one of the most influential figures in our nation's history who, along with Jackie Robinson and Jesse Owens, used the power of sports to advance our civil rights."" James' business partner, Maverick Carter, also is contributing to the donation.  ""I am overwhelmed by the incredible generosity LeBron James has shown,"" Ali's wife, Lonnie, said. ""This exhibit will enable children visiting the Smithsonian to learn more about Muhammad's work outside of the ring, particularly his humanitarian work and stance on social justice for all people."" The exhibit includes artifacts such as Ali's headgear and the training robe worn at Dundee's Fifth Street Gym. It celebrates the late champion's achievements in community activism, resistance, politics, spirituality and culture. Ali died in June at age 74. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Putin's telephone conversation with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump this week revealed a ""shared desire to join efforts in the fight against terrorism"" that creates a ""good basis for future work on the Syrian problem."" During the conversation, Trump supported Putin's call for normalizing U.S.-Russia ties, Ushakov told Russian news agencies. The two men agreed that bilateral relations ""can't be worse,"" according to Ushakov, adding that Trump ""expressed his readiness not only to normalize ties, but also develop them intensively in all areas."" Trump's office said in a statement following Monday's call that ""President-elect Trump noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia."" Ushakov, meanwhile, alleged that the Obama administration of ""doing everything it can to drive bilateral ties into such a deadlock that (it) would make it difficult for a new team to get them out from, if it wishes to do so."" Obama was in Berlin on Thursday for his final foreign trip as president. The White House declined to comment on Ushakov's accusation. At the same time, Ushakov said that ""it can't be excluded"" that Putin and Obama would have a conversation at the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Peru this weekend. The timing for a meeting between Trump and Putin hasn't been discussed yet, but their representatives plan to confer on scheduling, Ushakov said. ___ Associated Press Writer Josh Lederman contributed to this story from Berlin.

Britain evicted about 2,000 people from the tropical Chagos archipelago, a British colony, in the 1960s and 1970s so the U.S. military could build an air base on Diego Garcia, the largest of the islands. The islanders were sent to the Seychelles and Mauritius, two island nations off Africa's east coast, and many eventually resettled in the U.K. The Chagossians have fought in British courts for years to return to the islands. In June, the Supreme Court rejected their most recent appeal. The British government announced Wednesday that it will continue to lease Diego Garcia to the U.S. until 2036. It said it has decided against letting the islanders return ""on the grounds of feasibility, defense and security interests, and cost to the British taxpayer."" Foreign Office Minister Joyce Anelay said it would be impractical to set up ""a small remote community on low-lying islands."" The government promised 40 million pounds ($50 million) in compensation to the displaced islanders. Foreign Minister Alan Duncan told lawmakers in the House of Commons on Thursday that Britain had apologized for the original expulsion, but that the decision to bar the islanders' return was final. Scottish National Party lawmaker Peter Grant branded it ""a return to the days of the arrogant colonial Britain that should have been consigned to the dust bin of history 100 years ago."" Conservative lawmaker Andrew Rosindell said the decision had caused ""shock, anger and dismay"" among islanders.  ""These are British subjects, and they are entitled to the same rights and freedoms and self-determination that all British citizens should have,"" Rosindell said. The eviction of the islanders from their home halfway between Africa and Southeast Asia has long been controversial for Britain. U.K. authorities have expressed regret for the treatment of the islanders, but successive governments have blocked their attempts to return. The key obstacle is the strategically important Diego Garcia base, which has supported U.S. military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the U.S. acknowledged it also had been used for clandestine rendition flights of terrorist suspects. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

His book ""Ronald Reagan: New Deal Republican"" is scheduled for publication next year.     Donald Trump has won what might be the greatest ""change election"" in decades. Republicans leaders are only now waking up to the fact that the change Trump's voters want will end up changing the GOP, too. Trump's voters were not voting for less government. Instead, they believe the promise of American life has been taken from them by elites of both parties who neither know nor care what they are doing to their fellow citizens. Trump stepped into this massive credibility gap with the message that he was different. In his talks, tweets and rallies, he identified the problems these people were facing: stagnating wages, shrinking numbers of good jobs, a political and media culture that treated them as though they were aliens in their own country. For years, they had been longing for someone of Trump's stature to say to them: ""I hear you, and I will make things right."" These voters backed Trump because they want their heritage back. This is not, as has been charged, a racially tinged impulse. Millions of Trump's supporters voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Rather, it is the heritage that all Americans are of equal worth, that common values and common activities are worthy of respect and reward and confer dignity. Trump said he would ""make America great again,"" but he could have run on a different, more intellectual slogan: ""Make American citizenship count again."" This citizenship agenda is less interested in shrinking government than in making it work for average Americans. Trump's signature issues -- immigration, trade, law and order, fighting terrorism -- all involve the federal government doing more and doing it better. This push for federal action will pose serious challenges to the reigning GOP orthodoxy. However, if the first 100 days of a Trump presidency involve nothing more than tax cuts, deregulation and other traditional Republican ideas, the voters who wanted something different will wonder whether they were simply marks in a skillful con. Many of Trump voters' priorities can be addressed in ways consistent with Republican inclinations. Immigration can be reduced but not eliminated; trade deals can proceed if they ensure that benefits flow to average Americans, not just those in finance or exporting industries. Tax reform, which means raising taxes on millions of honest Americans, can make way for tax cuts, and those cuts can be structured so that large proportional gains go to those making less than the median income. Other initiatives might require more direct government action. Stagnating wages are not going away overnight. Why not create a generous wage subsidy in place of a minimum wage increase? Why not pass a New Homestead Act that gives incentives to Americans in low-growth areas to move to places with greater opportunity? Why not withhold federal criminal-justice funding from police departments with a pattern of civil rights violations, and increase funding for departments that cut crime and eradicate police misbehavior? This style of governance is not just what Americans want: It also fits with the Reaganite philosophy Republicans purport to admire. In his famous speech endorsing Barry Goldwater, Reagan told Americans: ""There is no such thing as left or right. There is only up or down."" Trump voters believe this wholeheartedly. They want government to move up and move beyond the sterile ideological battles of left or right. There's a reason Trump got the votes of the descendants of the Reagan Democrats: He was communicating the Reagan message that Americans of all stripes deserved a hand up from their government. Reagan never let ideology get in the way of helping average Americans. Reagan didn't just support free trade; he subtly encouraged Japan to enact ""voluntary"" export limits, which forced Japanese firms wanting to sell more cars in the United States to build American factories employing American workers. The Gipper's tax cuts always included generous exemptions or credits geared toward removing millions of low-income workers from the rolls entirely. Reagan's two terms are replete with examples of an energetic, active government that was nonetheless limited in its scope and aspirations. Trump's victory has given the Republican Party the opportunity of a generation. It can either hear the demands of whom, echoing Reagan and conservative Australian statesman Sir Robert Menzies, Trump calls ""the forgotten people"" or not. If it does, it will realign the GOP with its Reaganite heritage and work to affirm what Reagan called ""the purpose and worth to each and every life."" If the GOP can change back to what it once was, it can enact the change Trump's voters want and change America for the better.

" WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump's victory came as a surprise to many Americans, the nation's pollsters most of all. Heading into Election Day, most national surveys overstated what will likely be a narrow popular vote advantage for Hillary Clinton and led many to believe she was a shoo-in to win the Electoral College.  ""The polls clearly got it wrong this time,"" the American Association for Public Opinion Research said Wednesday in a statement. The association traditionally assesses the state of public polling after each election cycle, and already has a committee in place to do so again this year.  ""I think it was an important polling miss. It would really be glossing over it to say that it was a typical year,"" said Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center. For now, it's impossible to know for certain what exactly went wrong for pollsters this year -- and, as votes are still being counted, exactly how far off they were. Some factors pollsters will examine: ___ HOW BIG A MISS? Although most polls throughout the 2016 campaign showed Clinton running ahead of Trump, in the final two weeks of the campaign her advantage narrowed in many national surveys, as well as in states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. Her apparent lead fell within many surveys' margins of sampling error. Kennedy said pollsters may ultimately not have had a historically large miss on the national popular vote, but thinks there was a systematic overrepresentation of Clinton's support and underrepresentation for Trump's. She says people sometimes expect too much of election polls, which ""are not designed to provide extremely accurate results."" Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, says that averages of publicly available polls sometimes give a false sense of certainty in a candidate's lead.  ""You're taking imprecise estimates and throwing them all together with the hope of eliminating error,"" he says. ___ SHY TRUMP VOTERS? Trump's campaign frequently pointed to the possibility that public polls were missing some of his base of support, and some pollsters say that might have played a role in the polling miss.  ""One of the biggest problems that polls face nowadays is that people don't want to participate in them at all,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. He plans to use voter data to find out if certain types of people were less likely to participate in his surveys. At Pew, Kennedy said it appears that there was a segment of Trump's support base that was not responding to polls, which she called ""fundamentally a difficult challenge to fight."" But, she said, it's unlikely voters were lying about their support. ___ TURNOUT Harold Clarke, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas who regularly conducts polling, said one of the shortfalls in the presidential prediction was a problem that has plagued survey science for decades.  ""We've got to filter our surveys as we try to pick out those people that are really going to vote,"" he said. ""We all have the problem of not getting likely voters right."" Murray said pollsters are using likely voter models that might have worked in the past, but may no longer. He suggested that public pollsters should take a lesson from campaigns and consider putting out a range of numbers reflecting different turnout scenarios instead of a single number that suggests too much certainty in where the horse race stands. ___ TIGHTENING RACE Republican pollster Whit Ayres suggests that many observers -- himself included -- assumed that since Trump had never held a lead, he wouldn't get the benefit of the doubt from voters in the end. But he says that in races where an incumbent is stuck below 50 percent in the polls, late deciders often break toward the challenger.  ""There were a number of us who should have raised that possibility before the election,"" Ayres said. ""If you think about it, Hillary Clinton is about as close as you can get to an incumbent."" Nationally and in key states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Trump prevailed among voters who said they decided which candidate to support in the last week before voting, according to exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. In retrospect, Republican pollster Ed Goeas says that he saw a sign he now believes was a clue of Trump's advantage. In his national polling, he saw an 8 percentage point edge for Trump in voter intensity and enthusiasm among his supporters.  ""But the assumption on our part was that Clinton's ground game would overcome or neutralize that intensity,"" Goeas said. ""It just didn't."" ___ NOT ENOUGH POLLS? In several key states, including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, there were few polls conducted in the final week before the election.  ""In some of those unexpected states in the Rust Belt -- Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin -- you didn't see some of the more rigorous polls being conducted,"" said Kennedy. Goeas confesses to failing to see some late movements, in part because his polling ended four days before the election.  ""So basically we were looking at numbers thinking where he might end up,"" Goeas said of Trump's chances in Wisconsin, where he believed the Republican would benefit from Republican Sen. Ron Johnson's get-out-the-vote operation. ""Did we have any comfort he would do it? No.""  ""It would have been nice to have a couple more Michigan and Wisconsin polls to adjust that perception"" that Clinton was leading, Miringoff said. ""The campaigns don't stop because the pollsters do their final poll."" ___ Associated Press writer Matt Sedensky contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Perdue says Senate must act on high court vacancy	" WASHINGTON -- Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia said Monday it would be a ""dereliction of duty"" for the Senate to fail to act on Hillary Clinton's Supreme Court nominees if she becomes president. A few Republican senators and GOP activist groups have suggested that if Clinton becomes president, Republicans should try to keep the existing vacancy on the Supreme Court unfilled throughout her tenure. But Perdue said that failure to act would be an abdication of responsibility.  ""I hear what's being said about that, but I think that's a dereliction of duty,"" Perdue said, pointing to the Senate's constitutional role on judicial nominations. ""We're called to advise and consent. Now we can say 'no,' but that means that you do have a hearing.""  ""So I'm going to be one that says 'Look, our oath of office says that we're going to govern, and that's what we should do.'"" Perdue spoke with reporters Monday after presiding over a brief ""pro forma"" Senate session held one day before the election. Perdue struck an optimistic note that Republican Donald Trump would be elected and the GOP would retain its majority in the Senate. But he said that if Clinton becomes president Republicans will work with her.  ""Both parties need to find a way to compromise and get the country moving again,"" Perdue said, ""so whoever's in the White House we're going to give them a fair shake here in terms of trying to move forward and that means the budget, that means the appropriations process."" Several GOP senators in recent weeks, including Richard Burr of North Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas, have suggested that Republicans should take an unyielding stance toward any Clinton nominee, even though there's already been a vacancy on the Supreme Court for the better part of a year following the death of Antonin Scalia. The GOP-led Senate has refused to take any action on Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's nominee. The Senate could theoretically confirm Garland during a post-election lame-duck session, but Perdue said doing so would be ""improper."" Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has also ruled out a lame-duck confirmation. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

On Tuesday, they'll get to vote on whether they want statehood -- although the vote won't necessarily get the District any closer to that far-fetched destination. The statehood referendum provides the most intrigue to a sleepy general election in the nation's capital, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 12-to-1. Hillary Clinton is expected to easily win the District's three electoral votes. President Barack Obama received more than 90 percent of the District's vote in each of his campaigns. On the statehood question, voters will be asked to endorse a draft constitution that would have city residents electing a governor, not a mayor, and a 21-seat state legislature instead of a city council. The constitution includes new borders for the proposed state, with the White House, the Capitol and the National Mall carved out as a separate federal enclave. Ann Loikow, a longtime statehood advocate, said she's excited to vote for the referendum despite some concerns about how the constitution was crafted.  ""It's our first chance at a public opinion poll of the voters since 1982 of whether they're for statehood,"" Loikow said. ""It's a positive step because it's got people talking about it."" If the constitution is approved as expected, city leaders would then submit it to Congress, following the ""Tennessee model"" for statehood under which Congress can admit a new state into the union by simply voting to approve the document. But Republicans remain deeply opposed to statehood for both constitutional and partisan reasons: Making the District a state would dramatically shift the balance of power by all but guaranteeing two new Senate seats for Democrats. As it stands, the city's lone representative in Congress is Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who is barred from voting on the House floor. Norton, a 79-year-old Democrat, faces only token opposition in her bid for a 14th term. None of the D.C. Council races is expected to be competitive. The most noteworthy involves former mayor Vincent Gray, who did his heavy lifting in the June Democratic primary, when he defeated incumbent council member Yvette Alexander. Gray would represent his home ward on the council. His bid for a second term as mayor was derailed by a long-running federal investigation that exposed corruption in his 2010 campaign. Six people who helped Gray get elected pleaded guilty to felonies. Federal prosecutors said Gray knew about the illegal funds that aided his campaign, an allegation that Gray denied, and after five years, prosecutors declined to charge the former mayor. On the Council, Gray could serve as an antagonist to Mayor Muriel Bowser, who defeated him in the 2014 Democratic primary. The two politicians have a deep-seated personal animosity even though they lack major policy differences. Gray, 73, has not ruled out a run for mayor in 2018, although his support citywide is much weaker than in his ward, which is overwhelmingly black and poorer than most of the city. ___ Follow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols.

And then a century passed. . .	"    Gladys Ament, 96, was born the year that women were given the right to vote. She recently filed her absentee ballot from her home at an assisted living facility in Solomons, Md. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)  She was born at the family home in Lonaconing, a mining town in the mountains of Western Maryland, and delivered by the midwife who delivered all the Lonaconing babies around that time, which was Aug. 26, 1920. Her mother named her Gladys Elaine Beeman. Her father was on his way to Detroit, where he hoped he could find work in a car factory. Her president was Woodrow Wilson, whose secretary of state was Bainbridge Colby, a somber-looking man with little political experience whose appointment the newspapers had described as bizarre.  On that day, Colby sat at his home in Washington, D.C., and waited for a train to arrive from Tennessee. It carried some papers, and when they came, he signed them. Tennessee had just become the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment; now that the ratification nationwide had reached the required majority, Colby's signature would make it the law of the land. That night, Gladys's relatives came to Lonaconing to meet the baby girl whose country had just granted women the right to vote. Gladys grew up, and Gladys grew old, and over 96 years it was the story of America and the women who lived there: hemlines rising and falling, ideas coming and going-- and things that were done certain ways, and then all of a sudden done in different ways, which made some people feel liberated and some of them feel uncomfortable. In one of the first elections after the amendment was ratified, Gladys's grandfather put on the swallowtailed coat and top hat he wore for special occasions and walked down to the polling station to cast his ballot, for the Democrat. Later that day, her grandmother put on her own Sunday best, voted Republican, and returned to triumphantly tell her husband, ""I boxed you out."" Lonaconing was in moonshine country and two-room schoolhouse country, with a population of 2,054. Gladys's teacher was called Miss B, and Gladys wanted to be like her, which was a reasonable dream: A woman could have a career, as long as she never married, and as long as the career was one of three things: a nurse, a secretary, a teacher. That made sense to Gladys, the way it made sense that the girls did the dishes and the boys brought in the coal, the way she accepted that she'd never study at a university even though teachers had told her she had the brains for it. It was the way things were.     Gladys Ament (third row, fifth from left) with her classmates at Gilmore, the two-room schoolhouse in Lonaconing, Maryland that she attended while growing up in the 1920s and 1930s. (Ament Family Photo/Ament Family Photo)  The Depression came, and there was no money in Lonaconing. She knew two girls who were going to Baltimore to try to make it there. Gladys was 20, it was 1940, and she took the fourth seat in a car driven by one of the girl's older brothers to arrive at a boardinghouse in a neighborhood called Pigtown.  One night a friend arranged a double-date where it wasn't clear who was supposed to match up with whom. ""If you go on a date, you must make sure it's two couples,"" her mother had always told her, because that was what nice girls did. When the car pulled up, she got in the front seat to claim the boy who owned his own transportation. His name was Robert Ament. He was smart and reliable and a good pinochle player, so they eloped, and her relatives never stopped calling him ""that man of Gladys's,"" because he wasn't from the mountains and so could never truly fit in. The war came, and there were no men in Baltimore. Bob's job installing vital telephone lines kept him home for a while, but at the end of 1943 he was drafted, too, and he sent her letters from Europe: ""To my one and only,"" with hand-drawn cartoons of Cupid.  And then the world at home seemed to open up a little. Gladys saw posters of Rosie the Riveter, that strong-looking woman in a kerchief. There were posters of women holding drill bits: ""Do the job he left behind,"" they said, so she called up the telephone company where Bob had worked and tried to get a job there.  ""Your husband is serving our country,"" the boss told her sternly. ""And we are going to hold that job for him, and any men who want jobs when they come home.""  That made sense to Gladys, she supposed, because everyone hoped the war was almost over and everyone wanted the soldiers to return. She kept a job at a Montgomery Ward instead, filling catalogue orders, searching for shoes that had been ordered by people tracing their feet on paper. The workers were mostly women, and the bosses were all men. Sometimes if she was assigned a task, she was told to ask a man for help, even if she already knew how to do it. Even if she'd been there longer. She bought her first pair of pants, and sent Bob a picture of herself in them, strolling on a beach. He wrote her back and said, ""You mean you go outside with those pants on?"" She sent him a picture of herself in a bathing suit, and he wrote back, ""You're wearing too little!""      Gladys poses wearing one of her first pairs of pants. She sent this photo to her husband, Robert ""Bob"" Ament, while he was serving overseas in World War II.

The first lady was traveling all over the country for him, making speeches, meeting with unions, visiting factories and malaria patients. She visited the mountain country where Gladys had grown up. She wrote a newspaper column called ""My Day,"" where she talked about who she had seen and what she had learned.  ""It is said that gossip is the vice of women,"" she wrote in September 1944. ""Yet I have lived nearly sixty years, during which I have spent a good part of my time with men, and I have not found that they are any less quick to repeat things about which they know little and which they have not verified.""  Two months later, in November 1944, the first election in which Gladys was old enough to cast a ballot, she went to her Baltimore polling place and voted for FDR. If she were being honest with herself, she was really voting for Eleanor.  She voted for Harry Truman, who ended the war. He was her favorite president, because of his plain way of speaking and the fact that he sometimes cussed. She voted for Dwight D. Eisenhower twice. She voted for Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy, but then regretted it later, because Kennedy seemed so smart and died so young. By then, Bob had come home and they had a daughter, Mary, and a son, Robert Jr. They built a house out in Baltimore County, and had a third child, Marshall. Gladys's job was to stay home and raise them, which she did, while trying to navigate a world that kept changing. When she heard her daughter's grade school would be integrating black students, she worried about the best way to explain to Mary what was happening and why some people might be mad about it.  ""You be nice to everybody,"" she ended up saying, simply, because her daughter was barely 10. ""You be nice to everybody.""  It was the 1960s. Betty Friedan published ""The Feminine Mystique,"" and wrote, ""Each suburban wife struggles with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night -- she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question -- 'Is this all?' ""  Gladys didn't have much time to notice the feminist revolution. She was a wife, and a mother, and she loved those roles. But the kids got older, and she did start to want things. She wanted to go to work. Other women were; other women had kept their jobs after the war and built careers.  Bob didn't tell her not to, but she could tell he didn't like the idea, just like she could tell he didn't like the idea of her going back to school for a college degree. The kids were young. It would disrupt the family rhythms too much. She got a job anyway, but she made sure it was a part-time one -- a teacher's aide at a school for special-needs children -- so that she could still get home in time to make dinner, still be around on weekends for family car trips. Nurse, secretary, teacher.       Gladys Ament with her three children (left to right: Marshall, Robert Jr. and Mary) and her mother on a family vacation to Washington, DC in the 1950s. (Ament Family Photo/Ament Family Photo)  When she and Bob disagreed on something, usually they talked things through, but in the end he was the head of the household and was responsible for the decisions. Her daughter, Mary, later wondered how her mom felt about that. She wondered whether Gladys disagreed with his decisions about curfews, about clothing, about who could drive the car where and when.  But often this way made sense to Gladys, and she was glad for him to be the leader of the family. Sometimes it didn't make sense to her, though. But it was still the way it was. When they fought, she would throw her dishrag on the counter and storm outside to walk laps around the yard until she cooled off. ""There she goes again,"" the neighbors would say. The Equal Rights Amendment. Title IX. Eleven women in the U.S. House of Representatives, then 15, then 19. No women in the Senate. She voted for Lyndon Baines Johnson She voted for Hubert Humphrey. She voted for George McGovern, and then Carter, twice, even though she hadn't thought he was that great the first time around. She voted in every election, national and local. On election days, Bob would come home from work and say, ""Well, who am I voting for today, Gladys?"" because he knew that she had researched and thought about political things more than he had.  Later, much later, she would hear about some female engineers who had worked with Bob at the telephone company back in the days when he hadn't wanted his own wife to get a job. She learned that he had always been supportive of them and always treated them with respect in the workplace. People were complicated; they could hold many different beliefs at once. When the kids got near college age, money was tight, but Bob said he thought they could save enough money for their two sons to go on to a university. Gladys asked, ""What about Mary?""  ""I can spend it on my sons,"" he said, but he told Gladys he wasn't sure it made sense to spend it on his daughter. Gladys said, ""If the boys get to go, then Mary gets to go, too.""       Gladys on a trip to New York shortly after her marriage in 1943. (Ament Family Photo/Ament Family Photo)     Gladys and her daughter, Mary Ament Streb, reminisce while looking through a family photo album. (Doug Kapustin/For The Washington Post)    She voted for Walter Mondale. She voted for George H.W. Bush.  Bill Clinton ran for office and she liked him. She couldn't help it, with his folksy drawl. His wife reminded her of Eleanor Roosevelt, the last time that she could remember a first lady being so involved in White House life. When Clinton's philandering past came out, she wondered whether that should be such a big deal. She had lived through philandering presidents before. She had lived through a time when a man's cheating was something to be tolerated and expected. The same grandfather who had once put on his swallowtailed coat to go and vote also put on his swallowtailed coat for other reasons. ""Going up to see Mrs. Jones, are you?"" her grandmother would ask, sharply, and it was only later that Gladys realized what it meant. She voted for Bill again, and by then she was one of many because women were voting at higher rates than men. Her daughter Mary's life was different than hers. She did go to college. She studied education because the tuition was cheaper than her dream major of architecture. She became a teacher. But then she went on to become an administrator, the boss, with men and women alike working for her. Bob retired. Gladys thought about continuing to work, because she'd discovered how much she loved it. She loved the self-worth that came with it, and she was naturally patient with the children. Eventually, though, he persuaded her to retire too, and she was glad he had, because they spent happy years traveling through the United States and Europe before her husband of more than 50 years died at the age of 76.  Gladys voted for Al Gore. Her son had a daughter, which meant that Gladys had a granddaughter and she could see yet another generation of young women growing up, with even more opportunities than she'd ever imagined for herself. Her granddaughter never questioned whether she would be allowed to go to college. She just went, and while in school she worked part time in a job that nobody told her would be reserved for men. Gladys voted for John F. Kerry. She voted for Barack Obama, in 2008 and in 2012. She sold the house they'd built in Baltimore County and moved to a retirement community in Southern Maryland. Her health started to waver; she moved to the retirement home's assisted-living wing, where she maneuvered around her small apartment by making sure to grasp on to railings or the backs of chairs. She followed politics, as she always had. She watched as the 2016 election came, and as the former first lady, the one who had reminded her of Eleanor Roosevelt, was blamed for her husband's infidelity. She watched as the woman's fitness for office was questioned. She thought about the 18 presidential elections she had voted in, over the course of 70 years, and the 17 men she had watched take the office in her lifetime. Some of them had been good leaders, and some less so. She knew what made sense to her now.  In the middle of October, Mary drove to Gladys's retirement home with the absentee ballot that her mother had requested weeks before, unsure of whether she'd be well enough to get to a polling center. Gladys had recently celebrated her 96th birthday, which was also the birthday of the amendment that now allowed her to do what she had always wondered if she would live long enough to do. She filled in an oval bubble with a pencil, and she voted for Hillary Clinton.  "
