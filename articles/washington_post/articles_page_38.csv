If you're despondent over the election, consider this reminder from F. Scott Fitzgerald: ""The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.""  The ""opposed ideas"" we need to juggle simultaneously concern who we are as Americans -- a multiracial, multicultural nation coming to terms with our galloping diversity, or an us-against-them nation more torn apart by race, age, gender, geography, immigrant status and socioeconomic circumstance than at any time in living memory. That second idea has had a triumphant 2016. But it hasn't repealed the first idea. Twenty- first-century America is growing more polarized and more inclusive at the same time. The ugly aftermath of a toxic political campaign isn't the easiest moment to celebrate the kumbaya half of our two-sided coin. It's especially dicey to do so using data from public opinion surveys, given polling's many misfires in this election. Nevertheless, let me try. Item: In a nationwide Pew Research Center survey taken this spring, 59 percent of Americans said immigrants mostly strengthen our country, while 33 percent said they mostly burden our country. When the same question was asked in 1994, these numbers had been reversed: Sixty-three percent said burden; 31 percent said strengthen.  Item: Americans now believe same-sex marriage should be legally recognized by 61 percent to 37 percent. In 1996, they opposed same-sex marriage by 68 percent to 27 percent.  Item: In a nationwide survey this spring that I worked on with the nonprofit group Encore.org exploring attitudes toward America's ""gray-brown"" divide, 30 percent of respondents said the fact that most older adults are white and conservative, while a growing share of younger adults are nonwhite and liberal, will make it more difficult to solve our nation's most pressing problems. But 65 percent said that this growing diversity is more likely to be a source of national strength.  Item: Half a century ago, interracial marriages were illegal in a third of our states and a gasp-inducing taboo everywhere else. Today weddings among whites, blacks, Hispanics or Asians (16 percent) are more common than marriages between Democrats and Republicans (9 percent).  That last data point captures the current paradox. As our racial and cultural walls become more porous, our partisan chasms have grown wider. Politics is no longer just a contest of my ideas vs. yours. It's gotten meaner and more tribal. My group identity against yours. My grievances against yours. My insistence on these shifting boundaries vs. your resistance to them.  Any polity that lurches from President Obama to Donald Trump doesn't have a settled idea about who it is. This isn't new. Amid the tumult of the Industrial Revolution, as the verities of religion were being undercut by the march of science, the British poet Matthew Arnold wrote about ""wandering between two worlds, one dead, the other powerless to be born."" We're in such a moment now. Globalization, immigration, automation, the digital revolution, the women's revolution and the inclusion revolution are creating a new constellation of winners and losers. A wide swath of Americans feel like outcasts from the economy, exiles from the culture, strangers in their own land. Their sense of loss is palpable, as Trump understood. At the same time, another swath isn't yet sure if they've won a full seat at the table. Their anxieties and aspirations are every bit as legitimate.  These transitions do not last forever. Tick by tock, demographic change and generational replacement will tilt the balance toward the forces of inclusion. All the trends cited above are powered by millennials, our youngest, largest and most diverse generation. A lot of them didn't show up at the polls last week, but they'll be running the show for decades to come -- no doubt with some zigs and zags along the way. As for the rest of us, we'd do well to heed the wisdom of the proverb that says societies become great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit under. The future of today's young is the last report card for today's old. Our fates are shared, even if we don't look alike. That's not just my opinion. In this great, big, mixed-up country of ours, it's what most Americans think.   Read more here:   Catherine Rampell: Fellow millennials: I know you're frustrated. Vote anyway.

The decision by a three judge panel reverses a lower court ruling that overturned the law in Hardin County. The labor unions who sued to block the law say they will ask the full appeals court to reconsider the decision. If that fails, Kentucky AFL-CIO President Bill Londrigan said they would likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kentucky is the only Southern state without a right-to-work law. Warren County officials say that's a disadvantage when competing for jobs with nearby right-to-work state Tennessee. But labor unions say it would weaken their bargaining power and lead to lower wages and benefits. Warren County officials, emboldened by local governments across the country passing ordinances to raise the minimum wage, decided to pass their own right-to-work law in 2014, becoming the only local government in the country to pass such a law. Other Kentucky counties, including Hardin, soon followed.  ""We see it as an economic engine,"" Hardin County Judge Executive Harry Berry said. ""We thought it would give us more opportunity."" In February, U.S. District Judge David Hale ruled local governments had no authority to pass such laws, saying that power lies only with state legislatures. But the appeals court ruled that a county government, as a political subdivision of state government, can pass the law. It said local governments cannot pass laws banning companies from deducting union dues from paychecks and letting labor unions have a say in who is hired. Londrigan said the decision is ""a total misinterpretation of federal law."" He said if some employees were allowed to refuse to join a union, they would still benefit from the collective bargaining agreements the union negotiates on their behalf.  ""They would basically be able to have free services provided by the union that all the other union members are paying for,"" he said. An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court could take more than a year to decide. But the issue could be resolved by Kentucky's new Republican-dominated state legislature. The Republican-controlled Kentucky state Senate has tried for years to pass a right-to-work law, only to be blocked by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. But last week, Republicans won a majority in the Kentucky House for the first time since 1920. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has said he expects the new GOP majority to pass a right-to-work, although incoming House Speaker Jeff Hoover has not said what his agenda will be. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The choices of retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) as director of the CIA could presage a harsh and counterproductive U.S. approach to the Muslim world, a dangerous turn toward Russia and the reembrace of tactics for handling terrorism suspects that violate international law. Mr. Flynn, a close adviser to Mr. Trump during his campaign, has considerable experience fighting al-Qaeda and other extremist networks in Iraq and Afghanistan. As head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he is reported to have correctly warned that the terrorist threat was not diminishing in the years after the killing of Osama bin Laden. More recently, however, Mr. Flynn has attracted attention with his rhetorical assaults on Islam and Muslims. He has described Islam as not a religion but a ""political ideology"" that hides ""behind what we call freedom of religion."" He once tweeted that ""Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL."" Mr. Pompeo, who has an impressive academic, military and business record, is known as one of the more fanatical purveyors of conspiracy theories about the 2011 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and Hillary Clinton's alleged responsibility. He dissented from the Benghazi report prepared by his own Republican colleagues, which found no significant wrongdoing. More disturbingly, he has claimed that the U.S. government's surveillance powers have been critically weakened by reforms designed to prevent abuses. He has called for the creation of a large database combining phone records with ""publicly available financial and lifestyle information.""  Mr. Pompeo also has suggested that foreign terrorism suspects should be held for prolonged periods for interrogation by the military or CIA -- a policy that would likely revive the Bush administration's disastrous misuse of the Guantanamo Bay prison. Mr. Trump has been vague about his plans for fighting the Islamic State and other extremists, but the appointments of Mr. Flynn and Mr. Pompeo suggest a turn toward policies that could deeply alienate U.S. Muslim allies, including Sunni states whose assistance is critically needed to forge political alternatives to the terrorists in Iraq and Syria. An administration that appears to demonize Islam will be welcomed by the recruiters for the Islamic State and al-Qaeda; so will one that returns to the human rights violations symbolized by Guantanamo.  The damage will be compounded if the new administration allies itself in Syria with Russia, as Mr. Flynn and Mr. Trump have advocated. Not only is Russia committing war crimes in its bombing of hospitals and other civilian targets, but also it is doing so in alliance with Iran and the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which only boosts the Islamic State.  Mr. Trump's choice of Mr. Flynn also raises questions of temperament and conflict of interest. The general was reportedly not renewed in his DIA post because of bad management; since then he has accepted payment from the Russian propaganda network RT, and his consulting firm has lobbied for a businessman close to Turkey's autocratic president. His arrival at the White House, and that of Mr. Pompeo at the CIA, could trigger the last thing the incoming president should want: an exodus of the seasoned and capable personnel needed to construct a workable foreign policy.

That reality is now at the center of attention in the social media world as Facebook and others confront questions about their role in spreading fake news and false information before and after the presidential campaign. The social media companies must not duck this issue. It goes to the heart of an open society, and also is the key to their own credibility and survival.  It wasn't all that long ago that the Internet was a wild west, where information ran free. As Facebook, Google and Twitter grew, they celebrated this as a virtue, insisting they were technology companies built on algorithms and not news media outlets. But on the road to becoming true global giants, Facebook and the others took on enormous new power to shape the information that people consume. The latest Washington Post-Schar School national poll shows that when people are asked where they got their election news, 56 percent said television, and 30 percent said the Internet. Among the sources on the Internet, 32 percent of the respondents identified social media, 29 percent said news organizations' websites, and 15 percent said Google or other search engines.  A distinction must be drawn between personal posts, which are best left largely unfettered, and the news feed posts that can quickly go viral, accelerated by algorithms that respond to user engagement. When these posts suddenly explode and reach millions of people, social media essentially become news media. There is serious abuse when the content is false, such as one post during the campaign saying the pope had endorsed Donald Trump (he didn't), or a top Google search result the other day that pointed to a fake site reporting Trump had won the popular vote (he has not). Fake news is dangerous mischief and takes advantage of the fact that social media generally rely on rapid-fire algorithms and not deliberate human editing. The social media services must adjust to the reality that they now are news media outlets to some extent; that means relying more on human editors to weed out the fake news. The task is delicate and requires balanced judgment. The aim must be not to censor free expression or favor certain political views, but to guard against deception and fraud. In recent days Facebook and Google announced they are cutting off advertising on sites carrying content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive; that's a good first step.  Since the biggest social media outlets now span the globe, their operating standards must showcase the best of democracy at work, and avoid giving tyrants any impetus to crack down on dissent and free expression. This is a job for people, not algorithms. Social media have good reason to act here in order to protect their own future. If users conclude that the information highlighted by Facebook, Google and Twitter is consistently ureliable, they will look elsewhere. But society at large also has a big stake. The Internet has become a vital forum for democratic debate; it is essential that that interchange not be warped by propaganda and lies.

They'll have the perfect opportunity to make their appeal this week when Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a Pacific Rim summit as part of a visit to Ecuador, Peru and Chile. This is Xi's third time in Latin America since taking office in 2013, and when he wraps up the tour he will have visited 10 countries in the region -- the same number as President Barack Obama, who has been in office twice as long. Trump on the campaign trail pledged to break up trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, deport illegal migrants and build a wall to keep out millions from Mexico and Latin America, sending shockwaves across a region that for two centuries has looked northward for policy guidance. Over the past decade China has displaced the U.S. as the main trading partner in country after country in Latin America as demand for the region's soybeans, oil and iron ore fueled the fastest growth in decades. But more recently, as China's demand for raw materials has been slowing, the region's economies have taken a hit, dampening the once-torrid love affair with the world's second-biggest economy. Margaret Myers, a China expert at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, said that most South American countries have awoken to the pitfalls of dependence on commodity exports and would prefer closer ties to the U.S., which buys the sort of manufacturing goods that generate more jobs.  ""But the question is whether the U.S. will reciprocate,"" she says. ""Nobody in the region is expecting much from Trump in terms of really productive policy. That leaves room for China to play a much more important role."" Some of China's priorities and growing prowess in the region will be on display during Xi's trip. In Ecuador, a dollarized-economy that is battling a deep recession, Xi inaugurated on Friday the country's biggest hydroelectric dam, which was built by a Chinese firm and paid for with some of the nearly $8 billion lent to the country since 2007. From there he heads to Peru, to attend a summit of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group and a meeting with President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former Wall Street investor who nonetheless chose China for his first foreign trip after taking office in July. The weeklong tour wraps up in Chile, which recently opened a branch of a state-run Chinese bank that will be South America's first clearinghouse for transactions in the tightly-controlled yuan. Elsewhere, in Venezuela, the head of state-run China National Petroleum Corporation on Thursday signed a $2.2 billion accord to jointly boost oil production needed to lift the OPEC nation out of a crisis marked by severe food shortages and triple-digit inflation.  ""All of our thanks for all of the support given Venezuela in the difficult years, 2014, 2015 and especially 2016,"" a visibly pleased President Nicolas Maduro said at the signing ceremony. ""Our older sister China has not left Venezuela alone in these difficult times."" While Trump's victory has all but killed the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would've included Mexico, Peru and Chile, China continues to court the region with offers to strengthen existing free trade agreements with Costa Rica, Chile and Peru as well as negotiate new ones with Uruguay and Colombia. In the past decade, China's two biggest development banks have pumped in $125 billion to Latin America -- more than the Washington-based World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank combined. Xi, in a column for El Comercio newspaper, referred to the emerging ties with Peru as a ""win-win"" relationship encompassing areas as diverse as investment in infrastructure and energy to the shared heritage represented by the beloved ""chifa"" cuisine created by Chinese immigrants a century ago. To be sure, a U.S.-China trade war would have ripple effects across Chinese industry that would also depress demand for Latin America's raw materials. But for now Chinese businessmen attending the APEC summit see nothing but potential. Tang Ning, founder and CEO of wealth manager and micro-lender CreditEase, said Brazil and other parts of Latin America are ripe for venture capital in the same way China was 20 years ago. Nonetheless, he cautions that Trump's disruptive election is not a driver of its interest in Washington's backyard.  ""We take a very long-term view,"" said Tang in an interview. Politics ""isn't a major part of our conversation."" ___ Joshua Goodman is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman .

Trump spent about two hours dining with family at the 21 Club, a restaurant a few blocks from his Trump Tower residence. Journalists were only aware that Trump was leaving home when they spotted a large motorcade pulling away from the building, including an ambulance with lights flashing. Spokesman Jason Miller told reporters Wednesday that the transition team was trying to improve communication with the media and provide ""timely and accurate information. Do we always bat 1,000? Not necessarily. Last night probably was an example of where there could have been a little bit better communication."" The White House Correspondents' Association said it was ""unacceptable"" that the president-elect had traveled without the regular pool of journalists in place to provide the public with information about his whereabouts. Trump officials have said they plan to respect the traditions of press access at the White House. WHCA President Jeff Mason said, ""the time to act on that promise is now,"" adding it was critical that journalists covering the president-elect ""be allowed to do their job."" The movement was a surprise given that Trump's campaign had already called a ""lid"" -- a signal to journalists that he would not be venturing out for the rest of the day. The practice is meant to ensure that journalists are on hand to witness, on behalf of the public, the activities of the president or president-elect, rather than relying on secondhand accounts. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks issued the lid at 6:14 p.m. But just over an hour later, Trump's motorcade left his residence. His whereabouts became clear only after a fellow diner tweeted a picture of the president-elect arriving at the restaurant. Hicks said she was unaware that Trump planned to leave his home and had not intended to leave the press in the dark. Miller said the Trump team was working toward setting up a protective pool in the near future but said that ""for some in the media, unless they're actually sitting at the table, seeing if he's getting the chicken or the fish, that they will never be happy. And there always needs to be some balance for respecting some degree of privacy."" Trump traveled from New York to Washington last week without a pool of journalists. He's since spent most of his time inside his New York building, with his transition team offering few details about his schedule. Every president and president-elect in recent memory has traveled with a pool of journalists when leaving the White House grounds. News organizations take turns serving in the small group, paying their way and sharing the material collected in the pool with the larger press corps. The White House depends on having journalists nearby at all times to relay the president's first comments on breaking news. A pool of reporters and photographers was in the motorcade when President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas. The pool was just steps away from President Ronald Reagan when he was shot outside a hotel in the District of Columbia, and was stationed outside his hospital as he recovered. The pool also travels on vacation and foreign trips and at times captures personal, historic moments of the presidency. Trump departed the 21 Club around 9:30 p.m. His daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, were seen getting into a vehicle in the motorcade. ___ Pace reported from Washington.

We’re not reforming the electoral college any time soon.	"   Protesters in Los Angeles register their unhappiness with Donald Trump's win. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)  There is again some hope that we will reform our process of electing presidents after Donald Trump on Tuesday became the fifth person in American history to win the electoral college vote without winning the popular vote. Already, supporters of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton -- who won the popular vote -- have demanded by demonstrations and petitions that the electoral college alter its procedures so that the winner of the popular vote never again loses the election. But those hoping for reform shouldn't hold their breath. Electoral college reform has never been an issue that gains much traction. The power of small states within the Senate combined with the fact that voters don't tend to elevate this issue to the same urgent status of other issues has usually left proposals for an amendment to die on the vine. This time likely won't be different. Consider history: Following the election of 1968, there was a serious push for a constitutional amendment to move to a system of popular elections, though there had not been a constitutional amendment to change the electoral vote since 1804. Constitutional amendments required the support of two-thirds of the House and Senate, as well as three-fourths of state legislatures.   [Spoiler: That plan to have the electoral college elect Hillary Clinton isn't going to work]   Interest in reform emerged after the third-party candidate, Alabama Gov. George Wallace, a racist firebrand, ran a campaign that appealed to white working-class Americans by playing on their anger toward all the changes the civil rights movement had wrought. Wallace's electors said that they would vote for whomever their candidate wanted. Given that Republican Richard Nixon's victory over Democrat Hubert Humphrey was one of the closest in American history, this threat was taken seriously. When the electoral college met to confirm Nixon's victory, one of Wallace's electors, North Carolina Republican Floyd Bailey, indeed voted for Wallace instead of Nixon -- confirming the danger Wallace could cause to Nixon's candidacy. With the lukewarm support of the Nixon administration, Sen.Birch Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana, led a serious push for a constitutional amendment to change the system. The electoral college, Bayh said, ""is inherently inconsistent with the most fundamental concept of a democratic society."" Every vote, he argued, ""should count the same."" But he ran into a small-state firewall. First, Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina tied up the bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee and, working with fellow Republicans such as Sen. Roman Hruska of Nebraska, would not let it out for a vote. Bayh played hardball when Nixon nominated Harold Carswell to be associate justice of the Supreme Court on Jan. 19, 1970. Bayh threatened to filibuster the nomination unless Thurmond let the bill out for a vote. Thurmond conceded. The committee voted in favor of the amendment. The majority warned: A shift from (Richard M.) Nixon to (Hubert H.) Humphrey of only 42,000 popular votes in three states would have denied Nixon an electoral majority and given (George C.) Wallace, with his 46 electoral votes, the balance of power.... The elector is to the body politic what the appendix is to the human body.... The elector, in fact, is merely a symptom of what the American Bar Association's Special Commission on Electoral Reform aptly described as our ""archaic, undemocratic, complex, ambiguous, indirect, and dangerous"" method of electing a President.   [Why on earth do we even have an electoral college anyway?]   But when the amendment reached the Senate, Sen. Sam Ervin of North Carolina led a filibuster and killed the amendment. There was little political backlash so legislators moved on. The next major push for reform took place after the disastrous 2000 election when Vice President Al Gore won the popular vote and Democrats contested the results because of faulty ballots in certain counties and allegations of suppressed votes in urban areas. The recount process exposed Americans to a brutal, partisan battle over counting the vote. Many Democrats were outraged when the Supreme Court stopped the recount in Bush v. Gore, leading to George W. Bush becoming the next president. Mourning the turn of events, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote in 2001, ""The Electoral College gives states with small populations disproportionate weight, so Mr. Bush now resides in the White House even though Al Gore got more votes."" As in 1968, there was -- temporarily --  energized interest in moving toward a popular system. Commissions were formed, political debates were had, and a number of politicians said that reform was more urgent than ever before. Hillary Clinton herself said, almost prophetically: ""We are a very different country than we were 200 years ago. I believe strongly that in a democracy. We should respect the will of the people and to me. That means it's time to do away with the electoral college and move to the popular election of our president."" Yet nothing happened.     [Here were 2 totally plausible electoral-college maps in which Clinton and Trump could have tied]   Once again, legislators from smaller states, who had little incentive to try to change the system, stood firm in defending the existing system as something that has served the nation well. Voters, though worked up after election, didn't create any sustained political pressure for reform. Eleven state legislatures have signed onto the National Popular Vote interstate compact, which would guarantee that the candidate who wins the popular vote would receive all the support of the allied states when the electoral college meets. This time, all the factors that have undermined reform are still at work. Smaller states just played a major role in the election of a Republican president. Conservatives have depended on the institutional biases in our political system, from the electoral college to partisan gerrymandering, that allow smaller, older, whiter and more rural constituents to maintain inordinate influence even as demographic changes are rapidly transforming most of America. There are many on the right who will not willingly abandon this pivotal source of power. Nor is there evidence that enough voters are going to mobilize on this issue in a way that would cause politicians to fear for their jobs. In the 1950s and 1960s, civil rights organizations always made procedural changes like congressional reform (such as the discharge petition to allow liberals to get bills out of the hands of obstructionist chairs and filibuster reform) and were  successful at placing these issues on the agenda. Reporters shined a light on the way that southerners were trying to filibuster the civil rights bill of 1964. Right now it's unlikely for such a turn of events to take place. None of the major social movements of the day have made electoral college reform a central issue, and given the radical direction Republicans promise to take public policy there is little evidence reform will gain steam. After all, many Americans, especially those whose candidate just won, are comfortable with the status quo and aren't interested in making electoral college reform a major political issue. It will be interesting to see if grass-roots social movements like Black Lives Matter pick it up as an issue, and whether they have success in the long term.  But judging by history, the best bet is that the electoral college will survive. This will check some of the potential changes that have been predicted about the way in which a more diverse, pluralistic and ""browner"" America will shift electoral politics. If we want a different outcome, we'll have to change the rules of the game."

(Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)  They gathered in the November night chill beneath five billboard-size American flags. They stood on the sidewalk along Pennsylvania Avenue, not outside the White House, but farther down America's Main Street, outside the hulking stone building bearing the name of the new president-elect: the Trump International Hotel -- Washington, D.C. They came to make noise, to voice discontent, to make clear that America's decision to elect Donald Trump president was, to them, far from all right. They hoisted a motley assortment of signs listing a variety of grievances: ""You can not comb over racism,"" ""This Is No Country For Old Men."" ""TRUMP: RACIST IN CHIEF,"" ""Don't Tread on Me,"" ""Party of Lincoln 1854-2016,"" ""CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL,"" ""Stop Trump, Stand Against White Supremacy, Islamophobia & Immigrant Bashing!,"" and ""Trump Still Uses AOL.""      Protesters gathered outside of the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington and then made their way to the White House to demonstrate against President-elect Donald Trump. (WUSA)   Most were young, but some were silver-haired. Some wore black berets, green flak jackets and the garb of protest and resistance. Others came in business suits and trench coats, or black patent-leather pumps with a working woman's 2.5-inch heel. Some wore jeans and jackets, hats and other cold-weather gear. Others were in shirt sleeves and college sweatshirts but seemed undeterred, as the air temperature inched down toward 48 degrees. Neither was a man who passed on foot -- white, muscular and perhaps in early 30s -- who shouted his thoughts at the crowd. ""What a bunch of f------ idiots,"" he said without stopping. ""Go home. Know your f------ place."" ""Dump Donald Trump. Dump Donald Trump,"" protesters chanted in unison at 8:32 p.m. The scene outside the Trump hotel Thursday night was in many ways a living, breathing capsule of our time. Trump and the just over 60 million Americans who cast the ballots that made Trump the nation's next president are in the midst of celebration. But for many of the 60,839,922 who voted for Clinton, especially for the millions who are black, Latino, Asian, Native American or Muslim, there is fear, there is anger, there is disappointment. There has been weeping and a surge in anxiety. In cities across the nation, from Chicago and Baltimore to New York and Los Angeles, and, violently, in Portland, Ore., Americans distraught by the election outcome have poured into the streets. But also over cups of coffee, in office break rooms, on planes, buses and trains, on college campuses and in community centers, there are Americans seeking a community of the like-minded, assurance that all hope is not lost. They are hoping that in Trump's America, their rights will not be abridged, that they or their neighbors will not be rounded up or detained, that their political views and goals will not be suppressed, that their citizenship will not be downgraded because of who they are or what they believe. There is shock and fear and anger in the American progressive political valley, not just because of Trump or his policy goals, but directed at the more than 60 million mostly white Americans who heard and saw in Trump the promise of a better America, a different America, a country where their rights and needs and dignity are assured. ""Love Trumps Hate. Love Trumps Hate."" -- chant at 8:41 p.m. ""I say this without any irony or exaggeration at all,"" said Bassam Shawl, a 23-year-old dressed in a black bomber jacket, skinny jeans and a black T-shirt featuring Teddy Roosevelt with a gold grill. ""What you see here is a union of grave fear and grievances. People who are trying to come to terms with the very different America it seems we're going to have to live in. I think I need this, some of us need this. We have to be here to find a way to live with fear."" Since Election Day, Shawl has had conversations with family, friends and just people around town about what he sees as real and frightening possibilities. ""We not only have Trump preparing to be our president, but total Republican control of the House, the Senate, of the next Supreme Court appointment. The entire right-wing fantasy agenda is going to be enacted. It's completely possible that Muslims like me are being put on some list somewhere as we speak, or that we will all be detained, that my grandparents will be unable to even enter this country for a visit. That the Affordable Care Act will be crushed. That women's reproductive rights and health care eliminated or eroded. That is what's on my mind.""          1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flare up from opponents of the president-elect.

Peruse social media or news headlines and the bitter resignation of half the nation is clear. To Jared Taylor, a self-described white rights advocate and editor of American Renaissance, a publication that bills itself as ""America's premiere source for race-realist thought,"" it is ridiculous. ""Yes, if you visit [white nationalist] websites, you will see pretty much unalloyed joy about the election outcome,"" Taylor said. ""But does this mean that every African American, Hispanic or Muslim should be cowering in unreasonable fear of being imminently removed from the country? No. Donald Trump is an American nationalist, he is not a racial nationalist, despite the best efforts of the media to cast him as a frothing bigot."" Taylor said that he does not believe Trump is a white supremacist. Trump does not ""think in racial terms, despite every effort on the part of media to make it seem that he is taking secret instruction from people like me or David Duke,"" Taylor said. Trump has promised to remove illegal immigrants from the country to keep Muslims out, to possibly create a Muslim watch list, something that has happened before, Taylor said. Trump plans to put an end to maternity tourism, to examine the terms of birthright citizenship and to render it impossible for immigrants who make use of welfare, to develop policies that rid the country of the burden of fighting wars to spread democracy, Taylor said. Those are ideas ""ordinary Americans"" support, Taylor said. That is the same thought process that compels the majority of white Americans to move out of or avoid living in majority black or Hispanic neighborhoods, he said. Taylor is firm in his support for Trump, clear that his reasons have to do with race. ""Yes, it's true, someone like me who does have a racial consciousness supports Trump and is pleased about his election for a simple reason,"" he said. ""I support anyone whose policies will slow the dispossession of whites in the United States."" ""Not my president. Not my president."" -- chant at 8:54 p.m. To some of those protesting outside Trump's hotel, only those who allow themselves to overlook America's past and dismiss the constancy of bigotry and exploitation in American life had real reason for surprise. ""Listen, what we really face at this moment is the most American thing in the world: the white backlash that always follows any movement towards something different, something that even approximates equality,"" said Alonzo Hunt, 18, a Howard University freshman and native of Los Angeles who came to the Pennsylvania Avenue protest wearing a black beret, with a dime-size Black Panther pin and trench coat. Hunt described himself as aligned with various ""radical formations,"" along the lines of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. ""Trump is a fascist, and America has, from the beginning, been a settler colony, built on the expropriation of lands from first peoples and the theft of labor, energy and humanity from enslaved Africans,"" he said. ""What we have here is a swing of the pendulum, a move a bit closer to the nation's roots."" Hunt did not vote in the general election, an activity he dismissed as the ""most passive form of political engagement possible."" Protest, he said, reflects a determination to speak truth to power, to engage in the political battle for equality and justice in a meaningful way. It is a display of resistance, of an unwillingness to capitulate in the face of a massive political and social push in a regressive direction. That will sound to some Americans -- particularly those who voted for Trump or Clinton -- like the ramblings of the a college student who has entered his radical phase, a young black man not grounded in the kind of political pragmatism that sent others aware of the nation's history to the polls. But there is some historical basis for his position. In the years after Reconstruction -- a period in which freed slaves and freeborn black men and women bought land, built businesses, voted and won congressional seats -- came a wave of thousands of lynchings and the establishment of Jim Crow laws. In the years after World War II when the GI Bill's education and housing finance benefits seem poised to give all Americans a strong foothold among the middle class, senators from Southern states demanded state control of related programs and did not allow black veterans to reap the same rewards as white ones Still, it is inside the New York and Washington offices where full-time civil rights activists do their work where the election outcome has inspired less dejection and fear. ""Of course I feel the anger and pain,"" said Rashad Robinson, executive director of the civil right group Color Of Change. ""But there are also a few things we should remember. A majority of Americans did not vote for Trump. That doesn't change the impact that the policies Trump has promised, the ideas that he has unleashed. They will have a real and deleterious effect on people's lives. But it does mean that those of us in this fight, those of us who plan to hold him accountable are neither small nor weak."""

Some voters in Jefferson County ended up crossing party lines to cast their ballots for who they thought was the best candidate in each of the races -- defying the practice of party line voting in an election that showed a deep red-blue political divide. When Zena Stephens takes office Jan. 1, she will join Vanessa Crawford in Petersburg, Virginia, as the only black women sheriffs in the U.S., according to the National Sheriff's Association. Stephens credited her win in the sheriff's race to her long history in the community and to relationships she's built across political party lines. She said it's likely that there were Democratic voters who cast a ballot for her but who also voted for Trump.  ""There are people in our community who had positive past experiences with me who certainly were Republican. Certainly I got some of those votes,"" said Stephens, who defeated retired Beaumont police Lt. Ray Beck. One of those GOP voters was D'Ann Riggs, a 53-year-old emergency room nurse from Beaumont, who voted for Stephens and for Trump.  ""I voted for Zena not because she was black or a woman. I voted for her because I felt she was the best person"" for the job, said Riggs. Erin Landry, 32, an epidemiologist from Beaumont who considers herself a Republican, said she also voted for Stephens as well as for Trump. Landry said the selection of both Stephens and Trump shows that local voters were able to see past the presidential race and ""pick the best representatives for the job, regardless of which party they represent."" Jefferson County, which is east of Houston near the Texas-Louisiana border, has been a Democratic stronghold for many years. But Jefferson County Republican Chairman Garrett Peel said the GOP has been making inroads in recent years and currently has 20 locally elected officials. Of the county's more than 254,000 residents, 34 percent are black and nearly 20 percent are Hispanic. Trump barely edged out Clinton with about 49 percent of the vote, while Stevens got 51 percent. Support for Clinton wasn't strong as residents -- many who are blue-collar workers in the petrochemical industry -- were concerned whether her environmental and energy proposals would ultimately have a negative impact on their jobs, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston.  ""The appeal of Donald Trump was significant enough that taking a risk to vote for him for some economic change was reasonable,"" he said. Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston, said many of the Democrats who voted for Stephens -- and who probably also voted for President Barack Obama in the prior two presidential elections-- likely decided not to vote for Clinton.  ""Those are people who are saying, 'I voted straight-ticket Democratic but I'm not voting for Hillary Clinton. I voted for Donald Trump. But I'm supporting the rest of the party,'"" Jones said. The large local African-American voting bloc used its political muscle to rally behind Stephens but wasn't as enthused about supporting Clinton as it was when Obama was on the ballot, Rottinghaus said. Stephens, who is 51 and said she voted for Clinton, began her law enforcement career with the Beaumont Police Department in 1989. She spent 71/2 years with the agency before taking a year off from law enforcement. Stephens then spent about 17 years with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. Since 2013, she has been chief of the police department at Prairie View A&M University, located about 50 miles northwest of Houston. Stephens said she wasn't thinking about making history when she was elected Texas' first black woman sheriff.  ""Growing up I never saw an African-American sheriff or police chiefs,"" she said. ""I didn't think it was a possibility as a kid because I never considered myself to be a police officer or a police chief or a sheriff because I never saw anybody who looked like me in those positions."" ___ Follow Juan A.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/11/11/in-defense-of-political-spin/	In defense of political spin	"   Voters in Elyria, Ohio cast their ballots during the presidential election on Tuesday. (Reuters/Aaron Josefczyk)  Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we're talking about voter rationality. Need a primer? Catch up here. David Greenberg is a professor of history at Rutgers University and the author, most recently, of ""Republic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency."" For years after Americans elected Ronald Reagan president, liberals were despondent, doubting the electorate's capacity to make sound judgments. Here, in their view, was a not-very-bright former movie star who showed no grasp of policy, only a reflexive right-wing ideology. Surely, many argued, people were deluded by his skills as a communicator, getting them to buy into delusions like supply-side economics and the Star Wars missile defense system. Several years later, when Bill Clinton -- enjoying greater popularity as president than Reagan had -- withstood an all-out impeachment attempt, it was conservatives who questioned the good sense of the American public. Here, they said, was a small-time huckster and philanderer who lied under oath and showed no respect for the rule of law, but was getting away with it either because of his political dexterity or the vibrancy of the economy.   [The problem with our government is democracy]   It seems possible that our periodic crises of faith in the wisdom of the masses are rooted not in any cold-eyed account of human nature, but rather in our fluctuating judgments of whether or not we agree politically with the choices they make. While researching for my recent book, ""Republic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency,"" I found a continuing anxiety through the years that spin -- whether it was called propaganda, publicity, news management or something else -- would subvert the public's ability to make rational, independent judgments. There's a fear that in the face of the ever-more sophisticated techniques devised by professional spin doctors, voters are becoming increasingly malleable. They fall prey to manipulation of their emotions, dishonest rhetorical appeals or faulty claims about issues they are in no position to sort out for themselves. Our anxiety about illegitimate persuasion returns time and again -- it's as regular a feature of American politics as convention balloon drops, Fourth of July parties and sex scandals. In the 1920s, Walter Lippmann rejected the idea of an ""omnicompetent"" citizen who can stay well-informed enough to form opinions on the increasing welter of policy issues confronting the nation. This led him to temper his belief in democracy with a strong guiding role for disinterested policy experts. In the 1950s, Vance Packard fretted about the insidious psychological techniques that advertising wizards were using to play upon our unconscious. In our own time, Stephen Colbert coined the term ""truthiness,"" to direct our attention to people's willingness to believe what feels true over what really is true. A host of overlapping fears underpin these critiques: Will people be swayed by emotion and political bias, rather than cold reason? Does the public have adequate defenses against politician who spin, lie, or otherwise play with the truth? Does the complexity of modern life place the analysis of policy beyond the grasp of all but the most dedicated full-time student of public affairs? It would be naive to dismiss these concerns. The past provides many examples of the public following its half-baked enthusiasms and its overwrought fears, its blind partisanship or its ill-founded moralism. People have been deceived by politicians who've shaded the truth. Yet it would be wrong to aspire to a political world devoid of appeals to emotion, stripped of rhetorical claims that slant the facts, or reduced to expert pronouncements issued from on high as to which policies make sense and which don't.   [No, Trump voters were not irrational]   For one thing, the lines are hard to draw: Where does emotion stop and reason begin? Where does fact end and interpretation start? How much detail do we need to know to consider ourselves informed? Democratic politics depends precisely on not limiting public judgments to only the most bloodless, rational calculations. We rely on politicians' rhetoric to inspire us -- and even to scare us about things we should genuinely fear, like the curtailment of long-held rights or the evisceration of valued social programs. We similarly need to grant politicians a margin of exaggeration and even dissimulation in our political discourse, because they must be free to advocate full-throatedly for their passions and draw sharp distinctions from their rivals. And we want voters to form judgments on imperfect knowledge, lest the demand for consummate mastery of the issues chill our democracy into a technocracy. Journalists and intellectuals should -- and do -- call out politicians when they distort, exaggerate, or manipulate our hopes and fears. In an aphorism usually attributed to Daniel Patrick Moynihan (but first coined in slightly different form by Bernard Baruch), ""everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts."" The problem is that determining which facts are relevant or important to a political debate is part of the challenge -- and often the heart of the disagreement. Instead of trying to somehow banish emotion and spin and other less rational elements from the kingdom of politics, we'd be better off trying to inculcate in our fellow citizens a critical sense that helps us question and evaluate politicians' claims -- and maybe, just once in awhile, to know when to believe in what they say.
