Now here's the case for why your portfolio will be trumped by a Republican Congress that is fixated on tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy, cuts in domestic spending that will take money out of the pockets of the working poor and middle class, and further attacks on unions that will reduce what pitiful bargaining power the working poor have in dealing with their corporate bosses. The wealthy will sit on their savings and not spend. The working poor, deprived of health subsidies, housing subsidies, food stamps and bargaining power, will have less to spend, slashing demand. Trade wars will further cost the working poor and middle class, as imported goods will rise in price, disrupted supply chains will lead to factory shutdowns, jobs in export industries will be lost and most returning manufacturing jobs will be replaced by automation. This is a recipe for another Republican recession, which will spiral out of control because social safety nets will have been shredded.  Don't expect help from spending on infrastructure, which the deficit hawks will block. And we should not forget the negative economic effect of further climate-change-related disasters (fires, floods, droughts and more powerful hurricanes).   Michael Miller, Lorton, Va.              "

But what does one prominent candidate think ranks among the greatest dangers facing this OPEC nation? Cross-fit.  ""Competing athletes play in a mixed environment, with foreign and even some Kuwaiti women wearing indecent clothes, like sports bras, in a public and mixed environment,"" railed Waleed al-Tabtabaie, a prominent opposition figure. ""This is shameful and unacceptable."" Al-Tabtabaie's comments and those of others show how splintered Kuwait's opposition is despite many now saying they'll take part in the Nov. 26 poll after boycotting the last election, which followed tumultuous Arab Spring protests. Since parliament dissolved in late October, 454 hopefuls have registered to run for Kuwait's 50-seat parliament. Lawmakers on paper have four-year terms, though most parliaments are dissolved early in Kuwait. Among those running are many who sat out of Kuwait's 2012 election, including conservative Islamists and liberal reformers. Others remain imprisoned, like opposition politician Mussalem al-Barrak, who is serving a two-year sentence for a political speech deemed offensive to the emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah.  ""We believe that we delivered a clear message by boycotting the previous elections,"" said Mohammed al-Dallal, a member of the Islamic Constitutional Movement, Kuwait's version of the Muslim Brotherhood.  ""However, despite the fact that things have not changed, we feel that the upcoming period necessitates that we participate in the elections,"" he said. ""We need to take an active role in dealing with the extraordinary political and economic circumstances that the region is going through."" Kuwait allows far more public dissent than other countries in the region, many of which have outlawed the Brotherhood and jailed its members. Parliament routinely calls powerful politicians to account, and the recently dissolved group of lawmakers had planned to question a host of government officials in the coming weeks about widely unpopular subsidy cuts. While Kuwait, a country slightly smaller than the U.S. state of New Jersey, has the world's sixth largest proven oil reserves, its economy has been reeling. The global price of oil has been halved from heights of over $100 a barrel in the summer of 2014, forcing the government to cut gasoline subsidies and scale back cradle-to-grave benefits for its 1.4 million citizens. The stalwart U.S. ally has also grown increasingly worried about possible militant attacks. In 2015, an Islamic State-claimed suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Kuwait City killed 27 people and wounded scores. In October, an Egyptian who allegedly was an Islamic State supporter rammed a garbage truck into a vehicle carrying U.S. soldiers, wounding only himself. Those concerns, coupled with 87-year-old Sheikh Sabah's advancing age, have raised questions about Kuwait's future. But so far, its government has been slow to address any of it. The government is in some ways shackled by the political freedoms its citizens enjoy, ratings agency Moody's suggested in a note to investors in October.  ""These democratic elements of the system ... can be particularly disruptive to government effectiveness, which has been repeatedly demonstrated by the government's inability to implement reforms,"" Moody's said. Many candidates so far seem to be focusing on less urgent issues. Al-Tabtabaie, who is sweating the arrival of Cross-fit, began his campaign with remarks about a ballistic missile launch by Shiite rebels in Yemen that Saudi Arabia denounced as being fired toward the Islamic holy city of Mecca. Saleh al-Nafisi, a political science professor at the Gulf University for Science and Technology, said al-Tabtabaie's campaign showed the lack of a cohesive strategy among the Kuwaiti opposition, and risked inflaming sectarian tensions among Kuwait's Shiite and Sunni populations, who live together largely in peace.  ""The opposition as it stands today is certainly fractured,"" he said. ""Beyond its divisions and lack of leadership, there is no clear agenda of what they want to achieve."" ___ Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.

It could destroy his presidency.	"   Donald Trump poses for a fan in Anderson, S.C., on October 19.

University Press of Kansas. 193 pp. $29.95 Even before he honed his message of anger, disaffection and solidarity for the white working class, what powered Donald Trump toward the White House was his celebrity -- as a tabloid fixation, billionaire developer, reality-television star, Twitter fiend. He sought fame for its own sake, treating life as a series of brand extensions. A majority of the same American electorate that handed him the presidency believes he is unqualified for the job. Without his constant image-making and bomb-throwing, without his ability to shock and captivate so many audiences on so many platforms, he never could have won the Republican nomination, let alone the White House. But now he has, and if he wants to have a chance at an effective presidency, Trump will have to do something that appears contrary to his nature: He will have to cease behaving like a celebrity. Trump must relinquish spectacle, trading it in for the unglamorous business of governing. ""The obsession with communication -- presidential talking and messaging -- is a dangerous mirage of the media age, a delusion that inevitably comes crashing down in the face of governmental failure,"" Elaine Kamarck writes in ""Why Presidents Fail,"" one of four recent books on White House decision-making and crisis management that I'd encourage Trump to read during the transition -- if he read books. They suggest that, even in this era of the permanent campaign, a successful Trump presidency will hinge on his becoming someone else, or at least behaving like someone else. Trump the celebrity won the White House. But Trump the celebrity can't survive in it. *** All modern presidents succumb to the delusion that with just another riveting speech or evocative moment, just another dose of their personal magnetism, they can overcome political and legislative challenges, win over opponents, and enrapture the faithful. After the 2010 midterm elections, in which battles on immigration, health care and bailouts resulted in massive Democratic losses, President Obama concluded that what he needed was more theatrics. ""The symbols and gestures -- what people see coming out of this office -- are at least as important as the policies we put forward,"" he said. Kamarck, a former Clinton White House official, recalls that when President Clinton reflected on the failure of his 1993 health-care reform effort, he explained that he had ""totally neglected how to get the public informed. . . . I have to get more involved in crafting my message."" Yes, because better communication was their main problem.    (Brookings Institution Press)  There are certainly moments when the right message is not just necessary but transformative. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, an initially tentative President George W. Bush inspired the nation with his unforgettable ""I can hear you"" shout to rescue workers at Ground Zero. ""The bullhorn episode made Bush into an icon of American solidarity, pride, and defiance,"" political scientist Bruce Miroff writes in his insightful study  ""Presidents on Political Ground."" But other imagery would overshadow even that moment. Bush's infamous flight-suit landing on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in 2003, with the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner behind him, would come to embody the misjudgments and overconfidence surrounding the Iraq War, and when Bush gazed upon the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 from the safety and distance of an Air Force One window, Miroff writes, ""an image of indifference to suffering had been added to an image of incompetence in performance."" For Trump, whose public persona was forged through catchphrases (""You're fired!"" ""Make America great again""), the risk of confusing governance and speechifying is high. This is especially so after a presidential campaign, which always rewards pure communication abilities over real expertise. ""The challenge for the modern presidents is to add some governing skills to their campaign skills -- or, in other words, to stop talking long enough to figure out how to govern,"" Kamarck writes. [How does Donald Trump stack up against American literature's fictional dictators? Pretty well, actually.] In his inexperience with the bureaucratic behemoth he inherits, Trump is not all that different from his recent predecessors. ""Modern presidents find the federal government that they are supposed to run distant and unmanageable,"" Kamarck explains. When President Jimmy Carter approved Operation Eagle Claw -- the failed 1980 mission to rescue American hostages in Iran -- he did not realize that the service branches that needed to work together were actually terrible at cooperating (they never even had a full rehearsal, Kamarck notes) and that the military's Special Forces capabilities had been severely downgraded after the Vietnam War. Obama might have bypassed the embarrassment of watching HealthCare.gov crash repeatedly if his administration had tasked the right agency and the right people with the right expertise to manage the technical effort. Celebrity typically offers some degree of insulation from criticism, more leeway on bad behavior or stupid thinking. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump did not suffer the consequences of incendiary statements and revelations that would have doomed more conventional candidates -- so much so that he began to regard himself as invincible, even bragging at a rally that he could shoot someone in the street without losing any voters. ""Spectacle, as contrived and manipulative as it may seem, can appear to presidents as indispensable armor,"" Miroff writes.    (Lyons Press)  Trump's celebrity vs. Hillary Clinton's resume was one of the campaign's easy media narratives. But deep political and policy experience, by themselves, are hardly enough to make a president great. James Buchanan, who presided over a financial panic and Southern secession and is deservedly regarded as among the worst U.S. presidents ever, ""may well have been the most qualified man -- at least through his governmental resume -- to ever run for president,"" journalist Robert Strauss writes in ""Worst. President. Ever.,"" his new biography of the 15th president. Indeed, Buchanan's CV was Hillary-esque, including stints as a Pennsylvania state legislator, a member of the U.S. House and Senate, an envoy to Russia and Britain, and secretary of state. But he was a lousy president, Strauss explains, for a host of reasons, some of which have a whiff of Trump to them: ""a poor chooser of associates . . . pompous when he should have been contrite, oblivious to both current events and public thought, and living in a sheltered past."" Even relatively inexperienced presidents can compensate by appointing knowledgeable advisers and Cabinet members. Recall the early praise heaped on Bush's national security team (Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld and the rest), which was supposed to make up for the former Texas governor's blind spots in foreign affairs, or Obama's overhyped ""team of rivals"" approach to building his first-term Cabinet. In Trump's case, however, consider that Sarah Palin, Chris Christie, Rudy Giuliani and Corey Lewandowski are among the early names being tossed around for top posts. That's an entourage, not a Cabinet. Fun for a celeb, less suitable for a POTUS. Strauss notes that Buchanan also assembled a team of yes men, ""a cabinet that would not differ with him in any substantial way. . . .  no one was telling Buchanan when he went off kilter, as he was wont to do. He would often waffle on major issues, and could easily come up on the most ill-advised side of them."" [How did our politics get so harsh and divisive? Blame 1968.] Throughout his business career and presidential campaign, Trump has shown that he values loyalty above all else. So it shouldn't surprise us if there is an air of the sycophantic about the team he enlists. The problem is that presidents desperately need to hear contrarian voices. Kamarck writes of the State Department analysts who imagined dire consequences should the United States invade Iraq, the Bush-era economic officials who foresaw an impending mortgage crisis and the health-care consultant who warned the Obama White House that implementation of the Affordable Care Act's website was doomed. ""Many of the most important signals come from the very government that works for the president,"" Kamarck writes, ""and yet modern presidents are so distant from the government they manage that, on a regular basis, they ignore the flashing lights or fail to realize that they are even flashing."" Substantive expertise matters as much as ever because of what former Bush White House aide Tevi Troy describes as the ""ratchet effect"": the notion that any action a president takes in boosting the role of the federal government in a crisis will be assumed and expected the next time around. In his book ""Shall We Wake the President?"" Troy delves into the disasters presidents have and will invariably face, including pandemics, extreme weather, terrorist plots, economic contractions and civil unrest. When you're responding to real storms, not tweetstorms, it's tough being an apprentice in the White House. Even a celebrity apprentice. ***    (University Press of Kansas)  Of course, Trump may simply represent an exaggerated version of what the presidency has already become. ""With the rise of national media,"" Miroff suggests, ""a different possibility for presidential image making emerged: the president as the country's chief celebrity."" FDR, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and certainly Obama all combined celebrity with their politics. ""A growing amount of presidential activity is akin to pro wrestling,"" Miroff writes, in a comparison that should appeal to Trump. ""The contemporary presidency is presented by the White House as a series of spectacles in which a larger-than-life main character and a supporting team engage in emblematic bouts with immoral or dangerous adversaries."" It is possible that the celebrity-fueled excesses we saw from Trump during the campaign -- the late-night Twitter rants, coarse language, petty feuds, improbable boasts and unlikely promises -- will give way to a sober and measured commander in chief. Perhaps the trappings of the office will suffice to scratch the itch. But even if he makes that shift, will his most extreme and vocal supporters follow? ""Of all the constitutive elements of a president's coalition, social movements can be the most difficult partners,"" Miroff cautions. They are the most strident, intransigent and demanding, he explains, the most likely to push presidents beyond where they planned to go. This happened with President Lyndon B. Johnson and the civil rights movement, and Obama and LGBT rights. The alt-right elements in Trump's coalition are among the most organized; they are their own kind of social movement. What passions will be further unleashed if Trump doesn't deliver for them, after they delivered for him? Will the new president take that risk? After all, a savvy celebrity gives his hard-core fans what they want.
