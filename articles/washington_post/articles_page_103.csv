Former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), a respected voice on national security thought to be a leading candidate to run the CIA, was among those pushed out of the team over the past two days, two individuals with direct knowledge said, in a series of moves that have added to the anxiety across the upper ranks of U.S. intelligence agencies. ... A former U.S. official with ties to the Trump team described the ousters of Rogers and others as a ""bloodletting of anybody that associated in any way on the transition with Christie,"" and said that the departures were engineered by two Trump loyalists who have taken control of who will get national security posts in the administration: retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Everything's going to be fine when Trump's crack team of highly competent experts takes control of the government. * Madeline Conway reports on the latest from the slow counting of the votes and the increasing size of Hillary Clinton's popular-vote win: Hillary Clinton's lead in the popular vote over President-elect Donald Trump has surpassed 1 million, according to Dave Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As the final vote counts continue to trickle in a week after Election Day, Wasserman's tally found that Clinton had 61,963,234 votes to Trump's 60,961,185 as of Tuesday afternoon. Wasserman tweeted that votes from Montgomery County, Maryland, pushed Clinton's lead over the 1-million mark, with the Democratic nominee receiving roughly 20,000 more votes, compared to about 3,000 for Trump. Votes are still being tabulated in California, Utah and Washington, according to Tracy Lewis, elections operations manager for the Associated Press. The result in Michigan remains too close to call. A reminder: In every other democracy in the world, the popular vote is referred to as ""the vote."" * Gallup reports that before the election, 16 percent of Republicans said the economy is getting better. Afterward, 49 percent of Republicans said the same thing. Trump hasn't even taken office yet, and his voters can already see the results!  * Josh Marshall says that there's enough chaos in the Trump transition that some of his initial appointments could run into trouble in the Senate, where Republicans enjoy a very slim margin. * Molly Ball catalogs the explanations Democrats are offering for Clinton's defeat. * Ben Weyl reports that now that a Republican is about to become president, Republicans have decided that deficits are no longer important and they should spend whatever they want and cut taxes. Who could have predicted such a development? Oh yeah, pretty much every liberal. * Ed Kilgore says that Trump is going to betray his white working-class base; the only question is when and how he does it. * Seth Masket says you shouldn't be quick to assume that Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden could have done better than Clinton did. * Jamelle Bouie says that the voters who deserve our sympathy and understanding are the ones facing harassment, intimidation and potentially the wrath of the Trump administration, not the ones who voted to put this bigoted xenophobe in office. * Zeynep Tufekci says Mark Zuckerberg is in denial about the pernicious influence the flood of fake news coming over Facebook had on the election. * Ruy Teixeira argues that Trump managed to win this election by stoking a reaction to the demographic changes that will make it impossible to win on the same terms in the future.  * At The Week, I argued that it's starting to feel like 2003 or so, when Democrats were told they need to go hunting and take in some NASCAR events to show they were down with the white working class."

Opponents said the document revealed the chaos behind the government's frequent assurances that ""Brexit means Brexit."" The Times of London published a memo, written by a staffer at the accountancy firm Deloitte, claiming that rifts within Prime Minister Theresa May's team have delayed development of a negotiating strategy with the E.U. The government says it will trigger two years of formal exit talks by March 31. But the memo says that ""it may be six months before there is a view on priorities/negotiation strategy as the political situation in the U.K. and the EU evolves."" The prime minister's office responded, ""This is not a government report and we don't recognize the claims made in it."" Deloitte said the note was written "" without access to No. 10 [Downing St.] or input from any other government departments.""  The memo says that May's government has little understanding of Brexit's implications for industry and that its ""priority remains its political survival, not the economy."" May took office in July, after Britons voted to leave the E.U. She had campaigned to stay in but has promised she will deliver on voters' decision to leave the bloc.  -- Associated Press YEMEN Government rejects Kerry's peace initiative U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Tuesday that Yemen's Shiite rebels have agreed to a cease-fire for their war-torn country -- on the condition that their adversaries also agree to it. The announcement drew an immediate backlash from the internationally recognized Yemeni government. Kerry told reporters that the rebels, known as Houthis, have told him that they will abide by a cessation of hostilities, starting Thursday, providing the government does the same, and that they are willing to participate in a unity government. President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi's government rejected the cease-fire initiative. Hadi's government is supported by a Saudi-led coalition that has been waging an air campaign in Yemen. The government has opposed a road map to peace that Kerry said has the support of Houthis. The document, drafted last month, sidelines Hadi by stipulating the formation of a unity government. It also transfers the president's powers to a vice president and a new prime minister. The document says the formation of the unity government would come hand-in-hand with preparations for the Houthis to withdraw from cities they have seized and hand over their weapons to a third party. -- Associated Press EGYPT Court strikes down Morsi's death sentence A court in Egypt on Tuesday struck down the death sentence passed by a lower tribunal against an ousted Islamist president for his part in a mass prison break during the nation's 2011 uprising. The ruling means that Mohamed Morsi would be given a new trial, along with five other leaders of his now-banned Muslim Brotherhood group, whose death sentences in the same case also were quashed. The court also struck down life sentences passed against 21 Brotherhood members. Morsi is implicated in four trials pertaining to different cases, including the 2011 prison break. Last month, a court upheld a 20-year sentence for Morsi on charges related to the killing of protesters in late 2012. It was the first final verdict against Morsi, who was ousted by the military in 2013 after a year in office. Morsi is also appealing life sentences he received in the two remaining cases against him. -- Associated Press  Senior Libyan al-Qaeda leader reported slain:  A senior al-Qaeda leader was reportedly killed in a drone strike in southern Libya, a Libyan news agency said. The strike was suspected to be the work of a Western military, but a Pentagon spokesman denied any U.S. role. The news agency said Abu Talha al-Hassnawi, a key figure in al-Qaeda's North Africa affiliate, was killed in his house in Sabha.    Hong Kong court bars pro-independence lawmakers:  Two Hong Kong separatist lawmakers were disqualified by a judge from taking office because they altered their oaths by adding anti-China insults.

The movement generally advocates formation of a nation set aside for whites. Some adherents openly supported Trump for president, and white nationalists have praised Trump's appointment of Bannon as a senior adviser. Bannon previously headed the Breitbart website that appealed to the so-called ""alt-right"" -- a movement often associated with far right efforts to preserve ""white identity,"" oppose multiculturalism and defend ""Western values."" White nationalists often support the idea that white people are under attack in the U.S., and need protection from the growth of minority and immigrant groups. Adherents sometimes use the hashtag #whitegenocide on social media to promote their belief that the future of the white race is in peril. They see diversity as a threat to fight, not a goal to embrace. Here are some questions and answers about white nationalism in the United States: HOW DID THIS GET STARTED? Groups including the Ku Klux Klan, which is 150 years old, have espoused various white nationalist ideas. The start of the current white nationalist movement is pegged to more recent years. J.M. Berger, an author and expert on extremism at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, wrote earlier this year that many of today's white nationalists were inspired by ""The Turner Diaries,"" a racist novel published in 1978. In the book, physicist-turned-writer William Luther Pierce describes a dystopian America in which white people are disarmed by minorities. Timothy McVeigh had pages from the book with him when he bombed the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people. IS STEVE BANNON A WHITE NATIONALIST? Bannon hasn't commented publicly since being tapped for the White House position, but his former colleagues at breitbart.com dispute any links to white nationalism. In a statement released to The Hill, a political newspaper published in the nation's capital, breitbart.com said it had been under intense scrutiny over Bannon's involvement with Trump and was preparing a lawsuit over media depictions of it as a ""white nationalist website."" The statement added: ""Breitbart News rejects racism in all its varied and ugly forms. Always has, always will."" Speaking on CNN, a Trump spokesman has called media coverage of Bannon's appointment ""irresponsible."" ARE WHITE NATIONALISTS ORGANIZED? To an extent, yes. One such group, the National Alliance, was actually founded by Pierce, the ""Turner Diaries"" author. As with any such group, accurate membership numbers are tough to attain. And the National Alliance's website says it won't accept just anyone into the fold: Only heterosexual whites who aren't addicted to alcohol and drugs are welcome. Members can't be involved romantically with a person of another race, and they can't be in prison. A postelection commentary posted on the National Alliance's website called Trump's victory ""a move in the right direction"" and ""a temporary reprieve for the United States of America as a majority-white country."" Another group with white nationalist leanings, the Council of Conservative Citizens, also has praised Trump's election, as have various KKK groups and the American Nazi Party. White nationalist groups embrace a number of different symbols. Some with Nazi roots use the swastika as an insignia; KKK groups with white nationalist beliefs use more traditional Klan insignia, like a cross with a red tear. The National Alliance website features a cross with arms bent upward. ISN'T ALL THIS JUST PREJUDICE WITH A NEW NAME? It depends on who you ask. Critics of white nationalism definitely see it as a racist ideology, a form of hate run amok. They say the very idea of establishing a ""white"" nation is disparaging and hurtful to the racial minorities, ethnic groups and religious adherents who would presumably be forced to live elsewhere. Believers in white nationalism disagree. They deny looking down upon other races or believing they are superior to anyone. They say they don't hate. They just want their own country, which would implicitly allow minorities to have their own nation. ARE THERE OTHER KINDS OF NATIONALISTS? Absolutely, including black nationalists. One of the founders of black nationalism was Marcus Garvey, who founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1914. The Nation of Islam, formed in Detroit in the 1930s and now led by Louis Farrakhan, also has a black nationalist strain, as the religion aims in part to free blacks from ""servitude"" to Western civilization -- white society. Other black nationalist groups have popped up through the years, and several have an internet presence. The gunman in the Dallas police massacre, Micah Johnson, had shown interest in black nationalist groups before opening fire and killing five officers earlier this year. The Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, a liberal advocacy group which monitors extremist organizations, classifies both white nationalist and black separatist organizations as racist.

But many such devices were developed without security considerations. As a result, they are prime targets for hackers. Here are tips to protect your devices: HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE AN ""INTERNET OF THINGS"" DEVICE? If you have a device that is capable of connecting to the internet or shares information over a wireless network in your home, it is potentially insecure and can be leveraged for a cyberattack. Last month, hackers harnessed an army of 100,000 internet-connected devices around the world, such as DVRs and security cameras, to attack Dyn Co., which helps route internet traffic to its destination. It caused temporary internet outages to sites that included Twitter, PayPal, Pinterest, Reddit and Spotify. WHY SHOULD I CARE? Hackers can penetrate devices to directly harm someone or to target critical infrastructure. They can remotely disable a car, raise the thermostat on refrigerated foods, and toy with internet-enabled medical devices. In the Dyn attack, hackers used the devices to flood the internet infrastructure company with data and knock it offline. Such tactics also could be used against electrical and water systems, which are increasingly being put online to allow for remote operation. WHAT CAN I DO? Make sure you are aware of what you are connecting to the internet, and think about what is necessary. That feature on your new bathroom scale that syncs with your phone is handy, but can you password protect it from getting hacked? Any device that has the capabilities of remotely sending information elsewhere is vulnerable. Therefore, the software on that device and the network in connects to must be secured. If a device comes with a default password, make sure you change it. You should also change the password on your wireless network at home. Use complex passphrases to ensure your device is not easily hacked. The Dyn attack was made possible by devices with default passwords that were never changed. WHOM DO I CONTACT IF I AM WORRIED ABOUT A DEVICE? Contacting the manufacturer or vendor of the device may not always help. This is especially true because innovation has frequently outpaced cybersecurity education. The Homeland Security Department sends out public alerts about vulnerabilities through its US-CERT program that you can sign up for on its website . You can also contact the department directly. ___ Follow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams . Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If the white working-class voter was this election's A-lister, the journalist was its heel. Countless Youngstown and Wilkes-Barre dispatches did not shield reporters from the jeers and bird-flipping of Trump voters. The Clinton campaign, in a mopey Thursday memo, blamed its close defeat on the FBI's e-mail obsession -- that is, on how the press spent the election's last weeks talking about the former secretary of state's e-mail. Bernie Sanders may have the biggest gripe of all, and ""Our Revolution"" is arriving to talk about it -- in the most deadpan, wistful and wonkish way. The press labeled him ""fringe."" In 2015, it covered the collapsing Jeb Bush (remember him?) more than the surging Sanders. Before listing the ""giant corporations"" that own the press, Sanders painstakingly describes a series of news conferences where he tried to get issues covered and reporters instead asked about trivia.  ""As a general rule of thumb, the more important the issue is to large numbers of working people, the less interesting it is to corporate media,"" Sanders writes. ""The less significant it is to ordinary people, the more attention the media pays."" There's much more to ""Our Revolution,"" which reads like the author started hitting his keyboard and did not sleep until he finished. (Sanders crashed it in three months, between the Democratic primary contest and his October campaign swing for Hillary Clinton.) Reading it as a reporter who covered Sanders closely, I felt like a sitcom character who gets beaned on the head and hallucinates an angel -- or a talking dog, or a 75-year-old senator from Vermont -- spinning lessons about what really matters in life.      In any other year, Sanders's story would have dominated American politics. At the start of the campaign, as he recalls with some wryness, neither the press nor many progressive activists took him seriously. (A 2014 poll by MoveOn found 32 percent of its members favoring Clinton and just 6 percent picking Sanders.) ""Was there a better potential progressive candidate out there than me?"" he writes. ""Probably not."" With detail reminiscent of a dissertation, he describes how local reporters covered his events -- especially the ones that dealt with rural poverty, or Native Americans, or veterans. ""We held sixty-eight meetings there and brought out 41,810,"" he writes of New Hampshire. ""On Election Day I received 151,584 votes. The likelihood is that over 25 percent of the vote we received came from people who had attended one or more of our meetings."" Anyone picking up ""Our Revolution"" to learn what the Sanders campaign was like will get some impassive memories and not much else. The arrival of the Secret Service, which spent five months protecting the most successful democratic socialist candidate in American history, is mostly amusing. ""I was traveling in an armored vehicle accompanied by a fleet of cars and a number of well-armed agents who made sure I was safe in the bread aisle,"" Sanders writes. Sanders's own celebrity amuses him, too. But there's no recollection of what a cult figure he became, his image merged with band logos and cartoon characters by people hawking Bernie T-shirts online or at his rallies. ""People wanted cell phone photos,"" Sanders recalls of his early momentum. ""I was beginning to get used to the concept of the 'selfie.' "" And there is almost nothing about the skullduggery of modern campaigning. There are few details about election nights or how emotions were running at any particular time, with exceptions such as Sanders's admission that he grew ""increasingly nervous"" before the first Democratic debate. The criticism of his occasionally pro-gun record, he shrugs, was ""an unfair attack but one that I did not handle well."" On the decision to run for president, the reader learns more about what Sanders ate with his wife, Jane -- ""especially good"" blueberry pancakes at Denny's -- than what was said. Most of the campaign story is told through local media coverage (and asides, like how running as an insurgent was about ""campaigning in a town that no presidential candidate had ever visited""). A short digression into why only elderly voters considered him too old to be president ends with Sanders reminding readers that he had ""one of the strongest records in Congress on senior issues."" That's the point. Sanders, who had been saying roughly the same thing about the threat posed by oligarchy for 30 years, suddenly found that 14 million voters agreed with him. They ""were prepared to fight back, and the word 'socialism' didn't frighten them,"" he writes. Even as he gathered them, the media did not see him coming, then did not see Donald Trump coming and -- one assumes -- does not see whatever is coming next. That leads into the most telling, and detailed, of Sanders's campaign stories. When CNN kept pushing him at a debate to criticize Clinton for her use of a private e-mail server, Sanders said the media was worrying over the wrong issues. ""The middle class of this country is collapsing,"" he said. ""Enough of the e-mails!"" In retrospect, Sanders writes, ""the answer certainly struck a chord in the audience, which rose in a standing ovation and prolonged applause."" But its success was more of a distraction than a boon. Sanders had sandwiched his criticism of the e-mail obsession with a quick rundown of the economic issues he badly wanted to discuss. ""The media combined the two remarks about the e-mails and chose to omit coverage about the issues,"" he writes. Those issues make up the rest of ""Our Revolution,"" in an extended information dump that supplements Sanders's old stump speech with a tree-slaughtering army of charts. Any reader who was not already a fan of Scandinavian welfare systems will become one. Anyone not outraged by the state of things -- it is hard to imagine who -- will get disquieting statistics chased by lines honed at all of those meticulously organized rallies. ""More than 23 percent of working mothers in America have to go back to work just two weeks after giving birth,"" Sanders writes at one point. ""Just two weeks to bond with and spend time with their newborn babies."" When ""Our Revolution"" was written, Sanders probably expected to be throwing a manifesto at Clinton's presidential transition team. Trump is hardly mentioned at all here. The danger of big money in politics has a solution: a new Supreme Court justice who will overturn Citizens United. The threat to Social Security has a solution, too: elect people who will expand it instead of cutting it. None of that is possible now, but the journalists explaining why are chastened. For two years -- arguably, for eight or 16 years -- politicians like Sanders were characters in a larger story about how Clinton would take power. If it was remarkable that tens of thousands of people would cram arenas to hear about socialism, it was understandable, according to campaign reporting, because people wanted to push Clinton to the left. Sanders did shift her, and the Democratic Party, leftward. She was then defeated by a Republican candidate who abandoned the mainstream right -- including the Koch brothers, Sanders's bete noire -- on trade and Social Security. She has vanished. Sanders has not. ""I was gently faulted by some for having excessive 'message discipline,' for spending too much time discussing real issues,"" Sanders writes, taking one last whack at his critics by mocking their assessment: ""Boring. Not what a successful modern campaign was about.""                                           Our Revolution A Future to Believe In By Bernie Sanders Thomas Dunne. 450 pp. $27 "

(He is 74, I am 60). I had a very traumatic divorce. My current husband was one of the lawyers involved in the divorce. We had a whirlwind relationship and married after nine months. My new stepdaughter, 31 years old at the time, chose to destroy our special day, and to this day, hates me. My husband and I tried to work this through; he was devastated and I let her walk all over me. Now I don't have anything to do with her. My husband has refused to attend any of my family events if my only son is attending because my son has had several DUIs. My son is a very hard worker but has a very limited income. I have helped him out with legal fees, etc. I used our joint accounts for this. Mainly my husband seems to think my son is a loser. After holding in my anger about having to shuffle holiday events so that my husband doesn't have to be there with my ""wayward"" son, I totally blew up and revealed very ugly sexual activities that his daughter did. I feel terrible about this. Because he is a lawyer and can file for divorce (and has done it before without my knowledge after fights), is my love for him healthy? Should we try harder to make this work? Ninety percent of the time we are good. Wondering Wife  Wondering: Should you work harder on your marriage? Yes. But you two also seem to be equally poor parents: enablers, punishers and with distorted views of your adult children. I'm shocked that your marriage is good 90 percent of the time, because given what you report, you two deal with your problems by refusing to deal with your problems and blaming your partner. You should decide to be partners first, and then parent together. This means that you don't sneak money from your joint account to enable your son's drinking, and he doesn't tolerate his adult daughter's mistreatment of you. Your mutual refusal to acknowledge and take responsibility for your own actions doesn't bode well. A counselor with a specialty in family systems could help. You might also want to consult with your own attorney.  Dear Amy: I have been extremely unhappy since I was 8 years old, and I'm 27 now. It just seems like my life keeps getting worse. I have never had more than a few friends and have not really been in a relationship. I have been struggling since I was last in college and cannot get the jobs I go for. I feel like I'm rotting and stuck at home while people who have treated me badly get ahead. I would like to get into politics or acting, but I have no clue how to get started. I am constantly rejected by people, and it is extremely frustrating. I am too old to have these problems. I don't know what to do. I want a career I will enjoy, but spending your life sitting around at home is definitely not good. I am missing out on so much. I don't know how to make people want to help me career-wise and in my personal life. Frustrated  Frustrated: You should get a thorough mental-health screening, and solid career coaching. For someone who is sensitive to rejection, your two career choices: politics and acting, are not good fits. Both careers involve repeated rejection experiences, but if you are truly passionate about these things, then you will learn the most by diving in. You should volunteer with a local political campaign, supporting a cause or a candidate you believe in. You should also take an improv class. Improv acting is a great way to learn to navigate around different personalities, think on your feet, master rejection and learn to always say ""yes.""  Dear Amy: ""Hurting"" reported that her mother was acting angry and upset at her decision (at the age of 32) to move out. When I announced move-out plans to my parents, my mother replied testily, ""What do you think you're going to do there?"" and then asked my father if he was going to mow the back lawn after dinner. Subject closed! Later she wrote to me, ""You'll never know how difficult it was to put you on the train . . .""

Here is a look at the vote and the issues: WHERE IN THE WORLD? Bulgaria is a nation of 7.2 million in southeastern Europe, bordered by Romania, Turkey, Serbia, Greece and Macedonia. It's one of the poorest members of the 28-nation European Union and joined NATO in 2004. Still many in this Black Sea nation still share deep historical and cultural ties with Moscow and the energy-strapped country is heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies. WHO IS RUNNING? In a surprise in the first round of voting, Gen. Rumen Radev, 53, a former non-partisan chief of Bulgarian Air Force came in first with 25 percent of the vote. He was followed by the speaker of Parliament, Tsetska Tsacheva, a 58-year-old lawyer and member of Prime Minister Borisov's center-right party with 22 percent. For the first time, voting is compulsory for Bulgaria's 6.8 million voters. WHAT ARE THE STAKES? Borisov, whose party has trumped in all national elections in the last decade, says he will resign if Tsacheva loses the runoff, opening the way to an early parliamentary election. The coalition government's popularity has faded due to the slow pace of reforms to eliminate graft and overhaul the judicial system WHAT DOES RADEV WANT?  Radev, a former NATO fighter pilot who is a rookie in politics, has attracted many Bulgarians who are fed up with politicians they see as corrupt and distanced from the people. He has pledged to comply with Bulgaria's European obligations, if he is elected. But he also says ""being pro-European does not mean being anti-Russian"" and insists that sanctions on Moscow need to be lifted.   WHAT DOES TSACHEVA PROMISE TO DO?  If she becomes Bulgaria's first female president, Tsacheva is expected to continue her party's pro-Europe foreign policy. But unlike her party leader, Tsacheva is not very charismatic. She has tried to rally other right-wing parties behind her, urging them not to allow ""Bulgaria to return to the dark past"" of being under Russia's thumb.   WHY IT MATTERS The new Bulgarian president will face a possible rise in migrant inflows from neighboring Turkey and growing tensions between Russia and the West, but the post carried little real authority. A Radev victory, however, could trigger political instability and produce an early parliamentary election -- the country's third in five years. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Paul J. Richards/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  Political scientists will be analyzing the bases of Donald Trump's dramatic victory for a very long time. So far, the evidence points toward a toxic brew of economic and cultural anxiety, populism, racial resentment, sexism and authoritarianism, among other factors. But from a broader perspective, the search for specific explanations for Trump's support is probably misguided. An extraordinary campaign has produced a remarkably ordinary election outcome, primarily reflecting partisan patterns familiar from previous election cycles. As John Sides has already noted, the national election outcome was consistent with forecasts based on ""fundamental"" factors like incumbency and the state of the economy -- though he and I and many others imagined that it would not be, given the many remarkable features of this year's race, and of Trump's campaign in particular. By the conventional standards of high-minded democracy, many commentators believed that Trump's manifest unsuitability for the presidency should have doomed him at the polls. But millions of ordinary voters, employing their own less rarefied standards, viewed Trump as a strong leader who would ""say what he meant"" and ""get things done."" Most state election outcomes were also surprisingly consistent with past voting patterns. Here is the relationship between Trump's popular vote margin in each state on Tuesday (based on preliminary returns, with the heavily Democratic District of Columbia omitted in order to make the other results more legible) and Mitt Romney's margin in 2012:    Utah is a dramatic but not very surprising outlier, with unusually strong support for Romney (a Mormon) in 2012 and for independent candidate Evan McMullin (also a Mormon) in 2016. No other state saw a popular vote margin shift by more than 16 points -- a net shift of 8 percent of the electorate. The places in which Trump ran ahead of Romney included such famously white working-class states as West Virginia, Iowa and Ohio, but also Hawaii (Barack Obama's home state), Maine and Rhode Island. The average net shift (weighted by state population) amounted to just 1.2 percent of the electorate, and the correlation between 2012 and 2016 results (likewise weighted by population), even with Utah in the mix, is 0.93. It may be helpful to put these shifts in historical perspective by comparing them with similar shifts in previous election cycles. Elsewhere I have tracked continuity and change in presidential election outcomes from 1868 through 1996, noting that recent elections have been marked by ""a period of partisan stability and predictability unmatched since the end of the 19th century."" That period of unusual stability has continued through the first two decades of the 21st century. Here is the trend in ""partisan continuity,"" a measure of the extent to which each set of state-level election outcomes has reflected the partisan forces evident in the three preceding elections: The extent of partisan continuity evident in 2016 -- at the far right of the graph -- is slightly lower than in 2012, but well above the average value for the past century, and very much in line with typical values in the past several elections.    I have also tracked the magnitude of new national and local forces producing changing electoral patterns in each election year -- a combination of the shift in the national partisan tide (the absolute value of the intercept in a simple regression analysis) and the variation in the average magnitude of state deviations from that national shift (the standard error of the same simple regression analysis). Prominent peaks in 1912, 1932 and 1972 represent major shifts in American electoral patterns, at least in the short term, with a typical state moving by as much as 15 percentage points. In contrast, the 2016 value (4 percentage points) is quite low by historical standards -- and even lower than has been typical over the past 30 years:    The impression of partisan stability suggested by the state-level results for 2016 is generally echoed in national exit polls, which showed Clinton winning 89 percent of the vote among Democratic identifiers and Trump winning 90 percent among Republicans. These percentages precisely match those in 2008, the last time there was no incumbent president on the ballot. (The corresponding percentages in 2012 were only slightly higher, 92 percent and 93 percent.) To a good approximation, Trump won because the overwhelming majority of Republicans voted for the Republican candidate, undeterred by the qualms of party leaders and conservative intellectuals. Nonetheless, as usual, pundits are trotting out visions of realignment. Even before the election, Michael Lind proclaimed that ""the old political system is crumbling, and a new American political order is being born."" Jonathan Haidt called 2016 ""a global turning point ... the year that the battle between globalists and nationalists became the central axis of conflict"" in the United States and Europe, adding that ""the battle will grind on ... long after Donald Trump leaves the national stage, as the United States becomes a 'majority minority' country sometime between 2050 and 2060."" Perhaps. We won't know anytime soon, since major realignments of the party system usually take years or even decades to unfold. In the meantime, however, it would be a mistake to read too much into Trump's victory, remarkable as it was -- and remarkable as his presidency may well be. Christopher Achen and I have argued that in most democratic elections, ""the choice between the candidates is essentially a coin toss."" In 2012, the ""fundamentals"" predicted a close election and the Democrats won narrowly. In 2016, the ""fundamentals"" predicted a close election and the Republicans won narrowly. That's how coin tosses go. ""It is a blunder to expect elections to deliver more."" Larry M. Bartels is a political scientist at Vanderbilt University.

(Associated Press Photo/ Evan Vucci)  Last month, Jane Eisner received some troubling emails. ""Trump supporters HATE KIKES! HAIL TRUMP!"" read one of them. The others expressed thoughts that ring way too familiar to Jewish journalists who've taken a stand against Trump. For example: ""You would make a nice lampshade."" As she is very quick to note, Eisner isn't at the center of this election's anti-Semitic journo-backlash. ""I have suffered nowhere near some of my colleagues, who've really been on the firing line,"" she tells the Erik Wemple Blog. And that may just be the point. There are lots of media stories revolving around campaign 2016. We can thank CNN for many of them, including the drawbacks of placing political hacks on the payroll of prominent news outlets and of spending too much time airing Trump rallies. Fake news stories also have had a glorious run, as have the ethics of reporting on the FBI and the Justice Department; fact-checking organizations are entitled to a long post-election vacation; and journalism professors will be referring for decades to Election 2016 as a crucible of false equivalence. The media story of the 2016 campaign, however, is the anti-Semitic backlash against journalists critical of Donald Trump. Political hacks at cable networks, after all, aren't exactly a new thing; nor are fake news stories or overworked fact-checkers; and people have been griping about false equivalence before Donald Trump came along and invalidated all political comparisons. The horrific and voluminous anti-Semitic attacks against journalists writing about Trump, however, are new and very frightening. ""I myself have never experienced something like this,"" says Eisner, 60, whose resume includes more than two decades at the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""This"" is the subject of a recent exhaustive report by the Anti-Defamation League under the title, ""Anti-Semitic Targeting of Journalists During the 2016 Presidential Campaign."" The study focused on the playground for this rash of hatred -- Twitter, that is. Between August 2015 and July 2016, it found that 800 journalists were targeted in almost 20,000 anti-Semitic tweets. The top 10 targets got it the worst, receiving 83 percent of the Twitter-born anti-Semitism. As to the provenance of this madness, the ADL report chooses its words with precision: ""There is evidence that a considerable number of the anti-Semitic tweets targeting journalists originate with people identifying themselves as Trump supporters, 'conservatives' or extreme right-wing elements."" Nor is it a mystery why Trump supporters may feel they have license to dish out such abuse. The ADL denounced a recent Trump ad inveighing against global ""elites"" and using the faces of three prominent Jewish people, among others. ""Whether intentional or not, the images and rhetoric in this ad touch on subjects that anti-Semites have used for ages,"" ADL chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt said. ""This needs to stop."" As my colleague Dana Milbank argues, anti-Semitism has moved from an ""undertone"" of the Trump campaign to its ""melody."" The Forward took note of the story's dimensions back in January, when it posted a story about Trump having retweeted a tweet from the Twitter account @WhiteGenocideTM. Under the headline ""Donald Trump Retweets Creator of Pic Showing Bernie Sanders Sent to Gas Chamber,"" the piece inventories the hateful thoughts that had emanated from this account before Trump's retweet. ""It got nearly 350,000 page views, which for us is a real lot,"" says Eisner. The backlash from Trumpland, says Eisner, has complicated her job at the Forward, which was founded in 1897 as a Yiddish-language daily. ""We've really had to struggle to find people in our community who will put forward other points of view,"" she says, referring to pro-Trump perspectives. Neil Berro, a writer who ""worked in Jewish communal service throughout the country for many years,"" has chimed in with several pro-Trump opinion pieces, including one from September titled, ""Trump's Advisers May Be Thugs, but Hillary's Chill the Jewish Soul."" In that piece, he ripped Trump's challenger this way: ""Clinton would govern with ever-increasing attention to these uber leftwing noisemakers whose siren sound lures more mainstream Democrats into believing that there is no such thing as too much political correctness. If, along the way, certain minority groups no longer deemed central to continuing political power have to be brushed [aside] into the ashbin of history, so be it. Jews, are you listening?"" Contacted by the Erik Wemple Blog, Berro declined to address the anti-Semitic backlash from Trump backers on the record. Eisner has also resolved the Trump ""struggle"" by commissioning opinion pieces on issues relating to the race, as opposed to Trump-centric stuff. For example, the publication ran a piece by Noam Neusner, a former George W. Bush speechwriter, arguing that the Democrats have failed Jews. After explaining that Clinton is a bust, Neusner makes clear he's not advocating for her opponent: ""I recognize that by saying this, I may be accused of supporting the candidacy of Donald Trump. Not at all. I preferred all the other Republican candidates to Trump, and will not vote for Trump. Rather, I am merely arguing here that the candidacy of Clinton will undermine the purpose, spirit and ideology of the Democratic Party."" As a nonprofit, the Forward cannot endorse political candidates. Asked whether he'd sustained any abuse for his opinions, Neusner told the Erik Wemple Blog that ""A couple of people have tweeted at me. They appear to be Trump supporters. I'm not sure whether they're real or not."" He characterized the treatment as ""very minor,"" and contrasted his own case with journalists who've absorbed endless amounts of online taunts, insults and threats. Those folks are named on one of the grimmest top-ten lists ever assembled; it's part of the ADL report on this activity:     Now that we've reached Nov. 8, it's comforting to know that many core components of campaign 2016 are over. Trump shaming camera crews for allegedly failing to pan around to his crowds at rallies -- over. Cable news chyrons proclaiming ""NEW POLL RESULTS"" -- over, at least for a while. Hillary Clinton straining to practice retail politics -- over. Donald Trump lying about his alleged opposition to the Iraq war -- never over, but perhaps it'll pause. What about this social-media anti-Semitism that we hadn't before glimpsed? What about tweets like this one, directed at the New York Times's Jonathan Weisman?     The cessation of election activities, worries Eisner, won't mean a cessation of hatred. ""I don't think this is going away no matter what happens [on Election Day]. I think we're going to have to work very hard as a society to understand why people resort in their anger and resentment to doing the things they do.... The use of Holocaust imagery by the alt-right is at a level that I have not seen before,"" says Eisner, who has served as the Forward's editor in chief since 2008. ""And that's amplified through social media. We don't know who these people are."" Though Trump famously failed to denounce his apparent fans for spreading anti-Semitic thoughts and attacks, he also didn't ""orchestrate"" the activity, says Eisner. And that's crucial to understanding what's happening. Since ""it is a strange grassroots phenomenon... I don't think a particular decision by the voters is going to put this genie back in the bottle,"" says Eisner. Noah Rothman, assistant online editor at Commentary magazine, has written critically about Trump and has made the fight against tweeting anti-Semites a part of his routine. In a chat with the Erik Wemple Blog, Rothman -- whose father is Jewish and mother is Catholic and wasn't ""raised religious"" -- spoke of getting up every morning in the spring and finding 50 or 60 attackers on his Twitter timeline. ""Block, block, block until they're almost all gone,"" says Rothman. These days, the onslaught is more slight. ""There will be a day or two that goes by that I don't see anything,"" says Rothman. Does that qualify as progress?"

Here are the voices of some of those voters. ___ This election is a crossroads for mountain communities, said Doug Ratliff, a 67-year-old businessman in Richlands, an Appalachian town in rural southwestern Virginia, where the coal industry has collapsed and hopelessness is setting in.  ""We will slowly die. The population is moving out, there's no jobs, no future for the kids if Hillary Clinton is elected,"" said Ratliff. ""If Donald Trump is, we have a chance. And we're willing to work for it. But we've got to have help and change. And not the hope and change as Obama gave it."" Ratliff has hauled coal, taught school and now owns strip malls. He's angry at both Democrats and Republicans he says have forsaken rural, working-class America. He changed his voter registration from Republican to independent in protest. ___ Linda and Paul Crawford feel outnumbered in their corner of Virginia. They're Democrats, excited to vote for Hillary Clinton and surrounded by enthusiastic Trump supporters. It's been a hard year, said Linda Crawford, a 66-year-old former school teacher. She was concerned about relatives posting untrue information about Hillary Clinton on Facebook, so she chimed in to support her candidate. She was attacked with condemnation, personal attacks and vitriol. People are angry, scared about the future. They're taking this election more personally than she's ever seen. But a week ago, she went to a funeral and saw some of the same people. She was relieved that they hugged and comforted each other despite their political conflicts. She hopes that means the nation will do the same once the election is over.  ""We found out that people still love one another and are still good to each other,"" she said. ""This will pass, the election will pass, and our county will heal and move on."" Her husband, Paul, who is running for town council, believes the country has withstood worse divides (during the Vietnam War, he said) and found a way to mend. The lawn outside the Richlands Police Department where they cast their ballots is filled with dozens of Trump signs, with one Clinton sign in a corner. Both Crawfords come from a long line of coal miners, a group that has largely coalesced around Trump and his promise to fix their failing industry. But Paul Crawford, who has worked as a miner and at an automotive supply company, rejects Trump's overtures to the white working class. Throughout his career, he said, his life has improved under Democratic presidents. And he believes Trump appeals to desperate people's worst instincts to blame outsiders and believe in conspiracies. ___ There was no anguished, lesser-of-two-evils choice for Jackie Stephens, 69, a retiree from Ashburn. She called her Clinton choice ""easy-peasy.""  ""She has the experience, the intelligence. She was first lady, senator, secretary of state,"" she said. As for Trump: ""Words fail me."" A resident of Loudoun County, a quintessential swing county, she also voted for Democrat LuAnn Bennett in a closely watched House race against freshman Republican Barbara Comstock. Stephens said she was put off by Comstock's late move to repudiate Trump.  ""Comstock can't just change horses in the middle of the race,"" she said. ""It was 'I'm for him until it hurts me to be for him.'"" ____ G-H Qamar Baloch, a retired linguist from Ashburn, said it wasn't that long ago that Americans were greeted warmly in his native Pakistan. But now, he tells his son, a Marine Corps veteran, not to tell people he's an American when he travels there. U.S.-Pakistani relations, and foreign affairs generally, were on Baloch's mind Tuesday as he voted for Clinton.  ""She's very learned, very experienced,"" he said. He said he goes for qualifications, and Trump doesn't have any. He also questioned Trump's commitment, wondering whether he ""might be out sleeping with some ladies -- escorts"" if a crisis occurred in the middle of the night. Party politics weren't especially important to him. In a closely watched House race, he voted for Republican incumbent Barbara Comstock. ___ Burnadette Pierce, 60, a registered Democrat who voted for Clinton in Portsmouth, said she's particularly concerned about reducing gun violence and college debt. Pierce, who is black, acknowledged that there is some concern in the African-American community over Clinton's backing of stiff jail sentences in the 1990s, which affected many black men.  ""But I believe that she will do that which is good by the black people,"" Pierce said. ""She's going to try to keep the standards that President Obama created."" ___ Joseph Gatlin, 56, a Republican who moved to the U.S. from Israel 30 years ago, said he's voting for Trump because the nation needs a businessman.  ""I think that he has his flaws like everybody else. But it's a chance to bring the country back to what we need to be. Right now we're losing respect around the world,"" said Gatlin, who owns a flooring company. Immigration is the top priority because terrorists and ""all the haters of America"" are allowed to come in. He called Israel's border fences effective and said the U.S. should take similar measures. Gatlin called Clinton corrupt and the political system rigged. ""If Trump loses, and it's been proven that he loses fair and square, then he should call her and concede,"" he said. ""But right now I don't trust the system at all."" ___ Jean Montague, 48, voted for Clinton and brought along her 8-year-old son, Jaden Bryant.  ""He came to make sure I didn't vote for Trump,"" she joked. But actually, as a gay woman, she said, the decision was easy. A computer programmer and business owner who recently relocated to suburban Richmond from Texas, Montague said Trump ""made fun of a disabled reporter, and he makes fun of people he thinks are weaker.  ""If he's going to discriminate against people who are disabled or a different race, he's going to automatically disagree with my lifestyle."" ___ Tharish Harris got emotional after casting her ballot for Clinton in the Church Hill neighborhood of Richmond. The 36-year-old who teaches English in a public school said ""it's time for the glass ceiling to be broken for women.""  ""It's emotional to actually get to vote for a woman as president,"" Harris said. ""People have been throwing a lot of hate at her and I think it's unfair and unjust, but she's still there and she's going to win."" __ Judy Lee-Tiller, 64, voted on Richmond's west side. She's a registered Democrat and said her mind has been made up since Clinton became the nominee. ""There was no back and forth,"" she said. Also, it's a ""nice feeling"" having a female nominee, she said, comparing it to Obama's election as the first African-American president. ___ Joe Hudson, 49, an engineer and registered Republican from Virginia Beach, said he's voting for Trump because ""we're not taking care of our own people.""  ""We have our fingers in too many baskets. We're trying to be too involved in world politics. And our country is imploding from within,"" he said. Still, Hudson said he doubts Trump will win, and said he should concede if he loses.  ""The votes are the votes,"" he said. ""Whoever wins, they win. And then people need to start working together. It doesn't matter who's in charge. There needs to be less corruption and less drama. It's like a big soap opera. I'm embarrassed for both parties."" ___ Mohamed Eltayeb, 45, a Muslim cab driver in Virginia Beach, said Clinton got his vote because ""she can do a lot for the country and for the schools and for health care.""  ""I don't know a lot about Trump. He's just a businessman. I never hear him talking about the economy or education. He has no plan."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
