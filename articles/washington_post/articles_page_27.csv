Ifill died Monday at 61 after a yearlong battle with cancer. Mrs. Obama did not speak at the service, but several journalists and political figures offered reflections.  ""We didn't look like other anchor pairs -- and we loved that,"" said Judy Woodruff, half of the history-making team that became the first female co-anchors of a major news broadcast in 2013. The two co-hosted PBS' ""NewsHour."" Woodruff added that Ifill is needed ""more than ever.""  ""Never have we faced tougher challenges, and no one would've risen to them better,"" she added. Ifill, she added, will ""be our compass."" Former Attorney General Eric Holder read a letter from President Barack Obama, who was in Peru. Holder likened Ifill to ""a comet"" and challenged the colleagues she leaves behind to honor her legacy with their work by holding those in power accountable.  ""Will you cower? Will you normalize that which is anything but?"" Holder asked in a veiled reference to the incoming administration of Donald Trump. The service, held at the historic Metropolitan A.M.E. Church -- where Ifill was a longtime member -- was also a grand display of her faith and roots as the daughter of Caribbean immigrants whose father was a leader of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Her pastor of many years, Bishop James L. Davis, recalled Ifill as ""brilliance cloaked in humility."" A former reporter for The New York Times and The Washington Post, Ifill transitioned to television in the 1990s, covering politics and Congress for NBC News. She moved to PBS in 1999 as host of ""Washington Week"" and also worked for ""NewsHour."" She moderated vice presidential debates in 2004 and 2008. John Dickerson, host of CBS' ""Face the Nation"" who joined Ifill as a regular panelist on ""Washington Week,"" said Ifill ""wore her grace like a garment,"" but added her infectious laugh came with a withering scowl.  ""I'm not going to say it in church, but there's a very specific word for what Gwen could detect,"" Dickerson said. The pews were filled with journalists, politicians, her mentees, family and friends, including civil rights attorney Vernon Jordan, interim Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile, White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, veteran journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault, New York Times columnist David Brooks, former CNN anchor Bernard Shaw, Donald Trump surrogate Omarosa Manigault, and NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Sherrilynn Ifill, the journalist's younger cousin.  ""She was the shining star in our family,"" Sherrilynn Ifill said of Gwen. ""She was the most American of success stories. Her life and her work made this country better. She did the hard work for us for so long ... It's time to take her example and do what she did."" Ifill took a leave from ""NewsHour"" last spring for health reasons, but kept the details of her illness private. ___ Errin Haines Whack covers urban affairs for The Associated Press.

" White nationalists from around the country gathered Saturday in downtown Washington to bask in Donald Trump's victory and celebrate what many proclaimed as a coming-out moment in their mission to turn back multiculturalism and eventually create a whites-only ""ethno-state"" in North America. ""There's an energy in this city that I've never felt before,"" said Gerald Martin, 64, a retired teacher from Dallas who was one of nearly 275 attendees of the annual conference put on by the National Policy Institute, whose president, Richard Spencer, coined the term ""alt-right' and is vocal proponent of what Spencer refers to as ""white identity."" ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning,"" said Martin triumphantly amid the water goblets and white table clothes at the Ronald Reagan Building as he waited for Spencer to take the stage. ""And we just napalmed the [expletive] out of Hillary Clinton and everyone who supports her."" He and others welcomed media to the gathering and hailed what they called the ""mainstreaming"" of ideas that only were only recently confined to the shadows of the Internet. But they met fierce resistance during their two-day gathering, with protesters disrupting an NPI dinner Friday and crowding the pavement outside the conference Saturday.  ""NPI -- Today's KKK,"" read one sign in the crowd of about 200 people that security guards kept from entering the Reagan Building as police blocked 14th Street NW to traffic. Half of the crowd chanted ""We say no to racist hate!"" The other half responded, ""We don't want a white state!"" A few had red bandannas or black masks covering the lower half of their faces.     About 200 people protested a gathering of white nationalists sponsored by the National Policy Institute at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center on Nov. 19 in downtown Washington. (Facebook/Tauhid Chappell)   ""We have to resist the idea that fascism and a white supremacy organization can be normalized,"" said Perry King, 61, a District resident and psychotherapist. ""We can't let them be mainstream. That's what happened with the Nazis. We have to play whack-a-mole now and not let them become 'normal.' "" Inside the conference room, attendees dismissed the protesters as ""bullies"" and claimed the momentum in a culture-war struggle for control of a nation that they believe, in Martin's words, is ""rapidly becoming a Third World country."" Most in the overwhelmingly male gathering wore dark suits, many with the triangle lapel pin of a California-based European identity group. One man was dressed in camouflage, another wore a pony tail and an opera cloak. Dozens of them also wore what's known as ""fashy"" (as in fascist) haircuts -- a hipster look that features shaved sides with the hair on top swept across. A blond teenage girl wore a Make America Great Again cap. When Spencer asked for attendees younger than 40 to stand up, at least half in the room rose. ""The alt-right is a youth movement,"" said Martin. ""They're really going for it, maybe because they've never had a victory like this. All they've ever heard is 'white guilt' and, lately, 'white privilege.' "" Well more than a dozen journalists -- including several from non-U. S. publications -- reported on an afternoon news conference, where Spencer announced a number of goals the institute will push for in the coming year. Chief among them: a 50-year ban on all immigration (although Spencer suggested some exceptions should be made for Europeans).   In the wake of Trump's win, attendance more than doubled from last year's Washington gathering of the group, which the Southern Poverty Law Center places in the vanguard of ""academic racism."" The Institute's core belief, according to the SPLC, ""is that 'white identity' is under attack by multicultural forces using 'political correctness' and 'social justice' to undermine white people and 'their' civilization.""   Chairman of the National Policy Institute, Richard Spencer answers questions from the media at the annual conference put on by the National Policy Institute. Spencer coined the term ""alt-right"" and is a vocal proponent of what he refers to as ""white identity."" (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)  Attendees greeted each other -- some had been to previous NPI meetings here and in Europe -- with talk of countering ""thought terrorism"" and promoting ""Anglo-Saxon ethno-theology."" They exalted at the recent pronouncements from Trump Tower, particularly the nomination of officials whose views they said aligned with their own: retired general Michael Flynn as National Security adviser, former Breitbart News chairman Stephen K. Bannon as White House chief strategist and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general. ""Jeff Sessions being in charge of enforcing civil rights laws makes me want to sing,"" said one participant from Virginia, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Maybe the overwhelming sentiment was surprise. Few in the alt-right expected 2016 to end with their fringe movement becoming a household term and finding sympathy in the highest reaches of government. ""There's been an awakening,"" Spencer said in his opening remarks. One speaker, British anti-immigration activist Peter Brimelow, noted that although Trump doesn't identify as a white nationalist or a member of the alt-right, his campaign addressed two issues -- immigration and political correctness -- that are hugely important to them. ""With those issues, he slaughtered his way to the presidency,"" he said. ""It's like nothing I've ever seen."" Trump's biggest contribution to white nationalism may have been prevailing despite being associated with alt-right thinking, according to on NPI attendee, a student at New Jersey's Kean University who asked not to be identified so his friends wouldn't learn of his racial beliefs. ""The media called him a bigot, a racist, all the leftist smears and he still won,"" said this student. ""That means they are losing their moral grip on the narrative.."" Like many at the conference, this student acknowledged that he would like to live in a white enclave that mostly excluded minorities (although he applauded Japan's approach of letting a limited number of Filipino workers in as nurses and laborers). When pressed to explain how that mass segregation could occur without violence, he said many of those of details would have be worked out. ""This is not an empirical science,"" he said. Organizations that monitor hate groups say they have seen an uptick in activity and interest in supremacist sentiment during the campaign, and in the weeks since Trump's surprise win. ""Whether it's the suit-and-tie Nazis or their blob of supporters online, the bottom line is they feel like this is their time to strike,"" said Oren Segal, Director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. Measuring the depth of support is difficult in the Internet era, Segal said. Chapters and membership have been replaced by loose affiliations online, with supporters able to ""act"" on their beliefs simply by retweeting a racist meme or harassing a journalist. ""Most of the alt-right ideology is not really presented on the ground,"" he said. ""I'm troubled that any of them would ever feel in any way emboldened."" Oren sees the key moments coming in the months and years ahead, as the groups and their followers are inevitably disappointed. ""They are still very much on the fringe,"" he said. ""How are they going to react when their ambitions are not fulfilled?""  Staff writer Katherine Shaver contributed to this story. "

A spokeswoman for Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said Wednesday she'll sign legislation that supporters say ends a 5.75 percent tax that hurts women and hits working families the hardest.  But before it takes effect, the District needs to find more than $3 million a year to make up for the lost tax revenue in its $13 billion annual budget.  The next budget takes effect October 2017, meaning consumers must spend at least another year of paying taxes on diapers -- both for babies and incontinent adults -- and menstrual products.  [The sudden controversy around the cost of tampons]  An official with the D.C. Diaper Bank estimates lifting the sales tax will help low-income families purchase as many as a dozen additional diapers a month.  Opponents of taxes on feminine hygiene products note that in the District and elsewhere Viagra is tax-exempt as a medically necessary product.  ""Women, babies, and persons with disabilities who need these products should not be taxed for natural bodily functions,"" said Council member Anita Bonds (D-At Large), who authored the legislation.  Three states -- Illinois, Connecticut and New York -- repealed tampon taxes this year, joining five other states including Maryland. Another six states don't tax diapers.   California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) rejected legislation that would erase taxes for both diapers and menstrual products, and a similar bill failed this year in Virginia.  "

THE NUMBERS: Weekly applications for jobless benefits fell 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, dropped to 253,500. The number of people receiving benefits fell 66,000 to 1.98 million, the fewest in more than 16 years. THE TAKEAWAY: Applications are a proxy for layoffs, and have remained below 300,000 for 89 straight weeks. That's the longest streak since 1970. All those figures indicate that job cuts are very low. Businesses are hungry for workers and are reluctant to let go of any that they have. Hiring is typically healthy in such cases.  ""Clearly the latest news ... sent an upbeat signal about the labor market,"" Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan, said. Some of the drop may reflect last week's Veterans' Day holiday, Silver said. The government sometimes has difficulty seasonally adjusting for the holiday, Silver said, meaning that applications could bounce back up next week. Companies have slowed their hiring from last year but are adding jobs quickly enough to lower the unemployment rate over time. The economy gained 161,000 jobs in October and the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent. KEY DRIVERS: The economy is showing signs of acceleration after sluggish growth earlier this year. Growth was just 1.1 percent in the first half of 2016, but rose to a 2.9 percent pace in the July-September quarter. Americans ramped up their shopping in the past two months and a separate report Thursday showed that home construction soared in October. Those trends should boost growth in the final three months of the year to roughly a 2.5 percent annual pace. Still, growth will likely come in below 2 percent for the full year.

The Labor Department says that applications for unemployment aid dropped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 last week. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell to 253,500.

Outside the human rights activist's bedroom window, a Mexican marine in a black mask and helmet trained a rifle on him. ""Drop the phone or I'll shoot,"" he said. The marines blindfolded him, bound him and took him with four relatives and friends to a dimly lit, windowless warehouse. Then hours of torture began, Soni says -- beatings, electric shocks, asphyxiation, sexual abuse. He heard his teenage nephew scream as they applied electric shocks to the boy's ribs. Soni's tormenter said, ""This is going to make you not want to defend rights anymore."" _____ In the face of strong international condemnation, Mexico says it is taking steps to stop the use of torture by its security forces. After the United States withheld $5 million on account of Mexico's human rights record, the U.S. State Department in September recommended to Congress that full funding be restored. The nearly $2.5 billion Merida Initiative pays to equip and train Mexican security forces and support justice system reforms. However, there is still widespread impunity around the use of torture by security forces. From December 2006 through October 2014, the Attorney General's Office registered 4,055 complaints of torture, nearly one-third of them against the military. Yet over almost the same period, only 13 police and soldiers were sentenced for torture. Nobody has been charged in Soni's case. Also, one in five reports on torture cases filed by Mexico's National Human Rights Commission between 1994 to 2014 were against marines, according to the nonprofit Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights. But none of those sentenced over roughly the past decade were marines. The marines and the defense department did not respond to requests for an interview. Soni had far more resources than most victims of torture. He had a politically active family and connections in the human rights world. In the late 1990s, he worked as an international human rights observer for the United Nations in Guatemala. When he returned to Mexico, he continued to work in the indigenous communities of the Huasteca region. November 9, 2013, was not the first time marines visited his home in central Mexico's San Luis Potosi state, a lush landscape of sugarcane fields, rolling hills and waterfalls. Almost five months earlier, on June 22, 2013, Soni was driving home from teaching in the early afternoon when his sister called to tell him to stay away; marines and federal police were at the house. That day they grabbed Luis Enrique Biu Gonzalez, Soni's gardener, who also lived at his home. They beat him and asphyxiated him with a plastic bag, Biu says. A marine pointed a pistol at his head, asked if he was gay and threatened sexual violence, all the time demanding to know where Soni was. The marines took Soni's computers, which held records of human rights cases he documented. They returned in the middle of the night. With the house empty, they grabbed whatever they had not carried off in the first raid. Soni does not know exactly why the marines targeted him. It could have been the human rights complaints he helped people file against them and other security forces in the area. Or somebody with influence might have perceived him as a political threat. Soon after the June raid, Soni sought advice from his contacts at the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. They told him to get help from the Mexican government's protection program. Soni was enrolled in the program as of June 26, 2013, government records show. He had assurances from the Attorney General's Office there would be no more trouble. The government programmed an emergency ""panic"" number into his cell phone.  ""It gave me some peace of mind,"" he recalls thinking. On the morning he was taken, Soni was trying to find the panic number. It was too late. ______________ Even in its own assessment, the U.S. State Department notes that ""there continue to be serious, ongoing challenges in Mexico, including reports of law enforcement and military involvement in forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, the reported use of torture, impunity and violence and threats against journalists and human rights defenders."" In its recommendation to restore funding, the State Department cites several measures taken by the government, but Soni's case suggests they do not go far enough: -- The U.S. mentions the Mexican government's program for protecting human rights defenders and journalists, known colloquially as ""the mechanism."" But Soni was enrolled in that program five months before the marines took him anyway. -- The U.S. cites the autonomous National Human Rights Commission, which investigates and reports on human rights abuses. That body only issued its report on Soni's case in late September, nearly three years later. It concluded there was mistreatment, but not torture, without making any reference to the hours the victims spent in the warehouse. The victims' lawyers are now litigating those omissions. -- The U.S. points to a new law against torture that passed the Mexican Senate in April and still needs to pass the lower chamber. But even though torture was already illegal in Mexico last year, the human rights commission still received 628 complaints of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and 49 of torture by government officials. -- The U.S. pays special attention to a more transparent justice system Mexico has implemented in all 32 states and at the federal level. But a study released by two prominent Mexican think tanks in October found that even when injuries caused by abuse were documented, judges in one state did not order investigations or throw out evidence. The U.S. Embassy offered comment in a statement.  ""Mexico has launched an ambitious effort to modernize and reform its law enforcement and justice system,"" the statement said, noting that the recommendation was based on specific criteria established by Congress. ""We are committed to supporting Mexico's own efforts to increase respect for human rights."" Mexico's Interior Department deputy secretary for human rights, Roberto Campa, said eradicating the use of torture is a top human rights priority for the government, and he expects to see a significant increase in sentences against those responsible. He also noted that under Mexico's new justice system, evidence obtained through torture is thrown out.  ""For many years there were police forces that considered torture as an investigative method,"" he said. At times through tears, Soni and the others recounted what happened to them in the garden of his home, now surrounded by a tall fence and numerous surveillance cameras paid for by the government. As the marines led Soni away, he asked to pause before a wooden figure of Jesus outside his front door. Steered toward its base, Soni knelt, kissed its feet and prayed: ""Lord, only you know where they are taking me. Help me return well."" Then a marine shouted, ""Enough already, bastard!"" and dragged him to his feet by a handful of his long hair. Later, as marines drove him to the warehouse, Soni told them he was in the protection program. ""I have government protection,"" Soni said to his captors. ""You're making a mistake.""  ""Yes, you're very influential, you son of a bitch,"" came the response. In the warehouse, they were forced to kneel on the concrete floor, he recalls. When their blindfolds were removed, they saw people dressed in black. One took their photographs with a tablet computer and blindfolded them again. The marines rubbed a gel on their hands and told the men to touch some baggies and metal objects -- apparently setting them up to have their fingerprints on weapons and drugs. When the men resisted, they were punched and kicked. Biu, who was also taken, recalls the Marines giving them electric shocks, especially when they got to Soni.  ""Now we're going to give it to fatty to see if he can take it,"" one marine said in reference to Soni.  ""No more! No more!"" Biu heard him scream. ""Tell the truth,"" the marine shouted back. They held the probes near Biu's ear so he could hear the humming current. Soni says the marines beat him, gave him electrical shocks and did things he does not want published.  ""Everything, everything,"" he says. ____________ There has been no justice for Soni -- and many others. In April, a video circulated that showed soldiers and federal police torturing a young woman. In it, a female military police officer yanks on the woman's hair and pokes a rifle barrel against her head. A female federal police officer also pulls a clear plastic bag over the woman's head and holds it until she nearly passes out. It led to an unprecedented public apology from Mexico's defense secretary, but the victim remains in prison on weapons charges. Soni and the others were also held on weapons and drug charges. They spent more than a year in prison in the western state of Nayarit without trial until a judge in March 2015 threw out the case. From the day of their arrest through the day the judge finally ordered the charges be dropped and signed their release, the men never once saw the judge. Soni hopes that this will change under Mexico's new justice system, where both sides will have to present arguments and evidence in open court. His case is now being handled by a special unit created a year ago to investigate torture. All the men bear scars from the experience, and some prefer not to speak about the details of their torture. Soni's older nephew, Evanibaldo Larraga Galvan, still has a lump on his neck where a marine grabbed and choked him that morning. Luis Edgardo Charnichart Ortega, a teacher and childhood friend of Soni's who was sleeping over that night, asks, ""Is there even sufficient punishment to pay for all the damage done?"" Charnichart has struggled to work since his release.  ""My mind, the psychologists say, they still have it,"" he recounts. ""After they take you, nothing of you can remain. That is their objective, make you disappear, plant death inside you and leave it to consume you until the end of your days."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Federal police arrested Sergio Cabral in a morning raid that also snared several others connected to former governor's 2007-2014 administration. Prosecutors said Cabral received hundreds of thousands of dollars a month from several companies in exchange for help getting building contracts that ranged from projects in slums to the refurbishment of Rio's iconic Maracana Stadium. In total, Cabral received tens of millions of dollars in a scheme that included laundering money via the writing of fake contracts and buying luxury goods, according to investigators.  ""This case shows the overwhelming effects of corruption,"" said Athayde Ribeiro Costa, a lead prosecutor in the case, during a press conference. ""Society suffers greatly from it."" Calls to Cabral's lawyer were not immediately returned. Cabral is the latest top politician to be arrested in a massive kickback scheme connected to the state oil company Petrobras. Prosecutors allege that more than $2 billion in bribes were paid in exchange for building contracts and favorable terms over a decade. Dozens of politicians and top businessmen have been charged in the scheme. Several have been jailed. Long before the so-called ""Car Wash"" investigation was launched a few years ago, Cabral was repeatedly accused of wrongdoing. In 2014, he resigned after large street protests in a movement that cariocas, as Rio residents are known, called ""Occupy Cabral."" Detractors accused him of overseeing shady construction deals in Rio, of using state helicopters for personal trips and of allowing military police to use brutal tactics. Then-vice Gov. Luiz Fernando Pezao took over, and later was re-elected. Today Pezao and the state are facing a major fiscal crisis that has kept thousands of public employees from being paid.

That's the 2010 legislation that increased regulations on the financial system in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Yellen tells Congress' Joint Economic Committee that after the country lived through a ""devastating financial crisis,"" there was a need to put into place safeguards that would make the financial system safer. She says, ""I would not want to see the clock turned back on all the improvements we have made."" During the campaign, President-elect Donald Trump was highly critical of the Dodd-Frank law, arguing that it imposed too many burdens on the nation's financial system and was making it harder for people to get credit. Republicans in Congress have been trying for a number of years to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with a less stringent regulatory regime. ___ 10:40 a.m. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen indicates in testimony before Congress Thursday that the central bank remains on track to boost interest rates. She tells the Joint Economic Committee that the reports that have come out since the Fed met in early November show the economy is ""making good progress"" toward the goals the Fed has said it wanted to see before it raised rates again. She agrees that there had been significant moves in the markets since the election of Republican Donald Trump as president, including a rise in long-term bond yields. She says she interprets that as an expectation among investors that the federal government's deficit could increase based on Trump's budget and tax plans. Yellen says the Fed does not know ""what is going to happen"" when Trump and a new Congress take office next year. But she says the central bank will take into account decisions by Congress and the administration in implementing its interest-rate policies. ___ 10:35 a.m. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen says she has no plans of stepping down as head of the central bank before her term as chair is up at the end of January 2018. Asked about that possibility, she tells the congressional Joint Economic Committee that ""it is fully my intention"" to serve out her term. She says she could not imagine any circumstances that would cause her to leave early. There had been speculation that Yellen might decide to step down following the election of Republican Donald Trump, who was openly critical of Yellen during the campaign. Trump charged that Yellen was too political and was keeping interest rates low not to help the economy but to help Democrats retain control of the White House. ___ 10:10 a.m. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is delivering remarks before the Joint Economic Committee, made up of lawmakers from the House and Senate. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, praises Yellen for her ""steady hand"" in helping to lift the economy out of a deep recession. Maloney says that it is her hope that the Fed would remain insulated from political attacks. In prepared remarks, Yellen sketches a picture of an improving U.S. economy and says ""the case for an increase"" in interest rates has strengthened. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates when it meets in mid-December. She notes that the job market has made further improvement this year and that inflation, while still below the Fed's 2 percent target, has started to pick up. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

In a speech to the general assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees on Tuesday, Bach appeared determined to counter the negative public perception surrounding the Olympic movement following a turbulent year of doping crises, the troubled buildup to Rio and continuing concerns over the costs of hosting the games. Bach cited media headlines in the months ahead of the Rio Games about security, water quality, the Zika virus and allegations of state-sponsored doping in Russia. Citing Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election last week, Bach said the Rio Games were a ""case study"" in the difference ""between published opinion and public opinion"" and ""between perception and reality."" Bach said the Rio Games were a great success, citing record global television viewership and social media interest, though he made no mention of the empty seats and organizational glitches that also affected the event. Bach said the success of the games was a ""miracle"" in light of the severe recession and political turmoil that Brazil has been going through. He also went to great lengths to defend the International Olympic Committee's decision not to impose a total ban on Russia from the games, saying he has received support from dozens of world leaders on the issue. The World Anti-Doping Agency had called for the complete ban following a report by investigator Richard McLaren that detailed systematic, state-assisted doping in Russia. The IOC instead allowed international sports federations to decide which Russian athletes could compete. Bach said he has met with many heads of state and government since the games and all backed the IOC's position.  ""They appreciated and acknowledged we did not take a political decision but we took a decision that took in the interest of sport and respected justice for clean athletes and protecting the clean athletes worldwide,"" he said. ""To see this acknowledgement and this appreciation by so many political leaders was a confirmation of our decision and is a great encouragement for all of us."" McLaren's final report is due out next month and will focus on allegations of Russian doping and manipulation of samples at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi. Two IOC commissions are also looking into the allegations, which could lead to calls for sanctions on Russia for the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Bach said once the investigations and hearings are completed, the IOC will take ""the necessary measures and all the sanctions because if only part of this would be true, it would be an unprecedented attack on the integrity on the Olympic Games and on the Olympic competitions."" On a separate issue, Bach said no cities would have come forward as candidates to host the 2024 Summer Games had the IOC not passed his ""Olympic Agenda 2020"" project, which aims to reduce the cost of hosting the games and insists on maximum use of existing and temporary facilities. Several cities pulled out of bidding for the 2022 Winter Games over financial and political concerns. Last month, Rome withdrew from the 2024 race because of opposition from the city's new mayor. That decision leaves Los Angeles, Paris and Budapest, Hungary, as candidates.  ""Without 'Olympic Agenda 2020,' we would have had zero candidates,"" Bach said. ""There would have been none. All of the candidates who you will see now and the others who were in the race or considering in the race, they can confirm this to you. They told us this."" Bach also said that high-ranking Olympic official Patrick Hickey, who was arrested during the Rio Games on ticket scalping charges, deserves the ""presumption of innocence"" pending the resolution of his case. Hickey, who is not permitted to leave Brazil, has temporarily stepped down as a member of the IOC executive board and president of the European Olympic Committees. Bach said Hickey's arrest shows Olympic officials are ""not immune"" and must obey the laws and rules in other countries.  ""What was in the past something that just concerned us in an organization is now concerning the rules and the laws of a country,"" Bach said. ""These laws of the country we have to respect, and each and every one of you has to take them into consideration when acting accordingly."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Steve Helber/AP)  The night that Donald Trump was elected president, I got very little sleep. Surely the wine I sipped as a wave of red swept from east to west across that horrible, televised electoral map didn't help. But I managed to have one vivid dream. In it, I'm standing on a stage in a stadium full of fellow Christians. And I'm telling them that they voted for the wrong candidate, and that Trump's presidency will prove to be a grave mistake. Wednesday greeted me as it did half the voting population, with waves of grief. But since then, the grief has turned into a more complex emotion -- something like soul abandonment. After an election in which 81 percent of my white coreligionists supported Trump, the faith that has been my home for 20 years seems foreign, even hostile. In a story fit for testimony, I gave my life to Christ at age 13, at the end of a church service fervent with prayer and worship. I quickly became involved in a youth group, going on trips to serve orphans and attending annual prayer rallies outside my high school. Behind much of it was an earnestness bordering on naivete, I see now. But I also see, with gratitude, the way that evangelicalism exposed me to authentic kindness, service and awe. It taught me that love of God and neighbor was a force in the world and, indeed, could heal its deep brokenness. These early gifts stayed with me into adulthood, when I staunchly defended the evangelical label, despite its quirks and excesses, in my professional and personal life. To secular friends, I noted that today's efforts to rescue sex trafficking victims and shelter refugees are largely led by evangelical organizations. To mainline Protestants, I noted that the most dynamic growth in the global church is among Christians whom they would likely consider way too concerned about hell. To myself, I said that evangelical was about theology, not politics, and at Christianity Today, we always transcended political divides to root the gospel in the local church and not a voting bloc. The Religious Right didn't mean anything to me and other young evangelicals; it was a relic of railing radio preachers and big-haired moral scandals. Our forebears had surely learned from the mistakes of the 1980s. An older, wiser evangelical movement knew not to throw their lot in with political leaders who would squeeze from the church a drop of a vote before dropping it once it was no longer useful.   [The deep disgust for Hillary Clinton that drives so many evangelicals to support Trump]   This election, I didn't personally know any evangelicals who were vocally supporting Trump. Many of us were troubled by the other candidate, to be sure. But, as so many wise evangelical leaders had noted, electing Trump would seriously harm our already fragile democracy and undo the church's witness, and I believed the white evangelical community would take heed. On Wednesday, I woke up to an evangelical family I no longer resembled. Evangelical at its root means evangel or ""good news."" We proclaim to follow a man who chose to affiliate himself with the poor and dispossessed, who called the political and religious leaders of his day to account, who saw and loved people whom others had discarded. To be sure, no political leader can or should try to enact the good news in policy. Christians of good conscience have and will continue to elect leaders of different ideologies, then go about the daily task of loving their neighbors. But when evangelical starts to sound like very bad news for very many Americans, it has drifted far from its roots. A prophetic consensus has emerged that U.S. evangelicalism is irreducibly linked with white privilege. Many Christian leaders of color line up with their white peers in theology, yet won't claim the label for white evangelicals failing to provide a robust response to violence against racial minorities. That white evangelicals broke sharply from Christians of color in supporting a candidate who was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan will undo generations of efforts to heal the racial injustice tearing apart the church and our country. Meanwhile, Muslims now wonder if the liberties that white evangelicals are eager to protect by electing Trump will extend to their own worshiping communities. Women who have been sexually assaulted wonder if white evangelicals' support of Trump means their trauma will be minimized in Christian communities. Immigrants who have been embraced by churches wonder if said churches will no longer shelter them after threat of deportation. Trump's presidency poses a unique threat to the vulnerable -- the very communities the church is called to stand beside. It's a very evangelical thing to talk about what is in one's heart. So: My heart beats even stronger with the faith that I embraced as a teenager. When it comes to the Bible and Jesus and evangelism and service, the 81 percent and I share the same DNA. Although recently I have wished it were otherwise, evangelicals are my people. But this time, this election, I can't defend my people. I barely recognize them. It's like the way you love your offbeat uncle -- the one who rambles at Thanksgiving dinner about threats to his freedoms and political correctness run amok. You understand why he feels the way he does. You sympathize with him on many points. But when he starts in with racial slurs and sexist jokes and complaints about ""illegals,"" at some point you have to get up and leave the table. Want more stories about faith?
