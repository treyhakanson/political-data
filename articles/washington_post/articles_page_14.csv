Seth Moulton | Time for new leadership       The Democratic Party is in its worst governing position in a generation. Next year we will control just 31 state legislative chambers and 15 governorships. We lost the House of Representatives in 2010, the Senate in 2014, and now the presidency. Clearly the American people are not satisfied with the vision and leadership our party is offering. It's time to make some serious changes to both. Democrats believe America is at its best when it is an open and inclusive society where hard work pays off, we look out for one another, and equal rights are extended to all. Yet for many Americans, this simply isn't enough. Our economic message has been one of fairness, but worrying about fairness is a luxury reserved for those who already have opportunity. Opportunity is the animating idea of America: You can be anything if you are willing to work for it. We all yearn for the opportunity to pursue our dreams, and to succeed or fail on our own merit and hard work. Yet we know this is not today's reality. Economic mobility is at an all-time low, and what little exists is concentrated on the coasts. While our hottest start-ups lead the world in innovation, our small businesses get hit with higher tax rates than the world's biggest corporations. Many Americans in communities devastated by the recession and left out of the recovery feel so completely ignored by the party of working people that they embraced as their champion a man who rides in a golden elevator. Donald Trump's policies are terrible for most of the people who voted for him, but his call for change, however poorly defined, was enough to get people to try something new. Rather than following Trump backward to an old economy (think coal mines and isolationism), Democrats have the chance to show how to make the 21st-century economy available to all. That's a vision we can all get behind.  As a platoon commander in the Marines, I was responsible for everything that my troops did or failed to do. That's what it means to be a leader. We failed in this election, badly, and so far no one in our party is taking responsibility for it, let alone showing a new path forward. Our leadership triumvirate in the House of Representatives has remained unchanged since 2003, when the young people who just voted in their first election were 5 years old. It is hard to imagine this group being the source of the transformational ideas that will carry our party and our country into the age of self-driving cars and artificial intelligence. It is time for those who will live with the consequences of our policies for the next 50 years to have a hand in shaping them. It is time for the generation that fought in Iraq and Afghanistan to replace the generation that sent us there. It is time for a new generation of leadership, and for the Democratic Party, it can't come soon enough.  The writer represents Massachusetts's 6th District in the House of Representatives.  Julian Castro | It's no time to panic     The Democratic Party has a bright future. Without question, the election was deeply disappointing. And yet Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, Democrats picked up seats in the House and Senate, and now we have the chance to learn from what happened and regroup ahead of important races in 2018 and 2020. Also, Donald Trump and his Republican-controlled Congress will soon go to work on the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Social Security. How well do you think that's going to pan out? Very soon, Americans will be looking for an antidote. So it's no time to panic. Instead, Democrats need to listen, we need to connect, we need to fight, and we need to rally Americans behind a strong vision for prosperity in the 21st century. I've never had the pleasure of meeting 61-year-old Diane Maus of upstate New York. But her recent explanation to The Post about why she voted for Trump struck me.  ""My vote was my only way to say: I am here and I count,"" Maus said. Our No. 1 priority should be to reach out to folks like Maus. And when we do, we should focus on opportunity first. Whether you live in small-town Ohio, West Philadelphia or East Los Angeles, your first concern is how to provide for yourself and your family. So we have to offer a compelling blueprint of how America can create more jobs, provide the chance to get ahead and ensure that nobody is left behind. We need to make sure all folks understand that they count to us and that they are part of our vision for the future.  Democrats must also be ready to fight. Yes, we should remain open-minded. But I'm betting that congressional Republicans will work like crazy to help their usual crowd of corporate donors and lobby interests instead of the middle class and working poor. They are about to take us backward. The future will belong to those who stand up now to the use of power to benefit special interests.  Finally, Democrats have to work to forge a shared American identity. By dealing with our differences instead of ignoring them, we can build bridges. African Americans are much more likely to be abused at the hands of law enforcement. We shouldn't shy away from tackling that -- and everyone will benefit if we can improve the criminal-justice system. The white working class in the Rust Belt needs economic development -- and so do people of color in urban neighborhoods and tribal lands. As members of a diverse party, Democrats are infinitely better positioned to help Americans find common ground. If we can do that, we can build up a party that succeeds because America succeeds. Americans will cast their vote for that kind of future in any year on the calendar, in every corner of our Union.

Cory Booker | An epic gut check     In the 1960s, my parents encountered the illegal practice of racial real-estate steering then rampant in New Jersey suburbs. They turned to black and white activists at the Fair Housing Council of Northern New Jersey, led by a woman named Lee Porter, who eventually enabled my family to buy the house I grew up in. This month, Porter celebrates her 90th birthday. She is still the head of the Fair Housing Council, now working to help Muslim families and same-sex couples facing housing discrimination. Americans have always stood up in the face of unimaginable odds and tragic circumstances not of their own making. Humble heroes -- despite election outcomes, Supreme Court decisions or strong currents of hate -- have never given up, curled up or shut up in the fight for justice, equality and expansive opportunity. They fought on. We must honor this tradition.  I don't know what kind of president Donald Trump will be, but I know that as a candidate he degraded and demeaned Americans, threatened our rights and attacked our privileges of citizenship. He will have a disastrous presidency if he governs the way he campaigned. His early appointments are a tremendously discouraging sign of what's to come. Yet I hold on to the hope that the president-elect will cease the Twitter troll-like toxicity and unify our country with the type of magnanimity and statesmanship our nation deserves from its leader. If he does and wants to advance policies consistent with our progressive priorities, the Democratic Party should seek common ground. But should he not change, should he continue to assault human dignity, human rights, workers' rights, civil rights and women's rights, on issues of justice, fairness and expanding opportunity for all, Democrats must stand our ground. Even if we lose, we must never stop fighting to defend those countrymen and -women who have long been marginalized. I am a Democrat because our party is inclusive. It takes up the cause of the poor, of working families, of religious and ethnic minorities, of gays and of women. On the environment, it fights the unchecked corporate greed and lack of regulation that allowed the air, water and soil in communities like mine to be poisoned. It affirms that it is the party of ""we,"" not the party of ""me,"" and that we share a common destiny as a nation. For the Democratic Party, this moment demands an epic gut check. We lost an election but we are not defeated. I pray we have the humility to reach out to those who differ with us, the empathy to listen to the legitimate concerns and demands of many Trump supporters, the courage to fight through cynicism and despair, and the grit to relentlessly fight for an America that advances opportunity and justice for all of our citizens.  I believe the Democratic Party is ready for this challenge. Millions of Americans are. I know I am.  The writer represents New Jersey in the Senate.  Keith Ellison | Voter turnout is key     Democrats win when we harness the power of everyday people and fight for the issues they care about. This election cycle, despite the hard work of so many, we did not motivate enough people to get to the ballot box. In 2014, voter turnout hit a 70-year low. And this year, it took only about a quarter of the eligible voters to elect Donald Trump. We must give voters a reason to show up at the polls in 2018 and beyond. I'm running to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee because we have to turn out more people. And we've been doing it in Minnesota for years. Elections are won and lost on the ground in the states, not in Washington. In my Minnesota district, voter turnout is the top priority. I have staff working 365 days a year to build meaningful and lasting relationships with voters. Our hard work has paid off. In 2014, our vote total spiked by more than 13,000 votes over 2010's.  But that doesn't benefit just me. It helps Democratic candidates in other races -- from city council, to governor, all the way to president. When candidates collaborate, pool resources and use best practices, Democratic campaigns are cheaper, more efficient and often win by wider margins. I believe we are at our best when people across the country, no matter our race, religion, sexual orientation or economic standing, come together to fight for a single cause -- lifting up all Americans. For the Democratic Party, that means changing how we do business so that rank-and-file DNC members, state chairs and vice chairs, county and local leaders, state legislators, governors, congressional leaders and activists have a voice and the resources for success. All organizations perform better when there is a culture of respect and inclusion, and our party will benefit from listening to those on the front lines. Most important, we have to bring all Democrats together around our shared values. Growing up in Detroit, I saw firsthand how families and communities were devastated by job losses. We must reclaim our history as the party that looks working people in the eye, treats them with respect and fights to improve their lives by supporting workers' rights, fair trade and collective bargaining. I want to reenergize our broad and diverse Democratic coalition, and I want to make sure all are represented across our staff and leadership. We will never stop fighting attempts by the Trump White House and Republican-controlled states to roll back affordable health care, worker wages and protections, and a woman's right to choose. We will stand strong against efforts to divide or marginalize our friends. The great Democratic leader from Minnesota, Sen. Paul Wellstone, used to say politics is the art of the possible, and organizing is the art of making more possible. Let's recommit ourselves to this.  The writer represents Minnesota's 5th District in the House of Representatives.  Gina M. Raimondo | Obstruction is no answer         As Democrats and Americans, it's important we continue to fight for the working families who have watched the U.S. economy change dramatically in recent years. In Rhode Island, we're working to create an economy built to last. I'm determined to ensure future generations have an opportunity to build a better and brighter future for themselves and their communities. Because of our values and principles, Rhode Island is on the move. We've made progressive reforms to preserve our state pension system, and led an effort that has cut Medicaid costs by more than $100 million while also expanding access to care to more people. Working with the legislature, we invested $4 billion over 10 years to rebuild our roads and bridges -- an effort that will support thousands of good-paying construction jobs. We've come together to guarantee access to all-day kindergarten for every Rhode Island student and put ourselves in a position to be the first state in the country that offers computer science in every grade and at every school. And while some wrongly deny that climate change exists, the Ocean State has taken proactive steps to reap the benefits of a renewable, green economy -- we're the first, and still only, state with an offshore wind farm. In the weeks and months ahead, there is no question that some in our party are going to advocate that Democrats in Washington take a similar obstructionist approach to President Trump that congressional Republicans have taken during President Obama's years in office. As a governor, though, that cannot be my default position. I have a state to run. People count on me to make progress for Rhode Islanders no matter who is in the White House. I disagree passionately with many of Donald Trump's views. His wall wouldn't create jobs in Rhode Island. Dismantling the Affordable Care Act would undo great strides we've made here to expand access to care and lower premiums. His rhetoric about Muslims, Latinos and other immigrants is un-American and threatens our economy. I will work tirelessly to prevent him from enacting policies such as these that stoke division and hurt working families. However, I agree with Hillary Clinton: We owe the president-elect an open mind. Hard-working Rhode Islanders expect me to work with any willing partner to get things done, to expand opportunity and put people back to work. As a governor, I will do everything in my power to pave that path, put Rhode Islanders back to work and make Rhode Island a stronger state. Let's work toward the future.   The writer is governor of Rhode Island.  Zephyr Teachout | The price of failed thinking     In the middle of the 20th century, American laws were designed to support the people who make stuff and grow stuff, who think up new technologies and ideas, who write our books and create our journalism and play our music. Democrats stood against the middleman who controls all and takes all. But for the past generation, the Democratic Party has been dominated by leaders and funders who supported shipping jobs overseas. And those same leaders largely supported the monopolization that has jacked up prices and driven down wages at the jobs that remain here.  That must now end. In the 1980s, when the Democratic Party was taken over by people who promoted monopolization and offshoring, Democrats justified their actions by saying they were good for the ""consumer."" They said concentration and globalization were more ""efficient"" and would result in lower prices. But that way of thinking has failed us all as citizens. That way of thinking has stripped away millions of good jobs and driven down wages and benefits. It has taken control of our communities away from the people who live in them and turned it over to absentee corporations and banks. It has resulted in the corruption of our democracy by immensely rich hedge-fund runners and their flunkies. In the 1990s, Democrats pretended they could fund their campaigns with cash from Wall Street titans and still remain the party of the American worker and American farmer and American independent business owner. Well, that didn't work, did it? The rising tides of Wall Street didn't lift all boats. What it did do was flood the country, washing away our homes and our jobs and our dignity and our sovereignty. There have been real victories for the people of the United States in the past few years, including stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, stopping the Comcast-Time Warner merger, stopping fracking in New York state, rolling back Common Core high-stakes testing, the Communication Workers of America's victory over Verizon for higher pay and better benefits, and the net-neutrality ruling by the Federal Communications Commission. Too many Democratic leaders were behind the curve -- or against the curve -- on too many of these issues.  Democrats should stand for roads and bridges, for broadband and clean water infrastructure, for the Erie Canal spirit that we can and must build a future together. Democrats must also stand against all unfair or dangerous concentrations of private power, in every sector of our political economy. So what should the Democratic Party stand for? In a word, democracy, with equal dignity for each person. That means becoming the party that resists every effort by small groups of well-organized wealthy men to take over our families and our communities and our nation.  The writer is an associate professor of law at Fordham University and the author of ""Corruption in America: From Benjamin Franklin's Snuff Box to Citizens United.""  Eric Garcetti | The root of the pain     Following the election, there has been a lot of talk about the future of the Democratic Party, and claims that we are now a coastal party. This is simply not true. The struggles of working people on our nation's coasts are no different from the struggles of working people in our heartland.  As mayor of the largest city in the largest state in the nation, I know that firsthand. My city reflects this nation and its diversity. Contrary to popular belief, we aren't just a bunch of actors and surfers; we are mostly bus drivers, construction workers and nurses -- everyday people confronting the problems that face the entire nation: disparity of wealth, dwindling opportunity, flat wages for hard-working people. And too many of those people feel angry, hopeless and left behind.  Long before Nov. 8, we have been tackling these challenges head-on. We have cut the unemployment rate in half. We have expanded manufacturing jobs right here in L.A. County. We are not without our problems, but on election night we pulled together a broad coalition to make historic investments in our region's future -- passing bold measures to combat homelessness, expand parks, invest in community colleges and build new public transportation while fixing our roads and freeways. This isn't a coastal agenda. This isn't a Democratic agenda. This is an American agenda -- taking action on problems with an eye toward an economy in which everyone has a chance at a good life. I believe in this agenda because I believe in an America of common challenges and shared values.  So where do we go from here to lead America's healing and renewal? We need first to acknowledge the root of this election's pain -- on Election Day, economic fears trumped social values. And while a clear majority of Americans agree with us on social values -- that government should stay out of our bedrooms and marriages, that there is no place in America for racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia -- these messages get lost if we aren't helping Americans reduce their debt, buy a house and grow our economy for everybody.  Democrats across the country need to show people that we hear their concerns and can produce results. After all, we don't call ourselves progressives because we want to embrace the status quo. If we can prove to people that we're invested in an American agenda, and they feel that progress, those voters might reward us come the next Election Day.  The writer is mayor of Los Angeles.

Quebec Superior Court Justice Guy Cournoyer sentenced Richard Henry Bain, 66, in a Montreal courtroom Friday. Bain was found guilty of second-degree murder in August, convicted by a jury in the killing of Denis Blanchette outside a Sept. 4 2012 victory rally for Pauline Marois of the Parti Quebecois. Marios was delivering a victory speech inside the Metropolis nightclub during the incident. Shots fired by Bain also wounded a 27-year-old stage hand.

While campaigning in next spring's presidential election, Marine Le Pen has worked to smooth her image and distance herself from her father's extremist views and anti-Semitic comments. Kicking him out of the party was part of her strategy. The civil court outside that heard Jean-Marie Le Pen's reinstatement claim upheld the National Front's decision last year to expel him as a rank-and-file member. But the court also ruled that the 88-year-old firebrand can remain the party's honorary president. As a result, the court ordered the National Front to summon the elder Le Pen to any high-level party meetings and to give him voting rights as an ex-officio member of all the party's governing bodies.  ""No statutory provisions specify that the honorary president must be a member of the National Front,"" the judges said. The court sentenced the party to pay Jean-Marie Le Pen 23,000 euros ($24,500) in damages and lawyers' fee.  ""This can be called a success,"" his lawyer, Frederic Joachim, told reporters after the ruling was returned. Joachim had asked the court for 2 million euros ($2.1 million) in damages because ""it's a political life they tried to destroy at home and to cast scorn on abroad."" The party's lawyers didn't immediately comment on the ruling, which both sides can appeal. The National Front ousted the party patriarch for a series of comments, including referring to Nazi gas chambers as a ""detail"" of World War II history. Le Pen contends his comments were protected by freedom of expression, though he has been sentenced repeatedly in France for inciting racial hatred and denying crimes against humanity. Since taking over the National Front in 2011, Marine Le Pen's more mainstream politicking has turned her into one of France's most popular politicians while she campaigns on an anti-immigration, anti-European Union platform. She has widened the party's electoral base to include former supporters of the traditional conservative and socialist parties frustrated with the status quo, economic stagnation and France's shrinking global clout. The elder Le Pen, who retains a core of dedicated supporters, has said he hasn't decided whether to support his daughter's presidential bid. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Even meteorologists have battled fake weather news for years. This month, one ""wannabe weatherman"" in Kentucky took it to a whole different -- and more dangerous -- level: He allegedly lit several wildfires for Facebook views. Johnny Mullins, 21, posted ""weather outlook"" videos of himself in front of fires, NBC News reported. He warned eastern Kentucky residents to ""be extremely careful if you're out there,"" Jenkins Police Chief James Stephens told NBC. Stephens told the Associated Press that Mullins enjoyed the attention: ""It's really too bad because he's not a bad kid -- he's just misguided,"" said James Stephens, the police chief in Jenkins, Kentucky, where Johnny Mullins, 21, was arrested this week on a second-degree arson charge. ""He likes to do Facebook videos and have people follow him on his 'weather forecast,' so that's pretty much why he did what he did,"" the chief said. ""He enjoyed the attention he got from the Facebook stuff."" ""He didn't realize how much danger he was putting other people in,"" Stephens added. Meanwhile, large fires are burning from Kentucky to Georgia thanks to extreme drought, many of which have been set by people. There's someone roaming northern Georgia in a dark blue SUV that was last seen where other wildfires were started. In North Carolina's Nantahala National Forest, authorities are investigating 20 wildfires that they think were started by arson. Those fires alone have burned more than 17,000 acres. The Southeast is battling some of its worst drought and wildfires on record. There are 17 large active wildfires in the southern Appalachians that have burned more than 80,000 acres. Thick smoke is drifting into the Carolinas, prompting Code Red air quality alerts."

Or is it prejudice?	" WASHINGTON -- When Donald Trump announced Stephen Bannon as his top White House strategist, critics re-erupted with allegations that Bannon was racist, sexist and anti-Semitic.  ""I promise you he's not as scary"" as people said, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on NBC's ""Today"" show Tuesday. She called concerns about Bannon ""very unfair."" If history is any guide, Bannon won't be putting those fears to rest anytime soon. As a conservative media brawler who became Trump's campaign chief executive, Bannon has discarded norms for discussing race, gender and religion, often framing even abstract political fights in deliberately inflammatory terms.  ""What we need to do is bitch-slap the Republican Party,"" Bannon said in a 2010 radio interview. For a man aggrieved with elite educational, business and media institutions, Bannon has risen to the top of some of them. Born into a Norfolk, Virginia, family of Catholic Democrats, Bannon served in the U.S. Navy before attending Harvard Business School. Afterward, he went to Goldman Sachs, leaving to start his own media-focused boutique investment banking firm. After selling the business to French banking giant Societe Generale, he became a film producer. Though he created successful Hollywood films, the groundwork for his future career in politics came from a Reagan biopic, ""In the Face of Evil,"" which introduced him to conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart and author Peter Schweizer. After Breitbart died unexpectedly in 2012, Bannon took the helm of a relaunch of his news site. Breitbart grew quickly, from 12 million monthly page views to more than 192 million by August of this year, according to the site. During the Republican Convention, Bannon said Breitbart was ""the platform for the alt-right,"" a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. Heavily influenced by the shock-based rhetoric of internet chat boards, the alt-right includes strains of white nationalism and aggressive anti-feminism. The alt-right's mainstream apologists describe those themes as a demonstration of free speech rather than a full-throated endorsement of prejudice. In interviews, Bannon has acknowledged that the alt-right may attract some racists, homophobes and anti-Semites, but said that he does not share those opinions -- and that the left harbors undesirable elements as well. Yet Breitbart actively cultivates some of those themes, and Bannon has shown little patience for adjusting the site's tone to pacify critics. Under Bannon, Breitbart kept a running tab of news stories titled ""black crime,"" which catalogued the activities of supposed ""black rape gangs"" and ""black mobs."" The site used a slur for transgender people in headlines and stories. And during the campaign -- a period in which Bannon stepped aside from running the site -- Breitbart.com sometimes went out of its way to identify Trump critics as Jews.  ""I've known and worked with Steve Bannon, and he has traditional conservative non-racist, non-prejudiced views about the world,"" said Joel Pollak, a senior editor at large at Breitbart, who called The Associated Press in response to a request for comment from Bannon on this story. ""Lately, media conventions have determined that some of the traditional views of most of Western civilization are offensive."" Bannon has publicly disavowed tolerance for prejudice. But allegations of anti-Semitism have also followed Bannon into his personal life as well. In 2007, his ex-wife alleged in court documents from their divorce that Bannon expressed open anti-Semitism, declaring that he didn't want their two daughters ""going to school with Jews."" Bannon disputed saying this. In a 2011 radio interview, Bannon declared that conservative women, including Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachmann, infuriated liberals because they ""would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children."" He contrasted that against a slur for lesbians. Regardless of Bannon's personal views on race and gender, he has heartily endorsed using inflammatory rhetoric to incite Breitbart's readership. In a December 2014 internal Breitbart email obtained by the Daily Beast, Bannon and an editor discussed a traditional Washington slight -- the possibility that Breitbart might not have been invited to a press conference by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. The conversation quickly spiraled into rage at the Republican political establishment. He compared leadership figures to women's genitalia. ""Let the grassroots turn on the hate because that's the ONLY thing that will make them do their duty."" Such opinions make Bannon an odd pairing with Reince Priebus, the Republican chairman whom Trump has named his chief of staff. Senior members of Trump's camp have downplayed the prospects for conflict.  ""When you're out there just criticizing, it's one thing,"" Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani said. ""When you actually get on the inside, there's a certain weight of responsibility to the American people that is on your shoulders. And I think Steve Bannon is the kind of guy who gets that."" ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)  We don't know a whole heckuva lot about who Donald Trump will pick for his Cabinet at this point. So far, the process is heavy on rumors and preliminary lists. For Trump, selecting and vetting his picks isn't a three-day process, nor should we expect much of it to be done in public. It's also important to emphasize upfront that names floated for various positions are sometimes more about expressing gratitude to surrogates, even if they're unlikely to actually get picked. That said, some of the early names leaking out are of the sort that could send a real signal about Trump's path going forward. And some of those paths could really make Democrats squirm. Here's a rundown of the more controversial names that have been floated. David Clarke: Homeland security? This is another pick that is perhaps unlikely. Markon's story doesn't mention the Milwaukee County sheriff, who was a vocal Trump supporter. But others have, Politico said a Trump campaign source named Clarke as a possible pick, and a preliminary list of 41 names obtained by BuzzFeed's John Stanton also includes Clarke. Even Clarke has weighed in, playing it down but not totally dismissing the idea.      Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke offered his support for police officers around the country during a speech on the opening day of the Republican National Convention July 18. (The Washington Post)   Clarke's rhetoric on law enforcement echoes Arpaio in many ways. A regular surrogate for Trump's campaign, Clarke, who is black, has compared Black Lives Matter to the Islamic State, a.k.a. ISIS.   Before long, Black Lies Matter will join forces with ISIS to being down our legal constituted republic. You heard it first here. -- David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) October 28, 2015   And on Wednesday night, he called for protests against President-elect Trump to be ""quelled.""   These temper tantrums from these radical anarchists must be quelled. There is no legitimate reason to protest the will of the people. pic.twitter.com/G502pwNSN9 -- David A. Clarke, Jr. (@SheriffClarke) November 10, 2016   Sen. Jeff Sessions: Attorney general, Defense Department, OMB? Sessions's name is also on BuzzFeed's list for three possible slots, and his potential leadership of the Defense Department was explored by The Post's Dan Lamothe. He isn't as much a household name as some others on this list. But from a policy standpoint, he may be the Senate's foremost immigration hard-liner, and his long-ago political past could come up if he's nominated. Before resurrecting his political career as Alabama attorney general and then being elected senator in 1996, Sessions was denied a judgeship over allegations of racism.      Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's White House bid during a joint appearance in his home state. (Reuters)   As Lamothe reports: In 1986, he was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to serve as a federal-district court judge, but a bipartisan panel of Judiciary Committee senators declined to send his nomination to the Senate floor amid allegations that he had said the NAACP was ""un-American"" and ""Communist-inspired"" and that a white civil rights lawyer was a ""disgrace to his race."" Sessions vigorously denied the allegations. In a new interview with Politico's Glenn Thrush, Sessions responds: ""I don't feel like I did anything to damage the advancement of racial reconciliation and civil rights,"" he told me, voice lowered to a near-whisper. ""But I didn't -- I wasn't any hero in it either."" Sid Miller: Agriculture secretary?     Texas Agricultural Commissioner Sid Miller in Austin in 2015. (Eric Gay/Associated Press)   Miller's name is on the BuzzFeed list for agriculture secretary. And while, like Sessions, he might not be well known outside of political circles, he's known to say controversial things on social media. The Texas agriculture commissioner's Twitter account recently called Hillary Clinton a ""c---"" in a tweet. A spokesman suggested the account had been hacked, and the tweet has been deleted. Miller has also shared on Facebook a doctored photo of President Obama holding up a Che Guevara T-shirt, and in 2015 his social-media team shared an image suggesting a nuclear attack on the Muslim world. Rudy Giuliani: Secretary of state? This would seem to be among the more likely potential Cabinet picks on this list. Giuliani has been among the most vocal and outspoken Trump surrogates for months. He was thought to be a top contender for attorney general, but now that buzz is he's more likely to be secretary of state. As a Trump surrogate, Giuliani has often gone even further than Trump. Giuliani has said directly that he thought Hillary Clinton looked ill on the campaign trail, pressed the idea that voter fraud could rob Trump of the election, and was among the earliest public advocates for attacking Bill Clinton's indiscretions in the White House. And here's more from:      Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) is a big fan of Donald Trump - and he said some strange things while campaigning for the Republican nominee. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Giuliani, once the beloved, moderate Republican mayor of New York City on 9/11, over the course of this campaign turned himself into a bare-knuckle political brawler, willing to say pretty much anything to help Trump get elected. Myron Ebell: Environmental Protection Agency? Ebell is leading Trump's EPA transition effort and could be his pick to lead the agency. He also happens to be among the most outspoken skeptics of man-made climate change and has often criticized fellow Republicans for being too soft on environmental issues. As Politico's Danny Vinik writes: When Newt Gingrich, then the speaker of the House, worked on reforming the Endangered Species Act in 1995, Ebell wrote a nine-page memo opposing Gingrich's effort, saying, ""His soft feelings for cuddly little critters is still going to be a big problem."" When Sen. John McCain, working with Sen. Joe Lieberman, proposed cap-and-trade legislation in 2005, Ebell worked furiously to kill the bill, calling it a ""a shameless con game."" When Ebell got wind of a private meeting hosted by the American Enterprise Institute in 2012 to consider a carbon tax, he attacked the think tank, going so far as to ask donors to pull their funding. Laura Ingraham: Press secretary?    Conservative political commentator Laura Ingraham points toward the media booths as she speaks during the third day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Wednesday, July 20, 2016. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  The conservative radio firebrand has been a top Trump booster and helped him prepare for the debate. She says she would be ""honored"" to be his press secretary -- though for now it's just rumors. ""We'll see what happens,"" she said on Fox News on Monday night. ""I think people are getting a little far ahead of the narrative."" Ingraham, who worked early in her career in the Reagan White House, hosts a popular syndicated radio show and is a regular guest-host replacement for Bill O'Reilly. In that role, she has regularly decried the mainstream media outlets with whom she would be working closely as press secretary. Ken Blackwell: Leader of domestic transition team This one is in the books -- a done deal. And for liberals, it's an inauspicious start. Blackwell is a former Ohio secretary of state and GOP nominee for governor, and he is popular among conservatives. He's also someone Democrats love to hate for his comments about the LGBT community and his decisions during the hotly contested 2004 presidential election in Ohio. Back then, then-Secretary of State Blackwell ruled that provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct should not be counted. Democrats appealed and lost. The following year, the DNC drafted a report alleging voter suppression in the state. And while running for chairman of the RNC in 2009, Blackwell said that being gay is a choice and compared it to having the proclivity to commit arson or be a kleptomaniac. Joe Arpaio: Potential homeland security secretary? ABC News on Wednesday included Arpaio's name as a possible Trump homeland security secretary, and though it's not clear how seriously he's being considered, it would seem to be a good fit for Trump's immigration platform.      The controversial sheriff of Arizona's Maricopa County, Joe Arpaio, announced his endorsement of Republican presidential contender Donald Trump saying that it was a ""no brainer."" (Reuters)   Arpaio is the outgoing sheriff of Maricopa County (he just lost his bid for a seventh term) and is known for his hard-line stances on illegal immigration, his harsh rhetoric and making inmates wear pink underwear. Arpaio has faced accusations of instituting racial profiling for years, and in May a federal judge ruled that he had ignored federal orders to halt the tactics in question. The Post's Jerry Markon reports, though, that Arpaio's selection appears unlikely: But other people familiar with the deliberations said Arpaio is viewed as unable to win Senate confirmation. He is also 84 years old and facing legal trouble. The longtime sheriff was recently charged with criminal contempt for resisting a judge's order that he stop detaining people solely on suspicion they were undocumented immigrants. Arpaio, whose wife is battling cancer, could face up to six months in jail if convicted. Ben Carson: Health and Human Services or Education? Update: Carson tells The Post's Robert Costa that he's unlikely to join Trump's Cabinet: ""The way I'm leaning is to work from the outside and not from the inside. I want to have the freedom to work on many issues and not be pigeonholed into one particular area."" Back in May, Trump agreed with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that Carson would make a good pick for HHS, and he has also floated Carson for the Education Department. Carson said himself back in March that Trump offered him a role in a Trump administration, at least in an advisory capacity. And indeed, his name appears on the BuzzFeed list as a possible education or HHS secretary. Carson rose to prominence in the 2016 GOP primary as a vocal critic of Obamacare, which he has said was the worst thing since slavery and also suggested it was a form of slavery. He has also said liberals would turn the United States into Nazi Germany. ""And if you believe that same thing can't happen again, you're very wrong,"" Carson said in 2014. ""But we're not going to let it happen."" And Carson said during the 2016 campaign that he wouldn't be okay with a Muslim as president, suggesting that a Muslim's values would be inconsistent with American values. Sarah Palin: Interior Department? Palin's name was included on BuzzFeed's list, for the possible job of interior secretary. Again, it's not clear how serious her consideration may be, but it's one that would certainly make liberals' heads spin. That said, Palin hasn't been a hugely visible supporter of Trump on the campaign trail."

McDonnell, who recently emerged from a long legal saga a free but tarnished man, will join the faculty at the evangelical university founded by televangelist Pat Robertson. McDonnell (R) will serve as a distinguished professor at Regent University's Robertson School of Government starting in January, the Virginia Beach-based school announced Tuesday. He also will help establish the Governor's Center for Federalism and Civility, which is intended to help states understand their role in a federal society, Regent said. McDonnell, who was a prosecutor, state delegate and state attorney general before becoming governor, earned a law degree and a master's degree in public policy from Regent in 1989.  A master's thesis he wrote at Regent surfaced during his 2009 bid for governor, becoming a flash point in the race because it criticized working women and gay people as detrimental to society. McDonnell, who had tried to play down social issues during the race, tamped down the furor by saying his views had evolved, and he went on to a 17-point victory over Democrat R. Creigh Deeds.  [From the archives: Va. candidate McDonnell says views changed since he wrote thesis]  ""We are delighted to welcome Governor McDonnell back to Regent University,"" Robertson said in a written statement. ""As we train students to serve in government, law and other disciplines, McDonnell will bring his extensive public service experience as an Army officer, prosecutor, state legislator, attorney general and governor."" McDonnell was a popular governor and rising GOP star when a gifts scandal blew up in his final year in office. Shortly after leaving the Executive Mansion in January 2014, he and first lady Maureen McDonnell were charged with federal corruption for accepting more than $175,000 in luxury gifts, vacations and sweetheart loans from Richmond businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr., who'd sought their help promoting his nutritional supplement. Prosecutors contended that the McDonnells connected Williams with state officials, let him throw a luncheon at the governor's mansion to help launch the product and allowed him to shape the guest list at a mansion reception meant for health-care leaders. The McDonnells asserted that Williams got no special treatment, only the routine political courtesies extended to any political donor. The state never included the tablets on its employee health plan or conducted university clinical trials as Williams had sought. A federal jury in Richmond convicted the couple of corruption in September 2014, but attorneys for the former governor took the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and won. In June, the high court threw out his conviction, ruling that jurors had been wrongly instructed on the meaning of an ""official act"" -- the thing McDonnell was said to have performed for Williams -- and therefore deserved at least a retrial. The ruling set a higher bar for prosecuting public corruption, saying explicitly that setting up meetings or arranging events for benefactors did not, on its own, constitute the ""quo"" of a corrupt quid pro quo deal. In September, the Justice Department decided not to seek a retrial of McDonnell or his wife under that standard.  [Prosecutors will drop cases against former Va. governor Robert McDonnell, wife]  McDonnell referred to his legal ordeal in the statement released by Regent. ""During my painful journey through the justice system after I left the Governor's office, I came to the realization that politics and polls are much less important than people and policies,"" McDonnell said. ""I'm eager to engage with Regent students and faculty in and out of the classroom, and I hope that my experiences can inspire others to consider careers in public service."" "

(Courtesy photo)  Eight years after he was sworn into office, President Obama's ""HOPE"" poster remains, for many, a reminder of the energy and inspiration that launched the nation's first black president into the White House. Now, a Tuscaloosa, Ala., teacher has been placed on administrative leave for politicizing the image in a way that some students and parents found offensive. Tuscaloosa City Schools confirmed that Northridge High School math teacher Scott Johnson used a projector to show his students a mocking image of President-elect Donald Trump using the original image's font and formatting. Beneath Trump's smiling face, the word ""Hope"" had been changed to: ""Obama, You're Fired!"" ""You're fired"" was Trump's trademark phrase during his time on the popular NBC television show ""The Apprentice."" In recent weeks, the Associated Press reported, multiple people who worked on the show have accused Trump of using sexist language and openly discussing the physical attributes of women who worked on the show.   [A Holocaust scholar compared Donald Trump to Hitler. His high school placed him on leave.]   Tuscaloosa school officials said they received multiple complaints after Johnson projected the image onto a whiteboard Wednesday. Officials told AL.com that they found out about the incident the day it occurred.    A Tuscaloosa parent posted a photo complaining about her daughter being shown a political image in class. (Courtesy photo)  ""The Tuscaloosa City Schools is aware of a political issue discussed in a math class Wednesday at Northridge High School,"" schools spokeswoman Lesley Bruinton said. ""The situation is being investigated and the instructor has been placed on administrative leave,"" she added. Bruinton declined to tell The Washington Post whether -- as some have alleged on social media -- Johnson also made inappropriate political statements to students. Public school teachers -- like all American citizens -- are afforded free speech rights, but there are notable limitations, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. ""What you say or communicate inside the classroom is considered speech on behalf of the school district and therefore will not be entitled to much protection,"" the ACLU notes. ""Certain types of speech outside the school might also not be protected if the school can show that your speech created a substantial adverse impact on school functioning."" Because public school students are considered ""a captive audience,"" courts have not afforded K-12 teachers the same First Amendment protections as a public university professor's teachings and writings, according to the ACLU. Outside the classroom, however, public school teachers are afforded the same rights as anyone else. Protected speech allows teachers, for example, to post a political article favoring a candidate on their Facebook page or to attend a political rally on their own time. But inside the classroom, ""speech"" is more restricted and can also include ""decoration, posters or displays,"" the ACLU notes. First Amendment protections also might not apply to teachers who use social media to make comments about students or work-related topics. ""Because schools have the authority to control what happens in the classroom, courts have allowed school districts to require teachers to remove in-class banners and displays conveying a religious message,"" according to the ACLU. ""It is likely that the school could require you to remove political signs from the classroom.""   [Donald Trump said he once punched a teacher in the face. Did he?]   This year, teachers have reported finding it difficult to discuss the campaign while remaining neutral. Election years typically present teachers with an opportunity to explain government and implement real-world civics lessons in the classroom. But across the country this year, some teachers report that they have struggled to use the presidential election as a model for students. Last week at Mountain View High School in California's Silicon Valley, a high school teacher and Holocaust scholar was placed on paid leave after drawing parallels between Trump and Adolf Hitler in his class. Frank Navarro said he cited some of Trump's controversial and racially charged statements, such as calling Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and criminals and making comments about the Mexican heritage of a judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University, to make the case that there are some parallels with Hitler's persecution of Jews and the Nazi leader's rise to power. ""It's an effective way of embedding the lessons that I'm teaching regarding the place of government and the lives of people,"" Navarro, who teaches special education, civics and world studies, told The Washington Post. ""It's important to relate history to your lives because, in the end, that's what it's going to be about."" Navarro was placed on paid leave after a parent emailed school officials to complain about his teaching methods. Navarro defended himself by saying that his lessons were based on facts, but administrators said students and teachers are facing ""a heightened emotional environment"" because of the election. ""It's always a challenge to maintain a line in a classroom,"" District Superintendent Jeff Harding told the San Jose Mercury News, noting that Navarro could return to the classroom as early as Monday.   As teachers, how do we respond when his statements would break our own classroom rules? #hsgovchat #sschat pic.twitter.com/9yIj98oQRO -- Justin Christensen (@JustinChristen) March 23, 2016   When teachers step over that line, especially during a sensitive political period, they risk being exposed by students ready to blast their statements on social media. Photos from inside Scott Johnson's classroom were shared by students and parents on Facebook, AL.com reported. ""So this was up in one of my daughter's classroom today at school ... Smh [shaking my head],"" one parent wrote on the site. Russell Howard, a Tuscaloosa native who doesn't have children, submitted photos from the incident to the newspaper as well. Despite not having a child involved, he said he was offended by the allegations. ""After an extremely divisive election, what message does this send to the students in his classroom?"" he said. ""An educator has absolutely no right to advance their ideals and beliefs onto students.""

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/11/14/the-terrifying-prospect-of-an-attorney-general-giuliani/	The terrifying prospect of an Attorney General Giuliani	"      Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani told reporters on Friday that his advice to President-elect Donald Trump is ""out of great loyalty"" and has ""no expectation"" about his role in Trump's administration. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)   Among the names being tossed around for Donald Trump's attorney general is Rudy Giuliani, a politician that the journalist Jimmy Breslin once called ""a small man in search of a balcony."" Of course, Giuliani's name isn't a surprise. The former New York mayor -- who once said that ""freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do"" -- has been a Trump adviser and surrogate for months. He's actively lobbying for the Justice Department post, but he has also been mentioned as a possibility to head up the Department of Homeland Security. It seems likely that Trump's election is the end of criminal-justice reform at the federal level. Given his campaign rhetoric, and Trump's endorsement by nearly every law enforcement agency in the country, I doubt we'll see any more damning reports on police abuse from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. But Giuliani at Justice is an especially troubling proposition. This is a man whose career has been marked by prosecutorial excesses, knee-jerk defenses of abusive cops and an affinity for using the power of his political offices to get vengeance on his enemies. Let's look first at his tenure as the mayor of New York. Giuliani has always been a stalwart defender of abusive cops. In 2000, two undercover New York Police Department detectives shot and killed 26-year-old Patrick Dorismond. The detectives asked Dorismond if he knew where they could find some pot. Dorismond, no pot dealer, was offended at the question, and a scuffle broke out. One of the officers pulled a gun. The detectives claim Dorismond tried to grab it. After the incident, Giuliani released Dorismond's juvenile record, which by law was supposed to remain sealed. Citing Dorismond's record as a minor, Giuliani said the dead man was ""no altar boy."" (Actually, Dorismond had been an altar boy.) The city eventually paid $2.25 million to Dorismond's family. The detective was cleared. Giuliani defended the release of Dorismond's juvenile records by claiming the man had no right to privacy after death. Giuliani also defended the officers who shot Amadou Diallo 19 times after he pulled a wallet out of his jacket to show them his ID.      Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) is a big fan of Donald Trump - and he said some strange things while campaigning for the Republican nominee. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Giuliani of course was also the mayoral architect of ""Stop & Frisk,"" and still widely touts its success, despite the fact that murders in New York have continued to decline since the NYPD largely stopped the practice. Giuliani also stepped up street-level enforcement of the drug laws, often with the use of SWAT tactics and no-knock raids. In 1990s New York, raid teams kicked down doors left and right, often based on little more than tips from shady informants. Despite increasing complaints and media reports of brutality, excessive force, and raids on innocent people and families throughout the decade, the Giuliani administration did nothing. By the time Alberta Spruill -- an innocent, 57-year-old woman -- was killed in a mistaken raid in 2003, the NYPD was conducting 450 such raids per month. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said after Spruill's death that about 10 percent were on the wrong address. That 45 or so New York residences were wrongly raided each month was apparently an acceptable figure. But Kelly also conceded that the number could be higher, because the department didn't really keep track of how often they mistakenly waged volatile terrifying raids on innocent people. (Today, the NYPD is one of the more restrained big-city police departments when it comes to such tactics, although there are still some problems.) Under President Obama, at least some parts of the Justice Department tried to encourage less militaristic, less reactionary, more community-oriented policing. That will likely end no matter whom Trump puts at DOJ. But it would certainly end under Giuliani. Giuliani  the mayor was also hostile to the First Amendment. He waged war on a Brooklyn art museum because it displayed a painting he found offensive. He later tried to assemble a ""decency task force"" to seek out art at public museums for possible censorship. Giuliani often boasts of his crackdowns on pornography. Earlier this year, Trump vowed to do the same. (He has also added famous anti-porn crusader Ed Meese to his transition team.) Should he head up the Justice Department, we can probably expect Giuliani to invest considerable resources toward eradicating Internet pornography. That will never happen, of course. But they could certainly make examples of a lot of people. Giuliani also used zoning laws and quality-of-life ordinances to crack down on protests, street vendors and advertisements he found distasteful (or, in many cases, were critical of him). He took New York magazine to court (and lost) over a bus ad the magazine took out because it mentioned his name. In giving Giuliani a lifetime ""muzzle award"" for his hostility to free speech, the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression wrote, ""He has stifled speech and press to so unprecedented a degree, and in so many and varied forms, that simply keeping up with the city's censorious activity has proved a challenge for defenders of free expression."" First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams called Giuliani ""the single most consistent opponent of First Amendment rights in living memory."" In a 2007 profile for Washington Monthly, Rachel Morris pointed out that as mayor Giuliani lost 35 First Amendment lawsuits. As the New York Times reported in 2008, Giuliani was also an incredibly vindictive mayor. The paper likened him to a boxer, writing that ""he made the vengeful roundhouse an instrument of government, clipping anyone who crossed him."" One man confronted Giuliani during a radio show about a red light sting in his neighborhood. When Giuliani didn't respond, the man went to the New York Daily News. The same morning the article ran, NYPD cops showed up at the man's door to arrest him on a 13-year-old traffic warrant. The NYPD then released the man's decades-old record, despite the fact that it was supposed to be sealed. An NYPD spokesman also falsely claimed the man had been convicted of ""sodomy."" The Times article lays out how Giuliani used licensing bureaus, housing codes and other city government infrastructure to punish whistleblowers, critics, detractors and disloyalists. He not only tried to get his political opponents fired; when he heard they were being considered for other positions, he'd call the potential new employers to pressure them to look elsewhere. Giuliani's vindictiveness could be incredibly petty.  After AIDS activists with Housing Works loudly challenged the mayor, city officials sabotaged the group's application for a federal housing grant. A caseworker who spoke of missteps in the death of a child was fired. After unidentified city workers complained of pressure to hand contracts to Giuliani-favored organizations, investigators examined not the charges but the identity of the leakers. ""There were constant loyalty tests: 'Will you shoot your brother?' "" said Marilyn Gelber, who served as environmental commissioner under Mr. Giuliani. ""People were marked for destruction for disloyal jokes."" Mr. Giuliani paid careful attention to the art of political payback. When former Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins spoke publicly of Mr. Giuliani's foibles, mayoral aides removed their official portraits from the ceremonial Blue Room at City Hall.  When civil rights attorney and New York University law professor Joel Berger wrote a New York Times op-ed criticizing Giuliani in 1997, the mayor's aides called NYU and threatened to cancel an apprenticeship program the city ran with NYU unless the school fired Berger from the course he was teaching. Donald Trump is of course famously vindictive himself. He has banished reporters from publications who criticize him. He has openly suggested altering the libel laws to make it easier to sue journalists who write things he doesn't like. He sued author Tim O'Brien for $5 billion because in his biography of Trump, O'Brien suggested that the now president-elect was merely worth $150-$200 million, not the $9 billion Trump claimed. Trump knew the lawsuit was a loser. He just wanted O'Brien to suffer. Trump's campaign aides have already declared that he's keeping an enemies list, and that he and they fantasize about retribution. Giuliani had no qualms about using his power as the mayor of New York to settle personal and political grievances. Now imagine Giuliani settling scores -- his and Trump's -- with the vast resources of the Justice Department at his disposal. He'll have the FBI. He'll have an army of U.S. attorneys. And he'll have virtually unlimited funding. As noted, Giuliani was quick to release the sealed criminal records of police critics and victims of police shootings and brutality. He wasn't as forthcoming with his own records. Just before he left City Hall, he cut a shady deal with the city that transferred all of his records to his own private company, so only he could control who accessed them. For all Giuliani's criticism of Black Lives Matter protests, the prospective next attorney general launched his political career by inciting an actual violent protest. When he ran for mayor in 1992, Giuliani spoke to a raucous crowd of white cops protesting then-mayor David Dinkins's proposal for a civilian review board. From the New York Times: Hundreds of white off-duty officers drank heavily, and a few waved signs like ""Dump the Washroom Attendant,"" a reference to Mr. Dinkins. A block away from City Hall, Mr. Giuliani gave a fiery address, twice calling Mr. Dinkins's proposal ""bulls-t."" The crowd cheered. Mr. Giuliani was jubilant. ""If you're acculturated to like cops, you don't necessarily see 10,000 white guys who don't vote in the city, don't write political checks and love you for the wrong reason,"" an aide said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is working with the Giuliani presidential campaign. Mr. Dinkins has not forgotten that sea of angry cops. ""Rudy was out there inciting white cops to riot,"" Mr. Dinkins said in a recent interview . . .  Incite them he did. Nearly 10,000 cops rampaged through the city. Nat Hentoff and Nick Hentoff recently recalled the riot in a piece published at the Cato Institute:  Reporters and innocent bystanders were violently assaulted by the mob as thousands of dollars in private property was destroyed in multiple acts of vandalism. The protesters stormed up the steps of City Hall, occupying the building. They then streamed onto the Brooklyn Bridge, where they blocked traffic in both directions, jumping on the cars of trapped, terrified motorists. Many of the protestors were carrying guns and openly drinking alcohol.  Blocking traffic. Occupying public buildings. Sounds familiar, no? And yet Giuliani never condemned the rioters. From the New York Times:   The Giuliani campaign later conducted a ""vulnerability study"" to identify their candidate's weaknesses in 1993. This study, obtained by Wayne Barrett, author of ""Rudy!"" -- an investigative biography -- offers an unsparing critique: ""Giuliani's shrieking performance at the cop rally may be his greatest political liability this year. Giuliani has yet to admonish those who attacked the mayor with racist code words on signs and banners. Why not?""  Giuliani later ordered the report destroyed. It's hard to think of a politician more punitive than Giuliani. As a federal prosecutor, he was credited for inventing the ""perp walk,"" the practice of parading arrestees before television cameras that prosecutors have notified ahead of time. He made a name for himself with high-profile prosecutions of Wall Street traders and mob bosses, but on more than a few occasions, Giuliani had to drop the charges against suspects he perp-walked. In others, the charges were later dismissed by an appellate court. Perhaps his most famous prosecution was of ""junk bond king"" Michael Milken. But as William L. Anderson explains in great detail here, in doing so Giuliani pioneered abusive prosecutorial practices like the expansive application of racketeering and conspiracy laws, and the seizing of all of a suspect's assets before trial. Both are now common, and not just in cases against wealthy Wall Street barons. Conspiracy is now a tool prosecutors use to rope in the girlfriends and relatives of suspected drug dealers, or to connect unconnected events into criminal conspiracies that bring mandatory minimum prison sentences. It has led to some serious miscarriages of justice.  In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court (inexplicably) upheld the government's power to seize defendants' assets before trial, thereby denying them the ability to hire good legal representation. As Dan Baum documented in his book ""Smoke and Mirrors,"" during his time at DOJ in the 1980s Giuliani also helped expand the scope and reach of civil-asset forfeiture laws more generally. As mayor of New York, he instructed city officials to seize the cars of first-time drunk-driving suspects. Even if the suspects were acquitted, under Giuliani's proposal, they'd have to go to court (plus hire an attorney, pay court costs, etc.) to win back their automobiles. It's probably safe to say that under Giuliani, the Justice Department would roll back the modest civil-asset forfeiture reforms implemented during the Obama administration. We'd also likely see even less effort to discipline wayward federal prosecutors and a big push to expand prosecutorial power. As a federal prosecutor, Giuliani was also known for prosecuting low-level drug crimes as federal cases. As Kevin Baker pointed out in a profile for Politico a few months ago, Giuliani wasn't always the politician he is today. He seems to have grown more authoritarian as he has sought and accumulated power.He voted for George McGovern in 1972.  ""He only became a Republican after he began to get all those jobs from them,"" Baker quotes Giuliani's mother saying in 1988. The first job was with the Nixon-Ford Justice Department in the mid-1970s. Giuliani then worked in the private sector during the Carter administration. When Ronald Reagan was elected, he was offered the number three position at Justice. He accepted, but later requested an appointment to be U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York so he could litigate -- and make a name for himself. But even after a decade as a federal prosecutor, Giuliani's politics were well to the left of where they are now. In a 1989 profile, New York magazine wrote of Giuliani, ""He is perhaps the only white politician in town who draws a positive emotional response -- hugs and cheers -- in Harlem."" That of course would quickly change after he was elected mayor in 1993. Yet after his two terms as mayor, Giuliani's politics were well to the left of much of the GOP, especially on cultural issues such as gay rights and abortion. When he ran for the GOP nomination in 2008, Giuliani lurched to the right, not on taxes or regulation, but by boasting about his efforts to censor art and combat pornography while he was mayor. He also tried to compensate for his cultural liberalism by doubling down on crime and national security issues, running on his longtime support for cops and his record as a prosecutor, as well as support for torturing terrorism suspects, the detention of American citizens without trial and other war-on-terror policies. It was all enough for the the American Conservative -- obviously no liberal rag -- to portray Giuliani as a fascist on its cover. Perhaps no issue illustrates how Giuliani's authoritarianism grows as he seeks higher office than immigration. As Jelani Cobb recently pointed out at the New Yorker, during his tenure as mayor, Giuliani was staunchly pro-immigrant. Recall that during the 2007 campaign, Mitt Romney accused Giuliani of running a ""sanctuary city"" in the 1990s. (He was right.) As mayor, Giuliani also chastised anti-immigration demagogues like former California Gov. Pete Wilson. Cole cites this remarkable quote Giuliani gave in 1996: ""The anti-immigration issue that's now sweeping the country in my view is no different than the movements that swept the country in the past. You look back at the Chinese Exclusionary Act, or the Know-Nothing movement--these were movements that encouraged Americans to fear foreigners, to fear something that is different, and to stop immigration."" (There is one exception to his early record on immigration. As a Justice Department official in the early 1980s, Giuliani fought the asylum claims of 2,100 Haitian refugees arguing, as the New York Times reported, that ""repression in Haiti 'simply does not exist now' and that refugees had nothing to fear from the Government of Jean-Claude Duvalier."" The Haitian dictator of course tortured and murdered thousands of his own citizens, and sold the body parts of some of his victims on the black market.) By the time he ran for president in 2008, Giuliani was talking about border fences and national ID cards. But even then, he still opposed mass deportation and supported a path to citizenship for undocumented people currently in the United States. Today, he's lobbying to be the chief law enforcement officer for a president-elect who wants to immediately deport 2 to 3 million undocumented people, and has at various times promised to deport all 12 million. Trump of course also famously promised to ban all Muslims from entering the country. Giuliani initially rejected the plan in December, but in May Trump suggested Giuliani as someone who might head up his task force to hash out his plan for Muslim immigrants.  (Today as a Trump surrogate, Giuliani boasts that as mayor, he sent police officers to infiltrate and spy on city mosques and has suggested ""tagging"" people on the terror watch list with GPS devices.) If Giuliani's authoritarianism does indeed grow as he seeks and collects political power -- and there's ample evidence that it does -- imagine what he'll do if given most powerful position of his life.          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.
