Jeff Sessions, Donald Trumpâ€™s pick for attorney general	"      President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)   In Donald Trump's world, most roads, it seems, lead back to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), President-elect Trump's pick for attorney general. After Sessions became one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump this February, he became an adviser on almost every major decision and policy proposal Trump made during the campaign: -A top Sessions aide helped Trump communicate his immigration policy -Sessions chaired Trump national security advisory committee -Sessions advised Trump on who to choose for vice president. (Sessions was also in the running himself for the No. 2 job.) ""The president-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Senator Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama's attorney general and U.S. attorney,"" a Trump transition statement released Thursday read. ""It is no wonder the people of Alabama re-elected him without opposition.""    Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., talks with reporters as he arrives at Trump Tower Monday. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)  In a relatively short time, Sessions has elevated himself from back-bencher to a ""arguably one of the top 5 power players in the country now,"" said Alabama GOP consultant Brent Buchanan. Here's crash course in a politician likely to be a pivotal figure in Trump's administration: The basics: Sessions has served as a senator from Alabama for two decades. But Alabama is such a loyal state to its top lawmakers that Sessions is actually the junior senator from the state; Sen. Richard Shelby (R) has been in office three decades.   [Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet]   Sessions is popular back home: Aside from his first election in 1996, Sessions has never won with less than 59 percent of the vote. In 2014, he ran unopposed. His full name is: Jefferson Beauregard ""Jeff"" Sessions III. He's ""amnesty's worst enemy"": The conservative National Review crowned Sessions with that title in 2014, with good reason. Sessions has opposed nearly every immigration bill that has come before the Senate the past two decades that has included a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. He's also fought legal immigration, including guest worker programs for illegal immigrants and visa programs for foreign workers in science, math and high-tech. In 2007, Sessions got a bill passed essentially banning for 10 years federal contractors who hire illegal immigrants. ""Legal immigration is the primary source of low-wage immigration into the United States,"" Sessions argued in a 2015 Washington Post op-ed. ""... What we need now is immigration moderation: slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together.""    Sessions endorses Trump in February (John Bazemore/AP)  He's a debt hawk and a military hawk: Sessions, a lawyer before he became a politician, is known for touring Alabama with charts warning of the United States' ""crippling"" debt. On foreign policy, Sessions has advocated a get-tough approach, once voting against an amendment banning ""cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment"" of prisoners. These are two positions that could put him at odd with the president he'll serve: Trump has expensive plans that involve significant spending, like $1 trillion on an infrastructure program -- and he campaigned on a strong non-interventionist worldview (often claiming, inaccurately, that he opposed the Iraq War before it started). He's a climate change skeptic: Here's Sessions in a 2015 hearing questioning Environmental Protection Agency's Gina McCarthy: ""Carbon pollution is CO2, and that's really not a pollutant; that's a plant food, and it doesn't harm anybody except that it might include temperature increases."" Accusations of racism have dogged Sessions's career: Actually, they almost derailed it. In 1986, a Senate committee denied Sessions, then a 39-year-old U.S. attorney in Alabama, a federal judgeship. His former colleagues testified Sessions used the n-word and joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought they were ""okay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana."" By the time the testimony was finished, Sessions's ""reputation was in tatters,"" wrote Isaac Stanley-Becker in The Post this July, on the eve of Sessions delivering a prime-time speech at the Republican National Convention for Trump. In 1986, Sessions defended himself against accusations of racism. ""I am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create,"" he told the very same Senate Judiciary Committee he now sits on. ""I am not a racist. I am not insensitive to blacks."" And he told Stanley-Becker this summer: ""Racism is totally unacceptable in America. Everybody needs to be treated fairly and objectively."" But the Southern Poverty Law Center's Heidi Beirich, who tracks hate speech, said Sessions is guilty of it, and that his mere presence in Trump's inner circle is ""a tragedy for American politics."" He's got a populist streak: Here's one area where he and Trump likely get along swell. Wall Street and corporate executives are often the antagonists in the Alabama senator's speeches. ""A small group of CEOs don't get to set immigration policy for the country,"" he said in a 2014 speech opposing a multi-billion-dollar bill to help control the stem of influx of Central American refugees on the border. As hard-line as Sessions can be, he's worked with Democrats before: ""Say what you will about him,"" former longtime Senate Democratic communications aide Jim Manley told the Almanac of American Politics. ""He was always nice to [the late Ted] Kennedy and other Democrats as well."" Even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him. Stanley-Becker talked to Susan Parker, a Democrat who tried to unseat Sessions in 2002. During a debate, she asked for a tissue and Sessions handed her one. She joked she would use it to dry her eyes when Sessions made her cry, and he responded: ""Please don't say that. That's my nightmare. I promise I'll be nice."" Sessions has joined with Democrats to support criminal justice reform legislation like reducing the disparity between sentence time for crack and powder cocaine (although civil rights advocates say more recently he opposed a bipartisan criminal justice reform package that in part reduced federal sentences.) In 2010 he teamed up with Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) on a proposal to put strict limits on non-military federal spending. It fell one vote short of passing.      Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's White House bid during a joint appearance in his home state. (Reuters)   In 2016, he's gone from fringe to mainstream: Aside from immigration battles, Sessions mostly operated in the background on Capitol Hill. Until 2016. His mix of hard-line immigration position and a populist streak had made him a tea party star and thus a coveted endorsement catch for Republican presidential candidates catering to the tea party. In presidential primary debates, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) would even brag about his ties to Sessions. In the end, Sessions chose Trump, surprising the political establishment by jumping on stage with him at a rally in February in Madison, Ala., two days before Super Tuesday and donning a ""Make America Great Again"" hat. ""I told Donald Trump this isn't a campaign, this is a movement,"" Sessions said at the time. Nine months later, Sessions will be a central figure in transitioning that ""movement"" into a working government.          1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Now the real challenges start.	"   (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)  Election Day was a blowout for the cause of legal marijuana. Ballot measures legalizing medical or recreational cannabis use passed for the first time in seven states, with a defeat in Arizona the only setback for activists. But, as the experiences of other legal-marijuana states show, the thorniest debates are just starting. How should the trade be regulated? Who will benefit financially? How will the federal government act? These questions and others will roil the states for years to come. The presidential and congressional election results have already put some of these measures in peril. Activists knew that an overwhelming show of support for marijuana ballot initiatives could be interpreted as a mandate for lawmakers to reconsider the federal prohibition on the plant. (President Obama added to these hopes by saying that if just five of these states decided to allow a form of cannabis use, that would mean that ""a fifth of the country [is] operating under one set of laws, and four-fifths in another. . . . That is not going to be tenable."") The new political landscape, however -- with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office alongside a Republican-dominated House and Senate -- signals that, despite a groundswell of popular support for marijuana legalization and its growing geographic footprint in America, ending the plant's federal prohibition is unlikely to be a legislative or executive priority. Trump's pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), has said that ""good people don't smoke marijuana "" and that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was ""okay until I found out they smoked pot ."" (An early contender for the job, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, promised in the Republican primary race that he'd terminate legal marijuana in all 50 states.) This doesn't suggest an extension of the Obama administration's noninterference policy. Journalist Tobias Coughlin-Bogue also raises the disturbing possibility that an anti-immigration attorney general -- Sessions's opposition to immigration is well known -- might not disrupt state cannabis initiatives entirely, but could selectively enforce federal drug laws against immigrants and people of color in the cannabis industry. But even if appointed officials honor Trump's professed respect for states' rights , legalization is just the start of a protracted dialogue over how to craft cannabis policy. States that legalized marijuana earlier have contended with unanticipated consequences, as well as social and legal disputes over the rules of a newly sanctioned industry. Take Pueblo, Colo., which became the state's second-largest hub of marijuana production after legalization in 2012. The city voted on two measures in this election, both proposing local bans on the cannabis industry. Proponents argued that legalization has attracted a migration of homeless people from neighboring states, overburdening social services. The measures, in a town where the new industry has yielded thousands of jobs, were soundly rejected. But other cities, such as Los Angeles , are now studying the link between the availability of cannabis and the movements of homeless people, wondering whether to use the tax revenue from cannabis to expand homeless services or just leave them as public costs that other taxpayers are irritated about subsidizing. In California, more than 50 municipalities that correctly anticipated the passage of Proposition 64 (which legalizes and regulates ""adult use"" cannabis in the state) also drafted ballot measures to impose local taxes on pot, all but one of which passed. While tax revenue has helped sell skeptics on the benefits of legalization, if taxes are too severe, they risk driving consumers back to underground suppliers. Proposition 64's proposed statewide tax was controversial: Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML, a pro-pot lobbying group, called it ""inordinately high"" and predicted that it would ""encourage a lot of black-market activity for the foreseeable future."" Steep local taxes could compound this problem, as cities in California passed levies ranging from 3 to 20 percent, which, on top of the state tax, means that for some the cost of medical marijuana will rise by 27 percent. In Montana, where voters originally approved medical marijuana in 2004, voters chose to reform the law this year after a Republican-controlled legislature repealed the original act and replaced it with a far more limited version in 2011. While state Democrats at the time agreed that the original program was too permissive and sponsored the replacement, Republicans added restrictive provisions such as a rule limiting medical marijuana providers to three patients each, suddenly leaving 93 percent of registered patients without any legal means of procuring their medication. The new program voters passed this month is eventually expected to restore access for those temporarily dislocated from a legal supplier. Aside from the legislative and social growing pains of legal pot, municipalities have ethical issues to consider -- namely, who stands to benefit from these new laws. California, recognizing that people of color were most affected by racially biased enforcement of cannabis prohibition, made history with its answer: It's the first legalization initiative to allow drug offenders to participate in the sector from the start, as well as to include reparations for communities torn apart by drug policy. The pro-64 campaign explicitly argued that it's unethical to permanently disenfranchise previous offenders for an act that a majority of voters now deem acceptable. Relatedly, Maryland's Legislative Black Caucus has raised concerns about the fairness and diversity of license distribution for that state's developing medical marijuana program. As these cases demonstrate, legalization often raises surprising social and economic complications that can elicit new resistance. Cannabis consumers and others in legalized communities have good reason to pay attention to these challenges, as they will probably be called on to vote on cannabis regulations again as the industry matures and new concerns crop up. Cases like Pueblo and Montana serve as reminders that policy regression can be as easy as progress. It's also important for the voting public not to merely settle for marijuana legalization as presented, but to put political pressure on their representatives to ensure that cannabis policy mitigates potentially harmful outcomes, such as burdensome taxation, unequal opportunity in the industry and disruption to consumers' medical needs. Given the possibility that state legalization projects could be subject to federal interference (or even prosecution of participants), citizens may need to turn up the heat on their lawmakers to convince them that access to legal cannabis, given the diversity of states now supporting its medical or recreational use, is finally a bipartisan value."

(Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Yeezy Season 3)  Kanye West is no stranger to controversy, nor is he a stranger to pausing his concerts to go on long, politics-laden rants. Thursday night was no different. During the first show of the second leg of his Saint Pablo tour, West paused his San Jose, show to speak about -- take a wild guess -- the election. While West opening up about the momentous election wasn't particularly surprising, his candidate of choice sure was: Donald Trump.   [Kanye West and Donald Trump: Comparing their egos is a sport and Trump doesn't 'get it']   It's important to note that West didn't actually spent his Tuesday earlier this month going all the way to a voting booth, which might have been in a church or even, gasp, a public school. ""I told y'all I didn't vote, right?"" West said to many screaming and adoring fans. Then, he dropped the bombshell. ""But if I would have voted, I would have voted on Trump,"" he said.   ""I would've voted for Trump"" - @kanyewest pic.twitter.com/XtyUteCgUZ -- albertoreyes (@albertoreyes) November 18, 2016   The crowd's screams quickly transformed into confused boos. West is the man who, as The Washington Post noted, did the following: In 2005, Hurricane Katrina decimated New Orleans, killing more than 1,800 people and causing an estimated $96 billion in damage. During a live NBC telethon to raise money for hurricane victims, Kanye went off-script while standing next to an uncomfortable Mike Myers. Kanye famously concluded, before the feed cut away, ""George Bush doesn't care about black people."" To many of his fans, then, it likely seemed strange that he suddenly proffered public support for a man who has in the past several months garnered headlines in national media such as ""Donald Trump Is a Racist,"" ""Here Are 13 Examples Of Donald Trump Being Racist"" and, here in The Washington Post, ""Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist.""   Damn!!! @kanyewest, you're such a disappointment to the Bay Area, to the youth, and this country. #[?] -- Anthony (@FlacoAnthony) November 18, 2016   West didn't appear to offer any concrete reasons as to why he might support a man who once said black people are ""living in hell,"" leading some, such as MTV's Alex Pappademas, to wonder if he was trolling his audience merely to get a rise out of them. (After all, this is the same man who appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine wearing a crown of thorns, next to the tagline ""The Passion of Kanye West."")

During it, the rapper claimed he is still running for president in 2020 (whew!), that he appreciated Trump's debate style and that he is ""glad Trump inspired racists to reveal themselves.""

After all, as The Washington Post noted, comparing the two's egos by this point has become a sport.      During his Nov. 17 show in San Jose, Calif., Kanye West took lengthy breaks to talk about his views on race and the presidential election.

Wants charges dropped.	" Updated A protester who was tackled down a flight of stairs during a rally against Donald Trump at Ohio State University is seeking to drop an assault charge filed against his alleged attacker, saying Tuesday that the incident had nothing to do with politics. ""It has become clear that my assault was not politically motivated in the way that we previously thought, nor was it committed by a Trump supporter,"" Timothy Adams said in a public Facebook post. ""At this time I am working to drop the charges against the person in question."" Police arrested Shane Michael Stanton, 24, on Monday night after video showed him violently shoving Adams from behind as he was addressing a crowd of anti-Trump demonstrators in the university's student union building. He was charged with misdemeanor assault. Stanton's father, John Stanton, told the Columbus Dispatch that his son had Asperger Syndrome, a type of high-functioning autism often marked by difficulty with social interactions. A friend of Stanton's also came to his defense in a widely circulated Facebook post. Drew Riedel described Stanton as a ""loyal, kind and an incredibly fierce friend"" who advocated for gay rights and other causes in what he called the ""developmental disabilities"" community. He said Stanton was a Hillary Clinton supporter. ""Instead of this being the work of some violent crazy person, instead this is a really, really sad and unfortunate turn of events,"" Riedel said. ""I guarantee, no one will have deeper remorse and regret than he will over letting his emotions get the best of him and for what physical damage could have been inflicted upon the victim. So before you assume anything about his character, please refrain."" The International Socialist Organization, of which Adams is a member, helped organize the protest. The group said in a statement that it had received information that ""made us confident"" Stanton should not face charges. ""Initially, with the information available, Tim felt it was important that white nationalists not be further emboldened by this action and decided to pursue criminal charges in the hopes that it might play some role in protecting movement activists from similar or potentially worse harm in the future,"" the statement read. ""Tim and other ISO members are in the process of reaching out to police, prosecutors, and this student's family and friends to have charges dropped immediately and to ensure his quick release from jail.""    An Ohio State University student was arrested Monday night after video showed him violently shoving a protester down a flight of stairs during a rally on campus against the election of Donald Trump. Shane Michael Stanton was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault and placed on indefinite suspension from the university, according to court records and reports from the Lantern, the student newspaper. Video posted by the Lantern and provided to The Washington Post shows a protester, identified as Timothy Adams, standing about halfway up a flight of stairs and addressing a crowd of protesters through a bullhorn in the university's student union. A man in a striped sweater and hat -- identified as Stanton -- charges down the stairs toward Adams and yells, ""You idiot,"" before tackling Adams from behind. The video shows Adams falling several feet onto the floor below. Instantly, a number of protesters surround the attacker, and some of them appear to strike him. Four police officers arrive moments later and carry the man out of the building. As they leave, the crowd of protesters can be heard chanting, ""Shame, shame."" Adams landed face-first on the tile floor, injuring his left hand and shattering his glasses and bullhorn in the fall, the Columbus Dispatch and the Lantern reported. ""Can I finish my speech now?"" Adams reportedly said after the scene calmed down, drawing laughs from the crowd. He told the student paper in an interview later: ""I think, if anything, tonight shows that we really need to bring people into social movements, bring people into social organizations and to come out for each other and stand up for each other. Ultimately, coming together is the only thing that's going to stop any kind of violence.""   Happening now: Anti-Trump protestors enter the Ohio Union pic.twitter.com/1Oz8uQEuP5 -- The Lantern (@TheLantern) November 14, 2016   Nationwide anti-Trump protests have entered a second week on Tuesday, with thousands of people in cities around the country taking to the streets to voice opposition to the president-elect. At least one demonstration in Portland, Ore., turned violent, but gatherings there were peaceful on Sunday night, The Washington Post reported. The incident at Ohio State occurred just before 6 p.m., as about 100 people gathered in the Ohio Union, one of the main student and faculty hubs on campus. Up until that point, the campus had hosted a number of peaceful protests, the Lantern reported. Monday's demonstration began with just a couple dozen people, then grew to more than 100, with some people joining the demonstration from outside the university. The protest was organized by the Socialist Alternative, a national activist group, and Adams was one of the leaders, according to the Lantern. CNN reported that he was a former student who graduated in 2014. Stanton is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday morning, court records show. Attorney information for him was not immediately available. Over the weekend, University President Michael Drake sent out an email telling students and faculty to remain civil in the wake of the election, as the Lantern reported. ""We protect First Amendment rights actively,"" Drake said, ""but we do not under any circumstances tolerate intimidation or threats to students, faculty, staff or visitors to our campus.""

6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/15/the-one-big-thing-i-got-wrong-about-donald-trump/	The one big thing I got wrong about Donald Trump	"   Donald Trump (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)  After Donald Trump romped to the Republican presidential nomination, I started to tell people that there was a 5 percent chance of him doing absolutely anything. As in, if Trump climbed to the top of The Washington Post building and said he was going to jump off and fly, I would -- knowing what I know about gravity -- suggest that he wouldn't fly. But, I wouldn't totally rule out the possibility either. That's an exaggeration -- or is it? -- but it makes the broader point: Trump's march to the Republican nomination broke virtually every rule of politics. So why assume any rules apply to him going forward? That fact always led me to hedge somewhat -- emphasis on somewhat -- about who would win the general election. I wrote -- and said -- many times that Clinton was the clear favorite assuming that all of the traditional ways of measuring campaign success were still relevant. (I make that point toward the end of this panel I did at the Texas Tribune Festival in late September.) But, that caveat was just that -- an attempt to nod to Trump's atypical appeal while assuming that Clinton would win. After all, this was a general election, not a primary. Somewhere north of 100 million people would vote. And that electorate would be younger, less affluent and less white than the primary voters Trump won over. Plus, unlike the 16 people Trump beat in the GOP primary, Clinton wouldn't get caught by surprise by Trump. She and her campaign team had a massive opposition research file on him that, once dropped, would destroy any chance Trump had at winning (or even coming close). Double plus, the electoral map naturally tilts toward Democrats these days, with 18 states plus the District -- adding up to 242 electoral votes -- having voted for the Democratic nominee in every presidential election between 1992 and 2012. In case you spent the past seven days on another planet -- if so, welcome back! -- you know by now that Trump won. Anytime something that runs so counter to my expectations happens, I think it's instructive -- and necessary -- to sort through the assumptions I made that led me to conclude that in 95 percent of the cases in which this election is run, Clinton would win. Having spent a week doing just that, I think I have identified the biggest mistake I made in my reporting and analysis: underestimating how badly people wanted a change from political norms and the risks they were willing to take to get it. Viewed at the 50,000-foot level, this was a race between a qualified lifetime insider and a risky political outsider. That, on its face, was a good dynamic for Trump because of what we knew about the state of the electorate: Large majorities believed the country was headed in the wrong direction. They distrusted everyone in Washington. They felt as though the American Dream was either dead or dying, largely because of years of the elites taking care of themselves at the expense of the average person. Trump was, from the get-go, a flawed messenger for that message. After all, he had spent his entire life in New York. He came from an affluent family and seemed unaware of the uniqueness of his upbringing. (The famous ""small"" $1 million loan from his father being a prime example.) He talked regularly about how rich he was and how smart he was. Then there was all of the controversial things he did and said. A dozen women coming forward alleging sexual assault. The hot-mic ""Access Hollywood"" tape. Trump University. Khizr Khan. The Trump Foundation. Alicia Machado. And a hundred other things -- big and small -- that chipped away at his image. That damage -- both self-inflicted and that which the Clinton team inflicted -- convinced me that Trump was essentially disqualified in the eyes of a majority of the country. That, no, they didn't love voting for Clinton but they viewed voting for Trump as a dangerous decision that could have society-affecting consequences. The exit poll shows how wrong I was. Trump's image was in the garbage. Just 38 percent of voters had a favorable opinion about him. Only one in three thought he was ""honest and trustworthy."" Less than four in 10 (38 percent) said Trump was qualified to serve as president. Thirty-five percent said he was temperamentally fit to be president. Based on all elections before this one, those numbers are losers. Trump had been judged by the public and been found wanting. Period. Except that people weren't voting on the candidates' personalities or stances on issues or anything like that. They were voting for change. They knew that Trump wasn't ready for the job -- and that he might never be. But, they concluded that it was a risk worth taking because, well, how could he be any worse than the politicians they already had? That desire for radical change at any cost is illustrated in the exit poll when voters were asked which character trait of the candidates mattered most to them. Almost 40 percent chose ""can bring needed change"" -- double the amount who chose the next most popular option (""has the right experience"" -- 21 percent). Among the group that put a premium on change, Trump won 83 percent to 14 percent(!). That's the election right there. People wanted a change so desperately that they were willing to ignore -- or focus less on -- all of the problems they had with Trump. He was new and had never done this whole politics thing before. Clinton was the dictionary definition of the establishment. That was it. Knowing what I knew about how Trump won the Republican primary and how anxious and angry people were at politics and politicians, I should have known better than to assume that Trump's image issues would trump (ahem!) the deeper underlying dynamic of ""change vs. more of the same."" This election is a reminder -- yet again -- that I (and most of us in the political world) have a tendency to overthink how voters make up their minds. They hated the status quo. They wanted something else. Trump was the something else. Lesson learned. Onward."

The controls reflect the ruling party's determination to maintain a rock-solid hold on politics at all levels, galvanized in recent years by President Xi Jinping's steady accumulation of political authority that has made him the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s.  ""My reason for joining in the people's congress elections is simple and innocent. Everyone has the right to take part in elections,"" Liu, 45, said in a recent interview. ""These people are really taking it too far."" An initial attempt to interview Liu at the shack she's been living in since her home was demolished was blocked by at least seven men who identified themselves only as ""volunteers"" and parked a car across the road to block access. Interviewed later over FaceTime, a video chat service, Liu said 10 to 20 people were outside her door and keeping her from leaving. Such harassment appears routine for independent candidates amid elections for more than 2 million members of county and district people's congresses, the only level of citizens' representatives selected by direct vote. Across the country, independents report being kept under tight supervision and prevented from campaigning. Grassroots pro-democracy activist Yao Lifa, who has been intermittently detained since first winning election in 1998, has been out of contact for weeks, apparently while under detention, supporters say. Yao has been prevented from running for his old seat. Xi's administration has warned consistently against the pernicious influence of Western concepts such as free speech and multiparty democracy, while pursuing a brawny take on Chinese nationalism that has manifested itself in an assertive push for dominance in Asia. Donald Trump's election in a highly divisive campaign in the United States is seen as bolstering such sentiments, with Beijing's leaders increasingly convinced that their authoritarian system will prove triumphant while America's global influence steadily declines, analysts say.  ""If China wants to say democracy is not a good thing, this (U.S. election) certainly is good for them,"" said David Zweig, director of the Center on China's Transnational Relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. This year's local polls are particularly significant as a precursor to the selection of the roughly 2,300 delegates to next year's party national congress, where Xi will gain a second five-year term as party chief. Despite the various barriers imposed, the elections have attracted a wave of independent candidates hailing broadly from China's burgeoning ""rights defense"" movement. They include those seeking redress over personal issues such as the confiscation of property and idealists working for fair competition in politics, said Li Fan, an advocate of elections reforms in China.  ""They want to use the position of people's congress delegates to first, have their say, and second, to use legal means to vote or take policy actions to supervise and rein in illegal government actions,"" said Li. An additional motivation comes from the protection such representatives enjoy from arrest and detention, he said.  ""They're not government officials so their power is limited, but they have the right to speak and to supervise government,"" Li said, pointing to the example of past delegates to Beijing's Haidian district congress who passed measures to allow the children of migrants to attend local schools. On the surface, the rules for registering as a candidate are simple and inclusive. Apart from those put forward by the party, official organizations or government work units, candidates need endorsements from just 10 supporters to qualify for the polls. In reality, however, the government and party officials interfere by screening candidates, preventing undesirables from running or even taking office should they win, advocacy group China Human Rights Defenders said in a recent report. Most would-be independents are party members or have received some form of official approval and can be expected to toe the party line, said Li, who was interviewed in Hong Kong. While China has eight mostly tiny minority parties, they exist only to advise and assist the ruling party, not to offer a political alternative. The country's rulers treat the idea of a loyal opposition as anathema and even factionalism within the Communist Party is formally condemned. Because people's congresses at the city, provincial and national level are mainly elected by delegates at the next-lowest level, their loyalty to the ruling party is virtually assured. Only delegates to congresses at the county, township and urban district level are directly elected. Following a brief period of openness, the government's attitude toward independent candidates began hardening a decade ago and grew especially tough during elections in 2011 as Xi was preparing to take power, Li said.  ""The law hasn't changed. It's the government's attitude that has changed,"" Li said. Liu, the Beijing candidate, said that given the oppressive surveillance, she's been limited to communicating with potential voters via China's popular but heavily censored microblogging services. The entire experience has been depressing, she allows.  ""It's affecting my life. I'm feeling the pressure,"" Liu said. ___ Associated Press video journalists Josie Wong and Johnson Lai contributed to this report from Hong Kong. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

On the other side of the globe, in Southeast Asia, a gun-slinging vigilante who vowed to kill all criminals and dump their bodies until the ""fish will grow fat"" was elected to lead a nation of 100 million. And in Britain, voters with a centuries-long streak of moderation and pragmatism opted to ignore the overwhelming advice of experts by leaping into the abyss of life outside the European Union. The populist wave of 2016 that carried Trump to the pinnacle of international power and influence didn't start in the United States. And it certainly won't end there.  Instead, the biggest prize yet for a global movement built on a seemingly bottomless reserve of political, economic and cultural grievance is likely to be an accelerant to even more victories for people and causes bent on upending the existing world order.      Many far-right parties in Europe are celebrating the presidential victory of Donald J. Trump. (Jason Aldag,Ishaan Tharoor/The Washington Post)   ""Success breeds success,"" said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""Right now, everyone is susceptible to it. The drivers seem to be universal.""   [Can Trump's win boost France's far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen?]  And unless something dramatic changes to curb the populist appeal, a scattering of surprise victories this year could soon turn into a worldwide rout -- the triumph of those who preach strong action over rule of law, unilateralism instead of cooperation and the interests of the majority above the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. ""Their world is collapsing,"" tweeted a jubilant Florian Philippot, senior adviser to French far-right leader Marine le Pen, following Trump's victory. ""Ours is being built."" With French presidential elections due next spring, Le Pen is well placed to add Paris to the list of world capitals that have fallen to the populist tide. She is seen as a lock to make it to the final round of voting, and although her chances have long been discounted among political prognosticators in France, that changed after Trump's victory. Well before France votes, Austria could become the first country to elect a far-right head of state in Western Europe since 1945 when it picks a president next month. On the same day, Dec. 4, Italians will vote in a constitutional referendum that could bring down the center-left government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi -- while boosting the fortunes of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. More shocks looming Although the exact causes of the populist surge vary from country to country, the broad outlines are similar across national boundaries.          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

Unease with the cultural implications of an increasingly interconnected world. And alienation from a self-serving political class that aligns with the wealthy at the expense of the working class. That the populist leaders are often wealthy sons of privilege who bear little relation to the masses they claim to speak for doesn't matter. ""People feel they need a powerful champion to blow the establishment to smithereens,"" Leonard said. ""Whether the leaders are the same as the people they represent matters less than the fact that they have the intent to disrupt.""  That was certainly the case with Trump, an Ivy League-educated billionaire urbanite who won biggest in rural areas and among less-educated voters. It was true, as well, when Britain voted in June to get out of the E.U. The voters who backed that cause were predominantly from England's small towns and struggling, postindustrial cities -- well outside the booming, cosmopolitan metropolis of London. Voters who wanted to jettison the Brussels bureaucracy ranked immigration atop their list of concerns and tended to be less educated than those who wanted Britain to maintain its ties across the English Channel.  Yet the movement was led by well-to-do politicians with pedigrees from the nation's fanciest schools. Together, they championed a once-fringe idea and, by urging voters to ""Take Back Control"" of their own affairs, turned it into a cause that a majority of the country's voters could back. One of them, former commodities trader Nigel Farage, later became Trump's most outspoken overseas backer -- appearing with him at campaign stops and urging the New York businessman to follow the Brexit model to victory.  Trump did just that, promising ""Brexit times five"" -- and delivering.  Farage has pledged to help replicate the electoral success of Brexit and Trump across the West. The longtime leader of the anti-immigration U.K. Independence Party on Saturday became the first British politician to meet with the president-elect, spending an hour with him at Trump Tower and later posting to Twitter a photo of the two men smiling broadly in front of a set of gilded doors. ""Please don't for a minute think that the change ends here,"" Farage wrote Friday in Britain's mass-circulation Sun tabloid. ""Voters across the Western world want nation state democracy, proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives. Further political shocks in Europe and beyond are coming."" Tides beyond Europe Those sorts of shocks are a new feature of the post-World War II order in the democracies that ring the North Atlantic. They're more familiar in the developing world. But there, as well, the populist tide is resurgent -- and for some of the same reasons that it is rising in the more affluent West.  [Philippines' Duterte says he and Trump are 'alike' -- at least in their coarse language]  In May, Filipinos elected as their president Rodrigo Duterte, a man who spent 20 years running a city in the southern Philippines as a mob boss runs a block. Duterte, once nicknamed ""the death squad mayor,"" was famous for patrolling the streets on a motorbike, weapon at the ready. He bragged about taking justice into his own hands.   As a presidential candidate, Duterte promised violence. He vowed to rid the nation of crime in a matter of months with a vividly apocalyptic vision that involved eliminating ""all"" suspected criminals. Thousands of people identified as drug dealers and users have since been killed.  As the first president from the southern island of Mindanao, he said, he would challenge Manila's political class, end politics-as-usual and protect the poor.  That vision resonated among Filipinos who were fed up with the crass corruption of the country's feudalistic ruling families and outraged by ineffectual police and courts. Duterte, the son of a governor, cast himself as their street-smart savior. He talked like the overconfident older kid on the block, joking about rape, threatening to shoot people and salting his speeches with curse terms, such as ""son of a whore."" The bloodshed and tough talk are fueled, in part, by nostalgic nationalism. When Duterte rails against U.S. colonialism, he appeals to a wounded patriotism, promising to make the country more independent -- to make the Philippines great again. Anti-establishment political upheaval has also been a prominent feature of Brazilian politics in recent months -- most dramatically in the controversial August impeachment of leftist president Dilma Rousseff, whose Workers' Party had run Brazil for 13 years before her ouster.  Stained by accusations over corruption and its economic mismanagement that many blamed for Brazil's recession, the Workers' Party took a hammering in last month's municipal elections. Unconventional politicians were in many cases the beneficiaries. In Rio, an evangelical bishop was elected mayor. In Sao Paulo, Joao Doria, a millionaire businessman campaigning as a nonpolitician, won South America's biggest city and its economic powerhouse. Cementing the comparisons to Trump, Doria had starred in Brazil's version of the reality TV show, ""The Apprentice."" The morning after Trump's victory, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right lawmaker with presidential ambitions, took to Twitter to congratulate him and promise a similar upset in Brazil's 2018 elections. #Bolsonaro2018 began trending on Twitter. Oscar Vidarte, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, said Trump resembles a classic Latin American type of populist, the caudillo,  a Spanish term that translates roughly to ""strongman"" or a leader with authoritarian tendencies.   ""Trump fits the bill,"" Vidarte said. ""But in Latin America, the rise of caudillos is enabled by weak institutions. In the U.S., you have to look for different reasons.""  Although outsiders continue to be elected in Latin America -- a TV comedian, James Morales, recently won the presidency in Guatemala -- longtime strongmen have struggled.  If anything, there is now a backlash against them. Argentina last year voted for an end to a decade of governance by Nestor and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. A referendum in Bolivia blocked the reelection of President Evo Morales and Venezuela's Chavismo, after 17 years in power, appears to be on its last legs.   Indeed, the most effective way to defeat the populist wave, said Leonard, is often to let them govern. ""They don't do very well,"" he said.   [Reaction to a Hitler exhibit shows how nervous Germans still are about the Nazis]  Troubles in Germany The most extreme example, of course, is Germany, where the country's election of a charismatic populist proved catastrophic for the world. Because of the country's Nazi history, its postwar political system has been designed to defend minority rights and prevent a majoritarian takeover. But terrorist attacks by Islamist radicals and a record wave of Middle Eastern migrants are now testing the national will. The fast-growing Alternative for Germany party, founded in 2013, has galvanized the anti-Islam ranks. The AfD unveiled a scathing denunciation of the faith this year, warning against ""the expansion and presence of a growing number of Muslims"" on German soil. Adding fuel to the party's campaign, German authorities have arrested more than a dozen suspected extremists, many of whom entered Germany by masquerading as migrants.   With national elections next year, the party is now supported by nearly 1 in 6 voters and has staged startling gains this year in local elections.   Jurgen Falter, a political scientist and expert on the far-right, described the party's leadership as ""not real neo-Nazis, but rather close."" Its voter base, however, is larger -- an amalgamation of Germans fearing everything from foreigners to globalization.   ""They managed to get some more moderate and less moderate people supporting them who feel threatened by modernization, by refugees, by Islam,"" he said. ""And now we are talking about some Trump voters, as well."" Even in Germany, the political unthinkable can no longer be so easily discounted.  Rauhala reported from Manila.

(Tiziana Fabi, Timothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  The similarities between former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and President-elect Donald Trump run the gamut, including their fake tans and their brash talk. During the U.S. election season, however, Berlusconi remained quiet about the man many view as his American counterpart. But with the election wrapped up, he was more forthcoming, saying in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that the parallels between him and Trump are ""obvious."" ""He, too, is an entrepreneur that at a point in his life decided to devote his skills and energies to his own country. And he was voted by all the Americans that are tired of old politics, shut in themselves, that have grown unable to listen and understand,"" Berlusconi said ""A policy that made the same mistake typical of the left all over the world: thinking that being 'politically correct' is the way to be close to people's needs, without understanding that the actual weak are the citizens oppressed by the state, taxes, bureaucracy, uncontrolled immigration, unemployment, the terrorist threat."" Berlusconi held Italy's highest office for about nine years, in four stints -- the longest of any Italian leader since World War II. Before entering politics, he presided over a vast media empire and amassed wealth greater than Trump's, according to calculations by Forbes magazine. In 2012, a year after losing elections, he was convicted of tax fraud. The next year, he was convicted of paying an underage prostitute for sex, though the conviction was overturned on appeal a year later. Both men have been accused of grossly and criminally abusing women yet have openly bragged about their sexual exploits. Both claim that their independent wealth means they have no stake in using political power to enrich themselves. Hailing from the business elite, they have railed against political elites of all ideologies, and voters have loved them for it. Berlusconi told Corriere della Sera that it would be incorrect to see Trump or him as part of a right-wing movement. Rather, he said, they are part of a populist center. ""I don't represent 'the right', I represent a liberal middle of the people in which the best political traditions of our country came together: from the Catholic one to reformative socialism, liberalism and a democratic, responsible right,"" he said. ""As far as these political definitions go, and I think they're less significant by the day, my role has been and will always be this. About Trump's economic policy, there are many similarities and some differences between [his] program and ours: [His] tax policies can be appreciated, as well as his focus on controlling migration . . . I don't agree with his protectionist choices and the isolationist tendencies he expressed. But politics taught me that leaders must not be judged on their programs but on their actions. We'll watch him at work."" One foreign leader for whom both Berlusconi and Trump have expressed admiration is Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shares many of their traits, including populism and alleged womanizing. Recent reports suggest that Trump's presidential campaign was in touch with members of Putin's government, and Democrats repeatedly alleged that Putin's intelligence agencies were meddling in the U.S. electoral process to Trump's benefit. Berlusconi and Putin are close friends, and they often go on vacation and throw parties together. ""Trump understood something of fundamental importance: the Russian Federation needs be considered a full-fledged Western country,"" said Berlusconi, echoing sentiments that Putin has voiced repeatedly. ""We need Russia to face -- together -- the dramatic problems of the international arena: from Islamist extremism to the wave of migrants. Up until now President Putin has shown himself capable of facing the challenges of our time before and better than the other international leaders."" Berlusconi, 80, is hoping to return to political relevance in Italy after his tax fraud conviction and health problems have kept him out of the limelight. On Dec. 4, Italy will hold a referendum on constitutional reform that is being seen as a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who has threatened to resign if he loses the vote. Berlusconi's Forza Italia political party has recently been polling at about 12 percent. Stefano Pitrelli in Rome contributed to this report.
