Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said NAFTA benefits workers and companies on both sides of the border. Still, he expressed concern that the U.S. could be turning its back on a bilateral trade relationship responsible for moving $1 million worth of goods every minute.  ""In the face of Trump's positioning, we're now in a stage of favoring dialogue as a way to build a new agenda in our bilateral relationship,"" Pena Nieto told business leaders. ""Mexico, like the entire world, is about to initiate a new stage with the U.S. and in commercial terms we want to give the right value to this strategic relationship between Mexico and the U.S."" New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key spoke more bluntly, saying the ""tremendous despair"" triggered by Trump's trade views can't be allowed to slow down economic integration by the rest of the world.  ""Even if the United States doesn't want to engage in free trade, President Trump needs to know other countries do,"" said Key. He said it's still possible to save the 12-nation TPP negotiated by the Obama administration by introducing cosmetic changes making it acceptable to Trump or carving out a less ambitious pact among TPP signatories that leaves out the U.S.  ""I personally think that President Trump will be very much like chairman of the corporation Trump is,"" he said. ""He's a flexible business guy. He's going to realize he has a role to play."" Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered perhaps the most-forceful defense of free trade, given the size of his economy. In his kickoff speech from Peru he said the best response to rising protectionism would be for APEC's 21 members to negotiate a free trade area encompassing the entire Pacific Rim.  ""Closed and inclusive arrangements are not the right choice,"" Xi said, taking a veiled stab at the TPP, which excludes China and is widely seen as an attempt to reassert U.S. dominance in Asia. ""Building a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific is a strategic initiative critical for long-term prosperity."" Xi's remarks came as Chinese state media blasted Trump for ""trade-bashing"" rhetoric that threatens global economic stability.  ""The billionaire-turned-politician needs to prove that derailing the global economy has not been one of the reasons why he ran for U.S. president,"" official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary piece published Saturday. President Barack Obama warned against a rush to judgment on Trump, saying at a town hall on the margins of the summit that it's too early to conclude that the new administration will wipe out trade deals and create international problems.  ""Don't just assume the worst,"" he said. ""Wait until the administration's in place"" before drawing conclusions. ___ Associated Press writers Darlene Superville, Franklin Briceno and Paul Traynor contributed to this report.

New York housing police Chief James Secreto says one male and one female officer encountered the man around 1 p.m. Saturday on the ninth floor of the Van Dyke Houses in the Brownsville neighborhood. The New York Police Department's Housing Bureau officers were responding to a 911 call reporting a suspicious person. When they asked for his ID, a scuffle ensued during which Secreto says the man grabbed one officer's collapsible, metal baton and struck both in the head. The chief says the officers fired, killing the man. One officer suffered a gash, the other suffered contusions. Authorities did not immediately release the names of those involved.

Danny Davis, Chicago police said Saturday. At least two attackers went to the home of 15-year-old Javon Wilson in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago on Friday night and shot him in the head after an argument, police said.  ""This stems from a dispute over shoes, basketball shoes,"" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Guglielmi said Wilson knew his attackers and they may have been friends at some point. The shooting was not, as previously reported, a home invasion. Davis, a Democratic member of the House for 20 years, told The Associated Press Saturday that his grandson was a victim of a world where gun violence has become commonplace.  ""It's almost, just the way it is. People think nothing of it,"" Davis said.  ""Youngsters invariably say, 'I know a lot of guys who've got guns. I know a lot of girls who've got guns,'"" Davis said. ""It becomes a part of the culture of an environment that has got to change."" Chicago has seen a dramatic rise in the number of shootings and homicides, with August being the deadliest month in the city in two decades. There have been 673 homicides so far this year, including the fatal shootings of the cousin of Chicago Bulls basketball star Dwyane Wade, a Chicago police officer's son and the son of a famed percussionist. Davis said he was told a 15-year-old boy had traded slacks for shoes with Wilson's 14-year-old brother, but thought better of the trade and went to Wilson's house with a 17-year-old woman. He said the pair forced their way in the house and argued with Wilson before the boy pulled a gun and fired. Police have not arrested anyone or named any suspects, but Guglielmi said investigators have good leads. Davis, who was re-elected this month to his 11th term in the 7th Congressional District and is a former Chicago alderman, was in Chicago on Friday and spoke with reporters after talking to police. He wondered how the shooter obtained the gun and said he'd continue to try to combat gun violence. Davis said his grandson was ""a pretty regular kid"" who loved playing basketball and knew all the pros and their stats, who also loved music and whose grades were improving after a rough patch.  ""The question becomes where does a 15-year-old obtain a gun? Who let the 15-year-old have a gun and under what circumstances?"" Davis asked. ""There's no answer for that except that the availability of guns is so prevalent in America to the point where you almost can't tell who has a gun"" anymore. ___ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the victim's name to Javon.

The government identified the arrested man only as ""Benito N"" and alleged he was responsible for a significant amount of the bloodshed in the popular beach destination. A statement released late Friday said his arrest was one of the state's top security priorities. Local media said the suspect was the head of assassins for the Beltran Lleyva cartel in Acapulco. In spite of a high security presence, killings are up 5 percent this year over a very bloody 2015 in Acapulco. Authorities say 790 homicides were recorded from January through October. Also late Friday, Roberto Alvarez, spokesman for security forces in the southern state of Guerrero, said state police were searching for 12 to 14 people kidnapped Thursday night from the township of Ajuchitlan del Progreso. Witnesses told police that about 30 armed men kidnapped the victims, which included some minors, Alvarez said. Relatives reported already receiving calls demanding ransom for their release. Local residents blamed a group called Los Tequileros, he said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Pence was booed by some audience members when he first walked in. (Twitter/Hamilton via Storyful)   The cast of ""Hamilton"" was not going to throw away its shot. After Friday evening's performance, at which Vice President-elect Mike Pence was in the audience, several dozen of the Broadway musical's cast zeroed in on Pence during their curtain call. Brandon Victor Dixon -- the actor who plays Aaron Burr -- stepped forth and cut through the applause. ""You know, we have a guest in the audience this evening,"" he said to audience laughter. ""And Vice President-elect Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you will hear us just a few more moments. There's nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen. There's nothing to boo here. We're all here sharing a story of love. We have a message for you, sir. We hope that you will hear us out."" As he pulled a small piece of paper from his pocket, Dixon encouraged people to record and share what he was about to say ""because this message needs to be spread far and wide.""   ['Hamilton': Making ecstatic history]   ""Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you, and we truly thank you for joining us here at 'Hamilton: An American Musical.' We really do,"" Dixon said to further applause. ""We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us. Again, we truly thank you truly for seeing this show, this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colors, creeds and orientations.""      Some audience members booed Vice President-elect Mike Pence as he walked to his seat at a ""Hamilton"" show, held at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York on Nov. 18. (Storyful)   Pence reportedly left the auditorium before Dixon finished speaking, but a show spokesman told the Associated Press that the vice president-elect stood in the hallway and heard the full message. The unusual address quickly went viral and drew not one but two tweets from President-elect Donald Trump, who demanded the next morning that the cast apologize. ""Hamilton,"" a musical about the rise of Alexander Hamilton from his humble beginnings as an orphan and an immigrant to become one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, has a famously diverse cast. One of its oft-touted lyrics -- ""Immigrants, we get the job done!"" -- attracted a standing ovation in the middle of Friday's show, according to theatergoers who were in the room where it happened. (The lyric also appeared on a sign Friday night just outside the Richard Rodgers Theatre, where dozens had gathered to protest Pence.) Twitter exploded late Friday night with responses that cleaved into two camps: Those who cheered the cast for voicing their concerns so directly and those who found the exchange ""rude."" In the latter was Trump, who said that the cast had ""harassed"" Pence with ""cameras blazing.""   Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016     The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016   ""The Theater must always be a safe and special place,"" Trump tweeted as a follow-up. ""The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!"" Dixon responded to Trump on Twitter, saying that conversation did not amount to harassment and that he appreciated that Pence stopped to listen.   @realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen. -- Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) November 19, 2016   By Saturday morning, both #NameAPenceMusical and #BoycottHamilton were trending on Twitter. The barrage of tweets was, well, nonstop. For every tweet that threatened a boycott of the musical, there was another that cheekily mocked it -- or even encouraged a boycott, if it would mean a greater chance of getting tickets.   [Peter Marks: Why Trump gets theater completely and utterly wrong]   Although the Broadway cast's message was directed broadly at what would be an administration under Trump's presidency, Pence himself has a political track record that has been excoriated by the LGBT community. Last year, as governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act after the federal courts ruled that same-sex marriage bans in states were unconstitutional. Under the new state law, Indiana business owners could cite their religious beliefs if they didn't want to participate in same-sex weddings. Opponents said it amounted to allowing discrimination based on sexual orientation. A week later, after facing boycotts and widespread condemnation from rights groups, Pence signed an amendment clarifying that the law could not be used to discriminate against the LGBT community. He has a ""0%"" rating from the Human Rights Campaign, a nonprofit group that calls Pence ""notoriously anti-LGBTQ"" when he was chosen to be Trump's running mate. Republican Chrys Kefalas outlined Pence's anti-LGBT record in a guest column for The Washington Post: During his public career, Pence has been an outspoken opponent of equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens. In Congress, he opposed efforts to encourage foreign governments to decriminalize homosexuality and sought to block the repeal of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. As a governor, he stood against not only marriage equality, but civil unions as well. He also opposed a law prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people in the workplace and signed one opening the door to wide-ranging discrimination against these residents of his own state under the guise of religious liberty. None of this was lost on the audience, who greeted Pence's arrival to his prime orchestra seat with a mix of cheers and boos, according to the AP. Dixon told Broadway.com after Friday's performance that the cast was alerted ahead of time that Pence would be in the audience, and that they spoke to Lin-Manuel Miranda, who created ""Hamilton,"" as well as show producer Jeffrey Seller. Sam Rudy, the show's publicist, later said the speech was composed collectively by Dixon, Miranda, Seller and director Thomas Kail ""with input from members of the company."" The text was completed minutes before the end of the performance, Rudy said.   Proud of @HamiltonMusical. Proud of @BrandonVDixon, for leading with love. And proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater. -- Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) November 19, 2016   ""When we first got the call that [Pence] was coming, there was certainly a question of what we would do,"" Dixon told Broadway.com, which covers Broadway news. ""These are the opportunities that you die for."" Dixon added that he saw Pence enjoying the show and hoped the future vice president would remember the cast.   ['Hamilton's America' tells the story of a great American and a great musical]   ""I truly believe we had an effect,"" Dixon told the site. ""... If you have differences, say something! What better place than on this stage telling this story with these people? I hope he thinks of us every time he has to deal with an issue or talk about a bill or present anything."" It is unclear how Pence gained entrance to Friday's performance; spokespersons for the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to questions by email Saturday. Rudy, the show's spokesman, did not offer additional comments Saturday beyond a transcript of the speech Dixon gave. ""Hamilton"" the musical was inspired by historian Ron Chernow's biography, and Miranda also uses Hamilton's life to relay the complicated, fraught story of the American Revolution. The musical is, among many things, about the difficulty of independent governance and about the Founding Fathers' struggle to establish a democracy, despite their human flaws and differences. It is all told through a mix of hip-hop, R&B, rap and pop songs.    Like the titular character, ""Hamilton"" the musical faced unlikely odds for success. In 2009, Miranda and his musical collaborator, Alex Lacamoire, debuted a rough draft of the opening number at the White House Poetry Jam. ""I'm actually working on a hip-hop album,"" Miranda said in his introduction. ""It's a concept album about the life of someone I think embodies hip-hop: Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton."" The audience at the time, which included President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, rewarded Miranda with enthusiastic applause -- but also some apprehensive laughter. It was, after all, pitched as a hip-hop musical set in the late 1700s about a treasury secretary. Would anyone, let alone a Broadway audience, watch such a show? The answer has been a resounding yes. ""Hamilton"" has been an overwhelming hit since it debuted on Broadway last August. The show won 11 Tony Awards in June, including for best musical. Though many original cast members have since left the show, its popularity has remained unfettered -- to the point where the only ways to nab tickets are to enter a lottery or to pay hundreds of dollars on the resale market. ""We all started laughing, but Lin-Manuel was serious [about 'Hamilton'],"" President Obama said this year, reminiscing about Miranda's visit to the White House seven years ago. ""And who's laughing now?"" Since its Broadway debut, ""Hamilton"" has attracted numerous celebrities and politicians from both sides of the aisle, including Hillary Clinton and Richard B. Cheney. (Lynne Cheney, who is a historian, told the New York Times that she and her husband loved the show: ""The music was terrific. ... It's a play about human beings who achieved greatly."") In the past year, however, the musical has become increasingly politicized. The Obamas have been vocal and unabashed fans of the musical, as well as Miranda's body of work. In October, Miranda and actress Renee Elise Goldsberry rewrote the lyrics to ""Ten Duel Commandments"" and performed the rap in support of Clinton at a fundraiser for the Democratic presidential nominee.

Spanish officials say the games originally scheduled for next year in the northeastern region of Tarragona will now be held in 2018 from June 22-July 1. The decision was made to give organizers and officials more time to get the event properly funded. Spain endured 10 months of political impasse following two inconclusive elections, hurting the government's ability to approve budgets. The political deadlock ended last month but Tarragona Mayor Josep Felix Ballesteros said this week the lack of a stable government ""hindered the financing that had been originally planned"" for the event. It will be the 18th edition of the Mediterranean Games, with about 4,000 competitors from 26 countries. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/09/being-a-muslim-in-trumps-america-is-frightening-heres-how-we-can-survive/	Being a Muslim in Trump’s America is frightening. Here’s what we can do in response.	"   Muslim Boy Scouts gather before a Trump sign. (Andre Chung for The Washington Post)  In the seismic aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, there is only silver lining for millions of women, African Americans, Hispanics, people with disabilities and 7 million American Muslims like me. Now, every minority demographic group in the United States must now feel a sense of collective urgency to mobilize together for the future of our multicultural society based on what we witnessed during this presidential election. In addition to his blatant misogyny and anti-immigrant xenophobia during his presidential campaign, we have also seen Donald Trump's political campaign successfully normalize Islamophobia as part of the current national Republican Party platform as it exists today. But it is important to keep in mind that Islamophobia in America did not begin with Trump and it will not end with Trump. Former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson once noted in a Washington Post column that Islamophobia is becoming an entrenched platform within the Republican Party. Gerson observed that during the last two presidential nomination cycles, Republican candidates, at various points, have proposed requiring a loyalty oath for Muslims to serve in government and ruled out Muslims serving in their administration; called sharia law ""a mortal threat to the survival of freedom in the United States""; described Muslim immigration as ""colonization"" warning that Muslim immigrants ""want to come and conquer us""; said there were only a handful of ""reasonable, moderate followers of Islam,"" and described Islam as ""a religion that promotes the most murderous mayhem on the planet."" Trump took these Islamophobic tendencies to new levels when he famously proclaimed that we needed to implement ""a total and complete shutdown"" of Muslims entering the United States. After the emotional speech from Khizr Khan at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, instead of praising the Muslim Gold Star family, Donald Trump instead publicly implied that Ghazala Khan -- Khizr's wife -- was not ""allowed to speak"" at the Democratic convention because of her Muslim culture. He also once told Yahoo News that he would actually consider requiring Muslim-Americans to register with an official government database or even possibly mandating that we be required to carry special identification cards with us at all times. In a rare display of journalistic pushback, after Donald Trump once confirmed to reporters that he would set up a database for Muslim Americans, an NBC News reporter asked him point-blank in response: ""Is there a difference between requiring Muslims to register and Jews in Nazi Germany?"" ""You tell me,"" Trump replied while walking away. Aside from his blatant Islamophobia, we have also seen Donald Trump make abhorrent statements about many other disenfranchised groups within America today. From referring to Mexicans as ""rapists"" to suggesting that we implement a national policy of ""stop and frisk,"" which disparately impacts the African American community, the political campaign of Donald Trump proves that there still remains a critical mass of white nationalists who do not care if their presidential candidate shows a blatant disdain for millions of women, Hispanics, people with disabilities or Muslims across America. In the live on-air words of CNN contributor Van Jones on election night, Trump's presidential campaign was a successful ""white-lash"" against immigrants, African Americans and Muslims in the United States today. But on behalf of minorities across this country, we will not be afraid of demagogues like Trump. If there is one silver lining for the American Muslim community in the aftermath of the Trump campaign, it is that Muslims have politically mobilized at the local grass roots level in ways that have never been seen before. We saw major voter registration drives at mosques and Islamic community centers across the country as American Muslims realized the potential stakes of a Trump presidency. Some rays of hope at the political level included the victory of a 34-year-old Muslim woman named Ilhan Omar as she successfully became the first Somali-American woman to be elected to a state legislature in Minnesota. In Michigan, professional WWE wrestler Terrance ""Rhyno"" Guido Gerin was also handily defeated by Muslim-American Abdullah Hammoud in the race for Michigan's 15th House District seat. And Muslim representative Keith Ellison retained his congressional seat in Minnesota's 5th district. There are millions of Americans, including myself, who are stunned that we have just elected a misogynistic and xenophobic polemicist as our commander in chief for the next four years. But we shouldn't let our shock or despair paralyze us. In fact, now more than ever it is a civic duty and moral imperative for Hispanics, women, Muslims and every other minority group in America to mobilize together to neutralize the effect of Trump's rise on our great nation."

Pete Ricketts, center, greets state senators as he arrives at the Legislative Chamber to deliver the annual State of the State address in January. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik)  Governors, even those in states with weak executive power, have some big tools at their disposal to help advance their agenda. They can use their words, presence and political leverage to try to advance their agenda. But one of the nation's governors has another potent weapon in his arsenal: a multi-million dollar fortune he's using to promote his political agenda, and take on his enemies -- including members of his own party. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts (R), son of the multi-billionaire TD Ameritrade founder and part owner of the Chicago Cubs Joe Ricketts, has dumped hundreds of thousands of dollars of his own personal money on a pro-death penalty referendum -- a referendum that directly reverses the legislature's historic repeal of the death penalty last year, something they did over his veto.   [Nebraska and the conservative case for opposing the death penalty]   All told, Ricketts has donated more than $400,000 to the referendum and campaigns that will reverse decisions -- and, in at least one case, oust someone who opposed him in his tumultuous first year as governor. What he's doing is legal. If you've got the money, you can spend it, especially in a state like Nebraska with very few campaign finance laws. ""The idea that money is speech, he doesn't lose that right when he becomes governor,"" said Kytja Weir with the nonpartisan, investigative news organization Center for Public Integrity. But it is rare. And Ricketts has his allies and opponents in Nebraska on edge because -- well, it just feels weird. ""It's like he's single-handedly trying to get rid of those who opposed him,"" said GOP state Sen. Colby Coash, who voted to repeal the death penalty last year. (Coash is not on the ballot because of term limits.) ""Those of us who care about process and separation of powers, it makes us nervous that that line is getting blurrier."" The Republican speaker of the legislature, Galen Hadley, told the Omaha-World Herald the governor is sending a ""chilling"" message to lawmakers: ""I'm concerned about the independence of the legislature as a third branch of government."" Ricketts' spokesperson did not return repeated calls for comment. Of course, Ricketts isn't the first really rich governor to use his own bank account to give his agenda a boost. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) has donated millions to various groups and campaigns inside Illinois and outside, Weir noted. And former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions and millions across the country on his pet issues like gun control and the soda tax ($19 million on a soda tax ballot initiative in San Francisco this year alone). But Ricketts is the first governor Weir can think of to use his money to try to reverse decisions the legislature made over his objection. And the direct money trail is unusually clear: from Ricketts' bank account straight to the pro-death-penalty campaign, or Ricketts' bank account to a challenger of one of his Republican opponents (he's endorsed two other challengers of sitting Republicans). There are also several national, conservative dark money groups, like Citizens for Sound Government and the Judicial Crisis Network, that have given to the pro-death penalty side.       Polling is scant on the death penalty referendum, but those who want to keep it repealed are readjusting their expectations. Even though Americans are moving away from the death penalty, Nebraska remains a deep-red state, and its residents have traditionally favored it. One August poll by supporters of the death penalty suggested Nebraskans favored reinstating it by a margin of 2-to-1, although opponents quickly contested the methodology.   [Death penalty support is no longer a given in red states]   The battle over the death penalty is may seem like an odd issue to grab center stage in a state that hasn't executed anyone in nearly two decades. The last time Nebraska carried out a death penalty sentence as back in 1997, and the governor has struggled to procure the drugs to do it at all. Ricketts is putting his reputation on the line in a way most governors don't. And there are three likely reasons he's willing to take that bet, says Paul Landow, a political science expert with the University of Nebraska-Omaha. 1) He's got the money, so why not? Ricketts has proven he's willing to spend cash to advance his political agenda and career. When he ran for U.S. Senate in 2006, he contributed more than $14 million to his own campaign. (Despite having more than three times the money, Ricketts lost to incumbent Sen. Ben Nelson (D) by almost 30 points.) 2) If things work out the way Ricketts wants, his job could get a whole lot easier. Ricketts had a very tough first year as governor. The nonpartisan-but-conservative legislature overrode his vetoes on four different issues, the most high-profile being the death penalty (they repealed it, he wanted to keep it). Next year might go more smoothly with more friendly faces. 3) If Ricketts has a better gubernatorial term, it could be a launching pad for other jobs. ""He's got a national future if he wants one -- and he wants one,"" Landow said. ""So I think he sees some of this as making him a stronger, better governor, and thereby giving him greater standing in the national political community."" On the other hand, presiding over the first deep-red state to repeal the death penalty in 40 years -- and repeatedly having showdowns with the Republican legislature -- isn't really the best way to launch your career in conservative politics. If money could minimize or eliminate those issues, the investment could pay big career dividends beyond Nebraska's borders."
