""He's going to be the next president and regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office,"" said Obama, who met with Trump for the first time last week. ""This office has a way of waking you up."" Obama faced reporters crammed into the James S. Brady Briefing Room on Monday before leaving Washington for a week-long foreign trip to Greece, Germany and Peru, where he will meet with more than a dozen foreign leaders with their own set of worries about where the United States is headed under its next president. At moments the president offered advice to his successor that sometimes sounded like a warning. He urged Trump to respect ""those norms that are vital to a functioning democracy,"" such as ""civility and tolerance and a commitment to reason and facts and analysis."" For months Obama had accused candidate Trump of breaching those norms during a bitter and contentious campaign. After last week's shocking election results, Obama struck a more sanguine note. ""I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful president and moving this country forward,"" Obama said. ""I don't think any president ever comes in saying to himself, 'I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country.' ""     President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it's ""healthy"" for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. ""When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,"" Obama said. (The Washington Post)   The president sought to reassure U.S. allies, noting that in his conversation with Trump last week, the New York businessman ""expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,"" including the one with NATO. As he visits with world leaders, Obama vowed to let them know ""that there is no weakening of resolve"" when it comes to America meeting its commitments and defending its allies. Throughout the hour-long news conference, Obama sought to calm and reassure a jittery and divided country, choosing his words carefully and emphasizing unity over division. On many issues the president conceded that he and Trump continue to have competing visions on where to take the country and that his worries about Trump's fitness for office and temperament haven't disappeared. ""Of course I have got concerns,"" Obama said. He sought solace in the notion that change in Washington usually takes time. ""The federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat. It's an ocean liner,"" Obama said. And he expressed hope that on issues such as the Affordable Care Act, the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Trump would modify his position. ""I don't think he is ideological. I think, ultimately, he is pragmatic,"" Obama said. ""And that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.""     President Obama said that his administration ""stands ready"" to assist President-elect Donald Trump and his staff as they transition to the White House in January. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)   The president declined to comment on Trump's highest-profile and most controversial appointment so far -- senior counselor and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, former chief executive of the conservative website Breitbart News. Bannon is closely associated with the alt-right movement, which white nationalists have embraced. ""Without copping out, I think it's fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the president-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we are going to try to facilitate a smooth transition,"" Obama said. The president declined to answer a question on whether he still saw Trump as unfit to serve in the Oval Office -- a criticism he had leveled more than once during the campaign -- and instead emphasized that he had counseled the president-elect to reach out to some constituencies that had not supported his bid. ""It is important to send some signals of unity"" to minorities, women and other groups ""that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign,"" Obama said.     In a sign of how Obama has been working doggedly to influence Trump to preserve some of his administration's landmark achievements, the president spoke of the need to improve the Affordable Care Act rather than jettison it. He made a passionate case for not forcing children of undocumented immigrants to leave the country. ""I will urge the president-elect and the incoming administration to think long and hard before they are endangering the status of what, for all practical purposes, are American kids,"" he said. Going before the media soon after a major election is a rite of passage for the president. In Obama's case, only one of these exchanges has been celebratory. While he could embrace his 2012 reelection victory, both the 2010 and 2014 midterms and now the election of his successor have amounted to serious setbacks. Six years ago, Obama called the Democrats' congressional losses a ""shellacking""; in 2014, he declined to characterize the results, saying instead to the American people, ""I hear you."" Obama spent much less time talking about what contributed to Democrats' latest losses, which were punctuated by disappointing turnout among some minority groups and a poor showing in rural areas and some key suburbs. But he acknowledged that Democrats need to engage in ""some reflection"" about the way they campaign and connect with the American people. ""I believe that we have better ideas, but I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them,"" he said. ""We have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere."" Much of the president's hour-long news conference was dominated by questions of his view of Trump's character, temperament and fitness for office. Obama offered careful praise for Trump's ability to galvanize his constituency. ""What's clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxieties, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive,"" the president said. He observed that Trump was ""impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate. That's powerful stuff."" But Obama cautioned that Trump would not be able to govern as he campaigned: ""There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them.""

But among the city's new critically acclaimed restaurants, like Rose's Luxury, bottom right, Washington elites no longer hold much sway. (LEFT: Joseph Victor Stefanchik for The Washington Post; Dixie D. Vereen for The Washington Post: BOTTOM RIGHT: Goran Kosanovic for The Washington Post)  You cannot call in favors with Genevieve Villamora. You can't press a twenty into her palm. Everyone who wants to eat at her Filipino restaurant, Bad Saint, must queue up to get in.  Everyone. Including Cissy Marshall. On a recent evening, Villamora opened the door to Bad Saint to find Thurgood Marshall's 88-year-old widow among those waiting in line.  Marshall, Villamora recalls, ""was the loveliest."" But who she is doesn't change the new rules of Washington dining.  ""We have had high-profile guests,"" says Villamora, whose restaurant was recently ranked the second-best in the United States by Bon Appetit. ""But they come in the same way as everyone else.""  More and more owners in the city's booming restaurant scene are adopting this ethos. Look closely at those endless ""Hey, Isn't That. . . ?"" gossip-column items: The old ""power"" restaurants frequented by this city's version of the royals are surprisingly few. Sure, there's a fresh crop of big, luxe new dining houses: Le Diplomate. Maestro's and Joe's. Rasika West End. Fiola Mare. And there are the classics, tried and true. Cafe Milano. Tosca. The Palm. (Always, always, the Palm.)  How the incoming Trump administration will affect the D.C. dining scene remains to be seen, particularly given that the president-elect himself has a taste for McDonald's, meatloaf and Oreos, and not small plates or Mid-Atlantic, foraged cuisine.  Inside his massive hotel just blocks from the White House, on Pennsylvania Avenue, is a steakhouse, a class of eatery that has long reigned in Washington.  But on the whole, it's as if the city has been drained of the kinds of places where your name and ever-so-slightly Botoxed mug might net you fawning attention, and your favorite wine is poured before you've even ordered it.  The notion that we are still that sort of power-dining town, Villamora says, is ""an easy cliche about the Washington restaurant scene.""  The inevitable caravan of new staffers and return of the Republican establishment to Washington might return the power restaurant to prominence. But there's plenty of evidence that it won't.  Restaurateurs say that the congressional schedules of recent years have lawmakers spending more time at home than hobnobbing in steakhouses in Washington. And when they are in town, they're going Dutch, thanks to ethics rules that read like commandments.  But the most noticeable threat to the spend-and-be-seen crowd? All the new restaurants.   The hot Washington restaurants name-dropped by Bon Appetit and Michelin aren't the sorts of places where lobbyists post up with a steak and a cigar. They're on Barracks Row or Ninth Street NW, in Shaw, even in an alley once known as an illicit skateboarder hangout. There's Kyirisan in Shaw; Maketto on H Street NE. Tail Up Goat in Adams Morgan. Bad Saint, a 25-seat nook of a restaurant, is in Columbia Heights.  And if few of them are rolling out the red carpet for the media elite or the usual lawmaking suits, there are some that even dare to shun them outright. Shaw Bijou, which opened this month amid a storm of angry hellfire over its pricey tasting menu, recently announced a members-only program. But rather than sign up the usual suspects, the owner told Washingtonian magazine that the restaurant's VIPs will be selected on the basis of nebulous factors intended to preserve the place's coolness. ""Otherwise it's going to become a boys' lobbyist club,"" said Kelly Gorsuch, ""and that's what we do not want.""  Game change The winds of change have blown the truffle shavings right off the city's power-dining scene. Danny Festa, general manager of Morton's steakhouse, on Connecticut Avenue, has seen it all from the perch he has occupied for almost 20 years. Morton's was once Duke Zeibert's, which was, for the better part of 40 years, the preferred watering hole of Washington bigwigs like Jack Kent Cooke and Larry King, and, oh, every president there was, thanks to the proprietor's fawning attention to the power set. (The food, wrote The Washington Post's dining critic, was less of a draw.)    Duke Zeibert greets Larry King on the last day Zeibert's restaurant was open on Connecticut Avenue. (1994 photo by Lucian Perkins/The Washington Post)  Morton's has tried to carry on the tradition. But the swinging, partying congressmen and -women? Well, they're not what they used to be, either.  There was a time, Festa says, when newly elected politicians ""packed up the family and the station wagon and moved into town. Whether you were Republican or Democrat, you lived in the same neighborhood."" And often, he says, when the Washington workday was done, they played together, too.  ""They drank more, they ate more, and it was fantastic,"" says Tim Whitlock, Morton's chief operating officer. ""People would order gin -- just a glass of gin!"" Lobbyists and politicians and presidents would simply call Danny and request a seat for themselves and a Secret Service contingent.   Today, the political environment, coupled with dramatic changes in the congressional schedule that require lawmakers to be on the Hill just a couple of days a week on average, have transformed the robust, chummy dinners of Washington's power heyday.  ""They're not getting together,"" Festa says. Sometimes, he says, they barely look in one another's direction across the dining room.  Johnny's Half Shell, once the go-to destination for political fundraising events, quietly closed down on Capitol Hill this year, noting that its customer base disappeared on weekends as lawmakers flew home to their districts. (Johnny's has moved to a much smaller locale in Adams Morgan.)  This also happened: 2007 ethics rules quashed high-dollar lobster dinners paid for by lobbyists.  ""After we passed the ban on wining and dining,"" says Craig Holman, who helped write the language as a government affairs lobbyist for the advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen, ""all these other lobbyists had to do what I do, which is schlep over to the Capitol and try to get some face time with the lawmakers in their office.""  Ask restaurateurs who the power diners are these days, and they'll tell you it's foreign dignitaries and Saudi princes, and occasionally, the rare celebrity from out of town.      Power restaurants, says Bad Saint co-owner Genevieve Villamora, right, are ""an easy cliche about the Washington restaurant scene."" (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  No cigars, please Some restaurants, of course, continue to cater to power. Before Oprah brunched on the Fiola Mare patio recently, the talk-show goddess's people called owner Maria Trabocchi's personal cellphone. She quickly set aside not one but two tables for Oprah (and Gayle, naturally) to choose between.  Fiola Mare and all of Trabocchi's handful of Italian restaurants also have private rooms for those who'd rather dine behind closed doors. ""That's fundamental to become a power player,"" Trabocchi says. ""You have to offer private space.""  Most of the myriad new restaurants -- some with square footage so limited, dining there is like being crammed into a coach-class airline seat -- lack the trappings that large security details demand, says Cedric Maupillier, chef and owner of Convivial, a French boite that took up residence in Shaw last year. ""We don't have a private room or a special back door. And that's what the Secret Service look for,"" he says. What agents are not particularly excited about, he says, are the floor-to-ceiling windows so trendy these days.   ""I have a feeling that the Shaw neighborhood is in a Secret Service booklet, probably on a red page,"" Maupillier jokes. ""Like, 'Do not go there.' "" The new, mostly casual restaurants offer nowhere to light up a cigar. And, like Bad Saint, some of the hottest ones refuse to take reservations.  Rose's Luxury owner and chef Aaron Silverman concedes that he has received requests from high-profile people hoping to cut the epic line to dine at his acclaimed Capitol Hill restaurant. But Silverman, who has said that even his parents wait for a table, has stuck with a single rule since the restaurant opened: ""Everyone is treated the same.""   [Swelter for hours in line to eat at the acclaimed Rose's Luxury? People do it every day.]  With one exception. ""I think the only people who haven't waited,"" he told Food & Wine Magazine, ""are Michelle and Barack.""  Villamora admires the city's remaining power restaurants, the elegance with which they remember favorite dishes and seating preferences and keep Manhattans chilled. ""That's an art form,"" she says.  ""We work to know our guests as well, and to take as good care of them as we can. But,"" she says, ""it just looks different here."" "

Trump's advisers say the two leaders discussed a ""range of issues including the threats and challenges facing the United States and Russia,"" along with economic issues and the U.S-Russian relationship. Trump's transition team says that Trump told Putin he looks forward to ""a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia."" In a statement issued after the Monday call, Kremlin says that Putin expressed readiness to establish a ""partner-like"" dialogue with Trump's incoming administration. ___ 3:25 p.m. The Kremlin says that Russian President Vladimir Putin and President-elect Donald Trump have agreed in a phone call to work to improve U.S.-Russian relations. The Kremlin says that Putin expressed readiness to establish a ""partner-like"" dialogue with Trump's administration. In the U.S., Trump's office says the president-elect noted to Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia The Kremlin says that Putin and Trump agreed that U.S.-Russian ties are ""unsatisfactory"" and spoke for joint efforts to normalize them and engage in a ""constructive cooperation on a broad range of issues."" The Kremlin adds that they also agreed on the need to combine efforts in the fight against the No. 1 enemy -- international terrorism and extremism."" The Kremlin says they discussed the settlement of the Syrian crisis in that context. ___ 12:30 p.m. Vice President-elect Mike Pence says he is recruiting people with ""character and the competence"" to implement Donald Trump's vision for the country. The Republican Indiana governor was named chairman of Trump's presidential transition team on Friday and could wield considerable influence. But he downplayed his role Monday to reporters in Indianapolis, saying he was humbled to play a ""small part."" Pence did not respond to a question about the appointment of Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon as a senior Trump adviser. The website specializes in button-pushing headlines, including one that called conservative commentator Bill Kristol a ""Republican spoiler, renegade Jew."" ___ 12:05 p.m. A top adviser to President-elect Donald Trump says the incoming president will make additional appointments to his team this week. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tells reporters at Trump Tower that the transition team is working on naming members of the incoming president's staff and Cabinet. Trump on Sunday named Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and campaign adviser Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor. Conway says incoming first lady Melania Trump is also interviewing potential aides and Trump's team is making plans to fill the vacancy of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. ___ 11:45 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump is considering Richard Grenell as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, according to a person familiar with transition planning. If selected, Grenell would be the first openly gay person to hold a Cabinet-level foreign policy post. Grenell served as U.S. spokesman at the U.N. throughout President George W. Bush's administration. Grenell briefly served as a foreign policy adviser to Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. The person familiar with the transition planning insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the private deliberations. -By Julie Pace ___ 11:40 a.m. Vice President-elect Mike Pence says he is recruiting people with ""character and the competence"" to implement Donald Trump's vision for the country. The Republican Indiana governor was named chairman of Trump's presidential transition team on Friday and could wield considerable influence. But he downplayed his role Monday to reporters in Indianapolis, saying he was humbled to play a ""small part."" Pence did not respond to a question about the appointment of Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon as a senior Trump adviser. The website specializes in button-pushing headlines, including one that called conservative commentator Bill Kristol a ""Republican spoiler, renegade Jew."" Pence said the transition team will draw on people from across the country. He says he will present the president-elect with ""a lot of great choices."" __ 11 a.m. The nation's Roman Catholic bishops are urging President-elect Donald Trump to adopt humane policies toward immigrants and refugees. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said serving and welcoming people fleeing conflict and violence is part of their identity as Roman Catholics. Church leaders said they would continue to offer that aid. Trump talked tough about immigration on the campaign trail, including proposing building a wall along the border of U.S. and Mexico and deporting the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally. He later distanced himself from those statements. In an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" broadcast Sunday night, he said he would focus on deporting people with criminal records beyond their immigration status. Trump also has called to suspend the admission of Syrian refugees in the country. The bishops made the plea Monday, at the start of their annual fall meeting in Baltimore. ___ 11 a.m. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is defending President-elect Donald Trump's selection of Steve Bannon for senior counselor. At a Capitol Hill news conference, a reporter read a list of offensive statements by Bannon, the far-right media mogul whose Breitbart site has pushed a nationalist, anti-establishment agenda. McCarthy said the president-elect always gets to pick his team. The California Republican said ""the president has a right to select who he thinks is best."" In anticipation of Trump as president next year, McCarthy also said he and House GOP committee chairs were sending letters to government agencies telling them to stop issuing any new regulations. ___ 7:55 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump is considering oil billionaire Harold Hamm and North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer to lead the Department of Energy. Trump is also considering venture capitalist Robert Grady for the top energy job, according to a transition planning document obtained by The Associated Press. Grady, who worked in President George H.W. Bush's administration, is also listed on the document as a possible pick to lead the Interior Department. The planning document includes several energy and environmental priorities for the next administration, including repealing the Clean Power Plan. The plan was introduced by the Obama administration and aims to limit carbon pollution from power plants. The power plant plan is currently on hold awaiting a court ruling. The transition planning document says that if the court doesn't rule by the time Trump takes office, his administration will likely seek to have the case dismissed. -By Julie Pace ___ 7:32 a.m. Reince Priebus says Breitbart News executive Stephen Bannon has been a hard worker and sober decision maker in the months the two have steered Donald Trump toward the presidency. Trump's newly named White House chief of staff told NBC's ""Today"" show that Bannon has exhibited none of the racist, sexist or other qualities attributed to him and the Breitbart website. The site specializes in button-pushing, traffic-trolling headlines, including one that called conservative commentator Bill Kristol a ""Republican spoiler, renegade Jew."" Others asked, ""Would you rather your child had feminism or cancer?"" and ""Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy."" Priebus says those things weren't Bannon's writing. He expects to work with Bannon as a partner in slightly different roles the Trump administration. ___ 7:05 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump is making an overture to Republican circles by naming GOP chief Reince Priebus as his White House chief of staff. He's also fired a shot across the Washington establishment's bow by tapping Breitbart News executive Stephen Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor. The two men had made up the president-elect's chief of staff shortlist, and while Priebus received that job, Bannon's post also is expected to wield significant clout. The media executive with ties to the alt-right and white nationalist movement was given top billing in the press release announcing their appointments. Trump's hires announced Sunday were, at first glance, contradictory. But they fit a pattern of the celebrity businessman creating a veritable Rorschach test that allowed his supporters to see what they wanted. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In a major foreign policy speech at the annual Lord Mayor's Banquet in London, May said ""change is in the air"" and ""it's the job of politicians to respond."" She said Britain would champion free trade while managing ""the forces of globalization so that they work for all."" The speech comes as the British government tries to build bridges with a U.S. president-elect whose victory has surprised -- and even alarmed -- many European politicians. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Monday that it's ""very important not to prejudge the president-elect or his administration."" And May's spokeswoman, Helen Bower, said Downing St. wants ""an effective, strong working relationship"" with the incoming U.S. president. May and Trump spoke by phone on Thursday, the day after Trump's victory was announced. But the call has been overshadowed in Britain by Trump's meeting Saturday with U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, a key player in the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. UKIP issued a gleeful press release accompanied by a picture of the two men, beaming side-by-side in front of a golden elevator at Trump Tower in New York. May firmly rejected suggestions that she should use Farage -- a political foe of her Conservative party -- as a go-between with Trump's team. Bower said that Trump told May ""he looked forward to enjoying the same close relationship that (Ronald) Reagan and (Margaret) Thatcher did.""  ""I don't remember there being a third person in that relationship,"" Bower noted. May, who took office when David Cameron resigned after losing the June referendum on EU membership, has stressed the need to help those who feel left behind by the economic and social changes of recent decades. Years of recession and economic uncertainty since the 2008 global financial crisis have helped fuel resentments that drove the votes for Trump and Brexit. May told a black-tie dinner at London's medieval Guildhall: ""We meet in a world transformed."" She said liberalization and globalization are forces for good, and ""free markets and tree trade"" are the best way to lift people out of poverty. But -- in a nod to the anti-establishment feeling that fueled Trump's victory and the Brexit vote -- she added that governments must help people who have seen ""their jobs being outsourced and wages undercut.""  ""To be the true global champion of free trade in this new modern world, we also need to do something to help those families and communities who can actually lose out from it,"" May said. It's unclear whether May's commitment to free trade will be shared by president-elect Trump, who campaigned on promises to bolster U.S. industry and restore U.S. jobs lost to globalization.

Noting the painful labels and divisions of the just-finished campaign, the Rev. Jenna Faith Strizak said, ""We've got to figure out how to live together. And not just live together, but be one."" That could take a miracle: To bring together those elated by Trump's ascension to president-elect with those who see him as an embodiment of the country's worst instincts and a threat to its future. Even as Clinton pledged the victor her support Wednesday, others protested in the streets, burned flags and insisted he didn't represent them.  ""It's shattering,"" said Byron Beck, a writer in Portland, Oregon, who supported Clinton. While harshly faulting Trump, he cast the moment as a dilemma for all Americans. ""We have lost our way, and I don't know what that reset button will look like, but I know that I will work for it or I'll leave the country."" Trump extended a hand to such opponents in his victory speech, saying Clinton was owed ""a major debt of gratitude"" as he made an impassioned plea for both sides to join behind him: ""Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. ... To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people."" But the nation remained split over whether that was achievable or a pollyannaish vision. Exit polls showed voters expressing not just unhappiness with the way government is working but, among many who found hope in Trump, outright anger.  ""The bitterness could well get worse,"" said Robert Boatright, a Clark University professor and research director at the National Institute for Civil Discourse. ""It probably will."" For Clinton's supporters, the minutiae of how to move on seemed a secondary concern as many still professed shock and sadness over the result. In Denver, 47-year-old Eli Romero questioned how a man she dismissed as ""a circus"" could win, saying the election convinced her to move to Mexico. In Naperville, Illinois, 68-year-old Carol Anthony said she felt like she was punched in the stomach. In Hagerstown, Maryland, Sebiila Odin pondered how unity could even be possible.  ""You know, all this talk about healing, that's a problem, too, because we've never healed,"" said Odin, who is black, referring to race relations. Trump's election bared rifts that have churned for decades, if not since the nation's founding. Toxic politics have degenerated to rank-and-file hatred of the other side. ""It's impossible to think that a honeymoon will follow all the nastiness and name-calling,"" said Robert Schmuhl, a University of Notre Dame professor. Still, in small gestures all over the country, some were vowing to bridge the gulf between the two sides. John Barnes, a 60-year-old retiree in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who cast his ballot for Trump, pledged to move on from his anger at a neighbor who supported Clinton, who he feared could destroy the Constitution. Jennifer Farley, a 38-year-old chef and cookbook author in Bethesda, Maryland, who joked she'd drown herself if Trump won, said she was considering holding potluck dinners with people of different ideologies, seeking unity through the healing power of food. And Tane Danger, a 31-year-old independent in Minneapolis, planned a series of improv comedy shows in divided communities to try to get people of different backgrounds in the same room to share laughter.  ""Hopefully that moves us a little closer to helping to understand and be able to work together,"" he said. In Richlands, Virginia, when Linda Crawford made known her support for Clinton on Facebook during the race, she said she was met with an onslaught of condemnation and personal attacks. But a week ago, she was relieved when she met many of those same people at a funeral, and found they could hug and comfort one another despite their differences.  ""People still love one another and are still good to each other,"" said the 66-year-old retired teacher. ""This will pass -- the election will pass -- and our country will heal and move on."" At Decatur First United Methodist's ecumenical election night service, congregants from 13 different churches joined. Pastors spoke of unity, and the floors vibrated with ""America the Beautiful"" from the organ pipes. Democrats and Republicans shared the same pews, wearing voter stickers shaped like Georgia peaches, and shut out the barrage of news sweeping the country.  ""Let's talk about what's going to happen and how we can help the country,"" said Gary Brinker, a 56-year-old salesman who voted for Trump. ""We're going to have to work together."" Those who supported Clinton and other candidates expressed similar sentiments, professing a willingness to see past differences and a hope that people could come together. Enoch Bang, a 23-year-old law student who voted for Clinton, said the tenor of the campaign drove him to seek an escape from the election returns in the quiet of prayer.  ""We have to live tomorrow as one country, as one people,"" the son of South Korean immigrants said.

It has been unfolding in early primary states, where potential candidates have been introducing or reintroducing themselves. It has been on display in purple battlegrounds where they are helping in down-ballot contests. And behind the scenes, would-be contenders have sought face time with party power brokers eager to size them up.  ""I think it's already happening now,"" said Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.), a longtime GOP strategist. Cole identified another significant way the prospective candidates are laying a foundation: by embracing or shunning Donald Trump.  ""You've seen some pretty dramatic reversals of people deciding they couldn't be for Trump and they are for Trump. Now, part of that, to me, is about positioning for presidential contests.""   South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have been mentioned as possible 2020 presidential candidates in the event of a Donald Trump loss. (Chris Keane/Reuters)  If Trump loses the presidency on Tuesday, Republicans will be forced to choose yet again from a full slate of ambitious candidates-in-waiting with wildly divergent visions for the party's future. Even if Trump wins, he will begin his term far from safe against the threat of a primary challenge in 2020, because an ample cross-section of his party has spoken out against him. A Trump win also probably would set off a potentially chaotic scramble on the Democratic side to field a challenger in four years. Democrats have not built a robust bench during President Obama's time in the White House, in part because of the down-ballot drubbings the party has experienced in the midterm elections and partly because Hillary Clinton effectively froze the field as she considered her 2016 run.  No Republicans have announced that they will run in 2020 if Trump loses. Most have avoided even broaching the subject publicly, to avoid appearing presumptuous.   [How the stampede for big money enabled Donald Trump's rise]  But interviews with more than a dozen Republican strategists, elected officials, donors and rank-and-file voters show that the party has begun to ponder its future options and that the auditions have started.  Among the names mentioned most often are several unsuccessful 2016 candidates who eventually -- and awkwardly -- came around to supporting Trump: Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.). Some consider Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has held firm in his opposition to Trump after losing to him, a possibility. Republicans also are intrigued by Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.), an early Trump critic.    Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is often mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential contender. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)  Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, also comes up frequently as a possibility if the 2016 ticket loses, as does House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), who has had a rocky relationship with Trump.  Republicans also are interested in fresher faces, including first-term Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Joni Ernst (Iowa); and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Bobbie Kilberg, a Northern Virginia-based Republican fundraiser, said that she has been approached by possible candidates seeking meetings after the election to lay out their visions for the party's future. She declined to say who has sought her out. ""If Trump loses, I think it is very important that we do not again have eight to 10 highly qualified center-right candidates running,"" Kilberg said before Election Day, referring to the packed 2016 field. ""We have to over time -- not now, it's too early -- coalesce around one or two, maybe three, people on the center-right."" However, that lane appears to be no less clogged than it was four years ago. Kasich made a late-summer return to New Hampshire, an early nominating state no politician visits by accident. Rubio was up for reelection, and his win Tuesday will help wash away the stain of a stinging home-state primary loss to Trump and give him new life in the party that some backers hope he will parlay into another White House run.  Cotton, a national security hawk who is an Army veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, spent time in Iowa last month. In the closing days of this campaign, he has hit the trail on behalf of GOP Senate contenders in tight races in Indiana, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, a swing that could earn him some key allies down the road.  Trump's unlikely primary triumph, which came without early support from party elites, has emboldened many Republicans to push for an outsider again in 2020.  ""If there's one thing that this campaign cycle has shown, there is some competitive advantage for folks who are not viewed as being rooted in the establishment and the status quo,"" said Ken Blackwell, a former Ohio secretary of state. Cruz, who has clashed with party leaders, claimed an outsider mantle as he ran for president this cycle. But it fell flat against Trump, and his pitch could face new obstacles if he runs in 2020. Cruz only recently backed the GOP nominee, months after declining to do so during a Republican National Convention speech that drew boos from many Trump supporters. Cruz's most immediate priority is winning reelection in 2018.   [The 7 charts that explain the 2016 election]  Ryan also has a near-term campaign that does not involve the presidency: winning reelection as speaker. His bid could provide a snapshot of his standing in the party after months of a turbulent relationship with Trump. It's also not clear that Ryan, who was the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2012, wants to jump back into a long national campaign.  One person whose name comes up among Republicans from different ends of the ideological spectrum is Pence, who has been a loyal and on-message running mate for Trump. Pence is well liked by GOP leaders and Trump, too, making him something of a hybrid.  But whether Pence could energize Trump's base of loyal supporters remains to be seen. His style -- soft-spoken and folksy -- contrasts sharply with Trump's brashness and willingness to pick fights with members of his party, which drove his popularity in the primary.  ""I've known a little bit about Mr. Pence. Now, Mr. Pence -- I like what he has done in the state of Indiana economically overall, but Mr. Pence, he is a standard-issue Republican. I'm not a Republican. I'm a conservative independent,"" said Conrad Baker, 40, who lives in St. Francis, Minn., and attended a recent Trump event in Eau Claire, Wis. Many Republicans say they don't expect Trump to step away from politics completely if he loses, nor do they expect his supporters to walk away from politics en masse. So the trajectory of the next primary could rest heavily on how popular or unpopular he is in the lead-up to 2020. But Trump's anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric has many Republicans worried that his views are hurting the GOP's already struggling standing among minorities and putting the party further out of step with a swiftly diversifying country. Some Republicans said a Trump loss could spur the party to walk down a path similar to one Democrats traversed after a third straight White House loss in 1988. In 1992, they nominated Bill Clinton, a centrist who won the election, helping the party reassert itself on the national stage and shedding the image that it was too liberal for mainstream Americans. That may be easier in theory than in practice for Republicans to replicate in their next primary.  ""If you look at the Republican primary electorate compared to the Democratic primary electorate in 1992, the Republican primary electorate is more homogeneous and . . . much more ideologically skewed,"" said Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. After Trump's unlikely rise, which few saw coming at this point for years ago, Republicans are bracing themselves for unexpected twists and turns in the coming months and years more than ever before.  ""My one prediction about 2020 is it won't look anything like what we think it will look like the day after the election,"" said David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, an anti-tax group.   Jenna Johnson in Eau Claire, Wis., contributed to this report.  "

Comey dropped into the final stage of the race. But one effect seems beyond dispute. An agency that, at least in its recent history, has been considered the symbol of square-jawed rectitude has now taken a place in the larger, corrosive narrative of the 2016 election. ""Regrettably, this is of a piece with every event that happened before it in the campaign,"" said William A. Galston, a governance expert at the Brookings Institution. ""In a way, it is a perfectly fitting end to a truly awful campaign."" The whole saga also will probably reinforce the disillusioned American public's perception that the political system is corrupt, and that the institutions of government are failing. It is likely, as well, to further undermine the legitimacy of whoever wins the election in this deeply polarized country. Comey announced Sunday afternoon that his agency had found nothing in a newly discovered trove of emails to change its view from July that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email system did not merit criminal charges.     FBI Director James B. Comey told lawmakers on Nov. 6 that the bureau won't recommend charges against Hillary Clinton after reviewing newly discovered emails. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   In another kind of political season, that might have settled the matter. But instead, it generated a new round of dark theorizing from some of the same people who had praised Comey only nine days before, when he had notified Congress that the additional emails belonging to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin had been found on the laptop of her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), a former congressman under investigation for allegedly sexting with a minor. ""Comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he can't possibly know,"" tweeted former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a prominent ally of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. At a rally in Minnesota, Trump said: ""You have to understand it's a rigged system, and she's protected."" Meanwhile, the Democrats who had howled foul over Comey's Oct. 28 announcement were feeling a palpable relief. ""We were always confident that nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited. Now Director Comey has confirmed it,"" Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon wrote in a tweet. Fallon added in another one: ""Trump's hopes of using Comey to distract the voters in closing days of the campaign just went up in smoke.""     Voters in Pennsylvania and Ohio weigh in on FBI Director James Comey's decision to send a letter to members of Congress informing them that newly discovered emails were either duplicates or personal emails that were not related to government business from Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state. (Peter Stevenson,Erin Patrick O'Connor,Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)   The ostensibly apolitical FBI had become an actor in the election more than a year ago, when it opened an investigation into the question of whether the former secretary of state had put national security in jeopardy when she decided not to follow protocol of using a government email account to conduct official business, but to do it on her personal email and server. In July, Comey announced that no case would be brought against Clinton, although he harshly critized the manner in which she had handled sensitive and classified information. Although Democrats were relieved, Republicans saw politics at work, given that Comey had acknowledged someone else in that position would face sanctions. Nor did it help appearances -- or dampen cynicism -- when it was reported that former president Bill Clinton had held a private meeting with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch aboard her plane at the Phoenix airport as the investigation was nearing its end. Lynch later said that she regretted having met with Clinton, and that she would ""be accepting"" of whatever recommendation Comey brought her. Republicans and Democrats reversed positions, however, when Comey made his announcement last month. Leading GOP figures hailed it as a principled stand, while Democrats said it violated a long-standing practice by the agency not to do anything in the final days of an election campaign that could influence the outcome. Comey's decision to make public his agency's inquiry into the new emails did indeed inflict some political damage on the front-running Clinton campaign. The polls narrowed significantly after his announcement, forcing Clinton to abandon her plans to assume a positive stance in the final days before the election. Instead of laying out her vision for governing and focusing on bringing Democrats in difficult down-ballot races with her, Clinton resumed attacking Trump. With the race suddenly appearing more competitive, Trump saw new opportunities opening in states that had seemed beyond his reach, sending both campaigns into a scramble across what appeared to be a reconfigured electoral map. But tracking polls, including the one being done by The Washington Post and ABC News, suggested that Clinton was beginning to regain her footing. So if she wins, it may be difficult to determine whether Comey's latest announcement helped her, or whether the race was settling back into where it had been before. Meanwhile, even as some Republicans criticize Comey, others are enlisting the FBI to make a larger point. ""Regardless of this decision, the undisputed finding of the FBI's investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nation's secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security,"" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement issued shortly after Comey's decision became public Sunday. ""She simply believes she's above the law and always plays by her own rules."" If Clinton wins Tuesday, that is probably not the last time she will hear that line. The FBI investigation may be closed, but the partisanship around it remains very much alive.  "
