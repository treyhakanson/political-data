Doctors Without Borders said that its hospitals received a total of 21 victims Friday, including a group worker, and 75 wounded, with many suffering fractures, burns, open wounds and lacerations and internal injuries. Taiz has been one of the worst-hit cities in Yemen's conflict, where fighting between Shiite rebels, known as the Houthis, and forces loyal to the internationally recognized government escalated this week. The pro-government forces are backed by a Saudi-led coalition, which launched an air campaign last year to dislodge the Houthis from areas under their control, including the capital, Sanaa. A U.S.-brokered cease-fire and peace deal has been backed by the Houthis but rejected by the government for giving the rebels a share of power while sidelining the Houthis' rival, exiled President Abed-Rabbo Mansour Hadi. -- Associated Press SRI LANKA Official: 32 'elite' Muslims joined ISIS Thirty-two Sri Lankan Muslims from ""well-educated and elite"" families have joined the Islamic State in Syria, the justice minister told parliament Friday, promising that the government would clamp down on extremists. The statement by minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was condemned by representatives of the Muslim minority, who complained of racism. ""All these [Muslims] are not from ordinary families. These people are from the families which are considered as well-educated and elite,"" Rajapakshe said, adding that the government was aware of some foreigners coming to Sri Lanka to spread what he called Islamist extremism. The Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, an umbrella body that includes most Muslim organizations in the country, expressed concern, saying Rajapakshe's statement came at a ""very opportune time to certain extremist elements bent on tarnishing the image"" of Sri Lankan Muslims. -- Reuters   Italy's Renzi expresses faith as referendum approaches: Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi says he expects a constitutional referendum being put to voters next month to pass, but he says he will ""verify the political situation"" if it fails. Renzi has for months been trying to backtrack on a statement staking his political future on the success of the Dec. 4 referendum. But opposition politicians have taken him up on the challenge and are vowing to press for a new government if voters reject the proposed changes to the country's lawmaking system. Polls suggest the results will be close.  New Egypt rights bill 'draconian,' Amnesty warns: An international rights group has warned of a new Egyptian bill to regulate civil society, saying that the proposed law amounts to a ""death warrant"" for relevant organizations. In a strongly worded statement, London-based Amnesty International urged President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi on Friday not to sign the proposed law, calling it ""draconian"" and the ""most repressive"" for the authority it gives the government over civil society work. The call comes days after the parliament, packed with Sissi supporters, voted in favor of the law. It was debated for only two days and comes into immediate effect once ratified by Sissi.  U.N. says toilets save money and lives: The U.N.'s secretary general said this year's observance of World Toilet Day on Saturday will focus on ""toilets and jobs"" -- the impact of sanitation on livelihoods and work environments. ""Toilets play a crucial role in creating a strong economy,"" Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. ""A lack of toilets at work and at home has severe consequences, including poor health leading to absenteeism, reduced concentration, exhaustion and decreased productivity. About 17 percent of all workplace deaths are caused by disease transmission at work."" According to the U.N., some 2.4 billion people across the world lack access to toilets, which leaves them struggling to stay well and keep their children alive. -- From news services "

The settlement eliminates the possibility that Trump will be called to testify in court in the midst of his presidential transition. It ends three separate lawsuits that made claims against Trump University, including a California class action case that was scheduled to go to trial later this month, as well as a second suit in that state and an action filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. In a statement, Trump Organization General Counsel Alan Garten said he thought Trump would have prevailed at trial but settled so Trump could ""devote his full attention to the important issues facing our great nation"" during his presidential transition. Schneiderman, a Democrat who had faced harsh attacks from Trump since filing the 2013 suit, said in a statement that his office had sued Trump for ""swindling thousands of innocent Americans out of millions of dollars"" and that the settlement had come despite significant resistance from Trump for years. ""Today, that all changes,"" Schneiderman said. ""Today's $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university."" Schneiderman said the settlement includes a $1 million penalty paid to New York state for violating the state's education laws by calling the program a ""university"" despite offering no degrees or traditional education. Trump did not, however, admit fault regarding the claims that customers were cheated. A lawyer representing former customers in the two California cases also confirmed the settlement at a hearing in San Diego.  [Donald Trump said his 'university' was about education. Actually, it was about 'sell, sell, sell!']  The Trump University settlement appears to fit a pattern in which lawyers for the president-elect are working to reduce the number of his legal entanglements before he takes office. On Wednesday, Trump's attorneys dropped an unrelated lawsuit he was pursuing in Florida against Palm Beach County, in which he had complained about commercial air traffic over his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump has fought the county for years over flight patterns from the county airport, which he has complained causes too much noise at his club. New airspace restrictions likely to be imposed with Trump's election could mean that Trump will win the long fight without legal action. Negotiations over the Trump University deal were handled in part by lawyers for Schneiderman, who had filed suit against Trump University in 2013. Schneiderman has called the real estate program ""a fraud from beginning to end.""         1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        The fates of the New York case and the two California suits were closely linked because they were all brought on behalf of an overlapping pool of former Trump University customers, said a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongoing negotiations. Lawyers for customers who sued in California said the settlement must still be approved by the court, but that some customers would see full refunds of the money they spent on Trump University, potentially as much as $35,000 in some cases. An administrator is expected to be appointed to disburse the funds, but attorney Jason Forge said many could see refunds in three to four months. Forge called the settlement an ""unprecedented recovery"" for such a case. Charles Spada, an attorney for former Trump University president Michael Sexton, said in a statement that the one-time Trump business partner remained ""proud of the work done at Trump U."" and is ""grateful for the unwavering support he received"" from Trump. Trump is known for aggressively pursuing his business interests in court. Still, he has settled lawsuits many times, despite arguing that doing so only invites further litigation. ""I don't settle cases. You know what happens? When you start settling lawsuits, everybody sues you,"" he said on MSNBC in March, responding to a question about Trump University. ""I don't get sued, because I don't settle cases. I win in court."" The Trump University case emerged as a political issue during the presidential campaign. And even as he rose in the polls, won primaries and emerged as the Republican nominee, Trump at times seemed deeply engrossed in the litigation and repeatedly defended the business from the stump. At a rally in San Diego in May, Trump dissected the matter at length, insisting that most customers who had spent money on the real estate program had been pleased. He attacked particular plaintiffs by name, including one who later dropped out of the case, citing the publicity. Trump's San Diego statements included an attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was overseeing the California cases, and a promise: ""If we have a trial, we'll go all the way,"" he said then. ""Watch how we win it."" In subsequent interviews in June, Trump continued to press complaints against Curiel, alleging that the Indiana-born judge was biased because of his Mexican heritage. Those comments sparked an uproar that swallowed days of Trump's campaign and subsided only when his campaign released a lengthy statement in June claiming his comments had been ""misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage."" The cases against Trump University were based on complaints from customers who described their experiences in programs that could cost more than $30,000. The former customers said they were taken in by false promises including advertisements in which Trump promised seminar attendees would learn his personal tricks for succeeding in real estate from instructors he had personally hand-picked. In depositions, Trump has acknowledged he did not pick seminar leaders. Trump argued in a written statement that, ""with all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case!"" Curiel had strongly urged a settlement in the cases pending in his courtroom, where Trump's lawyers had recently asked for a delay, citing the burdens of the presidential transition. They suggested the trial, which was scheduled to open Nov. 28, would be easier in February or March, after Trump takes office.  Roxana Popescu in San Diego contributed to this report. "

(Chuck Burton/AP)  On a bleak election night for Democrats, North Carolina seemed to offer a consolation prize: the defeat of Gov. Pat McCrory (R). Elected in 2012, the governor never dug out from the backlash to an early barrage of conservative bills, and the later passage of a ""bathroom bill"" to overturn local pro-transgender ordinances. Roy Cooper, the Democratic attorney general who challenged McCrory, declared victory on Nov. 8 when results showed him 4,500 votes ahead. But since then, Republicans have challenged ballots in several counties, and begun laying the groundwork to contest the election further -- even as additional counting has increased Cooper's lead to around 6,000 votes. ""This race has simply gotten away from Pat McCrory,"" said Marc Elias, the recount lawyer working for Cooper, in a call with reporters today. ""He's not going to be the next governor, whatever tactics his campaign comes up with."" But as The Washington Post's Amber Phillips reported last week, Republicans were not conceding the race. Since then, the party has highlighted allegations of voter fraud in rural Bladen County, which broke for Republicans up and down the ballot. On election night, McCrory appeared to win the county with 8,272 votes to Cooper's 7,227 votes. But this week, a successful local candidate in a nonpartisan race, McCrae Dowless, filed a challenge to what Dowless said were ""literally hundreds of fraudulent ballots,"" alleging that ""the handwriting on hundreds of those ballots matches only about a dozen handwriting styles."" The clue, he said, was the number of ballots writing in a rival candidate's name. ""This is the shocking evidence resulting from a blatant scheme to try to impact the voting results of an entire county and perhaps even sway statewide and federal elections,"" he wrote. Dowless speculated that the Bladen County Improvement Association PAC, which had received $2,500 from the state Democratic Party, had cooked the ballots; Deborah Monroe, a witness to many of the signatures, had been paid by the PAC. At no point did Dowless suggest that Monroe, the PAC, or anyone else had been trying to help Cooper, but McCrory's campaign quickly seized on the complaint. ""Hundreds of absentee ballots appear to have been fraudulently cast for Roy Cooper and other Democrats,"" the campaign said in a statement. ""Initial evidence shows that a North Carolina Democrat Party-funded group may have paid people to cast fraudulent votes to tip this election to Roy Cooper!"" As the News & Observer reported, a quick analysis found that 167 -- not hundreds -- of absentee ballots seemed to contain the handwriting of seven people -- not one person. At the same time, McCrory's campaign filed challenges in 11 more counties, including Durham, where a late report of tens of thousands of ballots on Nov. 8 put Cooper in the lead. In a short interview Friday, McCrory strategist Chris LaCivita spoke confidently about problems being uncovered as the campaign probed ballots. ""We found several dozen voters who are on parole or in prison who have voted,"" he said. ""There's dead people who have voted. There's people who have double-voted. And that's not even starting on the 90,000 early votes they just sat on until election night in Durham County."" But Democrats have found refuge in two issues created by Republicans. First, thanks to some of McCrory's own reforms, every county election commission is run by two Republicans and one Democrat, allowing the Democrats to accuse the governor of attacking his own election monitors. Second, McCrory's campaign has fumbled a series of challenges in the contended counties. Romeo Johnson Myrick, the Republican who filed a challenge in Halifax County, misremembered the timing of the hearing, and showed up after it ended. Challenges Friday in Wake and Durham counties, among the most populous and Democratic in the state, were largely rejected by the elections panels. ""I've been involved in representing people on winning ends and losing ends of close elections,"" said Elias after a round of Cooper wins. ""It's unfortunate to see that rather than accepting election results, Pat McCrory is going to go down by besmirching Republican election officials and the voters of North Carolina."" But the steady accusations of mass fraud may be setting up an almost unheard-of challenge, one that looks unlikely unless the margin closes to fewer than 1,000 votes. The Carolina Partnership for Reform, a group run by Republican operative Bob Harris, has raised the precedent of 2004, when a Republican candidate for the state's chief education job trailed by 8,500 votes. He challenged 11,000 provisional ballots on the grounds that they might have been cast in the wrong precincts. Democrats, including Attorney General Cooper, rejected the challenge. ""Cooper and McCrory may indeed be headed for a court fight,"" wrote Harris this week. ""But if the Atkinson precedent is followed, the legislature may have the final say. Then we'll see if the Democrats are content to follow the rules they wrote."" The problem with the precedent is that the 2004 legislature stepped in when the Democratic nominee held a lead. Today, both Cooper and the party's candidate for state auditor hold leads. A successful McCrory challenge might depend on the count ending with him in the lead, or with questions about more ballots than the ballots that make up Cooper's margin of victory. Elias said Friday that this was unlikely, and that even if every challenged ballot was tossed -- and every one had been marked for Cooper -- the Democrat would win. ""I don't think there is any scenario where this could be thrown into the legislature,"" he said. ""Inevitably, I do understand that there's interest by the media in the most outrageous scenario."""

The federally funded review conducted for the Illinois Department of Corrections found that the mostly nonviolent women at Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln are often classified as higher security risks than necessary, which with disproportionate discipline needlessly extends their stays. Segregation is overused as a punishment and the women get few chances to prepare for community re-entry, contributing to a recidivism rate of 50 percent -- higher than the state's prison population as a whole, according to the report. The National Resource Center on Justice Involved Women's assessment is harshly critical of the 2013 decision by former Gov. Pat Quinn's administration to close a women's prison in Dwight and move nearly 2,000 women into Logan, which was designed for 1,500. The ""poorly planned, rushed and chaotic"" move ""set the tone for the culture that exists at Logan today,"" it said. Corrections director John Baldwin pledged additional staff training. Illinois is one of about a dozen states to undergo the assessment, for which states had to compete. The report advocates taking a different approach to incarcerated women because of their different emotional responses to stress and their histories. Ninety-eight percent of imprisoned Illinois women have experienced physical abuse, 75 percent have been sexually abused, and 85 percent have encountered emotional abuse. At the time of the review, 42 percent of the inmates qualified as seriously mentally ill. Although women make up only a fraction of the population at Illinois' overburdened prisons, making life better at Logan is worth the effort, said Donna Collins, a Rhode Island state prison administrator who has helped implement gender-response changes in that state and is among speakers scheduled to address a forum in Chicago Friday.  ""Women are the backbone of the family,"" Collins said. ""You're hurting the community if you continue to re-incarcerate women."" The study said there is inadequate training for staff members to deal with women's emotional responses. In interviews, staff members called inmates ""crazy"" and said they ""talk too much,"" resulting in more discipline and good-conduct credit days taken away. But women are more relational and prefer to discuss things, as opposed to men, who tend to shut down, Collins said. And women often don't relate well to prison security staff because they were typically at odds with authorities on the street, said Colette Payne, who spent five stints in prison beginning at age 14 and was part of the assessment team.  ""If I've been raped and you are yelling at me like my abuser, I see you as that person,"" said the 49-year-old who now runs a support group for former women inmates. ""I'm looking at you like you're my abuser, that's where they tension comes in."" Payne was shocked to see the use of the so-called ""crisis cage,"" where women are placed in a stand-alone cell without privacy or padding; the department has pledged to replace it. The report notes that inmates making ""crisis calls,"" in which they feel a threat to themselves or others, increased dramatically from early 2014 to late 2015, and monthly suicide attempts increased tenfold since the Logan consolidation. The report praises the state Corrections Department for agreeing on necessary change and constructing a mental-health unit at the prison. Baldwin, who also addressed the Chicago forum, called the haphazard 2013 consolidation ""a setup for failure"" and said the agency is adding staff training, ""from how to work with women who have a mental illness to how to be more effective in communicating with offenders."" Ed Caumiant, corrections liaison for the prison guards' union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said the union is ready to work with the department on adequate staffing as well as training. Deanne Benos, a former Corrections assistant director whose Chicago-based Women's Justice Initiative coordinated the project, said one reason Illinois succeeded in the competitive grant process was Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's criminal justice reform pledge. He wants to reduce the prison population by 25 percent by 2025.  ""Meaningful changes can be made with limited resources,"" Benos said. ""Even changing some of the rules and operational practices at Logan can have a dramatic impact on the facility."" ___ Contact Political Writer John O'Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor.

Michael Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general tapped Friday by Trump, was highly critical of Fethullah Gulen in an Election Day op-ed for the Washington, D.C.-based newspaper The Hill.  ""Gulen's vast global network has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network. From Turkey's point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey's Osama bin Laden,"" Flynn wrote. ""We should not provide him safe haven."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan contends Gulen orchestrated an attempted military coup in July and has demanded his extradition. President Barack Obama's administration has not complied. Gulen has never been charged with a crime in the U.S., and he has consistently denounced terrorism as well as the failed coup in Turkey. One of Gulen's lawyers, Jason Weinstein, called Flynn's comments about Gulen ""troubling"" but said the extradition process is a legal matter in the hands of the Department of Justice.  ""We hope and expect that the law will be followed here and that politics will not interfere with the judgment of career officials at DOJ. If the law is followed, then we are confident that Mr. Gulen will not be returned to Turkey, where he is certain to be subject to torture, a sham trial, and execution,"" Weinstein said in a statement. According to Senate records, Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, registered as a lobbyist on Sept. 15 for a Dutch-based company headed by a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. The Senate disclosure says Flynn ""will advise client on U.S. domestic and foreign policy."" Alptekin told The Associated Press on Friday that while he believes Gulen leads a ""criminal organization,"" he has no connection to Erdogan's government and had nothing to do with Flynn's article.  ""It is simply preposterous,"" said Alptekin, who also chairs the Turkish-American Business Council. ""I would never dare suggest anything like that, and if I had, my relationship (with Flynn) would have been immediately over."" He said his business consultancy, Inovo B.V., hired Flynn Intel to advise it on security issues in the Middle East. Robert Kelley, the chief counsel to Flynn Intel Group, didn't immediately return an email from The Associated Press seeking comment. Flynn said in a statement previously that if he returns to ""government service, my relationship with my company will be severed, in accordance with the policy announced by President-elect Trump."" In the op-ed, Flynn asserted that Gulen's moderate image masks a hidden ""radical Islamist"" agenda. He did not provide evidence. Gulen has criticized Erdogan, his onetime ally, over the Turkish leader's authoritarian rule. The Erdogan regime has launched a broad campaign against Gulen's movement in Turkey and abroad, purging civil servants suspected of ties to the movement, seizing businesses and closing media organizations. In the United States, a lawyer hired by the Turkish government has lodged numerous accusations against a network of about 150 publicly funded charter schools started by followers of Gulen, whose philosophy blends a mystical form of Islam with advocacy of democracy, education, science and interfaith dialogue. Nobody associated with the U.S. schools has been charged with wrongdoing. Gulen has lived on a compound in the Pocono Mountains since 1999. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press, Ban said Trump is showing signs of pulling back from his tough statements during a ""difficult political campaign.""  ""Slowly he is now showing some signs of changes from what he had been saying,"" Ban said. ""I hope he will be engaging closely with world leaders and he will be closely working together with the United Nations."" Trump's campaign promises included building a wall along the Mexican border, but he appeared to soften his stance after the election, saying in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" he may be amenable to a fence along some parts.  ""I'm asking world leaders not to erect walls,"" Ban said on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in Marrakech, adding he would meet with Trump to discuss ""all the matters of our common concern."" Reflecting on the state of the world as he prepares to leave office, Ban said a surge in nationalism and populism has resulted in some ""changes in the political scene around the world, particularly in Europe and now in the United States and some in Asia, too."" He said he thinks it has to do with people feeling angry and disheartened by economic inequalities and that during his 10 years as U.N. secretary-general he has urged world leaders to pay more attention to the concerns of their citizens.  ""Some leaders have been listening to my calls and their calls. And some leaders have been indifferent. That is the place where we see problems,"" Ban said. Looking back on his tenure, he said it's been a very tough but rewarding experience.  ""As a former secretary-general of the United Nations I cannot be indifferent to world affairs,"" he said.

Schock's attorneys ask that his arraignment be shifted to Dec. 12-15, noting federal prosecutors did not object to rescheduling the proceeding. They also say the hearing date conflicted with their schedules. The 35-year-old Schock was indicted by a federal grand jury last week on 24 felony counts.

Russia in 2000 signed the Rome treaty that established the Hague-based court but never ratified it. Putin's decree, published on the Kremlin's website, comes a day after the U.N. General Assembly's human rights committee approved a resolution condemning Russia's ""temporary occupation of Crimea"" and blamed Russia for rights abuses such as discrimination against some Crimean residents, such as Tatars. Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014 from Ukraine following a hastily called referendum, a move that led to crippling Western sanctions. A separatist insurgency erupted in eastern Ukraine the following month, backed by Russia. The ICC on Monday issued a preliminary report where it described what happened in Crimea as ""an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation."" His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, explained the withdrawal by ""national interests"" and argued that since Russia never ratified it Wednesday's decree was just a formality. Peskov also dismissed the ICC's accusations of an ""armed conflict"" in Crimea, arguing that Crimea joined Russia after a legitimate popular vote. Russia's foreign ministry insisted in a statement that Russia wants everyone implicated in grave international crimes to face justice but expressed frustration over the court's work in recent years.  ""The court has unfortunately failed to match the hopes one had and did not become a truly independent and respected body of international justice,"" the ministry said, adding that in the ICCs' 14 years of work ""only four verdicts"" have been passed while $1 billion was spent on expenses. Just hours before Russia's announcement, the U.N. human rights chief made a spirited defense of the ICC, entreating countries not to leave it. Several African nations have recently announced plans to leave the treaty. ___ Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In his first extended remarks on the election that pounded his party and his legacy, Obama sought to reassure an anxious world and nation about his successor's commitments to alliances, at times appearing almost sanguine about a future Trump administration. Although he would not explicitly say Trump was qualified for the office, he said he believed the first-time officeholder would do his best to unite the nation, calling him pragmatic. He refused to wade into a political firestorm over Trump's decision to name a far-right conservative media mogul as a top adviser. And he expressed hope that the weight of the presidency will force Trump to overcome his shortcomings.  ""He has won. He's going to be the next president and regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up,"" Obama said. ""And some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history, those are ones that hopefully he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people."" Obama's refusal to criticize his successor was a 180-degree reversal from the rhetoric of his campaign takedowns. Only a week ago, as he campaigned for Hillary Clinton, Obama said Trump was ""woefully unprepared for the job"" and couldn't ""handle the nuclear codes."" ___ Giuliani emerges as favorite for Trump's secretary of state WASHINGTON -- Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has emerged as the favorite to serve as secretary of state in Donald Trump's incoming administration, a senior Trump official said on Monday -- another indication the president-elect is putting a prize on loyalty as he narrows down his Cabinet picks. The official, who was not authorized to speak on the record and requested anonymity, said there was no real competition for the job and that it was Giuliani's if he wanted it. But a second official cautioned that John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, remained in contention for the job. Giuliani, 72, would be an out-of-box choice to lead the State Department. A former mayor, federal prosecutor and top Trump adviser, he lacks extensive foreign policy experience. Known for his hard-line law-and-order views and brusque manner, he would set a very different tone than previous holders of the job, including Trump's ex-rival Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. Bolton has years of federal government experience, but he has also raised eyebrows with some of his hawkish stances, including a 2015 op-ed in The New York Times in which he advocated bombing Iran to halt the country's development of nuclear weapons. A spokeswoman for Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his interest in the job. But the former mayor said Monday night at a gathering of CEOs sponsored by the Wall Street Journal that he ""won't be attorney general"" in Trump's administration -- a job for which he'd long been seen as a top contender. ___ 10 Things to Know for Tuesday Your daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Tuesday: 1. OBAMA BREAKS WITH DEMOCRATIC ALLIES ON TRUMP The president abandons his dire warnings about his newly elected successor, saying he believes Trump will do his best to unite the nation. 2. FRONT-RUNNER EMERGES FOR SECRETARY OF STATE Ex-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the favorite for the key cabinet post in Trump's administration, an AP source says. ___ Ouster of extremists from Iraqi town leaves bitter divisions QAYARA, Iraq -- On the main shopping street of the town of Qayara, murals put up by the Islamic State group that told people how to dress and behave have been hastily painted over. New signs touting nationalism and unity now line a main highway since Iraqi forces drove the extremists from the Tigris River Valley town in August. Deeper inside Qayara, however, fresh graffiti has appeared on some streets, revealing bitterness, anger and lasting fissures among the population.  ""Blood for blood,"" reads the Arabic script spray-painted outside a destroyed home on the town's northern edge. Neighbors said the house belonged to a man who joined IS when the group first rose to power in 2014. Slang and obscenities against the owner also are written on a partially destroyed garden wall. When Qayara was retaken by Iraqi security forces, it was hailed as an early triumph over the extremists as the country prepared for the long-awaited offensive to liberate the second-largest city Mosul that began Oct. 17. But for some residents, the ouster of IS doesn't feel like victory. ___ Obama, Clinton tell Democrats not to despair WASHINGTON -- Democratic leaders delivered pep talks to demoralized supporters on Monday, promising to reassess their strategy, message and organization in the wake of last week's devastating defeat.  ""You're allowed to mope for a week and half maybe two,"" President Barack Obama told Democratic National Committee members on a conference call. ""But after that we've got to brush ourselves off and get to work."" The party has entered a period of soul-searching, as Democrats try to chart their direction in the Donald Trump era. An ascendant liberal wing is pushing for a serious shift toward an economic populist message that could win back white working-class voters who backed Trump. Party activists, donors and politicians are also advocating for significant changes in leadership, with a group of younger House members trying to postpone leadership elections in an effort to force a discussion about the direction of the party.  ""There's a general feeling that the Democratic Party itself needs some serious reform and has grown very distant from the kind of communities it represents,"" said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors who gathered in Washington for a three-day strategy session this week. ___ ICC prosecutors: US forces may have committed war crimes THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- U.S. armed forces and the CIA may have committed war crimes by torturing detainees in Afghanistan, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor said in a report Monday, raising the possibility that American citizens could be indicted even though Washington has not joined the global court.  ""Members of US armed forces appear to have subjected at least 61 detained persons to torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity on the territory of Afghanistan between 1 May 2003 and 31 December 2014,"" according to the report issued by Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's office. The report added that CIA operatives may have subjected at least 27 detainees in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania to ""torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity and/or rape"" between December 2002 and March 2008. Most of the alleged abuse happened in 2003-2004, the report said. Prosecutors said they will decide ""imminently"" whether to seek authorization to open a full-scale investigation in Afghanistan that could lead to war crimes charges. ___ 2016 set to break heat record despite slowdown in emissions MARRAKECH, Morocco -- Global temperatures are soaring toward a record high this year, the U.N. weather agency said Monday, while another report showed emissions of a key global warming gas have flattened out in the past three years. The reports injected a mix of gloom and hope at U.N. climate talks in Marrakech this week.  ""Another year. Another record. The high temperatures we saw in 2015 are set to be beaten in 2016,"" said Petteri Taalas, the head of the World Meteorological Organization. WMO's preliminary data through October showed world temperatures, boosted by the El Nino phenomenon, are 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. That's getting close to the limit set by the global climate agreement adopted in Paris last year. It calls for limiting the temperature rise since the industrial revolution to 2 degrees C or even 1.5 degrees C. ___ Editor: Breitbart plans to be 'best place for news on Trump' NEW YORK -- Following the installation of Breitbart's chief executive to a top job in President-elect Donald Trump's administration, the news organization in its infancy when Barack Obama took office has big expansion plans and the goal of being the best source of news on the new administration. That scares its critics, which consider Breitbart News the home of cheerleaders rather than journalists -- and often offensive ones at that. Despite the opponents, Breitbart is unquestionably on a high following the surprise election of Trump, whose candidacy the web site unceasingly backed both before and after its leader, Stephen K. Bannon, was brought in to run the general election campaign. Trump on Sunday named Bannon chief strategist and senior counselor for his administration. Breitbart is planning a move into more spacious Washington offices, looking to add reporters in Germany, France, the Middle East and Asia, wants to add coverage of the media and technology to its conservative-framed news and hopes to produce more video, said Alexander Marlow, the site's editor in chief, on Monday. Its own cable network is a dream, but unlikely now, he said.  ""We're going to be the best place for news on the Trump White House,"" Marlow said. ""That is my intention and I have no reason to think that's not a fully attainable goal. I think a lot of the mainstream media already consider that the expectation and they're none too happy about it, which of course is a delight to me."" ___ PBS journalist Gwen Ifill dies of cancer NEW YORK -- Gwen Ifill, co-anchor of PBS' ""NewsHour"" with Judy Woodruff and a veteran journalist who moderated two vice presidential debates, died Monday of cancer, the network said. She was 61. A former reporter for The New York Times and The Washington Post, Ifill switched to television in the 1990s and covered politics and Congress for NBC News. She moved to PBS in 1999 as host of ""Washington Week"" and also worked for the nightly ""NewsHour"" program. She and Woodruff were named co-anchors in 2013. She moderated vice presidential debates in 2004 and 2008 and authored the book, ""The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama."" The president on Monday praised Ifill for informing today's citizens while also inspiring a young generation of journalists. ___ PHOTO GALLERY: Supermoon puts on a show around the world The moon is putting on a show for sky gazers worldwide. The phenomenon known as the supermoon occurs because the moon follows an elliptical orbit around the Earth. This week, the moon is coming closer to the Earth than at any time since January 1948. The supermoon appears about 14 percent larger in diameter and about 30 percent brighter than when it's at its farthest distance from the Earth. The moon reached its peak luminescence in North America before dawn Monday. Its zenith in Asia and the South Pacific was Monday night. Across the international dateline in New Zealand, it was to reach its brightest after midnight Tuesday local time. Here's a look at the supermoon from around the world. ___ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Who blinks first?	"    Donald Trump arrives at RNC headquarters for a meeting with Paul Ryan in July. The two have not posed for any photographs together this year. That will change today. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Donald Trump will lunch with Paul Ryan at 12:30 p.m. at the Capitol Hill Club after he drops by the White House to meet with Barack Obama. The speaker of the House declared at his post-election press conference yesterday that the president-elect has won ""a mandate."" But a mandate for what? -- Trump's victory represents nothing less than a repudiation of Ryan's brand of Republicanism, both substantively and stylistically. The two have sharply different views of what it means to be a conservative, and they want to take the Republican Party down different paths. Ryan is strongly pro-trade, pro-immigration, pro-entitlement reform, pro-religious tolerance and pro-NATO. After the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" video came out, the 2012 vice-presidential nominee said he would no longer defend or campaign for him. While he would reverse himself soon after, that pronouncement prompted the thin-skinned Trump to unleash a stream of vindictive attacks. Keep in mind that the next president posted this less than a month ago (before his staff took control of his Twitter account):  Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2016   For months now, Ryan has carried around a pamphlet with the House Republican's ""Better Way"" agenda. He has pivoted every unwelcome question about Trump into a paean about policy. But the manifesto is full of positions that run counter to the platform Trump ran on. Trump has solemnly and repeatedly vowed to never reduce Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security benefits. Ryan's career has been defined by his quest to reform entitlements and the tax code. Trump even said during the primaries that he knew Mitt Romney would lose the election once he picked Ryan as his running mate. ""I said, 'You got to be kidding,'"" Trump recalled. ""He represented cutting entitlements, etc., etc. The only one that's not going to cut is me!"" At another event, he said of Ryan: ""This guy lost four years ago in like a landslide."" Trump went on to criticize the so-called ""Ryan budget"" for costing Republicans House seats. Trump wants to build a wall, create a deportation force and block at least some Muslims from entering this country. Ryan supports legal status for undocumented immigrants and has negotiated with Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), one of the most liberal members of Congress, in search of bipartisan agreement on comprehensive immigration reform. In the recent past, Trump accused Ryan of backing ""open borders and amnesty."" Trump also says he does not want to defund Planned Parenthood, a top priority for many social conservatives in the House. ""You can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly,"" Trump said earlier in 2016. Ryan supported creating a special House panel to target and harass these providers of women's services. There are many other issues on which Ryan and Trump disagree, such as eminent domain, but they are somewhat moot because they will not be on the docket in the next four years. As Jonathan Martin puts it in today's New York Times, ""Trump ran as a Republican, but he was effectively a third-party candidate who happened to campaign under the banner of one of the two major parties."" Looking at the whole picture, you might sum it up this way: Paul Ryan knew Jack Kemp. Jack Kemp was a mentor of his. And Donald Trump is no Jack Kemp.    Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus huddle at the Republican convention in Cleveland in July. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)   -- There will undoubtedly be concerted efforts by both sides to paper over these profound differences, just as there were during the campaign. Especially if Trump installs Reince Priebus as his White House chief of staff, which he is very seriously considering. The RNC chairman went on ""Morning Joe"" to insist that Trump only plans to deport criminals. ""He's not calling for mass deportation,"" Reince claimed. ""He said, 'No, only people who have committed crimes.'"" The fact this lunch got scheduled so easily also demonstrates that Trump realizes he needs some friends on the Hill. -- Ryan, trying to keep the far-right Freedom Caucus at bay, has little incentive to underscore division. Especially going into next week's leadership elections, in which he is expected to easily get reelected as Speaker. He too wants a productive working relationship with Trump, a message he conveyed during a phone call on Tuesday night. ""I don't worry about intraparty issues,"" Ryan insisted yesterday. ""I feel very good about where we are. ... I'm very excited about our ability to work together. ... Donald Trump pulled off an amazing political feat. He deserves tremendous credit for that. It helped us keep our majorities."" -- Indeed, right now the Republican mood on Capitol Hill is jubilant. The Republicans have unified control of government for the first time since the 2006 midterms. And there are many areas of common ground. Repealing Obamacare will be near the top of the list, but there are many other high-profile items they could focus on during the first 100 days, including allowing the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and rolling back Dodd-Frank. -- But the Republican civil war did not end on Tuesday night. The battlefield just changed. A Senate Republican argued during a conversation on the eve of the election that Hillary's expected victory would be a balm for intraparty division because it would unite fractious Republicans in opposition to her. It undoubtedly would have been easier for GOP leadership to marshal opposition to Clinton's agenda, and her judicial nominees, than build support for some of Trump's highest priorities.    Paul Ryan speaks to the press in Janesville, Wis., yesterday. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)   -- The ingredients are all there for tensions to flare up again in the future: Many people in Ryan's orbit think that the speaker can roll Trump. They guess that Donald does not really believe anything he says and just took whatever positions he needed in order to obtain power. They think that he just wants to ""win"" but does not care deeply about what exactly -- as long as he's ""winning."" They are happy to play along, and Ryan can pass legislation that may not be his top priority but which he can claim shows he's being successful. Rank-and-file Republicans on the Hill also predict that Trump will not be interested in the minutiae and drudgery of governance, which will empower them to ram through their own agenda. And they believe that they can install conventional Republicans who subscribe to their orthodoxies in most of the thousands of postings that will open up across the administration and Cabinet-level agencies, which will allow conservatives to roll back the regulatory state Obama's people have built up. Many people close to Trump think congressional Republicans will defer to him, as they did when George W. Bush took office. Do not discount the fact that Trump, with his alpha dog personality, sees all of the capitulation, kowtowing and ring-kissing by Republican congressional leaders during the campaign as signs of their total weakness. He's publicly mocked such behavior, in the past, as pathetic. He thinks he can continue pushing these guys around because, for all intents and purposes, they have allowed him to push them around. He has constantly humiliated them since he locked down the nomination with his Indiana primary win, and they always fall back in line. And now he's just won when few thought he could. People who have spoken with Trump say he still does not fully appreciate how constrained he will be in many areas (without running roughshod over the Constitution). The former reality TV star does know, however, that he now has a much bigger bully pulpit than Ryan. -- What makes 2017 so hard to forecast is that no one but Trump really has any clue which version of Trump will assume the presidency on Jan. 20:  As someone who spent 15 months researching Trump's past statements, if anyone says they know what a President Trump will do they're lying.-- andrew kaczynski (@KFILE) November 9, 2016   -- Trump's plans are already running headlong into reality. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had a better night on Tuesday than anyone but Trump, declared at his presser yesterday afternoon that Congress will not take up the president-elect's call for term limits. Asked about the border wall, McConnell dodged twice. ""I want to try to achieve border security in a way that is most effective,"" he said. ""I think overreaching after an election, generally speaking, is a mistake,"" McConnell added later. (McConnell invited Trump to visit him in his Capitol office at 1:30 p.m.) In fairness, this happens to every president. Obama issued an executive order almost as soon as he was in the door to order the closure of the military prison at Guantanamo Bay. It remains open -- because he couldn't get Congress to go along, even when he had supermajorities.    Trump speaks on the final rally of his campaign in Grand Rapids, Michigan. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   -- Trump's relationship with Ryan is probably as important to determining the success of his first 100 days as anything else, and it enters this new phase with quite a lot of baggage... Ryan was rolling out the poverty section of his ""Better Way"" agenda in June when a reporter asked about Trump's attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel. In a fraud suit against Trump University (which is still pending, by the way), Trump said that the Indiana-born federal judge is incapable of being impartial because his parents were born in Mexico. ""Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,"" Ryan replied. How much will Ryan feel compelled to speak out against the new president? In July, when Trump retweeted an image of a Star-of-David shape created by someone who'd previously tweeted Nazi imagery, Ryan said ""anti-Semitic images have no place in this campaign."" Ryan publicly disagreed with Trump three other times this summer: after he called on the Russians to hack Clinton's emails, when Trump said the NATO security guarantee would no longer necessarily apply should he win and when he picked a fight with the Gold Star Khan family after the Democratic convention. ""It sounds like a joke gone bad,"" he told reporters. In September, when Trump praised Vladimir Putin as a stronger leader than Obama, Ryan said: ""Putin is an aggressor who does not share our interests.""    Trump campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon stand on stage during Trump's victory speech. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)   -- Keep a very close eye on Trump's friends at Breitbart. Trump campaign CEO Stephen Bannon has said he plans to go back to the conservative website now that the election is over. There's no reason to think he will not exercise enormous influence over the new occupant of the White House. Bannon has long seen Ryan as an enemy. His site was the biggest cheerleader for Paul Nehlen, Ryan's quixotic primary challenger in Wisconsin this summer. There was a daily deluge of hit pieces on Ryan and stories aimed at boosting fundraising for his challenger. And the site continued to put out long pieces right up until the election that accused Ryan of conspiring to throw the election to Clinton. In private emails to Breitbart reporters, which were leaked to the Daily Beast after he joined the Trump campaign, Bannon used some of the most vulgar language possible to describe Ryan and Republican leaders in Congress. The Hill published another exchange in which Bannon told an editor who worked for him that he wanted to destroy Ryan and rejected a proposal to open a bridge. -- The war for the soul of the conservative movement may wind up playing out between Bannon's Breitbart and the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, which probably comes to closet to representing Ryan's ideological views. (National Review and the Weekly Standard will also be important voices amidst the intellectual fights to come over what it means to be a conservative). -- Sean Hannity, who has acknowledged being an informal adviser to Trump throughout the campaign, is another outspoken Ryan critic and will continue to have his prime-time platform on Fox News. Hannity called in to the cable channel during its live election coverage Tuesday night to say he'd just spoken with Trump three times. ""Paul Ryan is not going to be the speaker of the House,"" Hannity told viewers. TRUMP TAKING CONTROL -- THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER:    -- ""Donald Trump is going to be our president,"" Hillary Clinton said in her concession speech at the New Yorker hotel. ""We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" (Read the full transcript.)    -- ""It is no secret that the president-elect and I have some pretty significant differences,"" Barack Obama said in the Rose Garden. ""But remember, eight years ago President Bush and I had some pretty significant differences. But President Bush's team could not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition so that we could hit the ground running. And one thing you realize quickly in this job is that the presidency and the vice presidency is bigger than any of us. So I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago.... Because we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world."" (Read the full transcript.)    New York City Police Department officers stand guard near Trump Tower now that Trump is president-elect. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)   -- In New York, Trump met with Mike Pence and a handful of advisers at the Trump Tower yesterday, contemplating the makeup of his White House and Cabinet. Candidates being considered for top positions include Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Steven Mnuchin, who formerly led Trump's campaign finance team, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former House speaker Newt Gingrich, aides said. (Philip Rucker and Robert Costa) -- Costa and Rucker hear that the two leading contenders for chief of staff are Priebus and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski: ""As party chairman for nearly six years, Priebus boasts deep ties with the GOP's elected officials, donors and other luminaries. ... Lewandowski would be a relative newcomer to the Washington power structure but has the trust and confidence of the president-elect."" -- Such staff appointments will be very telling about how Trump plans to run the West Wing, and former presidential advisers urged him to move slowly with making appointments. ""People will watch to see whether the new administration acts as though it has a mandate or looks at the fact that more people voted against him than for him as a brake on those who want revenge or want to jam ideas onto a skeptical people,"" said William M. Daley, former Obama White House chief of staff. -- Meanwhile, in Washington, a White House transition team chaired by the politically tainted Christie continued to lay the groundwork. The group is led day to day by Rich Bagger, a longtime Christie adviser; William Hagerty, a key player on Romney's 2012 transition team; and other establishment hands. Former Utah governor and Bush-era health secretary Michael O. Leavitt has also been formally advising the team. -- Many of Trump's most outspoken critics on Capitol Hill pledged to try working with him in a bipartisan way. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told fellow Democrats they have a ""responsibility to find common ground"" with Trump and that she was prepared to work with him on an infrastructure bill, indicating that Democratic leaders do not plan to pursue a strategy of ""reflexive opposition"" to Trump's agenda. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders also put out conciliatory statements. (Mike DeBonis)    Trump participates in a rally with daughter-in-law Lara Trump (L) and Omarosa Manigault (R) in Charlotte last month. (Erik S. Lesser/Reuters)   -- Meanwhile, a senior Trump campaign official said the campaign has been keeping an ENEMIES LIST: ""Let me just tell you, Mr. Trump has a long memory and we're keeping a list,"" Omarosa Manigault, the campaign's director of African American outreach, told Independent Journal Review, a conservative news site. Asked about Lindsey Graham voting for Evan McMullin, she said: ""It's so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get in to the White House, we know where we stand."" Others on the campaign responded that Omarosa made it up. ""I have never heard of that and I have never seen such a list, and I don't think that any sort of a list like that is ever helpful in anything,"" COO Jeff DeWit said in a radio interview, reported on by CNN. ""So if I ever hear of a list like that, I will, I'll burn it. I'll throw it in the fire personally is the way I feel about it."" -- House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said he will continue investigating Clinton's use of a private email server at the State Department. ""I still have a duty and obligation to get to the truth about one of the largest breaches of security at the State Department,"" he said. Top oversight committee Democrat Elijah Cummings (Md.) called his remarks ""extremely disappointing,"" saying they run counter to post-election efforts at unity. Other Republicans said it is time to move on. ""I think the sentence and the conviction came last night in the vote,"" said Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.). (Lisa Rein)    Trump's then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort speaks at a breakfast during the RNC. (Patrick Fallon/Bloomberg)   -- ""Trump and [James] Comey have never met. But former senior officials say that once they do, Trump will quickly see how much he needs Comey,"" Ellen Nakashima and Sari Horwitz report. ""One potential wrinkle in the relationship, though, could be the FBI's interest in Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, and allegations of illegal financial dealings in Ukraine, according to officials with knowledge of the case. The bureau refrained from taking investigative steps that might become public as the election drew near to avoid potentially influencing the election outcome. But now that voting is over, the bureau could proceed with the probe.""     Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter. With contributions from Elise Viebeck (@eliseviebeck).

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:    -- Vigils and protests continued into the early hours of Thursday as thousands of anti-Trump protesters expressed dismay with the election results, decrying his crude rhetoric and underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting the fractured country. From Matea Gold, Kari Lydersen and Fenit Nirappil: ""Protests were reported in cities across the nation, from major metropolitan centers like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, to smaller cities, such as Richmond and Portland, Ore. Dozens of demonstrators were reportedly arrested. Even cities in red states, such as Atlanta, Dallas and Kansas City, Mo., saw demonstrations."" Thousands of protesters gathered in front of Trump Tower in New York, with crowds spanning several blocks. Earlier, the protesters had marched from Union Square, chanting ""Donald Trump, go away! Sexist, racist, anti-gay!"" At one point, demonstrators lit an American flag on fire. Later, a glowing ""Love Trumps Hate"" banner was held aloft under the Trump Tower sign. ""He's going to lead us to a very dark place for women,"" said one Chicago college student, with a sign reading ""Amerikkka elected a rapist."" Here's some pictures of the scene in the streets:    (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)      (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   -- People in California shut down California's 101 for a time, calling for a ""Cal-exit"" succession from the United States in the wake of Trump's win. Plans are being made for a march on the capitol today in Sacramento. Well-known venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar has offered to bankroll the movement, confirming his plans in a CNBC interview. ""It's the most patriotic thing I can do,"" he said. ""The country is at serious crossroads.""

Tim Kaine and Anne Holton as HRC concedes at The New Yorker Hotel in midtown Manhattan. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- Tim Kaine is gearing up for his return to the chamber next week. There will be no special Virginia election in 2017 after all. He will probably skate to reelection in 2018 since the midterms will be a bad year for the incumbent president. And it's hard to imagine Kaine, a former DNC chair, not running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. ""There was a time when it looked as though Kaine's star would shoot from Virginia's capitol city straight to Number One Observatory Circle on a wave of dad jokes and harmonica riffs,"" Jenna Portnoy writes. ""But less than four months after his journey around the country began, he is poised to return to a Republican-controlled Senate with national profile but scars from a devastating defeat."" The upside? Many say Kaine's expertise on the constitutional powers of the presidency will be particularly valuable as Trump assumes office. -- Tom Cotton defended Trump's support for waterboarding, claiming that this enhanced interrogation tactic does not constitute torture. ""Waterboarding isn't torture. We do waterboarding on our own soldiers in the military,"" Cotton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""We have to play the game the way they're playing the game. You're not going to win if we're soft and they're, they have no rules."" AMERICA STANDS DIVIDED: -- ""America woke up Wednesday as two nations. One jubilant, hopeful, validated.

He walked to his son's room to get him ready for school. 'Who won?' 8-year-old Bilal asked ... Sadi, 34, could hardly say the words. 'Donald Trump won,' he said. Bilal's jaw dropped, and his dad tried to remain calm as he walked downstairs to prepare breakfast. About an hour away, in the small, heavily working-class town of Dunn, truck driver Gary Godwin strode into Sherry's Bakery with a smile on his face. 'That's my man!' Godwin said. 'Trump is a businessman. He'll get people to stop sitting on their porch and not working. No one knows how to do anything.' It was morning in Trump's America, hours after the Republican's improbable victory. The election had been grueling, and the polarization it brought to the country did not die at the ballot box. The diverging views in two North Carolina communities -- so close geographically, and yet so far apart culturally -- showed how the divisions exposed during the campaign will be difficult, if not impossible, to heal.""    -- Emotions ran high at many schools, as teachers sought to explain what the polarizing election results mean for the country's future. Educators scrapped lesson plans, comforted crying students, and held schoolwide assemblies to assuage fears. Some districts said they are offering counseling services to students and staff fearful about the results. (Moriah Balingit and Donna St. George) -- ""'I don't feel safe': Undocumented immigrants fear what Trump will do as president,"" by Michael E. Miller: ""For undocumented immigrants, however, their futures have taken a startling turn, from the promise of immigration reform under Clinton to the threat of deportation under Trump. 'We are now facing an entirely different system of reality to what we are used to,' said Jose Antonio Vargas, a [reporter-turned-activist] who is perhaps the country's most prominent undocumented immigrant. On Election Day, a man who recognized Vargas outside of Fox News patted him on the back. 'Get ready to be deported,' the man told him."" -- If Trump sticks to his immigration pledges, he will begin an unprecedented, exorbitantly expensive, and logistically difficult illegal immigration operation to remove millions from the country while fortifying the border. Yet even with the potential difficulties, Trump will have the administrative tools to massively scale back the Obama administration's efforts to shield millions of immigrants from deportation, former federal officials say,"" according to Chico Harlan and Jerry Markon. ""With the stroke of a pen, for example, Trump could reverse a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of people brought to the United States illegally as children -- something he has vowed to do. The new president could also change the priorities of the Department of Homeland Security, exposing even more of the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants to sudden deportation."" -- ""Tuesday's vote left unresolved whether the ugly narrative of unprincipled demagogue vs. dishonest harridan really reflects a country that has fallen into coarse, raw hatred -- or if the 2016 campaign was instead a symptom of the newly pervasive power of Facebook, Twitter and other social media,"" Marc Fisher writes. ""Through traditional news media and new social media, an unusually captivated audience saw this campaign as a disorienting kaleidoscope of bloodcurdling anger at raucous rallies, waves of investigation and suspicion, and torrents of insults traded by candidates and their supporters. ... The line between public and private blurred so thoroughly that nasty, hurtful comments that people once made only to their closest family members and friends were now broadcast to the world at large. Congress, the news media and politicians overall -- the usual basement dwellers in any accounting of the nation's least-trusted institutions -- fell to new lows. But the biggest shift seemed to take place on the smallest stages.""    MILLIONS OF WOMEN CONTINUE TO GRIEVE THIS MORNING: -- The results have been a body blow for many who were excited about the prospect of the first female president. There is palpable fear that reproductive rights will be rolled back bigly, especially if Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot make it four more years. And there is panic about what kind of message it sends to other powerful men that a guy who has talked in such vulgar terms about women, and who more than a dozen publicly accused of sexual assault, will be the leader of our country. Will other guys think they can get away with sexual harassment now? Days ago, the conversation was all about how the Trump imbroglio had changed the contours of the debate about sexual assault in a good way. Now, for many, it seems like the country has taken a gigantic step backward in this area. Some believe that Trump's victory is an even bigger humiliation for women than when Clarence Thomas got confirmed to SCOTUS despite the testimony of Anita Hill.  -- We keep hearing demoralizing stories like this about what might be dubbed the Trump Effect: A group of younger guys from his victory party followed a group of Democratic female Hill staffers leaving Clinton's event in the wee hours of yesterday morning. The women said they got cat-called and told repeatedly to ""smile."" Talk about sore winners.

The key quote from her speech: ""To all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. Now, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.""    Vicki Slater, a Democratic activist, watches returns come in on websites at a watch party Tuesday night in Jackson, Miss. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)   -- ""Waiting for history in Mississippi, a state with a dismal record of electing women,"" by Mary Jordan: ""[Vicki Slater] knew it would be tough for Clinton to win her state. Never once has a woman been elected as governor or to Congress, making it the only state in the union with that distinction. So last year Slater, a 60-year-old trial lawyer, decided to run for governor herself after years of trying to recruit other women to do it. She was widely seen as the favorite to win the Democratic Party's nomination. But she lost in the primary to a man, a long-haul truck driver who campaigned so little that his own mother didn't know he was running. Stunned party officials said several factors were at play, including Slater's gender. 'I am the woman from Mississippi who lost to the truck driver!"" Slater told Clinton when she met her at a fundraiser in the spring. 'Don't give up. Do not ever give up,' Clinton told her."" -- ""At what was supposed to be the Pennsylvania Democratic Party's celebration in Philadelphia, several devastated women were lying on the carpeted ballroom floor, tears welling,"" Jodi Kantor reports in the Times. ""A few said they could barely speak. The success of the Republican real estate mogul left many American women in a state of shock over a victory they had counted on belonging to them, their sisters, aunts and girlfriends. Late into the night, mothers said they were not sure how they were going to break the news to their sleeping daughters in the morning. ... Many female Clinton supporters said they were experiencing a depth of loss and frustration that some of the women, especially the young ones, had never felt before.""    A woman reacts to election returns at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on Tuesday night. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)   -- The nation's newspapers are full of similar accounts, many in the first-person. ""I thought about [Bill] rising steadily through his political career, on the track we have built for charismatic, competent white men,"" writes Lindy West, the author of a book called ""Shrill."" ""He must have known, every second, how good his wife was. Not just good, but 'the best.' Better than everyone he'd ever met; better than him, even. And he watched her stand next to him and wait, and wait, and wait, underestimated and degraded and excoriated for wanting more out of life than cookies. And she didn't quit! She swallowed slander and humiliation and irrational hatred for three decades and she didn't quit, and here she was, just a hair's breadth from the presidency of the United States--the first woman ever to be trusted with the rudder of the world. He must be so proud of her, I thought. It made me cry. ... I cried because I want my daughters to feel that blazing pride, that affirmation of their boundless capability ... I cried because it's not fair, and I'm so tired, and every woman I know is so tired. I cried because it does things to you to always come second. Today doesn't feel real. It is indistinguishable from fresh, close grief."" -- ""For her entire life, (Hillary) has symbolized women's power, and the forces that would limit it. That was true when her public life began almost 50 years ago, and it was true Wednesday, when it almost certainly ended,"" Yvonne Abraham writes in the Boston Globe. ""What we do know is that at every setback, where others might have given up, perhaps leaving the future to a new generation, Hillary Clinton stayed to fight. 'For too long our leaders have used politics as the art of the possible,' Hillary Rodham told fellow graduating seniors [in 1969]. 'And the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible.' She looked like the future. Only she was born a couple of decades too soon."" -- Seth Meyers got choked up on his NBC show last night as he talked about how hard Clinton's loss was for his mom: ""She was really excited yesterday, and umm... I was really sad for her."" (Daily Beast)    Hillary leaves her concession speech. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   HOW CLINTON LOST: -- One explanation for the stunning political demise of the Clintons might be the extent to which they moved away from a middle-American sensibility into the realm of the coastal elite - ""from McDonald's to veganism,"" undone by the white, working-class voters they once knew so well. A great read from The Post's David Maraniss: ""Few Americans knew the voters who rejected Hillary Clinton better than her husband. He lived among them growing up, and then studied them with a fanatical intensity during his political rise. He used that ability again later in the White House to keep his connection with the white working class, among other ways by opposing same-sex marriage and supporting reform of a welfare system that many wrongly believed was aimed primarily at helping poor minorities. [But] two decades later, when Hillary tried to reclaim the Clinton legend, everything had changed. The country and the candidate. She was no Bubba, but maybe he wasn't anymore, either. By the time she won the Democratic nomination, she had more experience than any candidate in modern times, but also as much baggage. Despite all that she has done and been, or perhaps because of it, her identity remains not singular but kaleidoscopic, with ever-changing shards of opaqueness and clarity. -- ""Ada is a complex computer algorithm that the campaign was prepared to publicly unveil after the election as its invisible guiding hand,"" John Wagner writes. ""Named for a female 19th-century mathematician -- Ada, Countess of Lovelace -- the algorithm was said to play a role in virtually every strategic decision Clinton aides made ..."" Based on a raft of previously-fed data, Ada ran 400,000 simulations a day of what the race against Trump might look like. A report that was spit out gave senior aides an idea of which battleground states were most likely to tip - and therefore, govern decisions about time and resource allocation. So what didn't Ada see? Aides say she correctly pegged Pennsylvania as an extremely important state early on. ""But it appears that the importance of other states Clinton would lose -- including Michigan and Wisconsin -- never became fully apparent ... Like much of the political establishment Ada appeared to underestimate the power of rural voters in Rust Belt states."" -- The Democratic New Deal coalition that Franklin Roosevelt forged in 1932 really has finally shattered. Look at West Virginia, which was a swing state as recently as 2004. Hillary only won 26.5 percent of the vote, breaking the previous all-time low set by George McClellan during the Civil War in 1864. Obama even got 35.5 percent in 2012, according to the University of Minnesota's Smart Politics blog. She got crushed across coal country. -- She under performed among working-class voters: CNN exit polls found just 51 percent of UNION households broke in her favor, while 49 percent went for Trump. While a spate of other polls appeared to suggest slightly better margins for the Democratic nominee (Fox News showed her up by eight points among union households, while ABC News gave her a 16-point lead) they still come as a weak performance in comparison to Obama, who in 2012 took union households by 18 points. (HuffPost) -- Might Jill Stein have cost Hillary the election? From MSNBC's Steve Benen: ""In Florida, Clinton lost by about 1.4% of the vote - but if Stein's supporters and half of Gary Johnson's backers had voted Democratic, Trump would have lost the state. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, Clinton lost by about 1.1% of the vote - but if Stein's supporters and half of Johnson's backers had voted Democratic, Trump would have lost the state. In Wisconsin, Clinton lost by about 1% of the vote - but if Stein's supporters had voted Democratic, Trump would have lost the state. In Michigan, Clinton appears to be on track to lose by about 0.3% of the vote - but if half of Stein's supporters had voted Democratic, Trump would have lost the state."" -- ""The idea of Clinton the candidate never matched the reality of Clinton on the campaign trail,"" Chris Cillizza writes. ""She underwhelmed repeatedly, running a too-cautious primary campaign that allowed a little-known Sen. Bernie Sanders to emerge as exactly what Clinton's campaign had hoped to avoid: a viable liberal challenger. Support for Clinton -- even after she won the primary campaign -- seemed obligatory rather than excited. The campaign she ran was ruthlessly efficient and organized. But what it never seemed to be was joyful or exuberant. It felt, to put a fine point on it, dutiful. Clinton was never -- in this campaign or in the 2008 race -- able to show that she was something more than the hyper-prepared, supersmart, best student in the class."" HOW TRUMP REDREW THE MAP: -- Donald delivered on his promise to flip the Democrats' electoral hold on the industrial Midwest. (The Post's graphics team made a neat, interactive exit poll breakdown here.)    These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump.   -- The relative lack of enthusiasm for Clinton killed her in the Rust Belt. ""She received far fewer votes than Obama,"" Philip Bump tabulates. ""The Democratic candidate for the presidency received fewer votes in 2016 than 2012 in 46 states. Trump got more votes than Romney in 28 states. In Michigan, Clinton got 13 percent fewer votes than Obama. Trump got 7 percent more than Romney. In Pennsylvania, Clinton got 5 percent fewer votes than Obama. Trump got 9 percent more than Romney. In Wisconsin, Clinton got 15 percent fewer votes than Obama. Trump did slightly worse than Romney -- in a state that was home to Romney's running mate. ... About 118 million votes have been counted so far, according to the Associated Press. That's fewer votes than 2012, 2008 and 2004 -- even as the population has grown by 47 million people since 2000.""     Another way of visualizing it:  Trump ran ahead of Romney in 2,465 counties. I made a map of the 159 counties where he ran 12% or more ahead. https://t.co/zXY359KAQI pic.twitter.com/QJO5d9Ey90-- Tom Bonier (@tbonier) November 10, 2016    Clinton ran ahead of Obama '12 in 184 Counties.

""One of the biggest upsets in American political history was built on a coalition of white voters unlike that of any other previous Republican candidate, according to election results and interviews with voters and demographic experts...Trump's coalition comprised not just staunchly conservative Republicans in the South and West. They were joined by millions of voters in the onetime heartlands of 20th-century liberal populism -- the Upper and Lower Midwest -- where white Americans without a college degree voted decisively to reject the more diverse, educated and cosmopolitan Democratic Party of the 21st century, making Republicans the country's dominant political party at every level of government ... 'A lot of stuff he's talking about is just God-given common sense, which I think both parties have lost,' said Tom Kirkpatrick, 51, a Trump supporter who used to work in an industrial laundry plant and is now on disability. He stood near the Florida State Capitol on Tuesday, holding an American flag. 'Let's put him in. And if he doesn't do what he says, I'll help you vote him out'""  Twelve percent of Mr. Trump's supporters approved of Mr. Obama, according to the exit polls. Trump won low-income white voters to the Republican ticket, reversing a partisan divide along class lines that is as old as the Democratic and Republican Parties. His breakthrough among white working-class voters in the North not only erased the Democratic advantage but reversed it, giving him a victory in the Electoral College while he lost the national popular vote. Trump won his biggest margins among middle-income white voters, according to exit polls, a revolt not only of the white working class but of the country's vast white middle class. Even where Democratic-leaning Hispanics are growing as a force, Mr. Trump's supporters were waiting on Tuesday.  -- HE RAN HIS CAMPAIGN LIKE A REALITY SHOW: ""The touch-maps, the projection calls; the reaches for explanation and chest-beating on MSNBC, while over on CNN Wolf Blitzer constantly interrupted John King's insistence on waiting for more Broward County numbers. The wayward attempts at live comedy and fun by Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah and the ladies of 'The View' - it all suddenly turned into a dour and futile acceptance for so many people in the strange hybrid business of entertainment and reality, including the president-elect,"" Post TV critic Hank Stuever writes. ""Yes, Donald Trump's victory happened exactly as you saw it on your television -- not just early Wednesday morning but in so much infotainment that came before it. A night many TV addicts jokingly called America's ""series finale"" had by 9 p.m. turned into a genuine, nail-biting cliffhanger. But after 10 p.m. there was no longer any clinging to the cliff. The only surprise, while plummeting, is that anyone could be surprised."" HOW THE POLLS GOT IT WRONG: -- ""The reliability of presidential polls has fluctuated wildly over the past five elections, and there's no clear pattern or evidence of systemic flaws,"" Paul Farhi writes. ""It's not necessarily that 'the polls are phony,' as Trump put it in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. The National Council on Public Polls rated presidential polls in 2004 and 2008 as the most accurate in the history of scientific sampling. However, as the number of polls has expanded over the years, there may be some degree of poll pollution in averages of all these surveys, said Lee Miringoff, director of Marist College's polling operation ... By combining polls -- some good, some bad -- into running averages, news organizations may be distorting where the race stands. 'You're tossing different modes of data collection into the stew,' he said. 'And some of those methods are unproven.'"" FALLOUT ON THE LEFT: -- ""The biggest stain on Barack Obama's political legacy may turn out to be the decimation of the Democratic Party on his watch,"" Karen Tumulty, John Wagner and Tom Hamburger write. ""Unlike Franklin Roosevelt's durable New Deal coalition, the impressive political operation that Obama built does not appear transferable to other Democrats -- and therefore, may not live on past his presidency. Meanwhile, the party has also been hollowed out in state capitals across the country. Where Democrats held 29 governorships when Obama was inaugurated, they can count only 15 in the wake of Tuesday's election. In 2017, Republicans could tie the record for controlling governorships, which is 34, set in 1922 when Warren Harding was president."" -- Another problem: Trump is unorthodox, and Republicans likely benefited from not having to run a hard-right candidate as their nominee. That, however, means it is far more difficult for the opposition party to figure out precisely WHAT it needs to oppose. It's almost certain to embolden the party's liberal wing, however, who believe Democrats' salvation is to reclaim their New Deal roots and move the party onto a more populist footing. ""Democrats need to speak more directly to voter anger,"" said progressive group leader Adam Green. ""They'll hopefully remold the party in [Warren's] image and have a more authentic message that channels that anger in a more productive direction than Trump's authoritarian message.'"" -- ""It is inconceivable that Bernie would have lost Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire,"" Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager during the Democratic nomination process, told the Boston Globe's Annie Linskey. ""It just would not have happened. Bernie Sanders was the perfect match-up against Trump because he always was a change agent. It would have taken a lot of air out of the balloon."" -- Politico's Gabriel Debenedetti says Donna Brazile won't stick around as DNC chair as Democrats go into crisis mode:""Swept dramatically from power as Republicans assumed control of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives and stood poised to make Supreme Court appointments that will dictate the direction of the Judiciary for a generation, the Democratic Party is only beginning to grapple with enormous questions - everything from who will lead to what the party will stand for. The potentially devastating uncertainties are starting to pile up, spurring big-picture panic and minutiae-laden nitpicking for a party that was convinced until the final moment that the U.S. would never elect [Trump].  There are decisions to be made, and soon: on Capitol Hill, Democrats are actively wondering whether a minority leader Chuck Schumer would welcome Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders to the leadership ranks.""  Those questions are just the beginning. Is Obama's coalition of millennials, minorities, and women not enough? Is it Clinton's party? Obama's? Warren's?"" ""It could get worse before it gets better,"" said one senior aide.    John Kasich speaks at the White House last month. (Carolyn Kaster/AP/File)   FALLOUT ON THE RIGHT: -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich has canceled a big speech he was planning to deliver on Thursday outlining a moderate, Trump-free vision for the future of the GOP. From The Plain Dealer's Henry J. Gomez: In refusing to support Trump, Kasich had hoped to redefine conservatives and assert himself as a post-election party healer. Instead, after Trump triumphed, plans for the Thursday speech were quickly scrubbed. ""Few of Kasich's political advisers would speak on the record about his political future. All agreed that, barring extraordinary developments in a Trump administration, he would not challenge a sitting president for the Republican nomination in four years ... With the White House out of reach, those close to Kasich expect him to make the most of his final two years and use his national profile at times to speak out on issues important to him."" -- Neither George H.W. nor W. Bush voted for Trump but both former presidents called to congratulate him and offer their support yesterday.    THE WORLD REACTS: -- ""After a campaign of bombastic sound bites and often contradictory policy prescriptions, Trump's plans remain opaque for dealing with issues including terrorism, Russian aggression and multiple shooting wars in the Middle East,"" Karen DeYoung writes. ""He has called for increased military strength and more forceful American leadership, while also speaking of stepping back from U.S. responsibilities as the free world's primary protector. He has invited China to invade North Korea and 'solve that problem,' but also said he would host North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the White House. He said he would renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal, and then called for strict enforcement of the existing agreement. His plan to combat the Islamic State, Trump said during the campaign, is a secret."" With little clarity on plans, the best initial indicator of Trump's approach may be those he chooses for his national security team. Many of the names floated so far strike fear in the hearts of mainstream leaders, while others instill a sense of reassurance. Karen has the short list: Among the rumored candidates for secretary of state are Newt Gingrich and former U.N. ambassador John Bolton -- both outspoken Trump supporters viewed as loose cannons even by even fellow Republicans. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is seen as the more mainstream candidate. Trump's lack of foreign policy experience could also shift more focus back to Congress, where Republicans who have sharply criticized the level of unilateral control President Obama's White House has exercised over national security -- and some of whom have denigrated Trump as uninformed on the issues -- are chafing for a bigger voice."" -- A spate of Islamic extremist groups praised Trump's victory on Wednesday, with Islamic State and al-Qaeda-linked sites praising his nomination as the beginning of ""dark times"" that could alienate Muslims and boost their recruitment efforts. ""Rejoice with support from Allah, and find glad tidings in the imminent demise of America at the hands of Trump,"" said the Islamic State-affiliated al-Minbar Jihadi Media network. A pro-a-Qaeda al-Maqalaat Twitter account predicted that Trump would ""make the U.S. Enemy No. 1 again"" in the Muslim Middle East. ""Trump will serve as the perfect straw man for the next four years, like Bush did before him,"" it said. (Ishaan Tharoor) -- Dejected Americans looking to migrate to Canada may be due for an unwelcome surprise: it's actually quite hard to move there. From Alan Freeman: ""[Vancouver-based Immigration lawyer] Jonathan Leebosh said that Canada is an open country that is looking for well-educated migrants, but he warns that Americans fleeing Trump will find that there are many others in line. 'They're competing against others who already have job offers,' Leebosh said. The Canadian government has announced its intention to accept 300,000 new permanent residents in 2017 but that number includes immigrants with family ties and refugees, as well as economic newcomers. And would-be migrants to the province of British Columbia, where house prices have soared to stratospheric levels in part because of an influx of Chinese buyers, will have to remember something. 'B.C. means Bring Cash,' Leebosh said."" -- Asian nations were a regular target of Trump's speeches, and now they're unsure of what to expect. From the AP's Tim Sullivan: ""His anger could be palpable. 'We can't continue to allow China to rape our country.' Trump said in a campaign rally, talking about Washington's trade deficit with Beijing. But he could also shift quickly, noting: 'I'm not angry with China ... China's great!' So across Asia, politicians and analysts are wondering what role the Trump White House will play across the continent. Hard-line trade negotiator? Counter-balance to Beijing? Leader? Isolationist?

Temperatures are relatively comfortable in the upper 50s to lower 60s. A northwest breeze is light enough to keep from being a nuisance."" -- President-elect Trump received just FOUR PERCENT of the vote in the District of Columbia, his lowest share anywhere by far. (Perry Stein) -- ""Other than that, Gov. McAuliffe, how was Election Day? Not bad, in fact,"" by Laura Vozzella: ""Terry McAuliffe had a surprisingly good night Tuesday if you set aside one crushing personal loss: His longtime friend and political ally, Hillary Clinton, is not going to the White House. For one thing, McAuliffe delivered Virginia for Clinton. The former secretary of state won the swing state by 4.8 points -- a margin smaller than Barack Obama's in 2008 (6.3 points) but bigger than his in 2012 (four points).  A ballot measure that McAuliffe opposed, which would have enshrined the state's right-to-work laws in the state constitution, was defeated. And McAuliffe protege Levar Stoney came out on top in the race for Richmond mayor. In all, those wins are perhaps small comfort to a man with deep personal and professional ties to a Democratic dynasty upended by Republican President-elect Donald Trump ..."" -- Meanwhile, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan took several political hits. From Ovetta Wiggins: ""Hogan (R) endorsed a handful of Republican congressional candidates, none of whom came close to winning their races in the heavily Democratic state. Maryland Democrats, still reeling from Hogan's 2014 win and soaring approval ratings, were thrilled that the governor's slate lost by large margins ... Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, said GOP candidates may have been hurt by appearing on the same ballot as Trump, who was broadly unpopular in the state. 'If you don't have a good top to your ticket, the down-ballot races are really affected,' Cluster said. 'We won't have that problem in 2018, with Larry Hogan at the top of the ticket.'"" -- ""Jose Andres on Trump's victory: Life will go on, and so will business,"" by Maura Judkis: ""When Jose Andres backed out of his restaurant concept for the Trump Hotel in July 2015 after the candidate's disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants, pundits and journalists weren't even taking the candidate seriously yet. Andres canceled his plans to open the Spanish-Japanese restaurant he had planned for the hotel, triggering a lawsuit and a countersuit -- and today, he finds himself in the position of being embroiled in litigation against the company founded by the president-elect of the United States. ""It's kind of a unique situation,"" Andres said. But he insists it will be business as usual at his ThinkFoodGroup. ""At the end, this is business for the Trump Organization and business for me, because we are a nation of laws ...That's why America is a great country: The laws work for everyone."" -- The Wizards beat the Celtics 118-93 VIDEOS OF THE DAY: Seth Meyers and Conan O'Brien offered their thoughts (serious and unserious) on Trump's election:   More late-night jokes about the election:    Post columnist Dana Milbank wrote a letter to his daughter to help her cope with Clinton's loss:    Here's how people around the world reacted:    Four ways Trump changes the Supreme Court:    Bloomberg Politics captured compelling reflections on Trump's win:  Finally, it's not a video.
