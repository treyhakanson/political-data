James Mattis, calling him ""the real deal."" Mattis is considered a contender to lead the Pentagon. He was one of a series of people who met with Trump Saturday at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump wouldn't say if he was offering Mattis a job, saying ""we'll see."" But he called Mattis a ""brilliant wonderful man"" and said ""what a career."" Trump also briefly bantered with reporters watching the comings and goings. ""Everything ok out there?"" he asked. ""Need some chocolate, need something? I'll send some stuff. I'm not allowed to do that but I will."" ___ 3:45 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump is meeting with education activists at his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Michelle Rhee, a former chancellor of Washington, D.C., schools, came to meet with Trump Saturday. She was accompanied by her husband Kevin Johnson, a former professional basketball player and the Democratic mayor of Sacramento. Rhee was considered a polarizing leader, who fought teachers unions in pushing for charter schools. Trump also met with Betsy DeVos. She's a Republican donor from Michigan and an advocate for school vouchers. The meetings come as Trump is starting to appoint top administration officials. ___ 2:39 p.m. Mitt Romney says he had a ""far-reaching conversation"" with President-elect Donald Trump. The 2012 GOP presidential nominee met privately with Trump for about an hour Saturday at Trump's private golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. Romney told reporters afterward that the two had a ""very thorough and in-depth discussion"" and said he appreciated ""the chance to speak with"" Trump. Romney did not respond to questions about whether he would consider joining the administration. Trump walked Romney out at the end of the meeting and said ""it went great."" The sit-down comes after an acrimonious election year. Romney was a harsh critic of Trump, calling him a ""con man."" Trump called Romney a ""choke artist"" because of his loss to President Barack Obama. Trump and Romney have been trying to mend fences since then. ___ 2:30 p.m. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach is lining up to meet with President-elect Donald Trump. Kobach spokeswoman Desiree Taliaferro told The Associated Press on Saturday that Kobach is on his way to New Jersey. She says she could not confirm details of the planned meeting. Kobach served as an adviser to the Trump campaign on immigration issues and has a background in designing laws cracking down people who are here illegally. ___ 1:10 p.m. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has arrived for a private meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf course. The 2012 nominee was greeted by Trump and his Vice President-elect Mike Pence on the front steps of the club house. ""How are you sir,"" said Romney, before shaking hands with both men. Romney was an outspoken critic of Trump during the election, calling him a ""con man"" and a ""fraud."" But the two have started to make amends since the election. Romney called Trump to congratulate him after his win. ___ 12:04 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have arrived at the clubhouse at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf course to start a day of meetings. Trump gave a thumbs-up to reporters assembled outside the building. He said he had ""a lot of meetings."" Pence added ""indeed."" Trump's agenda Saturday includes meeting with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. But since Trump's victory, the two have begun to mend fences. ___ 12:00 p.m. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is threatening political payback if congressional Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump try to undo President Barack Obama's major legislative achievements. Senate Democrats' leader-in-waiting told The Associated Press in an interview on Friday: ""They will rue the day"" they repeal Obama's health care law. Trump, after meeting with Obama, said he'd like to keep popular pieces of the six-year-old law, including the requirement to extend coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and the provision allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26. But Schumer said it was non-starter to start picking off favored pieces of the Affordable Care Act. ___ 9:23 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump says he agreed to settle lawsuits over Trump University ""for a small fraction of the potential award because as president I have to focus on our country."" Trump made the comment on Twitter Saturday. He also tweeted that ""the ONLY bad thing about winning the presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U."" It was announced Friday that Trump had agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve three lawsuits over Trump University, his former school for real estate investors. The lawsuits alleged the school misled students and failed to deliver on its promises in programs that cost up to $35,000. Trump has denied the allegations and has said repeatedly he would not settle. ___ 9:11 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump says the cast of the Broadway hit Hamilton should apologize to his Vice President-elect. Mike Pence attended the blockbuster show Friday night. After the curtain call, he got an earful from star Brandon Victor Dixon, who spoke from the stage, saying the multiracial and multicultural cast is ""alarmed and anxious"" about the new administration. On Twitter Saturday, Trump said Pence was ""harassed"" and ""this should not happen."" In another message, Trump said ""the Theater must always be a safe and special place"" and said the cast was ""very rude."" He added: ""Apologize!"" Dixon plays Aaron Burr, the nation's third vice president. He said in an interview on Broadway.com that he hopes the show left an impact, saying he hopes ""he thinks of us every time he has to deal with an issue or talk about a bill or present anything."" ___ 2:40 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump has picked Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signaling a sharp rightward shift in U.S. security policy as he begins to form his Cabinet. Trump on Friday also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism. The selections form the first outlines of Trump's Cabinet and national security teams. Given his lack of governing experience and vague policy proposals during the campaign, his selection of advisers is being scrutinized in the U.S. and abroad. Trump's initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam's role in stoking extremism. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)   If Jeff Sessions is confirmed as attorney general, it will mean likely sweeping changes for the Justice Department, especially on civil rights policies. It also could mean even more investigation of Hillary Clinton's email practices and her family's charitable foundation. Sessions, a Republican senator from Alabama who previously served as a U.S. attorney, has been an outspoken critic of the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server, saying on Fox Business Network last month he was ""uncomfortable with the way the investigation was conducted"" in part because witnesses were not compelled to testify before a grand jury. He also has said it ""seems like"" the FBI had not fully investigated the dealings of the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state and that, in his view, Clinton might have used her position to benefit the foundation. ""The fundamental thing is you cannot be secretary of state of the United States of America and use that position to extort or seek contributions to your private foundation,""  Sessions said on CNN. ""That is a fundamental violation of law and that does appear to have happened.""   [Jeff Sessions is expected to bring sweeping changes to the Justice Department]   Those statements are important because, as attorney general, Sessions would have the power to reignite the email investigation, which FBI Director James B. Comey has recommended be closed without charges. He also could breathe new life into a separate investigation of the Clinton Foundation -- which agents in the FBI's New York Field Office have wanted to probe, despite the misgivings of career-public-integrity prosecutors about a lack of real evidence. Pursuing such cases, of course, would be called a form a political retribution by critics. When Donald Trump said during a debate that he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into the Clinton email case and Clinton would ""be in jail"" if he were president, even former attorney general Michael Mukasey -- long a critic of Clinton and her private email server -- said he would advise against such actions.   [One of Clinton's biggest critics in email case says he'd tell Trump not to jail her]   ""It would be like a banana republic,"" Mukasey said at the time. He added later: ""Putting political opponents in jail for offenses committed in a political setting, even if they are criminal offenses -- and they very well may be -- is something that we don't do here."" But as president-elect, Trump has not backed down from the idea. Asked on ""60 Minutes"" if he would appoint a special prosecutor, he said, ""I'm going to think about it"" and later, ""She did some bad things."" He ultimately did not answer the question. ""I don't want to hurt them. I don't want to hurt them. They're, they're good people. I don't want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do '60 Minutes' together,"" Trump said. Representatives for Trump, Sessions and the Clinton Foundation did not immediately return messages seeking comment. A Clinton campaign spokesman said they were not commenting on any cabinet appointees. Comey has said ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring a case against Clinton for her email practices, which allowed classified material to traverse a private server. Sessions seems to take a different view and has criticized the FBI's tactics in coming to that conclusion. On ""The Howie Carr Show"" last month, he said he ""tried not to be critical of Comey at first, but more that comes out, the more I'm concerned about it."" He questioned in particular why top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills was allowed to sit in on Clinton's FBI interview and said congressional hearings would be necessary to assess what happened. (Comey has said Mills was Clinton's lawyer, and the FBI has no ability to control who she brings to a voluntary interview). ""I am troubled about it,"" Sessions said. ""A case of this high-profile should have been handled as clean as possible, with the least possible ability for anybody to question what was done, and they left a lot of things out there that caused real questions in my mind, and it's troubling."" Comey himself is in the middle of a 10-year term, though it is technically possible -- if politically difficult -- for Trump to fire him. Trump declined to comment on that question during his ""60 Minutes"" interview. Even if Sessions were to accept Comey's recommendation on the email investigation, that would not preclude pursuing a separate investigation of the Clinton Foundation. Agents in the FBI's New York Field Office pitched such a probe to career-public-integrity prosecutors earlier this year. Those prosecutors, and at least some in FBI leadership, though, believed they did not have enough evidence to proceed. That left some agents frustrated, though it did not end the matter entirely. In August, Justice Department officials learned New York agents were still taking steps to advance their case and advised them to hold off -- in accordance with department policies -- until after the election. Sessions, it would seem, would be far more sympathetic to the New York agents' side of things; he said on CNN outright that an investigation was warranted. ""The evidence indicates to me that this should be fully investigated. I cannot say that Mr. Comey has not completed a full investigation but it seems like he has not,"" Sessions said. ""And I think there is a cloud over this, and just because he might conclude there is not a chargeable offense does not indicate that there is no wrongdoing.""

After she hosted a meeting of outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama and the leaders of Spain, Italy, France and Britain, Merkel was asked by reporters how she sees her short- and long-term responsibilities.  ""I want to perform my task as German chancellor, which on the one hand is to serve the people of Germany, but it also includes working for the cohesion and success of Europe,"" she replied. Merkel, 62, is scheduled to hold a news conference late Sunday after meeting with senior members of her Christian Democratic Union party. So far, she has refused to say if she plans to run again But with Europe facing an unresolved conflict in Ukraine, tough talks over Britain's exit from the European Union and a politically sensitive influx of migrants, whether Merkel will remain as leader of Europe's biggest economy has generated interest. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who recently won his country's Parliament's backing to head a minority government after 10 months of political deadlock, said Germany's stability was important for Europe as a whole.  ""It's fundamental for Europe that things go well in Germany, as fortunately they are at this moment,"" he said. Rajoy noted the headway that populist political groups on both the left and the right have made in Europe lately. In Germany, Merkel faces fierce opposition over her decision to take in hundreds of thousands of refugees last year.  ""I'm confident, although next year will be a difficult one from an election point of view in Europe, that things will begin returning to normal,"" Rajoy said. After the meeting in Berlin, Merkel appeared keen to downplay recent descriptions of her as the last great defender of Western values following Donald Trump's election.  ""One person alone can never solve everything,"" she said. ""We are only strong together."" ____ Ciaran Giles in Madrid contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Pitt spokesman Joseph Miksch says the two were arrested Thursday evening after campus police asked them not to enter the lobby of Litchfield Towers. Police say a 23-year-old student pushed an officer's patrol bicycle into the crowd, then pushed her in the chest several times while yelling obscenities. Authorities say the other was a 20-year-old nonstudent who grabbed an officer's protective vest and wouldn't let go. Some protesters blamed the violence on the police, but police say the protesters made anti-police chants and were the aggressors. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Alito told the Federalist Society conference of conservative lawyers, judges and legal thinkers that religious freedom and gun rights are among ""constitutional fault lines,"" important issues at stake in the federal courts. The conference of 1,800 of conservatism's leading lights took on a new air of importance with Trump's victory, and included a list of judges the president-elect has named as candidates to fill the vacancy created by the death last February of Justice Antonin Scalia. In his remarks, Alito didn't mention the election or the vacancy, rather using the platform to pay tribute to Scalia, a longtime colleague and conservative ally in high court battles on hot-button social and political issues. He said Scalia, a hero to many of the group's 40,000 members, is sorely missed on the court. ""We are left to ask ourselves WWSD,"" what would Scalia do, Alito said. The lettering is a play on the phrase ""WWJD,"" for what would Jesus do. In the halls of the conference there was little formal talk of the election or the fight to seat a new justice. But attendees packed a lunchtime panel moderated by Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, one of 21 people on Trump's list, and the Supreme Court vacancy was the talk of hallway chatter among lawyers who ranged from Trump backers to those who proclaimed they would never vote for him. Larsen served as a Supreme Court law clerk to Scalia and said he valued his clerks' frank assessment of his work. ""It was a formidable task to stand up to Justice Scalia and say, 'You have gone too far.' But he valued that,"" Larsen said. Later, she declined to discuss her status on Trump's list, saying she intends to complete her state court term, which runs through 2021. ""That's really where my focus lies,"" she said in a brief conversation with The Associated Press. Other sessions were moderated by Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras and federal appellate judges William Pryor and Thomas Hardiman, all on Trump's list. Before the conference ends Saturday, nine judges on the list are expected to appear. The court has been operating with eight justices since Scalia's death because Senate Republicans blocked action on President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas also was on the schedule at the conference, which has turned into an impromptu job fair for spots in the new administration.  ""The mood has changed. Everyone is going to be thinking, 'Maybe someone here is going to be filling Justice Scalia's shoes,'"" said Abbe Gluck, a Yale Law professor who is not a member of the group but will participate in the conference. The Federalist Society got its start on college campuses when Ronald Reagan was in the White House. It was conceived as a way to counter what its members saw as liberal domination of the nation's law-school faculties. Its influence was pronounced during the presidency of George W. Bush, when its leaders helped rally support for Senate confirmation of Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts. The group was so successful that it spawned copycat liberal organizations. Speaking at a Federalist Society event in the Bush years was akin to an out-of-town preview of a Broadway show for conservative lawyers looking for administration jobs or judgeships, author Mark Tushnet has written. Over the past eight years, the group provided a forum for opponents of Obama's court choices and policies, although the Federalist Society itself does not endorse candidates or take policy positions. Some of its leaders backed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's refusal to act on Garland's nomination. That political strategy paid unexpected and huge dividends for conservatives with Trump's election. Now the society's star again appears to be on the rise.  ""Anytime there's a major shift in the power of government, it's an enormous opportunity for what is probably the collection of the smartest, most talented and most publicly minded lawyers in the country to roll up their sleeves and help advance the cause of constitutional government,"" said Leonard Leo, the group's executive vice president. Leo met with Trump in New York on Wednesday and said afterward that Trump has yet to pare down his long list of names of Supreme Court hopefuls. Nan Aron, the president of Alliance for Justice, said the Federalist Society ""promotes a way of looking at the law which upholds the rights of the powerful and the wealthy."" Aron said it is ""regrettable that so many nominees on Trump's list are going to attend Federalist Society events."" Yet a conservative legal scholar who has been critical of Trump said the group's involvement in identifying candidates for judgeships and other jobs in the new administration is not something to fear.  ""In fact, if the Federalist Society does play a role in identifying the president-elect's nominees, that could be comforting to some who have reservations about Donald Trump's administration, because such a role would suggest, at least in this area, continuity with longstanding, mainstream Republican practice,"" University of Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett said in an email. ___ Associated Press writer Sam Hananel contributed to this report.

Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan said Thursday he will challenge the California lawmaker, who has led the party since 2002 and was the first female speaker from 2007-11, in leadership elections later this month. Democrats have been reeling since last week when the party won fewer seats than she had predicted and lost the presidency.  ""What we are doing right now is not working,"" the 43-year-old Ryan said in a letter to colleagues. ""Under our current leadership, Democrats have been reduced to our smallest congressional minority since 1929. This should indicate to all of us that keeping our leadership team completely unchanged will simply lead to more disappointment in future elections."" Ryan is from a Rust Belt state that President Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012, but President-elect Donald Trump won Ohio easily this year. Along with younger members in the caucus, Democrats from several Midwestern states have expressed concern that the party has become too focused on the two coasts and forgotten the working-class voters in the middle. Pelosi is from San Francisco. Well-known for her ability to count votes, Pelosi is still the favorite to win another term as leader. She said in announcing her candidacy on Wednesday that she has the backing of two-thirds of the caucus, though Ryan questioned that number. The election is Nov. 30. It had been scheduled for Thursday but was postponed until after Thanksgiving. Pelosi, 76, is a survivor who enjoys enormous respect and goodwill among most Democrats, even as many of her closest allies have left Congress. She has managed to maintain unity within the diverse flock of House Democrats and is an unparalleled fundraiser for them, collecting more than $100 million in the past cycle alone. Ryan's bid marks the second time Pelosi has faced a challenge after a dismal Democratic performance in an election. She easily beat back North Carolina Rep. Heath Shuler 150-43 after the party lost the majority in 2010. But some Democratic lawmakers expressed their frustration in a closed-door caucus meeting earlier Thursday. Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., said she told her colleagues that ""if we don't, as a party, have our leaders accept responsibility for where we are, we can't move forward and get to the point where our message is going to resonate with voters."" Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said he had issued a challenge in the caucus ""that anybody who is running for any position of leadership needs to come back and explain to us how we're going to be able to survive one, the Trump years, but two, to not have the same excuse we have every two years where there's some external factor that somehow causes us to not gain the seats that we need."" Among the frustrations for junior Democrats is that several top Democrats on powerful committees have been atop their posts for many years -- well into their 80s in some cases -- and are not some of the party's most fresh and vibrant voices. For instance, the top Democrat on the panel responsible for taxes and the Affordable Care Act is 85-year-old Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, while the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee is John Conyers, 87, who's been in Congress for more than 50 years.  ""We've got a couple of big issues coming up, not the least of which is defending the very strong parts of the Affordable Care Act,"" said Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., a rival of Levin's on the powerful panel. Some Democrats are pressing for term limits for committee chairmen. Pelosi didn't dismiss the idea.  ""If you want that, you have to fight for it,"" Pelosi said. Pelosi was crucial in ensuring Obama's health care overhaul became law in 2010. Even in the minority under Obama, Pelosi has been a savvy negotiator with GOP leaders when Democratic votes were needed to advance legislation.  ""When somebody challenges you, your supporters turn out, both internally in the caucus and in the country,"" Pelosi, who has led Democrats since 2002, told reporters at her weekly news conference. Indeed, her allies spoke strongly in her favor.  ""She has been an extraordinary leader,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. ""If it weren't for her, a lot of things that are near and dear to our hearts would have been eviscerated. She's a good negotiator even in the minority."" On the budget front, House Republican leaders said Trump wants a short-term spending bill to keep the government running through March of next year. The current stopgap spending bill runs out in less than a month, on Dec. 9. House and Senate negotiators are working on a bill they could pass before leaving for the holidays.

Chris Christie who were convicted of fraud and misusing the bridge in what prosecutors say was a political revenge plot. Former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey executive Bill Baroni was convicted of misusing the bridge to purposely cause traffic jams. Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, also was convicted. A second former Port Authority employee, David Wildstein, pleaded guilty and testified the gridlock was created to punish a Democratic mayor who didn't endorse the Republican governor's re-election bid. The agency has been reviewing testimony and has asked its own lawyers as well as outside counsel to compare the allegations with internal bylaws and policies over the next 90 days, Port Authority Chairman John Degnan said. Degnan didn't specify what actions would be taken if it was concluded violations had occurred. Beyond the criminal charges that formed the basis for the trial, other testimony reflected unflatteringly on the Port Authority, a powerful bistate agency that operates New York-area bridges, tunnels, ports, airports and the World Trade Center. The George Washington Bridge, among the world's busiest, links Fort Lee, New Jersey, and New York City. Wildstein testified that he and other Christie subordinates used the agency as a source of political favors doled out to Democratic mayors whose endorsements were sought. Current Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye testified that he approved the publication of a news release about the traffic jams that he knew to be false. Wildstein also testified that at least two other Port Authority officials, neither of whom was charged, knew the reason for the traffic jams ahead of time. Christie has denied wrongdoing and wasn't charged, but testimony by Kelly, Baroni and Wildstein all cast doubt on the governor's account of when -- and how much -- he knew about the scheme. Degnan also said Thursday he will seek to change rules that allow agency employees to not cooperate with internal investigations. The specific rule, known as Rule 3, allows employees to refuse to answer questions from the agency's Office of Inspector General without disciplinary penalties.  ""It frustrates the OIG to no end,"" Degnan said. ""There's no reason to perpetuate that rule."" Degnan and Foye both said Thursday that the rule likely didn't hamper the Port Authority's initial probe into the lane closures in late 2013 because that investigation became absorbed by the federal investigation.

Giuliani angered former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when he went to Belgrade in 2012 to advise a Serbian political party once allied with a nationalist faction. At the time, Clinton described Giuliani's Serbian role ""outrageous"" in an email to an aide. Giuliani's work for foreign and corporate clients shows he could face the same ethics criticisms he raised about Clinton's ties to foreign government and corporate donors through the Clinton Foundation. Giuliani has defended his work abroad and said he never lobbied for any interests, foreign or otherwise. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The U.S. government seems to have taken this message to heart, spending significant resources on public relations efforts. Federal agencies have spent about $1 billion a year over the past decade on advertising and public relations, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report. Even this figure likely understates the actual costs, the GAO notes, due to imprecise budget classifications and the difficulty in defining ""public relations"" activities and personnel. The Defense Department is responsible for the largest share of public relations activity by far, accounting for 40 percent of all federal public relations personnel and 60 percent of all PR spending. The Department of Veterans Affairs experienced the largest rate of increase in public relations spending during the period, doubling its PR staff from 144 in 2006 to 286 in 2014 (which was, probably not coincidentally, the year the VA hospital negligence and wait time scandal broke). The government's public relations services include perfectly legitimate functions, such as providing notice of impending regulations and public comment periods or informing the public about health and safety threats. But when the Health and Human Services Department launches an expensive pro-Obamacare advertising campaign, or the Pentagon tries to spin and influence media coverage of military actions, the question we must continually ask is: When does public information cross the line to propaganda? A report last year from Arizona Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake criticized what they called ""paid patriotism,"" the practice of the military paying pro and college sports teams to perform on-field flag ceremonies, surprise homecomings, wounded warrior tributes, ceremonial first pitches and the like. ""Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DoD marketing gimmicks,"" they stated. And a 2008 New York Times investigation revealed that the retired military officers who serve as ""military analysts"" on many news programs oftentimes parroted administration talking points in exchange for special briefings and access to administration officials, which many of them used to advance their own business interests by pursuing government defense contracts. As Reason Magazine's Eric Boehm argued in a pointed criticism, ""To be fair, the Department of Defense's PR team has a tough job. They have to sell the American public on the value of foreign military interventions (something most Americans generally oppose) and have to spin the bombings of hospitals and the droning of innocent civilians at wedding parties as being in the best interest of America's defense -- or at least as something other than war crimes."" It is bad enough that the government spends our own money in ways with which many taxpayers would disagree, but it is a double slap in the face when it uses those hard-earned dollars to pat itself on the back for these infringements or tries to manipulate our opinions and behavior. Online:  http://www.ocregister.com  ___ Nov. 14 The Miami Herald on President-elect Trump and Cuba: Donald Trump's victory has sent shock waves through the United States -- and also to our nearest ""frenemy"" 90 miles away. The president-elect clearly said during his campaign that he would reverse the thaw in relations between Washington and Havana unless Raul Castro's government granted more political freedoms to the population. On this subject, the Cuban regime continues to be deficient: Granting the freedoms to which Mr. Trump referred is tantamount to going against the very essence of the system. The Editorial Board, though supportive of normalization, has been disappointed with the pace of change in Cuba. In truth, the regime has conceded very little. In the final days of his campaign, Mr. Trump was endorsed by the veterans of the Bay of Pigs invasion -- a group of CIA-trained Cuban exiles who unsuccessfully tried to topple the Fidel Castro regime in 1961. Rightly, the island government fears that when Mr. Trump moves into the White House, he will put President Obama's thaw back on ice. After all, Cuba has seen an increase in the flow of capital it needs to keep its failing economy afloat. And on the streets, Cubans who dream of coming to the United States see their goal at risk. They fear that Mr. Trump, who has often spoken of reducing the influx of immigrants to the nation, will eliminate migratory privileges, such as visas programs, that allow Cubans to resettle in the United States. It is possible that before Jan. 20, when the real-estate magnate takes office, there will be increased attempts to cross the Florida Straits, or there will be a jump in the number of Cubans making their way to the United States through other countries. No doubt, such a renewed exodus will have an impact on South Florida. The restlessness on the island coincides with an announcement last week of military exercises in Cuba. Cuban authorities say the exercises will be held from Nov. 16 thru 18. The objective is to ""raise the country's willingness to defend and prepare the troops and the population to deal with the enemy's different actions,"" according to a statement in the official newspaper Granma. But who is the enemy the Cuban government refers to in the announcement? Is it the United States, the so-called ""Yankee imperialist,"" the term the Castro regime used for the United States before President Obama set each nation on a road to cordiality? Keeping the population fearful and alert for a possible foreign invasion from the United States has long been a Castro tactic. Just like previous Republican and Democratic administrations in the last half a century, Mr. Trump likely has no interest in launching a military operation against the old enemy. So ordering military exercises to confront the hypothetical ""enemy actions,"" is a sign of the paranoia that has characterized the Cuban regime. It is possible that the real intention of the Castro government with these exercises is, as on previous occasions, to distract the people from the real threats facing the Cuban people, those from within: lack of freedoms, economic crisis, despair at the system failure. The war maneuvers will be nothing more than a useless display of a military power that has dissipated since the Soviet Union pulled out of the island. Neither Mr. Trump nor anyone in the U.S. government entertains the crazy idea of invading Cuba. The real enemy of the Cubans is not in Washington, but on the island itself. Online:  http://www.miamiherald.com  ___ Nov. 14 The Telegraph on the European Union and Trump's election: After describing the reaction of his EU colleagues to Donald Trump's election as a ""whinge-o-rama"", it is hardly surprising that Boris Johnson decided to avoid an informal meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the implications of the result. The response of some European leaders to the American president-elect has exemplified everything that is wrong with the institution: out of touch and riddled with anti-democratic instincts. This is particularly true of commission officials like Jean-Claude Juncker, whose comments have been totally inappropriate for an unelected office holder. It is his job to ensure the EU can forge a good relationship with the new administration in Washington, not question the choice of voters. Americans have made their decision and it is now for other countries to come to terms with it. Of course, based on what he said during the campaign, there may be significant ramifications from Mr Trump's foreign policy and military strategy. But until we see how they translate into action, it is pointless to try to second guess what he might do. Far better, surely, to engage with the new president and try to persuade him to keep the US fully committed to Nato and wedded to free trade than to continue exhibiting the contempt the EU elites evidently feel for him and those who supported him. This same attitude yesterday greeted the BBC's decision to interview Marine Le Pen, leader of the French Front National. She is a significant political force in one of Europe's biggest countries and yet Andrew Marr was required to defend inviting her on to his programme. Conceivably, she may be France's next president. All those who say she can't or won't win should consider how every other complacent assumption has been shattered. In her interview, Ms Le Pen said Donald Trump's victory had boosted her own chances and ""made possible what had previously been presented as impossible"". In truth, Mr Trump's unexpected win (and the Brexit vote here on June 23 for that matter) were both made possible by the refusal of the established political order to listen to the complaints of voters whose opinions were previously ignored. Ms Le Pen is tapping into the same well of discontent; and if the EU establishment thought Brexit was a blow to their project, a win for the Front National next year would be their worst nightmare come true. Online:  https://www.telegraph.co.uk  ___ Nov. 16 The Los Angeles Times on Trump's personnel picks: President Obama has spent much of the last week acting as Chiller in Chief, trying to reassure the many people around the world made anxious and fearful by the election of Donald Trump. Continuing in that vein Monday, Obama said he thought his successor was ""pragmatic,"" not ideological, ""and that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction."" Pragmatism would be a welcome change from the extreme views and unfulfillable promises Trump aired during the campaign. His first staffing moves, however, don't breed confidence that he'll surround himself with ""good people"" with relevant experience and solid judgment who advance the interests of all Americans. One of the very first Trump appointments was Stephen K. Bannon, a venture capitalist turned media provocateur who will serve as Trump's chief strategist. As the boss of Breitbart.com, Bannon positioned himself as the leader of the ""alt-right,"" a loosely organized coalition of anti-establishment forces that ranged from die-hard conservatives to white supremacists. And though his defenders insist that Bannon is neither racist nor anti-Semitic, he turned Breitbart into the go-to media outlet for people who are -- while peddling half-truths, hyperbole and disinformation on behalf of Breitbart's pet causes. Let's hope that Trump means to give this divisive figure an impressive title but no substantive role in the new administration. Trump's transition team has gotten off to a rough start, with former head Chris Christie being bounced on Friday and a top national-security advisor leaving Tuesday. Meanwhile, many of the leading candidates for Cabinet positions appear to be people like Bannon -- loyalists from the Trump campaign who aren't necessarily suited for the jobs they may receive. For example, two of the leading names for secretary of State -- former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton -- are notoriously abrasive and polarizing figures who are ill-suited to be America's chief diplomat. And a top candidate to head the Department of Homeland Security is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a border-enforcement zealot with little apparent interest in workable immigration policy. When Obama urged Trump to surround himself with ""good people,"" he didn't mean good friends or allies -- he meant people with the experience, expertise and temperament to make up for Trump's shortcomings in those areas. In filling out his team, the president-elect needs to stop thinking about the campaign behind him and start focusing on the message that his choices send about the country's future. Online:  http://www.latimes.com/  ___ Nov. 15 The Chicago Tribune on ""Big Data:"" Cubs win the World Series. Donald Trump wins the White House. What do those two epochal events have in common? Both were considered highly unlikely. And both happened. Many fans didn't expect the Cubs to come back from a 3-games-to-1 deficit against the Cleveland Indians. But they knew from data that it was statistically possible: Five teams in history had done just that. Most Americans probably didn't expect Donald Trump to overcome a polling deficit against Hillary Clinton to win the presidency. And those polls were all but unanimous: The odds against Trump, as those against the Cubs, looked daunting. But daunting and impossible aren't synonyms. In the aftermath of the alleged Epic Big Data fail on Election Day, many Americans will judge predictions, projections and premonitions with more skepticism. They've learned an important, even comforting, lesson about the limits of polling and other measures: Big Data is not destiny. Algorithms are formulas written by humans to take the guesswork out of what other human beings will do under certain circumstances. Will they buy this toothpaste? At what price? Survey responses to pollsters, consumer buying habits, internet site visits, etc. can be plugged into computer models to suggest people's future behavior. The understandable hope is always that if you start with knowable measurements and crunch them through well-constructed formulas, you'll produce a reliable preview of what will happen. Not necessarily. Computers don't read minds. Nor do pollsters. People don't always say what they think. Or they change their minds. People can be convinced and unconvinced. Some people say one thing but do another. You will never write a program to take into account all those nuances and many others. To a computer, predicting behavior is an efficient but wisdom-deprived matter of manipulating ones and zeros. But the real world isn't always binary.  ""... People mistake having a large volume of polling data for eliminating uncertainty,"" writes Nate Silver of the website FiveThirtyEight.com, one of many prognosticators who whiffed the election call. ""It doesn't work that way. Yes, having more polls helps to a degree, by reducing sampling error and by providing for a mix of reasonable methodologies. Therefore, it's better to be ahead in two polls than ahead in one poll, and in 10 polls than in two polls. Before long, however, you start to encounter diminishing returns. Polls tend to replicate one another's mistakes ..."" Big Data can lead to Big Mistakes. Google Flu Trends, for instance, sought to use data from internet searches to estimate when influenza season would peak and at what level. But it drastically overestimated peak flu levels in the 2012-13 season. That failure ""doesn't erase the value of big data,"" wrote David Lazer of Northeastern University and Ryan Kennedy of the University of Houston in Wired magazine. ""What it does do is highlight a number of problematic practices in its use -- what we like to call 'big data hubris.'"" We'd say that many alleged political pros suffered a serious case of that affliction before voters set them straight Nov. 8. Should we toss out data and rely only on experience, or on anecdotes, or on what we hear (true or false) from people with whom we agree? That would be a dangerous overreaction to the election flub. If people believe the data cannot be trusted, they may turn instead to ""trusting anecdotes from friends, family and tribe,"" political blogger Erick Erickson writes in The New York Times. ""Policies will be based on what people think are good ideas, not what data show. This will potentially further divide the country and further segment an already divided nation,"" he warns, aptly. Humans embrace Big Data -- more than they would if it were more accurately billed as Big Guesses or Big Evidence-based Hunches -- because we live in an unpredictable universe that is often capricious. People feel comforted when they think they know what is going to happen. They see patterns in random chance. They purge from their thoughts the reality that a 74 percent chance of victory is a 26 percent chance of defeat. Superstition endures. Reality is elastic. Every moment brings new possibilities. That's what makes life intriguing. Many predictions proved wrong on Election Day. As did many predictions when the Cubs were down 3-games-to-1. That's why we vote. That's why we play the games. Online:  http://www.chicagotribune.com/  ___ Nov. 15 The Des Moines Register on the Dakota Access Pipeline protest: Eleven months ago, a group of armed militants piled into a couple of pickup trucks and headed for Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. Once there, they took control of the headquarters building, stationed armed guards around the perimeter and began issuing ominous threats of violence unless the federal government relinquished control over 1.4 million acres of national forest. Just for good measure, they named their merry band of flag-waving commandos the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, underscoring their bizarre belief that as individuals we all have a constitutional right to simply take, at gunpoint, land and property that belongs to all of us collectively. The government responded the same way parents react to a child's tantrum: quiet patience. Authorities adopted a strategy of waiting out the offenders, at one point attempting to gently nudge them back into the real world by offering them a police escort out of the county if they'd just quit misbehaving. But, as so often happens when the right to bear arms collides with one's right to be stupid, the freedom fighters' campaign ended in bloodshed. In a confrontation with police, one of the men was shot and killed as he reached into a pocket containing a loaded gun. After that, most of the rebels gave up, went home or were carted off to jail. Eleven pleaded guilty to an assortment of criminal charges, but a jury last month acquitted seven of them on conspiracy and weapons charges. Now, contrast the manner in which law enforcement responded to the armed takeover of federal land in Oregon with the way it has responded to Native Americans and others protesting the Dakota Access pipeline. As currently planned, this pipeline will transport crude oil more than 1,100 miles from North Dakota to southern Illinois, and in the process it will cross a major waterway near the Standing Rock Sioux Indian reservation. In September, shortly after construction workers bulldozed North Dakota land that tribal leaders consider sacred, protesters flooded into the area. As local police watched, a private security company used pepper spray and attack dogs on unarmed demonstrators. Local police later claimed the protesters were violent, swinging fence posts and brandishing knives, but the available video suggests otherwise. That video, which was broadcast repeatedly on national television networks, prompted the police to issue an arrest warrant for the journalist who shot it. Amy Goodman of Democracy Now was charged with rioting -- a charge that, thankfully, was later tossed out by a judge. McLean County State's Attorney Ladd Erickson admitted that Goodman's arrest was based in part on the content of her reporting. ""She's a protester, basically,"" he said. ""Everything she reported on was from the position of justifying the protest actions."" Then, late last month, National Guard troops and police from a half-dozen states cleared out a protest camp that was blocking roads and highways. Using armored personnel carriers, they advanced on the protesters until a tribal elder physically placed himself between the demonstrators and the authorities, then turned to his people and said: ""Go home. We're here to fight the pipeline, not these people, and we can only win this with prayer."" There's no question that many of the Dakota Access protesters are engaged in civil disobedience, so fines and citations are entirely justified. But the private security firms, the police and the prosecutors have gone far beyond that. Their actions are so heavy handed they seem designed to inflame the situation and to encourage violence. Several Native Americans have reportedly been jailed and strip-searched for minor offenses such as disorderly conduct. When one compares that sort of overreaction to the government's low-key response to the good ol' boys who brandished guns while seizing a wildlife refuge, one has to wonder how much a role race plays in all of this. After all, the federal government has a long and thoroughly documented history of disrespecting the rights of Native Americans -- right up to, and including, genocide. The police and the National Guard have a duty to keep the peace in North Dakota, but they're also obligated to use the minimum force necessary -- not just to protect the rights of protesters, but also to avoid a needless escalation in hostilities. As Amnesty International has already observed, ""confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response.""

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/11/16/evangelicals-owe-their-fellow-americans-something-better/	Evangelical Christians owe their fellow Americans something better	"   Jerry Falwell Jr. shakes hands with Donald Trump during a campaign event in Sioux City, Iowa, on Jan. 31. (Dave Kaup/Reuters)    According to exit polling, about 80 percent of evangelical Christians voted for President-elect Donald Trump, a man who personifies none of the values evangelical Christian leaders say they embrace.  That 80 percent figure can be misleading, however. ""To clarify, 80% of white people who voted and call themselves 'evangelical' or 'born again' voted for Trump,"" explains evangelical activist Eric Teetsel, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump. ""This is a sociological category more than a theological one. Consider that just 56% of voters who said they attend religious services 'weekly or more' voted for Trump.'"" Nevertheless, in an email Teetsel observes that a lot of sincere Christians backed Trump. ""Now that the election is over, all Christians must remember that we are not to be known by our voting patterns,"" he cautions. ""Rather, our reputation is to be one of selfless love for others. This means standing with Jesus on the side of the poor, sick, and marginalized and for public policies that recognize the dignity of every human being."" Conservative scholar and former adviser to President George W. Bush Peter Wehner argues that evangelical Christian voters now have a special burden. ""Trump voters -- the fully committed and the partially committed -- made his presidency possible, so they have part ownership in it. We'll see the level of competence and honor and toxicity that will characterize the next four years."" He adds, ""Appointing Steve Bannon to be chief strategist and senior counselor in the Trump White House is quite a worrisome development. Bannon, after all, has described himself as a 'Leninist' who wants to 'bring everything crashing down' and gave a platform to the malicious 'alt-right' movement while he was executive chairman of Breitbart News.""      Here's what you need to know about the man who went from Breitbart News chairman to Donald Trump's campaign CEO before his appointment as chief White House strategist and senior counselor. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)    For evangelicals, in particular, Wehner urges that ""those who supported Trump will have the integrity, if and when it is necessary, to speak out against him, just as those of us who vehemently opposed Trump need to be willing to praise him if he does things that warrant it."" In an email, he emphasizes, ""The point here is that our allegiances have to be to things beyond party and tribe and ideology; there needs to be an allegiance to truth, as best as we mere mortals can discern it - and in the case of Evangelical Christians, an allegiance to a Lord who asks of us to act justly and to love mercy. He adds, ""One of the things that really concerns me as a Christian is how in the political arena our faith has become weaponized, how our political loyalties disfigure our faith commitments rather than our faith commitments shaping our politics. I'm as susceptible to that as anyone else; it's a temptation we all must all strive to resist."" Going forward, evangelical Christians will find a changed landscape, one in which their influence may be vastly reduced. ""The idea that Trump's most vocal supporters will in the future weigh in on the importance of character in public leaders is risible,"" Wehner says. ""That argument is now gone, at least for a time. Many Evangelical Christians marched under the banner -- some even helped raise the banner -- for a man whose personality is characterized by vindictiveness, cruelty and coarseness."" He explains, ""They rallied behind a man who in my estimation embodies a Nietzschean ethic rather than a Christian one, and there's a price that will be paid for that. Trump supporters would say it was worth it in order to prevent a Clinton presidency."" Where that leaves evangelical Christians, both Trump supporters and opponents, is uncertain. Teetsel says withdrawal from public life is not an option. ""The responsibility to love our neighbor and seek the welfare of our communities remains, no matter who is president."" That said, how they engage may change. They would be wise to start out by reflecting on their non-Christian and nonwhite brothers and sisters. Wehner says, ""Trump supporters need to think about how they would view things if they were Muslim or Mexican and felt unfairly targeted -- or an African American, knowing that the thing that really catapulted Trump into politics was peddling a racist conspiracy about Barack Obama not being born in America."" He muses, ""In many ways empathy and sympathy - what Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments referred to as 'fellow feeling' -- are lost, or at least de-valued, virtues."" Ultimately, however, Wehner, like Teetsel, comes down on the side of engagement, explaining that ""politics, for all its mundane aspects and downsides, is still a means through which we pursue justice, protect human dignity and advance human flourishing, and those things are never unimportant."" Evangelical Christians who justified their decision to back Trump based on Supreme Court picks, will be humiliated if Trump trades a conservative judge for something else he wants -- a distinct possibility for a man who shows no convictions beyond self-promotion. Perhaps evangelical conservatives need to not only reflect on their faith but on their political acumen as well. ""In the last few decades - and especially in the last year -- Christians have often done politics poorly,"" Wehner observes. ""So do most other groups in democracy. The answer is to do politics better. I think we can, and I hope we do. Because this nation is in a difficult place just now, in need of healing and reform and restoration."" People of different faiths or of no faith at all certainly can agree with that."
