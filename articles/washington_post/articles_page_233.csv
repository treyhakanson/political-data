But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines.   Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016     I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016   Ford has never announced plans to move to Mexico either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC and the Ford Escape. In a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model -- the MKC -- from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky, because Escape production would replace lost MKC production. ""Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States."" In a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. This week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. Trump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. In an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky. Ford announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs. Bill Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico.      While on the campaign trail in February 2016, President-elect Donald Trump joked that the Carrier and Ford companies could use illegal immigrants from Mexico to deliver their products to the U.S. (Reuters)   ""I've had a very good meeting with him,"" Ford told the Economic Club of Washington. ""He's a very good listener and he knows the facts."" This isn't the first time Trump has misstated facts about a Ford move. In October 2015, he tweeted that the company had halted plans to build a factory in Mexico and would locate in Ohio instead, and he claimed credit for the decision. The company said he was wrong, and that it was continuing to build its plant in Mexico. Trump appeared to be relying on information gleaned from an article posted on a website of a shop that sells business cards and door hangers.      President-elect Donald Trump told reporters on Nov. 10 that his administration's priorities will include immigration, health care and ""big league jobs.""

In a yearly ritual that has become one of the largest far-right gatherings in Europe, they marched under the slogan ""Poland the Bastion of Europe."" The nationalists are strongly opposed to accepting refugees from the Middle East. Some of them carried banners depicting a falanga, which is a far-right symbol dating to the 1930s of a stylized hand with a sword. The Interior Ministry estimated that 75,000 people joined the march, while Warsaw town hall estimated the number at 60,000. It proceeded peacefully, in contrast to violence of several marches in the past. One huge banner read ""God, Honor, Fatherland,"" a patriotic slogan. Others read: ""Death to the enemies of the fatherland"" and ""To be a Pole, to be a Catholic is a privilege and honor."" Some participants burned a Ukrainian flag at the march, which comes amid increased strains between Poland and Ukraine because of renewed discussions of a wartime massacre of Poles by Ukrainians. The main organizers were the National Radical Camp and the All-Polish Youth, groups which take their names from radical nationalistic groups of the 1930s that pushed a virulently anti-Semitic ideology.  ""This movement promotes the exclusion of all minorities and of everyone who isn't Polish enough,"" said Rafal Pankowski, the head of Never Again, an organization that monitors and fights racism and extremism. ""This year and last year, the anti-Muslim message has been emphasized and it is an extreme and violent message."" Pankowski said skinheads and other extremists held their first, small march on Independence Day in 2009 and that the yearly event has grown in number each year. It now draws extremists from Hungary, Germany, Sweden and the U.K., becoming what Pankowski believes is the largest such far-right gathering in Europe.  ""They hijacked this holiday, which I think is sad,"" Pankowski said. Other groups held their own events in an effort to reclaim the day from the right-wing radicals, including one organized by the Committee for the Defense of Democracy, an organization founded last year to fight the centralization of power by Poland's right-wing government, and joined by political opposition leaders.  ""The Nov. 11 holiday is our holiday and nobody will take it away from us. We will not allow it,"" said Grzegorz Schetyna, leader of the Civic Platform party. The Interior Ministry said some 10,000 joined that march, though city hall said 27,000. Separately, hundreds of left-wing activists held what they called an ""anti-fascist"" march elsewhere in the capital. Across the country, official parades and other events were also held to mark 98 years since Poland regained its independence at the end of World War I after 123 years of foreign rule. Early in the day, President Andrzej Duda, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo and other leaders attended the opening ceremony of Warsaw's Temple of Divine Providence, a church the Polish parliament first planned to build in 1791, but which got delayed because of centuries of occupation, war and communism. The construction finally began in 2002, after the fall of communism. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The panel in Washington ruled in a 2015 lawsuit by the Republican Party of Louisiana and two parish GOP affiliates that sought to overturn the last major remaining provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, more commonly known as McCain-Feingold after its chief Senate sponsors. The law allows for lower court rulings to be appealed directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing intermediate steps, and requires the high court to decide the case. James Bopp Jr., the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs who sued the Federal Election Commission, said Monday that ""we just believe they're wrong, and we're certainly appealing to the Supreme Court."" Once an appeal is filed, Bopp said he would expect a case to reach the high court by February for consideration next year or in 2018. Bopp has argued that a 2003 Supreme Court decision upholding the party soft-money ban on contributionsto political parties has been overtaken by the high court's 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, which ended limits on corporate spending and enabled the growth of super PACs, independent groups funded by massive gifts from big money donors. The Supreme Court in June 2010 affirmed without comment a ruling by a special three-judge district court panel, also in Washington, that upheld the constitutionality of the soft money-ban in a case brought by the Republican National Committee. The RNC had argued that the law violates the First Amendment rights of political parties engaged in state elections that have only an incidental effect on federal races. In the RNC challenge, the three-judge panel cited the Supreme Court's 2003 finding upholding the ban that said there is ""no meaningful distinction"" between national party committees and the elected officials who control them, and that ""large soft-money contributions to national parties are likely to create actual or apparent indebtedness on the part of federal officeholders."" In the current case, Bopp said even if the ban is constitutionally acceptable on its face, the way it has been applied is not. He argued that before the soft-money ban, state parties could engage in ""independent"" spending, such as voter-registration activity or advertising without coordinating with any federal candidate or campaign. By counting such efforts as federal election activities under the soft-money ban, the law leaves political parties at a disadvantage to the super PACs, he said. The disadvantage persists despite the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United that accepted that independent spending did not pose a risk of ""quid pro quo"" corruption, Bopp argued. The courts' prior rulings were enough to dismiss the Louisiana GOP case, wrote Judge Sri Srinivasan, who ordinarily sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit but wrote for the panel in Monday's decision. ""We see no salient distinction between the First Amendment claims rejected in those cases and the challenge presented here,"" Srinivasan wrote, with U.S. district judges Christopher R. Cooper and Tanya S. Chutkan. As in the RNC case, ""plaintiffs cannot 'deny that their proposed activities' "" would benefit federal candidates, even indirectly, the judges wrote. They added that the high court's opinion about ""independent"" expenditures applied to spending, and did not dismiss the risk of corruption from unlimited contributions from donors seeking access to elected officials. Exempting state parties from a ban on unlimited soft-money contributions would simply allow the national parties to resume using state and local affiliates to take in such money, the judges wrote. An FEC spokeswoman declined to comment on Monday's ruling. Public interest groups that support campaign finance laws praised the ruling. ""We are pleased to see they recognized what courts have held for decades, which is that party contribution limits prevent quid-pro-quo corruption and should be upheld,"" said Daniel I. Weiner, senior counsel with the Brennan Center for Justice, which with Public Citizen, Democracy 21 and the Campaign Legal Center filed friend-of-the-court briefs supporting the FEC. "

Aoun spoke Sunday before thousands of supporters who gathered at the presidential palace in Baabda in southeastern Beirut. The 83-year-old has been a central figure in Lebanese politics for decades. He was elected by parliament as president on Monday.  ""A strong nation needs a strong government to administer it,"" he said. ""Corruption will be uprooted,"" he added, drawing cheers from his supporters waving red, white and green Lebanese flags. Aoun was elected president following a 29-month presidential vacuum. Many Lebanese hope his election would breathe new life into state institutions that have been paralyzed for nearly three years. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
