Police say 15,500 yellow-shirt protesters took to Kuala Lumpur streets Saturday for a second straight year to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Najib Razak over a financial scandal. Bersih estimated the crowd at 120,000. Bersih official Wong Chin Huat says the security sweep and Chin's detention without trial was aimed at silencing dissent and was a ""sign of panic"" by the government. He said Sunday that lawyers have had no access to Chin since she was taken Friday. Najib, who is attending the APEC summit in Peru, says Malaysians are fed up with demonstrations.

Bannon looks on as Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Denver on Nov. 5. The former Breitbart News chairman has been appointed senior White House counsel in the president-elect's administration. (Evan Vucci/AP)  In the fall of 2015, before Stephen K. Bannon became a trusted adviser to the next president, he launched a daily three-hour radio show that catered to what he called ""those 'low-information' citizens who are mocked and ridiculed by their 'betters' -- the clueless elites."" Bannon welcomed guests whose views, he often said, had been suppressed by the left's political correctness. He gave regular airtime to Milo Yiannopoulos, who was banned from Twitter after cheering on supporters who barraged ""Ghostbusters"" actor Leslie Jones with racist and sexist tweets. Bannon described an anti-Islamic activist who campaigns against what she calls ""creeping sharia"" in the United States as ""a voice in the wilderness."" A former Heritage Foundation staffer who had argued that Hispanic immigrants have lower IQs was ""one of the smartest brains out there in demographics, demography, this whole issue of immigration,"" Bannon said. From his perch as chief of the Breitbart News empire, which produced the satellite radio show, Bannon cemented his role as a champion of the alt-right, an anti-globalism movement that has attracted support from white supremacists and helped power Donald Trump's populist White House victory. Bannon's appointment as Trump's senior White House counselor is an early sign that the incoming president intends to continue promoting the hard-line approach to issues such as immigration and Islam that galvanized nationalist enthusiasm for his candidacy. How Bannon rose from provocateur to Oval Office confidant is the story of a man who, like Trump, now rages against the system from which he benefited for years.    Bannon and Trump participate in a roundtable with the Republican Leadership Initiative at Trump Tower in New York in August. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)  As a graduate of Harvard Business School, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker and a Hollywood movie producer, Bannon is in many ways an example of the bicoastal elite that he now disdains. Although Bannon and those close to him have said he is not racist, he has nonetheless shown a willingness to accommodate ""fringe organizations,"" as he described the extremists attracted to populism in a 2014 address unearthed by BuzzFeed. Eventually, those elements would fall away, he assured the audience: ""Over time, it all gets kind of washed out, right?"" Under Bannon's hand, Breitbart articles offered dire warnings of the threats posed by immigrants. Bannon's radio show provided a steady diet of apocalyptic warnings about radical Islam's rise, asserting that Europe had been subject to a ""quasi-invasion."" Breitbart stories ridiculed feminists, and Bannon once angrily denounced a female colleague as a ""bimbo"" in the 1990s, according to court records. An ex-wife's allegations that Bannon said he did not want his children to attend school with Jews -- comments he denied making -- have spurred accusations that he is anti-Semitic. Friends, family and even now-critical former colleagues said the image of Bannon as a bigot is wrong, and miss what really drives the 62-year-old, who was infuriated when people like his father, a longtime phone company worker, saw their retirement funds shrink because of the 2008 financial crisis. Bannon's longtime personal assistant is an African American woman, and he has extended family members who are Jewish, they note.    Bannon backstage during a campaign event on Nov. 1 in Eau Claire, Wis. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)  For Bannon, the mission is to ignite a broader populist movement -- even if that means tolerating extremist viewpoints, associates say. ""He is not a racist,"" said Julia Jones, a self-described ""Bernie Sanders liberal"" who was Bannon's screenwriting partner for 16 years. ""I think he is using the alt-right for political purposes."" In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter published Friday, Bannon said: ""I'm not a white nationalist, I'm a nationalist. I'm an economic nationalist."" He predicted Trump could create a new populist political movement that would win significant black and Hispanic support and ""govern for 50 years.""   Bannon did not respond to a request to be interviewed for this article, but friends and family spoke about his views. His older brother, Martin J. ""Mike"" Bannon III, strongly rejected the idea that he held any prejudices. ""Steve and I and others were taught by our parents that if a woman came on the bus, you gave up your seat -- it didn't matter if they were black or white or Asian or whatever,"" Mike Bannon said. What guides his brother, Mike Bannon added, is a belief that the rules should be fair to give everyone a chance to participate -- including those of all ethnicities and faiths. ""He's a fighter for those people,"" said Mike Bannon, who works in finance and still lives in their home town of Richmond. ""He's a man for the forgotten man."" Bannon is known for becoming consumed with whatever endeavor is before him. When something goes awry, he is quick with an expletive. At times, colleagues said, he would remind those around him that he had a Harvard degree. Brazenness, canny intuition and luck drove Bannon to a series of unexpected successes. When he ran a boutique investment bank, a bet on the library of Castle Rock Entertainment in the 1990s scored him a lucrative royalties stream from a then-little-known show called ""Seinfeld."" His direction of a glowing biopic of former President Ronald Reagan in 2004 brought him into contact with the late conservative media agitator and entrepreneur Andrew Breitbart and through him the wealthy Mercer family. 'He believed what he believed'   The middle sibling of five children, Bannon grew up in a tightly knit Irish Catholic family in Richmond, on a street of big shade trees and eclectic old houses in the Ginter Park neighborhood. Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, now lives about seven blocks away. Bannon's pugilistic character was apparent at an early age. ""He's a son of Richmond and a son of the South, and that's who he'll always be,"" Mike Bannon said. ""He was always a guy that would get in an argument or get in a fight, and you weren't going to change his mind about something. He believed what he believed."" Bannon attended Catholic schools throughout childhood and graduated in 1972 from Benedictine High School, an all-boys military academy. Students were not exposed to much of the counterculture of the time. ""We had to take Latin and logic -- everyone had to take a classical education program and a heavy dose of values,"" said Patrick McSweeney, an old family friend. ""At that time, most of the teachers were monks. It was very definitely a religious education."" McSweeney, a lawyer who went on to be chairman of the state Republican Party, said Benedictine was racially integrated long before Richmond public schools, which did not integrate until the 1970s. Bannon's first foray into his brand of disruptive politics came in 1975, during his junior year at Virginia Tech, when he launched an upstart bid for student body president, challenging the established order. He chose as his running mate a woman, Susan Oliver, at a time when campus leadership positions were dominated by men. ""He had as much respect for me and my ideas and my contributions as anybody possibly could,"" said Oliver, who is now a lawyer in Lynchburg, Va. The race got nasty. Bannon had participated in student government for only five months. His opponent, Marshall DeBerry, had toiled for more than two years in the organization and was the handpicked heir of the outgoing president. Bannon used DeBerry's establishment credentials against him. ""He was saying, 'This administration, these guys . . . they're all part of this old crowd. They haven't done jack for you,' "" DeBerry recalled. A Bannon-Oliver campaign flier belittled other candidates for offering only ""Platitudes, Promises and Slogans.""    Bannon was a 21-year-old junior at Virginia Tech, running an upstart campaign to be student body president. Bannon had only participated in student government for five months as chair of a committee. He said he better understood the needs of the student body, engaging supporters with emotional appeals he would hone over four decades. (Provided by Susan Oliver)  The old guard struck back. ""Don't be fooled by Bannon. He has immense charisma, but lacks the ability to keep his head geared in any one particular direction long enough to accomplish anything,"" warned Gary Clisham, whom Bannon was running to replace, in a letter to the editor of the student newspaper. Clisham, who is deceased, added that during his brief tenure in student government, ""Mr. Steve Bannon has run amok every assignment given him."" The letter infuriated Bannon's supporters, including Bannon's then-roommate Darrell Nevin, who shoved Clisham when he spoke up to blast Bannon during a debate. ""Scuffle Occurs at Great Debate"" read the headline in the student newspaper. ""I was young. I just thought, well, let's push him off the stage,"" Nevin recalled sheepishly. ""It was a bitter campaign."" Bannon won with more than 60 percent of the vote. A shift to the right Bannon's political tilt deepened in the Navy, when he observed President Jimmy Carter's handling of the Iran hostage crisis from a destroyer in the north Arabian Sea. ""I come from a blue-collar, Irish Catholic, pro-Kennedy, pro-union family of Democrats,"" he told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2015. ""I wasn't political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter f---ed things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer.""  After Harvard Business School, he scored a job at Goldman Sachs in the middle of the heady 1980s, eventually moving to Los Angeles to focus on media mergers and acquisitions. In the late 1980s, he and some Goldman colleagues broke off and formed their own investment bank, Bannon & Co., housed in an office on Canon Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif. They quickly gained traction by drilling into the details of a media company's library, outmaneuvering goliaths such as Goldman in the process. ""We were two guys trying to buck the system, not being the traditional establishment investment bank,"" said Scot Vorse, a close friend since business school who joined Bannon in the enterprise. ""We were of an attitude that we're going to do something different."" During this time, Bannon was hired by investors including Texas billionaire Edward Bass to turn around the financially struggling Biosphere 2, an experiment in the Arizona desert to build an entirely self-sufficient community. Bannon's temper flared as he became embroiled in a management dispute, according to court records. One scientist described as part of subsequent litigation how Bannon pulled up in a limousine on Easter weekend of 1994, accompanied by police officers and armed with a court order that gave him control of the facility. The scientist said that Bannon changed all of the office locks and switched out computer and telephone codes. The project's chief engineer hid a microcassette recorder in his underwear and secretly taped Bannon, court records show, capturing Bannon angrily calling a female scientist a ""29-year-old bimbo."" The woman had broken into the Biosphere to warn other scientists of Bannon's actions. On the recording, a copy of which has been published by Buzzfeed, Bannon promised to take a document she had written outlining safety problems at the site and ""ram it down her f---ing throat.""  In a deposition filed in the case, obtained by The Washington Post, Bannon said the ""bimbo"" insult was said ""in the heat of the moment, in a monologue of which I am blowing off steam."" At trial, he defended the word, saying it meant a person of low intelligence. He said he had concluded the woman was ""detached from reality, deluded and acting like a bimbo.""     While Bannon's work as an investment banker consumed him, he was growing increasingly intrigued with the creative side of the entertainment business. In the early 1990s, he and Jones, a screenwriter, struck up a conversation in a restaurant and decided to try their hand at adapting Bannon's idea for a version of Shakespeare's ""Titus Andronicus"" set in space.  That script went nowhere, but the two went on to work on dozens of film and television projects together. One of them, the 2004 Reagan movie ""In the Face of Evil,"" introduced Bannon to Breitbart, who was making a name for himself as an editor at the Drudge Report. ""We screened the film at a festival in Beverly Hills,"" Bannon told Bloomberg, ""and out of the crowd comes this, like, bear who's squeezing me like my head's going to blow up and saying how we've gotta take back the culture."" By then, Bannon had sold his company to the French bank Societe Generale. He shed the expensive suits he wore for Hollywood business meetings, sticking with cargo shorts and polo shirts. ""The moment he left that world, there was a physical transformation,"" said conservative author Peter Schweizer, whom Bannon approached in 2002 about turning his Reagan book into a documentary. ""The uniform of those elite institutions was gone."" Bannon told Bloomberg that he was disgusted by how the banking industry handled the 2008 financial crisis. ""I turned on Wall Street for the same reason everybody else did: The American taxpayer was forced to cut mook deals to bail out guys who didn't deserve it,"" he said in the interview.    From left, Bannon, executive producer Trevor Drinkwater and producer Jason Netter pose together at the premiere of ""Sweetwater"" during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, in 2013. (Danny Moloshok/Invision/AP)  Bannon increasingly turned his lens on political issues, directing and producing documentaries such as ""Generation Zero,"" an examination of the global economic crisis; ""Battle for America,"" which hammered an ""arrogant, and ever-expanding central government""; and a film celebrating 2008 GOP vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin called ""The Undefeated."" He said his approach was influenced by liberal filmmaker Michael Moore and Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl. ""Leave the politics aside, you have to learn from those past masters on how they were trying to communicate their ideas,"" he told the Wall Street Journal. Jones, Bannon's longtime writing partner, said she was dismayed by his turn toward conservative politics -- particularly his focus on Islam as a threat. Jones said she was taken aback when Bannon added a coda to the Reagan film warning of the threat of ""the beast"" over images of Muslims praying, terrorist camps and people falling to their deaths from the World Trade Center on 9/11. A few years later, Jones said, she declined to work on a project he pitched about the rise of ""Islamic fascism"" in the United States that would have opened with an image of the American flag dissolving into the Islamic crescent and star. ""It offended me,"" Jones said. ""Everything about what he's become baffles me."" In recent years, Bannon has expanded his efforts to influence the political debate by setting up nonprofits to spearhead independent research, most notably through the Florida-based watchdog group Government Accountability Institute. Bannon served as chairman of the group, whose directors included Rebekah Mercer, a daughter of hedge fund executive and conservative megadonor Robert Mercer. Schweizer, the president of GAI, authored ""Clinton Cash,"" a book that lacerated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for her ties to wealthy interests. Bannon turned it into a documentary that was released earlier this year. It was produced in part by a company called Glittering Steel, which shared a Beverly Hills address with both Breitbart News and the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica -- both of which have financial backing from Mercer, who also financed a super PAC supporting Trump. Cambridge Analytica also worked directly for the Trump campaign this year. The first rule of 'Fight Club' Bannon joined the board of Breitbart News in 2011. The following March, the site experienced an unexpected transformation when the 43-year-old Breitbart collapsed and died near his California home. Larry Solov, Breitbart's longtime friend, took over as chief executive, while Bannon was appointed executive chairman. Bannon was hands-on, hosting two daily calls with the staff. Reporters talked up news -- about immigration, refugees and crime -- that they said the rest of the media was ignoring. Conservative stalwarts such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) -- nominated Friday to be Trump's attorney general -- had a welcoming forum to explain their immigration and terrorism views, and Breitbart embraced Republican insurgents while blasting party leaders. ""We call ourselves 'the Fight Club.' You don't come to us for warm and fuzzy,"" Bannon told The Washington Post early this year, adding, ""We think of ourselves as virulently anti-establishment, particularly 'anti-' the permanent political class. We say Paul Ryan was grown in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation."" The site's tone and the reactions it drew from readers alarmed some staffers, including former editor-at-large Ben Shapiro, who later wrote that the comment section turned into ""a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers."" Bannon told the Wall Street Journal this past week that Breitbart provided ""an outlet for 10 or 12 or 15 lines of thought,"" of which the alt-right was only ""a tiny part."" He acknowledged the movement had ""some racial and anti-Semitic overtones"" that he rejected, defining it for himself as ""younger people who are anti-globalists, very nationalist, terribly anti-establishment."" In November 2015, Bannon assumed a more prominent public role as host of the daily satellite radio talk show ""Breitbart News Daily."" He led the show until August, when he became chief executive of Trump's presidential campaign.      Before Stephen K. Bannon became a close adviser to Donald Trump, he hosted ""Breitbart News Daily,"" a radio show, on which he interviewed the eventual president-elect nine times. The Washington Post's David A. Fahrenthold discusses what those interviews tell us about their relationship. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Bannon's show became a key platform to promote Trump, who appeared regularly. During one interview, Bannon likened the reality TV star's ability to negotiate with networks about the terms of the primary debates to the skills needed to negotiate international treaties. ""The same logic applies whether it's China, or Mexico, Iran or the E.U.,"" Bannon told the candidate. ""We've been pushed around by everybody. "" Still, Bannon had reservations. Trump is a ""blunt instrument for us,"" Bannon told Vanity Fair this summer, before joining the campaign. ""I don't know whether he really gets it or not."" One thing Bannon had no doubts about, however, was the strength of the nationalist sentiments bolstering the candidate.  The day after Trump's Election Day upset, Bannon took a victory lap on his old radio show, chiding the media elite for failing to anticipate the outcome. ""They didn't understand the underlying desire for people to have control over their own lives,"" he said. ""This victory,"" Bannon told his listeners, ""is your victory.""

Chuck Schumer of New York is threatening political payback if congressional Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump try to undo President Barack Obama's major legislative achievements.  ""They will rue the day"" they repeal Obama's health care law, Senate Democrats' leader-in-waiting told The Associated Press in an interview in his office on Friday. ""It's a political nightmare for them. They'll be like the dog that caught the bus."" Trump, after meeting with Obama, said he'd like to keep popular pieces of the six-year-old law, including the requirement to extend coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and the provision allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26. But Schumer said it was a non-starter to try picking off favored pieces of the Affordable Care Act.  ""There is no way that you can keep those things without keeping the ACA,"" Schumer insisted. He added that he'd made similar points directly to Trump, but declined to share the president-elect's response. Congressional Republicans have tried repeatedly to repeal the law that helped some 20 million Americans gain coverage, but they've been unable to coalesce around a replacement. Democrats chose Schumer this week to serve as minority leader, replacing Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who is retiring after five terms. In the interview, Schumer also served notice on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill that provided for tougher oversight of financial institutions and created a consumer protection bureau after the 2008 economic crisis.  ""He should not even try to think about repealing Dodd-Frank,"" Schumer said. ""We will have enough votes to beat that back."" As leader of a 48-member Senate Democratic Caucus next year, Schumer will command enough votes to block majority Republicans from getting the 60 votes needed to proceed on most major legislation. As such, Schumer and his Democrats will be the only backstop against Trump and the GOP next year when Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But the Brooklyn-born Schumer pledged to work with fellow New Yorker Trump when possible, arguing that to do otherwise would amount to a ""a dereliction of our responsibility to the millions of Americans who need work, who need protection."" Indeed Schumer argued that on some issues Trump has more in common with the Democrats than Republicans, suggesting a strategy that would amount to forming alliances with Trump where possible against the wishes of conservative Republicans and GOP leaders on the Hill.  ""Donald Trump in his campaign advocated many things or a good number of economic issues that Democrats support and Republicans have opposed,"" Schumer said, pointing to trade, spending on infrastructure, and a financial loophole benefiting wealthy Wall Street interests. Schumer blamed Democrats' election failures on an ineffective economic message, and adopting some of Trump's rhetoric he pledged ""a bolder, stronger, sharper-edged economic plan aimed at the middle class and those trying to be middle class, and an understanding that the system is rigged against the average person and it's gotta change, a draining of the swamp if you will."" But he also promised to fight Trump ""with everything we've got"" when the new president takes an approach opposed to Democratic values. ""We're not going to do something in name only,"" Schumer said. On infrastructure, Trump has proposed a $1 trillion spending program that some conservatives are already balking at. Schumer said he'd told Trump: ""It'll make a lot of your hard-right people against it, the Freedom Caucus will never go for a large infrastructure bill.""  ""He didn't say 'no,'"" Schumer said of Trump's response. And unlike demands from conservatives, Schumer said he didn't think such an infrastructure bill would have to be fully paid for -- meaning it could add to the deficit instead -- a position he said he believed Trump might share. Schumer also signaled a fight over the Supreme Court vacancy, noting that after refusing to act for nearly a full year on Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, for the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, ""our Republican colleagues who want to move this quickly don't come before us with clean hands.""

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2016/11/19/trumpism-the-french-way/	Trumpism, the French way	"   French far-right party leader Marine Le Pen answers media questions after launching her campaign for the French presidential elections. (Laurent Etienne/European Pressphoto Agency)  Christine Ockrent is a journalist and writer based in Paris and is a Global Opinions contributing writer. A few days ago, as the United States and the rest of world were still trying to grasp the full meaning of Donald Trump's victory, one French politician rushed to the media, glowing with self-confidence: Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right movement, wanted the world to know she was actually the real winner of the Oval Office. ""The people are free! It is not the end of the world, it is the end of a world!,"" she said.  To Le Pen, who very early claimed her support for the Republican candidate, America's political earthquake has cleared her path to the Elysee Palace. In her view, le systeme in both France and the United States has crumbled and with it, so has the establishment, the elites and the media which so far have denied the National Front the right to access the highest political office in the land. Le Pen is eager to accommodate her homemade brew with the new American recipe: nativism, identity, ethnicity, anti-globalization, Putinism, protectionism, borders. It all fits perfectly with her far-right agenda -- only the wall is hard to sell to the French -- the ""ligne Maginot,"" meant to protect France against the Germans, collapsed in 1940. The 48-year-old Le Pen has long been betting on the anger and frustrations of those who feel they are the losers in a society struck by unemployment and income inequalities. Voting for her party no longer looks like kissing the devil in the dark. More people today support the National Front openly, including teachers, policemen and civil servants traditionally considered as the gatekeepers of ""La Republique."" A shrewd tactician, Le Pen has transformed a marginal, vilified extremist movement into a well-organized party, which she controls with an iron fist. She expelled her anti-Semitic father, who had founded the National Front some 45 years ago, and just forbade her niece Marion, a rising star, from stealing the spotlight by taking part in a major TV program. She has adopted a more respectable style, publicly avoiding the racial overtones National Front activists cultivate, careful not to indulge in overt anti-Muslim propaganda, sticking to the anti-immigration, anti-European Union arguments that have won over some 25 percent of French voters, according to public opinion polls. A year ago, the National Front scored 27 percent of the vote at local elections without gaining control of any region: the electoral process would not allow it. Alongside other Western democracies, France suffers from democratic fatigue. According to a study published last week, 7 out of 10 French voters believe the forthcoming elections will not change anything. One out of 5, particularly among the poorly educated, would favor a more authoritarian system. Our presidential election is a two-round system, each citizen casting a single vote for his or her preferred candidate. All pundits agree that next April Le Pen will successfully pass the first round. The Trump shockwave has caught all traditional parties in France unprepared and left them aghast. With France's presidential elections due in six months, the traditional party system is bursting at the seams. The Conservatives have yielded to fashion, holding primaries only to discover that the process is reviving old rivalries without renewing political offering. Among the seven candidates competing this Sunday for the first round, all but one have been cabinet ministers. The main contenders are a former president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and two former prime ministers, Alain Juppe and Francois Fillon. After the  TV debate Thursday night, Juppe remains the favorite in the polls -- if the turn-out is high, he will defeat Sarkozy. To Juppe, the American campaign demonstrates the moral and political imperative to resist populism and its load of simplistic lies. Sarkozy, who had publicly praised Hillary Clinton, changed gear and praised the choice of the American people to elect Trump without criticizing his populist overtones. Whoever wins on Nov. 27 will be the conservatives' candidate for president. On the opposite side, the Socialist party is in shambles. President Francois Hollande's credibility and ratings are so low that his closest advisers are nervous  about the opportunity of his running again. Manuel Valls, the prime minister, tries to appear as the natural heir to Hollande but not as the traitor -- he'd rather leave that part to Emmanuel Macron, the dashing former economy minister who has just declared his bid. Valls has been the most outspoken about Le Pen, recognizing that she now stands a much better chance of becoming president, only to hint that he would be her most efficient opponent. Macron is the only one to infuse some fresh air into stale political atmosphere; as a result of his newcomer status, he faces massive hostility from the left and from the whole political establishment. To expand her hold, will Le Pen now adjust back to the hateful and racist strategy which has fared so well for her new American hero? In any case, she has already won her bet: For the coming months, she will be the central character of the French political scene."

Sam Rasoul, a young Democrat from Roanoke, quit his post in the party leadership Friday over what he said was the inability of Virginia Democrats to turn away from the politics of fear and division. ""I feel as though the [leadership] right now is not committed to the radical changes we need to connect with the values of working class America,"" said Rasoul, 35, the lone Muslim in the General Assembly. ""We were sent a mandate on Election Day that we have to completely rethink the way we do business."" It's a minor party squabble - Rasoul isn't stepping down from the House of Delegates seat he first won in 2014 - but the rift is an unusual window into the hand-wringing that grips a party after a tough election.  Virginia's electorate has been sending mixed signals for the past few years, tilting Democratic for president and governor but leaving the state legislature firmly under Republican control. And even though Virginia went for Hillary Clinton last week, Rasoul said he was troubled by the overall tone of the recent election. There is a deepening divide in Virginia between the blue-leaning voters of urban and suburban areas and the red voters of more rural areas that Rasoul said the party needs to bridge.  [Virginia Clnton voters don't know any Trump voters, and vice versa]  ""Sure, we need to be super-strong in condemning acts of real hatred and bigotry and racism, but when people believe that all of Trump voters are racist, they really are not empathizing with the wants and needs of a lot of folks, and we are missing out,"" he said. Rasoul, a business strategy consultant, said he has no beef with the policies of his party.  ""I love our platform, but when we want to use the same negative campaign tactics, when we do not try to genuinely listen and build trust with people from all walks of life, we're not really being sincere about the values we espouse,"" he said. ""I think that's why trust has eroded with time, and I think people have lost trust with both parties."" Rasoul said he will offer some specific suggestions in coming days, such as a candidate training program ""not on what issues you should run on but on how we should conduct ourselves."" Or maybe, he said, Democrats could pledge that ""I'm never going to say anything about my adversary that they wouldn't agree with if they were in the room."" The House Democratic caucus is gathering in Richmond this weekend for its annual retreat. One party member who insisted on anonymity to discuss the squabble said that Rasoul has been trying for some time to get leaders to consider a rebranding effort during this year's meetings. When that failed, Rasoul quit as caucus treasurer to try to get some attention for his ideas, the party member said. For Republicans, the open break was a delightful gift for the weekend. ""I think it shows how oblivious they are to the message that was sent by the voters on Election Day,"" state Republican Party chairman John Whitbeck said. ""If they don't listen to people like Sam they're going to have a miserable few years under President Trump.""  An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the state Democratic party is meeting this weekend. It is the House Democratic caucus. This story has been updated.  "

As they prepare to take control of the White House and both chambers of Congress next year, Republicans are celebrating the opportunity to enact a new agenda for the country, including lowering taxes, securing the border and repealing President Barack Obama's health care law. But with that opportunity comes massive political risk: If President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans don't deliver, they will face a serious reckoning with voters. That could begin with the 2018 midterm elections, when every House member and one-third of the Senate will be up for re-election.  ""The American public has clearly said that they want to go a different direction,"" said Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado. ""And if we are not effective in moving in that different direction, they will take the opportunity away from us, and they will return it to the Democrats."" Said Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, speaking Friday at the Federalist Society: ""It's time to put up or shut up. There are no excuses."" That sobering reality has been sinking in for GOP members of the House and Senate as they begin the early stages of planning an agenda for next year. Republicans point out that although they will control a majority in the Senate with 52 votes, that's well short of the 60-vote supermajority needed to advance most major initiatives, including Supreme Court nominees. So although Republicans would be able to use a legislative maneuver to send a health care repeal to Trump's desk with just a simple majority, other major objectives, including immigration and border enforcement, would require some degree of cooperation from minority Democrats. That could give Senate Democrats' new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, veto power over major chunks of Trump's agenda. And it's led to a call from some House Republicans for their Senate colleagues to try to push through a rules change to eliminate the 60-vote filibuster barrier.  ""They're either going to have to modify that rule, or they're going to have to face the wrath of the voters,"" said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., who is retiring at the end of this year. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is an institutionalist who has shown no enthusiasm for such a move. But Republicans fret that a shortage of votes in the Senate is not likely to be a winning political excuse to most voters who picked an outsider in Trump to bring wholesale change to Washington, and now want to see that happen.  ""We can talk about not having 60 in the Senate, but I think that our time to show that we can govern is now,"" said GOP Rep. Tom Rooney of Florida. The Republican role on health care seems particularly risky to some in the party. Democrats have born severe political consequences for pushing through the Affordable Care Act in 2010. They lost control of the House in that year's midterm elections, and Republicans have used the health care issue ever since to rally their base and attack Democrats. But if Republicans repeal it, as they are determined to do, they will be the ones responsible for whatever comes next. And given the enormous complexity of the U.S. health care system, which accounts for fully one-sixth of the U.S. economy, the potential for complications looks immense. Even after six years, Republicans have failed to unite around a single alternative to Obamacare, or a solution to ensure that the 20 million Americans who gained health coverage under the law don't suddenly lose it. Schumer warned in an interview Friday that repealing the health care law would turn into ""a political nightmare"" for Republicans. And even while cheering the opportunity to undo the health law, House Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged in a news conference this past week that, ""It's too early to know the answer to, 'How fast can Obamacare relief occur?'"" Many Republicans believe Democrats overreached in the early years of the Obama administration, when they controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress. Voters took Democrats' majorities away, and now Republicans are mindful of making the same mistake themselves. Rather than a rightward lurch, ""It's paramount right now in American politics to build a plurality coalition, because we are still a country of great diversity,"" argued Paul Schumaker, who was North Carolina GOP Sen. Richard Burr's chief re-election consultant this year. And even as Republicans prepare to enact a governing agenda, it's unclear in some cases what that agenda will be, because some of Trump's promises clash with goals set out over the years by Ryan and other congressional Republicans. For example, Trump has promised to protect Medicare; Ryan has proposed turning it into a voucher-like program for future retirees. Trump is proposing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill; most conservatives balk at major new government spending. As for Democrats, even from their defensive crouch they're eyeing the political upside that could result from full Republican control of the nation's capital. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is facing a rare leadership challenge from Democratic colleagues distraught about the election results, tried to reassure her caucus this past week that midterm elections in an opposition president's first term offer a singular chance for political gain.  ""Trump is president, we have a bigger opportunity to take the Congress, just following history, in our generation of being involved in politics,"" said the California Democrat. ___= Associated Press writers Tom Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington contributed to this report.

"   Pro-white rights organizations the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement and Ku Klux Klan groups participate in a cross and swastika burning in Temple, Ga. (ERIK S. LESSER/European Pressphoto Agency)  Organizations tracking hate crimes have seen a spike in racist and anti-Semitic incidents over the last several days. In the words of Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center: ""The white supremacists out there are celebrating his victory and many are feeling their oats."" Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard who caused controversy with his comments on women, announced in The Post that he was never going to use the term ""political correctness"" again. The real threat, in Summers' view, stems from the ""terrifying events"" that Donald Trump's election has set off, leading to an upsurge in hateful incidents and speech. Timur Kuran's academic book, ""Private Truths, Public Lies,"" helps explain why Trump's election victory has been associated with an upsurge in hate crimes. Kuran may seem an improbable person to explain why public expressions of racism are increasing: He doesn't believe that U.S. racism is as bad as many think, opposes ""political correctness"" and ""affirmative action"" and argues that the U.S. has metamorphosed ""from a country that oppresses blacks into one that gives many blacks special privileges."" Even so, his intellectual arguments can be separated from his political beliefs. His notion of ""preference falsification"" provides a plausible explanation for why many racists, anti-Semites and the like were reluctant to reveal their true beliefs until recently. It also explains why they are more willing to do so now that Trump has been elected. Preference falsification means that people often don't say what they really think Kuran's key idea is that 'preference falsification' explains many aspects of human society and politics. Preference falsification is ""the act of misrepresenting one's genuine wants under perceived social pressure."" Trivial examples of this are commonplace. When we go to our boss's house for dinner, we don't necessarily express our true opinion of his or her hideous taste in furniture, and may indeed praise it. At Thanksgiving dinner, we may want to bite our tongues when relatives express loud and confident political opinions that we completely disagree with. As political philosophers have observed, a certain degree of hypocrisy is essential to the smooth functioning of society. Yet preference falsification doesn't just apply to trivial forms of social hypocrisy. It can have profound social and political consequences. Most authoritarian societies force people to express public support for the regime, for example by effectively requiring store owners to have a picture of the dictator in their shop window. The reason is straightforward. If most people publicly express support for the regime, then no one can be sure how many people quietly oppose it. It might even be that a large majority of citizens oppose their government and want to overthrow it. However, unless they know that enough other people oppose the regime to overthrow it, no one will make the first move. Everyone fears that their own private opposition to the regime is not widely shared, rendering any attempt at regime protest doomed. Preference falsification plausibly explained why the brutal regime ruling Tunisia was stable for so long, and why it fell when Facebook made it easier for people to figure out that other people hated the regime too. Preference falsification happens in free societies too Most academics interested in the concept of preference falsification have examined how it works in nondemocratic regimes. However, Kuran's book spends a lot of time arguing that it can have consequences in open societies too. He argues that social pressure generates the same kind of outcomes in open societies as state repression does in authoritarian ones, making people unwilling to express unpopular opinions. Kuran claims that both arguments for affirmative action and efforts to enforce political correctness rest on a kind of preference falsification. Many people disagree with these arguments, but are frightened to express their opposition in public, for fear of social sanction and shaming. Kuran is skeptical of claims that racism is a major problem in modern American society, although he notes that new empirical evidence might emerge that shows that his claims are wrong. However, the notion of preference falsification is itself a value neutral one, which does not depend on Kuran's own political beliefs. Although Kuran does not dwell on this, he acknowledges that preference falsification can in some contexts and from some perspectives be beneficial. We are probably all better off if we don't tell our boss how horrible his or her taste is, or get into a heated fight over the Thanksgiving turkey that leaves everyone in the family feeling miserable. Preference falsification might have helped suppress racist expression As Summers's opinion piece suggests, what some people view as problematic 'political correctness' might from another perspective be perceived as a mostly benign set of informal norms and social institutions that prevent people from expressing their actual racism. A large body of social science research indicates that racism is still relatively widespread within the American public. For example, Adivit Acharya, Matthew Blackwell and Maya Sen's influential recent paper shows how people are far more likely to identify as Republican, oppose affirmative action, have negative feelings toward African Americans and believe that black people ought to be able to overcome prejudice as other minorities did if they live in counties that had high slave ownership in the 1860s. This strongly suggests that attitudes to affirmative action and the like are indeed closely linked to historic racism. Yet over the past few decades, it has become increasingly socially unacceptable to publicly express racist views or sentiments. People in public life who express these beliefs are likely to be treated as pariahs on the national stage. There is regional variation: For example, Jeff Sessions who was denied confirmation as a federal judge during the Ronald Reagan administration for expressing sympathy with the Ku Klux Klan, has repeatedly been elected as senator for the state of Alabama. Even so, overt racism is usually viewed with abhorrence. This can plausibly be interpreted as a mixture of sincere change in beliefs and preference falsification. On the one hand, changes in attitudes to mixed-race marriages suggest that there are fewer strong racists in the United States than there were 40 years ago. On the other, people who are racists are more plausibly likely to keep their views to themselves except in certain contexts and perhaps certain parts of the country. Those who are still racist have had good self-interested reasons to falsify their true beliefs, either refraining from expressing their views in public or actively pretending to hold different views than the views they do hold. That is what Trump has changed Trump's election victory has many consequences, which the social sciences are only beginning to parse. However, if reports of a substantial upsurge in racist incidents are correct, they suggest that one of these consequences is a breakdown in preference falsification around racism. People who are and always have been racists have just witnessed the election of a president who has made grossly racist claims about Mexicans and has surrounded himself with some people who are more racist still. This does two things. First, it gives racists new heart by suggesting that many more people share their beliefs than they might hitherto have believed. Trump's electoral success tells them that at the least racism is not a politically disqualifying problem for presidential candidates any more, and that perhaps for many voters it is a plus rather than a minus. Second, it tells them that if they themselves publicly express their racism, they are less likely to be socially punished than they previously believed. Of course, we don't know for certain that preference falsification is the real reason people seem to be more willing to show their racism in public than before. However, if it is, we can probably expect that there will be a long-term increase in the rate and level of public expressions of racism. Trump's appointment of Steven K. Bannon as his head of strategy, and his nomination of Sessions as attorney general are likely to further suggest to racists that they do not need to hide their true views. The direct policy consequences of Trump's presidency will be very important. His election will have indirect consequences too. One of these indirect consequences is plausibly to weaken implicit social sanctions against racism and empower racists to publicly express their true preferences."

Javits Convention Center in New York on Nov. 8, 2016. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)  Our addiction to political theater did us in. We hated the 2016 campaign -- prayed for the endgame -- yet we couldn't look away. Like a car crash, horrified onlookers said. But was that really a gripe? Or was it a choice? After a year and a half of high-ratings, low-content TV debates and drama-packed stadium rallies, who's to say the 2020 sequel won't be bigger? More spectacular? Altogether more gripping and worse? Politics There are two definitions of ""political theater"": the one that applies to the realm of politics, and the one that applies to art. In the public sphere, ""political theater"" is synonymous with ""empty show."" It's a gesture. Posturing. Grandstanding. Sound and fury, likely to be signaling no genuine idea but certainly indicating a play for power. You hate to think of presidential campaigns as empty shows because they're so consequential. Yet how, in fact, did we spend the past 19 months and the $2 billion it takes to hash out these extravaganzas?  [Paul Farhi on the big cable ratings for cable news]  On Nov. 9, everyone was scrambling to interpret the historically shocking results. What was the message and the mandate? Well, who could say with any precision? Indisputable now is that the message was change, yet it was practically blind change. Apparently, 23 percent of Donald Trump's voters thought he was not qualified for the job. ""I'm excited to see him blow the place up,"" a heartland voter told The Washington Post after the election. ""He stands on his own, so he can throw the middle finger up."" Policy specifics didn't matter. Anger did. And it was spectacular. Theater people know about spectacle. It's the cheapest tool in the kit. It's also often the most popular. It goes back to Aristotle, who observed in ""The Poetics"" that spectacle is the least valuable element of tragedy. The effect of spectacle is visceral, not intellectual -- it's a thrill.  This was widely described as an angry election; David Axelrod's phrase was ""primal scream."" Could it be that we are angry (both sides) because across so many issues we skimmed past evidence and ideas to feeling? What answers were talked through? Is the public smarter and more fluent about anything now (except how to craft a zinger and swagger past a gaffe) than we were before this campaign? Has the public basically just blown a year and a half of college to binge on rage? The inevitable campaign ""narrative"" isn't issues but ""character,"" a lazy habit nurtured by candidates, pundits and an increasingly rabid public that's prompted to stoke its frustration and get louder with no requirement to get smarter. All around, it's bad citizenship. That was what New York Times columnist Paul Krugman objected to in September when he complained that political journalists were behaving like theater critics, describing the lively but hollow show. Theater critics disputed that: We know spectacle when we see it. And the word for this Wrestlemania-like showdown -- executed with particular fervor at CNN, with its glowering head shots of the heavyweight contestants above a ticking countdown clock -- was never really ""drama"" or even ""farce,"" but ""travesty.""  Journalists palpably experiencing withdrawal from the fury and surprise of this campaign are already trying to gin up the next round. The Friday after the election, Jane Sanders, Bernie's wife, was asked by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer whether her husband would run in 2020. ""See, that's exactly the wrong question,"" Sanders answered.  She offered Blitzer issues every day, but we don't really seem to want to think it through. We'd rather slug it out. That's a choice. As long as emotion and spectacle remain our preferences, be braced for the next extravaganza, the next mesmerizing unicorn who will razzle-dazzle some sort of unpredictable path to 270. We are the stories we tell. Art    A scene from the Rust Belt: Lynn Nottage's ""Sweat"" at Arena Stage last winter. (C. Stanley Photography)  ""Political theater"" in the artistic realm, by contrast, is exemplary citizenship: The two hours (or seven, in some ambitious cases) are the definition of a thoughtful deep dive. Yet this fall, Washington theaters lamented that the stage had a puny voice, if any voice at all, as the hyper-theatrical campaign boiled to its climax. ""I said that the discourse in this country is so terrible and that people were getting away with big lies,"" Michael Kahn told Peter Marks as five theaters embarked on ""Theatrical Selections,"" a free Monday-night series of political plays during the final weeks of the campaign. ""I was thinking about how we could try to wake people up."" Studio Theatre artistic director David Muse told American Theatre magazine that ""Theatrical Selections,"" which has The election in its title if you highlight the proper letters, was born of ""a shared feeling of impotence and a desire to do something to use the theater to comment on the moment we found ourselves in."" The readings were popular: Tickets vanished for Bertolt Brecht's fascist-gangster fable ""The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui"" at the Shakespeare Theatre, and a large portion of the audience stayed past 11 p.m. for a Trump-centric discussion with political journalists. ""Bad Jews"" playwright Joshua Harmon's ""Medea""-themed ""Ivanka"" was a fast sellout at Studio. The question is why, in the United States and especially in Washington, political engagement onstage would be an afterthought. In ""American Playwriting and the Anti-Political Prejudice,"" I found that we habitually block political works from the stage, particularly as producers (the ultimate gatekeepers), but also as scholars and journalists. Audiences seldom get a vote.    A dress rehearsal for ""The Great Game: Afghanistan,"" from London's Tricycle Theatre at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in 2010. (Astrid Riecken)  Our stages see increasingly challenging work on identity, gender and ethnicity, and that's only likely to intensify: Young Jean Lee's ""Straight White Men"" at Studio is already riveting viewing in the new cultural context. But turn to Britain for public topics you seldom see plumbed here: When the Shakespeare Theatre Company presented the three-night ""The Great Game: Afghanistan"" -- a historically grounded deep dive par excellence -- it came from London's Tricycle Theatre. As Britain's National Health Service was recently reorganized and potentially undermined, Stella Feehily penned a well-received agitprop drama called ""This May Hurt a Bit."" When the world economy collapsed in 2008, London's National Theatre commissioned longtime issues dramatist David Hare to write. He interviewed bankers and economists, and by October 2009 the result was in front of audiences (""The Power of Yes""). The stage can be a fast-moving, widely variable reflection of ideas in the air and conditions on the ground. That's not exactly our habit, and finance might be a particular theatrical third rail.  Lucy Prebble's dense and dazzling anatomy of a financial collapse, ""Enron,"" was shot down at the border in 2010 by the New York Times, after triumphing in London. Even Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatists such as Bruce Norris (""Clybourne Park"") and Ayad Akhtar (""Disgraced"") can triumph with works on identity but have a hard time selling plays about money. Still unseen in the District: Norris's 2013 history-of-capitalism ""The Low Road"" and Akhtar's 2014 stock market-and-terrorism ""The Invisible Hand."" Hare's 1993 ""Absence of War"" might be instructive, too. It's an insider campaign drama, a lightly fictionalized account of Hare's period embedded with Neil Kinnock's failed 1992 campaign for prime minister -- a come-from-ahead liberal defeat by a whip-smart, perplexingly flawed candidate. The campaign dodged policy as the candidate's contentious team got vexed about its messaging. It now seems analogous to Hillary Clinton's loss. This is not to suggest that Washington's theaters are socially oblivious. But there is a variety of topics to be braved -- and perhaps the tide is turning. Increasingly, Arena Stage is voting yes on politics, and last winter's ""Sweat,"" from Lynn Nottage, now looks like it placed its finger exactly on the sore spot in scrutinizing a Rust Belt Pennsylvania town scapegoating race as jobs went scarce. Arena's upcoming slate includes Lisa Loomer's ""Roe,"" a drama about the ultimate hot-button Supreme Court case; it will run as Trump is inaugurated and probably putting forth his first high court nominee. Jacqueline Lawton's ""Intelligence,"" about CIA agent Valerie Plame's blown cover, will arrive at Arena at about the same time.    Ayad Akhtar's ""Disgraced"" explosively probed modern Muslin-American identity at Arena Stage this year. (C. Stanley Photography)  Other recent examples: Mike Daisey's ""The Trump Card"" and Guillermo Calderon's ""Kiss"" (a calculatedly distanced look at Syrian conditions) at Woolly, where artistic director Howard Shalwitz has just written a post-election note declaring, ""The role of art in the coming struggle is blazingly clear."" ""I Call My Brothers,"" Jonas Hassan Khemiri's fevered account (at Forum Theatre) of a Muslim American man's paranoia as a bomb goes off in his city. Ari Roth's vision of a social justice theater has expanded since opening Mosaic Theater Company after being fired for controversial Middle East plays at Theater J. The Public Theater's production of Richard Nelson's three-play cycle ""The Gabriels"" -- three intimate dramas watching an Upstate New York family prepare meals on politically significant dates, including Nov. 8 -- arrives at the Kennedy Center in January. Still, the feeling of voiceless-ness that led to ""Theatrical Selections"" is telling, and curable. After 9/11, a highbrow theater journal asked artists how they might respond, much as the call is going out now among artists about what's next as Trumpland comes to Washington. After 9/11, Anna Deavere Smith pointedly replied that the question of how to use the stage thoughtfully and actively needs to be asked before crises and surprises, not after. We are the stories we tell. "

Trump will nominate the senator to be his attorney general. (John Bazemore/AP)   THE BIG IDEA: The metaphor of the moment is that Donald Trump is the dog that caught up with the car. Multiple members of his own transition team have used this analogy when explaining their scramble to catch up. The truth is that almost no one on his own team thought he could win. They planned, or didn't plan, accordingly. A more apt reference, especially after Trump's inauguration, might be the Pottery Barn Rule. Colin Powell popularized this doctrine in the foreign policy context. The then-secretary of state warned George W. Bush about the consequences of invading Iraq: ""You are going to be the proud owner of 25 million people. You will own all their hopes, aspirations, and problems. You'll own it all."" As Bob Woodward recounted in a 2004 book, ""Privately, Powell and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage called this the Pottery Barn rule: You break it, you own it."" -- Trump and the congressional Republicans who have chosen to make their bed with him are responsible for what happens from now on. There is now no one to blame if they can't pass budgets, avoid shutdowns, deal with sequestration, replace Obamacare, destroy ISIS or reverse the continuing loss of manufacturing jobs. If climate change gets worse, it's on them. If Syria continues its downward spiral, it's on them. If more countries acquire nuclear weapons, it's on them. It may be totally unfair, but that's the way our system works.    Barack Obama waves as he boards Air Force One in Berlin a few moments ago. (Clemens Bilanc/AFP/Getty Images)   -- This is a rude awakening that faces every president, regardless of party, but it will be especially acute for someone who has demonstrated a preternatural unwillingness to take personal responsibility for anything.  Barack Obama constantly blamed Bush and the Republicans for the lingering effects of the Great Recession, but by the 2010 midterms - just two years after the greatest economic calamity in 80 years - most voters were sick and tired of what they saw as excuses. Fairly or not, they punished Democrats for their pain. Congressional Republicans made a strategic decision not to help Obama; it paid political dividends but corroded public faith in the institutions of government. Now congressional Democrats are faced with a similar choice. -- Republicans are about to have unified control of government for the first time since 2006, which was three years before the birth of the tea party movement. The GOP has changed dramatically during the intervening decade, lurching rightward from being for smaller government toward being anti-government. Then the party's rank-and-file nominated someone for president who is simultaneously promising the biggest tax cuts ever, a massive increase in defense spending and steadfast opposition to any entitlement reform. The last time Republicans had unified control of the government, the American people were so happy with how it went that they made San Francisco liberal Nancy Pelosi the Speaker of the House and a community activist turned law professor named Barack Hussein Obama the first black president. Both developments were unthinkable to many at this juncture in 2004. Trump's rise is, at least to some degree, a belated over-correction to the overreach of Pelosi, Obama and Harry Reid during their two years with super-majorities.    John Barrasso, Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn leave a meeting of Senate Republicans. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)   -- The GOP now has a lot on its plate for the first 100 days. Many Republicans in the Capitol are talking about trying to use reconciliation to repeal Obamacare in January. Trump has suggested his top priority will be an infrastructure spending package. Trump's appointees need to get confirmed. Attorney General-designee Jeff Sessions, whose nomination to a federal judgeship was blocked in the 1980s by a bipartisan group of senators because of alleged racist comments he had made as U.S. attorney, will not be able to coast through the Judiciary Committee, despite the fact he is a member. (In fact, that actually hurts his prospects - because he cannot vote for himself.) Much more importantly, because it will shape the country for a generation, the president-elect must quickly decide on a Supreme Court pick. A bunch of the names on his list of 21 could face heavy resistance. Yesterday Trump made his first stamp on Congress as House Republicans bowed to his wishes and announced plans to extend government funding through March, despite warnings from top GOP senators that such a short-term spending strategy will wreak havoc on the first several months of his presidency. In addition to the big-ticket items, Trump will now need to negotiate a bill to fund the government. This could wind up wasting a lot of time and blunting any early momentum he might get. Politically-savvy Republican lawmakers on the Hill are baffled by the decision to pass only a three-month C.R., instead of clearing the deck. ""It'll only get harder,"" said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) ""You'll have a smaller margin of error in the Senate, and we're not likely to get any Democratic cooperation in the new year."" Trump allies argue that they'll have more leverage without needing to deal with Obama, and they bet that Democrats will never allow a shutdown. But, here again, they will own the outcome of the spending fight. (Kelsey Snell and Mike DeBonis have more on the short-sighted strategy.)    George W. Bush and Dick Cheney talk last December during a ceremony at the Capitol. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)   -- Will deficits matter to this unified Republican government? The GOP has a long history of only caring about the national debt during election years and when they are out of power. Fiscal discipline has tended to go out the window when they're the ones who get to write the checks. Ronald ""Reagan proved deficits don't matter,"" Dick Cheney reportedly said in 2002 as he pushed for a second round of Bush tax cuts at the same time that the government was ramping up expenditures for the war on terror, homeland security and Iraq. When Reagan took office, the size of the national debt was $1.1 trillion. When he left, it was $2.9 trillion. The debt increased by more than $5 trillion during Bush 43's presidency. -- Nothing in Trump's business record, which includes six bankruptcies, suggests he will be a deficit hawk. If Trump was still a Democrat, which he was the last time Republicans ran Washington, many GOP lawmakers would loudly worry about this. But we're already seeing some of the likeliest conservative dissidents fall in line. -- The influence and intellectual integrity of conservative outside groups will be tested as never before in the coming months, from the Koch political network to Heritage Action and the Club for Growth. The GOP relentlessly attacked Obama's ""stimulus"" in 2009, turning it into a dirty word, but it looks like the party is about to get behind the same sort of massive infrastructure spending. There is also a push by Republican members in the House to bring back earmarks, though it has been put off for now. -- Besides winning, what are Trump's core convictions? Every leak out of Trump Tower only bolsters the narrative that Trump lacks a cohesive worldview or a coherent ideology. As Herbert Hoover once said of FDR, Trump is a chameleon in plaid. He ran against Common Core; now he's considering two Common Core cheerleaders for Education secretary. He ran against interventionism, but now he's mulling John Bolton for State. He spent months lacing into Mitt Romney as the symbol of a broken GOP; now his team is floating that the 2012 nominee could be asked to run Foggy Bottom. Trump promised to drain the swamp; now he's relying on swamp creatures to show him how.     Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.

Mike Flynn as his White House national security adviser, elevating his controversial surrogate with a record of incendiary statements about Muslims to one of the most powerful positions in the government. (Philip Rucker, Karen DeYoung and David Nakamura) Greg Miller turns a quick profile: ""As a decorated military intelligence officer and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn has deep experience to draw upon in the role. But Flynn has also shown an erratic streak since leaving government that is likely to make his elevation disconcerting even to the flag officers and senior intelligence officials who once considered him a peer. Flynn stunned former colleagues when he traveled to Moscow last year to appear alongside Vladimir Putin at a lavish gala for the Kremlin-run propaganda channel RT. ... He was forced out of his job as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 over concerns about his leadership style. ... A longtime Democrat and native of Rhode Island who grew up in a military family, Flynn has articulated an increasingly dark vision of the direction of the United States, [warning] that it is failing to adequately address the threat posed by what he calls a 'diseased component' of Islam. His behavior has drawn ire of former colleagues and superiors, including retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who formerly tapped Flynn as his top intelligence officer."" In February, Flynn tweeted a YouTube video link with this message:  Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions... https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU-- General Flynn (@GenFlynn) February 27, 2016   -- Flynn's son, who works as the ""chief of staff"" for his consulting business, regularly shares conspiracy theories, expletive-filled posts and racially insensitive sentiments on social media. ""[The younger] Flynn frequently shares unfounded conspiracy theories, like ones claiming Hillary Clinton and President Obama would be tried for treason if Trump is elected,"" per CNN's Andrew Kaczynski and Nathan McDermott. ""He also posted an unfounded story claiming hackers would release a video of Bill Clinton raping a teenage girl. Flynn tweeted multiple times unfounded claims about Sen. Marco Rubio's 'coke house, gayish dance troupe, and foam parties.' On Twitter, the younger Flynn frequently re-tweets Paul Watson, editor for the conspiracy website InfoWars, sometimes using the hashtag '#infowars' himself."" -- Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, blasted the Flynn pick in a lengthy statement at 10:05 p.m.: ""I am deeply concerned about (Flynn's) views on Russia, which over the last twelve months have demonstrated the same fondness for the autocratic and belligerent Kremlin which animate President-elect Trump's praise of Putin. The incoming President would be better served by someone with a healthy skepticism about Russian intentions, and willing to be guided by the unequivocal intelligence we have of Russian's malignant policies towards the U.S. and our allies. ... General Flynn's uncritical acceptance of the Turkish crackdown on dissent, and his call for the extradition of the cleric Gulen without seeing any evidence of complicity in the aborted coup is also worrying. While Turkey is an important NATO ally, we cannot blind ourselves to its increasingly authoritarian character and the bonds it has been forming with Russia and Iran."" Expect more statements like this to come from other Democrats in the coming hours... -- Many of the best and brightest candidates for sub-cabinet positions - assistant secretaries, deputy assistants, etc. - have been taking a wait-and-see approach on Trump. Flynn's pick will discourage some cream-of-the-crop folks from agreeing to serve in the president-elect's national security apparatus. ""Everyone is having this exact same conversation,"" said Daniel Twining, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States who advised John McCain on foreign policy. ""Everyone is saying, 'What are you going to do?'"" ""For some who have tried to change an administration from the inside, the advice to fellow conservatives is far bleaker and their sense of the dilemma their colleagues are facing is dire,"" Annie Linskey reports in the Boston Globe. ""It's not good,"" said Alberto Mora, a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. ""Trump's policies, positions, and character and behavior are such that it just pushed away individuals who would otherwise be eager to participate in a Republican administration."" Mora, who worked in both Bush administrations, has a unique insight into the limits of what one civil servant can do: As general counsel of the Navy he led an effort to prevent legal codification of George W. Bush's policies on enhanced interrogation procedures. ""You need to be comfortable that the president won't willfully order you to do something unlawful,"" said Mora, who received a Profile in Courage Award for his efforts combating torture.

""I'm disappointed ... but I have a job to do here that in some ways may have gotten more important,"" he told our Jenna Portnoy, with bluegrass music playing in the background.  -- Kaine had never lost an election before, and he was convinced they'd win last week when he saw the returns from the conservative Richmond suburb of Chesterfield, where Trump had a relatively weak showing. It hadn't occurred to him that they could win the popular vote by more than 1 million votes and still lose the election. He really didn't want to delve into why he lost, but he noted that Hillary ran into head winds trying to be the first female president. He also stressed that only two Democratic presidents were elected following a two-term Democratic presidency -- Martin Van Buren and Harry Truman. -- Kaine said he understands why the daily protests continue around the country: ""I view it as people are afraid, and I think they have reason to be afraid,"" he said, promising to battle the ""normalization"" of bigotry that he sees in the appointment of Steve Bannon.

(Steve Marcus/Reuters)   READING THE TEA LEAVES FROM TRUMP TOWER: -- Trump is planning to meet this weekend with Mitt Romney to discuss his transition operation and a potential role as secretary of state, David Nakamura, Jerry Markon and Karen DeYoung report. Trump's stunning outreach to one of his most outspoken critics in the presidential race could help bridge the divide between Trump's advisers and the GOP establishment, and it sends a signal to foreign capitals that the president-elect is at least interested in a more conventional figure to serve as his top diplomat. -- South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, also a contender for the role, met with Trump in New York yesterday. Calling Haley ""unbelievably talented,"" transition spokesman Sean Spicer suggested the team would be willing to overlook her outspoken criticism of Trump in the Republican primaries. ""Donald Trump right now isn't looking to figure out who supported him and who didn't,"" Spicer said in a CNN interview. ""As long as they are committed to bringing change to Washington and making this country better, then they can be part of this team."" -- ""Picking Romney [or Haley] would show something that was sorely lacking in Trump the candidate: magnanimity,"" Chris Cillizza writes. ""A willingness to pick the person he thinks is best for the job, not just someone who was unfailingly loyal to him during the campaign. Someone who might challenge his assumptions or opinions from time to time. An equal, not a lackey. Again, this would, largely, run counter to how Trump ran his presidential campaign. But that would also make picking Romney all the more powerful a symbol."" -- Retired Army Gen.

James S. Simpson, who ran New Jersey's Department of Transportation under Chris Christie and calls himself a 'transportation nut,' may get a look-see, but after Christie was banished from Trump's inner-circle, Simpson may fall from favor.

The president-elect -- who has long been entranced by celebrities and cleared his schedule to meet them -- campaigned on the promise to do things differently than presidents before him. [But] the presence of so many nontraditional visitors and advisers raises a question: Is this really the best use of the president-elect's time, especially when his transition team has just undergone a leadership purge and is only now reaching out to many major federal agencies?

The New York Times' Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Maggie Haberman report that Trump's son-in-law has spoken to a lawyer about the possibility of joining the Trump administration, a move that could violate federal anti-nepotism laws and risk legal challenges and political backlash. Trump is reportedly urging his son-in-law to join him in the White House, a sentiment that is shared by both Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus. ""But the prospect that Mr. Kushner might end up in the West Wing remained a concern to some people close to the president-elect, who said he would instantly become a target for media and legal attacks if he took the unorthodox step ... Mr. Kushner has consulted with at least one lawyer and believes that by forgoing a salary and putting his investment fund, his real estate holdings and The New York Observer into a blind trust, he would not be bound by federal nepotism rules."" -- Both Ivanka and Kushner sat in with Donald during his 90-minute meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe yesterday.

Later, when I asked Obama how things had really gone, he smiled thinly and said, 'I think I can't characterize it without ...' Then he stopped himself and said that he would tell me, 'at some point over a beer--off the record.' Those closest to Obama at the White House say that he copes by quietly, sarcastically deflating the attacks--like letting the air out of a balloon slowly, one said, the better not to make too much noise. He never loses his capacity to be the scholar of his own predicament, a gently quizzical ethnographer of his own country, of its best and worst qualities. In private, Michelle Obama gives clearer voice to the frustrations, and, not least, to a concern about the racism that is apparent to them both. There is no denying the depths of Obama's humbling. He fully grasps the nature of the bigotry and the nihilism that Trump has espoused in the name of working-class empowerment..."" ""Obama's way is to keep cool while insisting on, and embodying, a faith in institutions,"" Remnick explains. ""'This is not the apocalypse,' Obama said. History does not move in straight lines; sometimes it goes sideways, sometimes it goes backward. A couple of days later, when I asked the President about that consolation, he offered this: 'I don't believe in apocalyptic--until the apocalypse comes.

Though he struck an upbeat tone at times, saying he remains ""optimistic"" about Trump's presidency, he also drew a stark picture of a world without even-handed U.S. leadership -- a world in which a divided United States would lose its way and disengage. The United States is ""the voice that insists on rules and norms governing international affairs, the voice that helps to steer the world away from war wherever possible; that's our voice more often than not,"" Obama said. ""And we're not always successful, but if that voice is absent or divided, we will live in a meaner, harsher and more troubled world.""

Exit polls found that Hispanic voters who backed Mr. Trump tended to have higher incomes--he won 38% of those with family income above $100,000--and they tended to view terrorism and foreign policy, rather than the economy, as top issues. Mr. Trump also won an outright majority of Hispanics who call themselves conservative. The results also appear to sap some force, at least for now, from the argument that Republicans must support liberalized immigration laws to win a national election. Democrats say the trends still favor them and that over time, the GOP will pay a price with Hispanic voters. 'Don't bask in your glory and your current victory,' said Rep. Luis Gutierrez. 'We are a young community ... [young Latinos] are going to remember who victimized their parents.'"" -- ""National Security Agency Said to Use Manhattan Tower as Listening Post,"" by Jim Dwyer: ""From a sidewalk in Lower Manhattan, the building at 33 Thomas Street, known as the Long Lines Building, looks like nothing less than a monument to the prize of privacy. With not a window in its walls from the ground up to its height of 550 feet, 33 Thomas looms over Church Street with an architectural blank face. Nothing about it resembles a place of human habitation, and in fact it was built for machines: An AT&T subsidiary commissioned the tower to house long-distance phone lines. Completed in 1974, it was fortified to withstand a nuclear attack on New York, and the architect made plans to include enough food, water and generator fuel to sustain 1,500 people for two weeks during a catastrophic loss of power to the city. Now, an investigative article in The Intercept and an accompanying 10-minute documentary film ... say the building appears to have served another purpose: as a listening post code-named Titanpointe by the National Security Agency.""     HOT ON THE LEFT ""Private Prison Companies Ready to Cash In on Throwing Out Immigrants,"" from The Daily Beast: ""When the children were released from the privately run immigration detention facility in Karnes City, Texas, they were immediately taken to the emergency room with pneumonia. Over the past few months, several children who fled from violence in South and Central America with their mothers have been hospitalized after leaving the facility run by GEO Group, a private prison company that saw its stocks jump following Election Day. The children's health problems were the result of poor medical care inside what is essentially a prison for mothers and their children ... And with [Trump] now president-elect, the Karnes City facility and a dozen more like it across the country are preparing to fill even more beds with immigrants and refugees. GEO Group and another private prison company ... are also preparing for more large, lucrative contracts with the federal government to run the detention centers.""     HOT ON THE RIGHT ""Michael Brown's Father: [Black Lives Matter] Tried To Profit Off My Son's Death,"" from the Daily Caller: ""Some members of the Black Lives Matter movement tried to profit off the death of Michael Brown, according to his father. ... While some members of the Black Lives Matter movement had good intentions, Brown Sr. said that he saw some of them try to gain from his son's death. Brown Sr. also criticized the riots, saying that they took the focus off of the loss he and the community felt after losing Brown.""
