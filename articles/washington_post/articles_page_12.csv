Brought out of retirement by Putin to lead Russia's future strategy on doping, 81-year-old Vitaly Smirnov is being called on to use his contacts from five decades in Olympic politics to lobby for Russian interests and play down the accusations of state-sponsored cheating. Even as Smirnov tries to build bridges with the IOC and World Anti-Doping Agency, and plans to address WADA's board on Sunday, Smirnov vehemently denies that the Russian government ran an industrial-scale doping program and cover-up, including at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.  ""What has happened is a glitch. It doesn't have roots in any kind of practice which was happening over a long period of time,"" Smirnov, a former Soviet minister who spent 44 years as an International Olympic Committee member, told The Associated Press in an interview in his spacious office at the Russian Olympic Committee. ""There was no organized doping system on the state level. We believe that the participants in this were individuals, who were pursuing their own goals."" Putin's love of sports as a judo black belt and recreational hockey player means the Russian government couldn't have sponsored an East German-style doping scheme, Smirnov said.  ""I've known our president for 25 years. I got to know him when we were preparing the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg in 1994. I know him still. I know he's an athlete,"" Smirnov says he told Richard McLaren, the Canadian lawyer who produced the WADA report accusing Russian officials of complicity. ""And as an athlete and head of state, it's incompatible."" Among those named in McLaren's report in July were Deputy Sports Minister Yuri Nagornykh and the ministry's anti-doping adviser, Nataliya Zhelanova, both of whom are facing investigations from the Russian authorities and have since left their jobs. Even if officials like Nagornykh and Zhelanova are found to have been complicit, they should be seen as bad apples rather than part of a government conspiracy, Smirnov argues.  ""Certain officials ... it doesn't mean the whole system, the whole ministry was taking part,"" he said. The second part of McLaren's report is due out next month and could further tarnish the legacy of the Sochi Games. Smirnov has been in contact with McLaren and WADA President Craig Reedie. However, Smirnov is scathing in his condemnation for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory who turned star witness for WADA. Rodchenkov said he was involved in state-backed doping for years, providing doping substances to athletes and helping swap dirty samples for clean ones at the Sochi Games. Now living in the United States, Rochenkov is facing an investigation by Russian authorities over the destruction of doping samples. Smirnov suggests Rodchenkov was motivated by money, not Russian state prestige.  ""If you take the case of Rodchenkov, there's pure criminality. They were just, over the course of a fairly long period of time, falsifying results and getting money for that,"" Smirnov said, later adding: ""I am counting on objectivity in this whole case. The McLaren report is sadly built on the evidence of just one man. That man is facing a criminal case and an investigation is under way."" Formally, Smirnov's role is as head of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, a body set up at Putin's suggestion and backed by the Russian Olympic Committee to lead the charge against what the Russian government perceives as unfair accusations. Putin didn't formally appoint Smirnov, but nominated him on state TV as a man with an ""absolutely unimpeachable reputation."" He was swiftly approved. The commission, which last met in October, includes numerous sports officials but also doctors, a state TV executive and even a concert pianist, though none of the commission's members are anti-doping scientists.  ""Our commission is absolutely independent. The commission contains people, many of whom have no connection to sport at all, but carry a lot of weight in society,"" Smirnov said, defending the participation of pianist Denis Matsuev. ""He's not just there because he can play 47 piano concertos, but because he loves sport"" and was invited to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics because of his musical skill, Smirnov added, though the commission also works with two experts from Australia and Lithuania sent by WADA to Russia to help with reforms. Smirnov is eager to repair relations with the IOC and WADA after a year of fierce rhetoric on all sides, and refers to former WADA president Dick Pound, author of last year's first report into Russian doping, as ""my old friend."" In a recent conversation with Reedie, Smirnov offered to appoint a foreigner to Rodchenkov's old job as head of the Moscow lab to reactivate its ""colossal"" capacity of 20,000 tests a year. Smirnov's overall message is clear though -- Russia is not a country of drug cheats.  ""In the spirit of our people there is nothing about trying to deceive, to find a dishonest shortcut,"" he said.

Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, turning to a pair of staunch conservatives as he begins to fill out his Cabinet. Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism and has cast Islam as a ""political ideology"" and driver of extremism. Sessions and Flynn were ardent Trump supporters during the campaign, and their promotions were seen in part as a reward for their loyalty. The selections form the first outlines of Trump's Cabinet and national security teams. Given his lack of governing experience and vague policy proposals during the campaign, his selection of advisers is being scrutinized both in the U.S. and abroad. Trump's initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam's role in stoking extremism. Sessions, who is best known for his hard-line immigration views, has questioned whether terror suspects should benefit from the rights available in U.S. courts. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders are ""potentially complicit"" in attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam. ___ Senate hearing for Sessions likely to revisit racial issue WASHINGTON -- The Senate confirmation hearing of Sen. Jeff Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, is likely to rehash racially charged allegations that derailed his efforts to become a federal judge and made him a symbol of black-voter intimidation under the Reagan administration. The expected focus on Sessions' record on race, policing and immigration comes as the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has surged in prominence under the Obama administration. If confirmed, Sessions would have broad latitude to define how federal prosecutors across the country wield their powers and make changes to the Justice Department's priorities. Lawmakers and advocates expressed concern Friday that Sessions could sideline or undo the Obama administration's civil rights efforts, which have included investigations of police departments for unconstitutional practices and lawsuits meant to protect the rights of transgender individuals and black voters.  ""Given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say,"" incoming Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said he strongly supported Sessions, who he said ""has worked tirelessly to safeguard the public and to improve the lives of Americans from all walks of life."" ___ Trump agrees to $25M settlement to resolve Trump U. lawsuits SAN DIEGO -- President-elect Donald Trump agreed Friday to pay $25 million to settle lawsuits against his now-defunct Trump University for real estate investors, averting a trial in a potentially embarrassing case that he had vowed during the campaign to keep fighting. The agreement came 10 days before jury selection was scheduled to begin in one of three cases. The complaints accused Trump University, which wasn't an accredited school, of defrauding students who paid up to $35,000 a year to enroll in programs that promised to share Trump's real estate secrets. About 7,000 students would be eligible for refunds if U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel approves the proposed settlement. Under the terms, Trump admitted no wrongdoing in two class-action lawsuits in San Diego and a civil suit brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The settlement lifts what would probably have been a major headache for Trump as he works to fill key executive branch positions and get acquainted with foreign leaders. The San Diego trial, on a case filed in 2010, was expected to last several weeks, guaranteeing daily news coverage of a controversy that dogged him during the campaign. Trump's political rivals seized on the lawsuits to try to portray him as dishonest and deceitful. Trump brought more attention to them by repeatedly assailing Curiel, who oversaw the San Diego cases. Trump suggested the Indiana-born judge's Mexican heritage exposed a bias. ___ Obama blocks new oil, gas drilling in Arctic Ocean WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is blocking new oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean, handing a victory to environmentalists who say industrial activity in the icy waters will harm whales, walruses and other wildlife and exacerbate global warming. A five-year offshore drilling plan announced on Friday blocks the planned sale of new oil and gas drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas north of Alaska. The plan allows drilling to go forward in Alaska's Cook Inlet southwest of Anchorage. The blueprint for drilling from 2017 to 2022 can be rewritten by President-elect Donald Trump, in a process that could take months or years. Besides Cook Inlet, the plan also allows drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, long the center of U.S. offshore oil production. Ten of the 11 lease sales proposed in the five-year plan are in the Gulf, mostly off the coasts of Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Alabama. Confirming a decision announced this spring, the five-year plan also bars drilling in the Atlantic Ocean. ___ UN climate talks end with pleas for Trump to join fight MARRAKECH, Morocco -- The first U.N. climate conference after the landmark Paris Agreement closed Friday with delegates appealing to Donald Trump to join the battle against global warming and inviting him to see its impacts in Pacific islands. Suddenly faced with the possibility that the U.S. could withdraw from the emissions pact adopted in Paris last year, countries rallied in support of the deal and said they would forge ahead no matter what. Moroccan Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, the host of the two-week talks in Marrakech, said the conference's ""message to the new American president is simply to say, 'We count on your pragmatism and your spirit of commitment.'"" Trump said during his campaign that he would ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement and withdraw American tax dollars from U.N. global warming programs. More than 190 countries, including the United States, pledged in the deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for rising temperatures and sea levels, worsening droughts and heat waves. ___ Unlikely apprentice: Obama coaches Trump to be world leader BERLIN -- It's the last thing President Barack Obama ever expected he'd be doing in his final months in office: Coaching Donald Trump on how to be a world leader. As the president-elect holes up in his skyscraper, Obama is giving Trump policy advice, style tips and gentle nudges to let the fervor of the campaign give way to the sobriety of the Oval Office. And as Obama completes his last world tour, he's been thrust into the unexpected role of Trump translator to anxious U.S. allies. Standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, Obama said Trump would quickly see that a president's responsibilities can't be treated casually and that diverse countries can only be governed by ""listening and reaching out.""  ""It is my hope that that is what will happen,"" Obama said. ""And I'm going to do everything I can over the next two months to help assure that that happens."" Though the outgoing president made clear his profound disdain for Trump throughout the campaign, perhaps no one is better positioned than Obama to get him up to speed in a matter of weeks. ___ Democrat's lead widens in North Carolina governor's race RALEIGH, N.C. -- Hardly anyone in North Carolina is willing to guess when their excruciatingly close governor's race will be resolved. A Friday deadline came and went with Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper's unofficial advantage growing to about 6,600 votes over Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, from nearly 4.7 million cast. McCrory is fighting for his political life in a battleground state that Donald Trump and Republican Sen. Richard Burr won by relatively comfortable margins. After endless legal battles over how, when and where people can vote, they're fighting now over whether to count 60,000 provisional ballots and thousands more absentee ballots that have remained sealed since Election Day. Still more delays are in store as McCrory's campaign supports allegations of hard-knuckled fraud lodged by voters in more than half the state's 100 counties. If Cooper's margin remains below 10,000 votes, McCrory can call for a statewide recount, and with the possibility of other legal challenges and conceivably even legislative intervention to decide a contested result, few outside Cooper's campaign are ready to put a date on the naming of the next governor. ___ Venezuelan 1st lady's 2 nephews found guilty in cocaine case NEW YORK -- Two nephews of Venezuela's first lady who were charged with conspiring to send drugs to the United States were convicted on Friday by a jury that found evidence of the crime even though the government's star witness came across to at least one juror as ""slime."" The Manhattan federal court jury returned its verdict against Efrain Campo, 30, and his cousin Francisco Flores, 31, after less than a day of deliberations. The nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores were charged with conspiring last year to import more than 1,700 pounds of cocaine into the United States. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Flores and Campo thought they'd make millions of dollars with the drug scheme.  ""What they ended up with is a conviction in an American court and the prospect of years in federal prison,"" he said. Lawyers for Campo and Flores argued no drugs traded hands and the men never intended to deliver any. They blamed a flawed Drug Enforcement Administration-led probe that relied on a longtime informant who was using and dealing cocaine as he helped build the case. ___ Kansas police seek public help in search for missing newborn KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Police assisted by the FBI pressed an urgent appeal for public help Friday in finding a Kansas newborn a day after her mother was shot to death in her home, insisting the week-old girl was imperiled during a disappearance the police chief considered vexing. Wichita, Kansas, police trying to locate Sofia Victoria Gonzalez Abarca, who went missing Thursday, said tips of special interest to investigators would be any reports about someone suddenly passing off an infant as their own, or buying large quantities of baby formula or clothing. Police Chief Gordon Ramsay said leads as of late Friday afternoon were proving elusive in what he called ""a very sad and tragic case."" Authorities as of Friday evening had not issued an Amber Alert seeking the public's help in the search because investigators haven't identified a suspect -- a criteria for issuing such an advisory.  ""We have no information. That's why I'm here, just pleading for information,"" Ramsay said. ""We're pleading with the community, asking everybody to help us find Baby Sofia. There's no doubt she is missing and in danger."" Police said Laura Abarca-Nogueda's live-in boyfriend returned home from work Thursday and found his 27-year-old girlfriend's body, and their newborn daughter missing. ___ UN agency lifts Zika emergency, prepares for long-term fight GENEVA -- Acknowledging Zika is ""here to stay,"" the United Nations health agency on Friday lifted a 9-month-old emergency declaration and prepared for a longer-term response to the mosquito-borne virus that can result in severe neurological defects in newborns whose mothers were infected. The World Health Organization was quick to note that the move does not mean the agency is downgrading the threat of the virus that has spread across Latin America, the Caribbean and elsewhere. Nearly 30 countries have reported birth defects linked to Zika, with over 2,100 cases of nervous-system malformations reported in Brazil alone. The officials also emphasized that the now-lifted ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" was declared in February, when Zika clusters were appearing and a sharp increase in research was needed -- with the looming Rio Olympics in mind. WHO said the emergency measures had led the world to an ""urgent and coordinated response."" But the virus has continued to spread. The agency acknowledged ""many aspects of this disease and associated consequences still remain to be understood, but this can best be done through sustained research.""  ""It is a significant and enduring public health challenge, but it no longer represents an emergency,"" Dr. David Heymann, who heads the WHO emergency committee on Zika, said after the panel met for the fifth time this year. ""There was no downgrading of this."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Trump's outreach to Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, could help bridge the divide between the president-elect's advisers and the GOP establishment, and send a signal to foreign capitals that Trump is interested in a more conventional figure as the nation's top diplomat. Late Thursday night, Trump offered the national security adviser post to retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, according to a person close to the transition team. Also Thursday, Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, said in an interview with McClatchy News Service that he would not have an official role in Trump's administration, despite having previously been identified as a potential secretary of state. Gingrich confirmed the report in an interview with The Washington Post.  ""I think it's good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Mr. Romney,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who also is being considered for Trump's Cabinet, told reporters outside Trump Tower in New York. ""He's meeting with a lot of talented people that he needs good relationships with. I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things, but he'll be one of those I'm sure that's reviewed, and Mr. Trump will make that decision.""     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet  The disclosure of their meeting came as something of a surprise. Romney had been one of the earliest and most vocal critics of Trump among the GOP leadership, ripping the real estate mogul last March after squelching speculation that he would mount a late primary challenge to Trump. ""If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished,"" Romney said, adding that ""dishonesty is Trump's hallmark."" Romney also criticized Trump for racially charged campaign rhetoric, prompting Trump to write on Twitter that ""Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist -- but I am least racist person there is."" Romney took a more tempered tone after Trump's general election triumph last week, and called him to offer his congratulations. The news came as Trump's transition to power kicked into higher gear. Transition officials were expected to fan out across federal agencies, and Trump prepared for an important meeting with Japan's prime minister. The 5 p.m. session with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump's first with a foreign leader since the election, has raised questions among some in Washington's foreign policy community because Trump has apparently not been briefed by the State Department. Officials said Wednesday that the transition team has not reached out to State. A former State Department official said such a meeting with a foreign leader would normally be preceded by numerous briefings from key diplomats, which is considered especially important here because the Japanese are concerned about comments Trump made on the campaign trail. The president-elect repeatedly said that Japan should pay more for its own defense and be less reliant on the United States.

Trump ""would want an intelligence briefing. You'd probably want to get briefed on what's what happening in the region.''  But Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Thursday that the session at Trump Tower, which Vice President-elect Mike Pence will attend, will be ""much less formal"" than in the future because Trump has yet to assume office. ""We are very sensitive to the fact that President Obama is still in office for the next two months,'' Conway said.  As Trump remained ensconced with close aides in his Manhattan office tower, his transition team appeared to signal Thursday that Sessions is a leading candidate to be attorney general.  ""The President-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Senator Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama's Attorney General and U.S. Attorney,'' the team said in a statement about Trump's meeting with Sesisons on Wednesday. While the statement cautioned that ""nothing has been finalized,'' Sessions's 14-year stint in those two posts in the 1980s and 1990s would be his primary qualifications to lead the Justice Department. Sessions's former staff director of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brian Benczkowski, is also helping to manage the Justice Department transition for Trump's team, lawyers familiar with the matter have said. Sessions, a top Trump adviser known for his hardline views on immigration, has been a rising force in the transition team and is also under consideration for defense secretary. His nomination for Justice would likely bring a re-examination of his failed nomination by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 to be a federal judge. A bipartisan panel of senators on the Judiciary Committee declined to send his nomination to the Senate floor that year amid allegations that he had made what some characterized as racist remarks. Sessions, who has been a senator for 20 years, has vehemently denied holding any racist views and has said he supported civil rights in Alabama, where he grew up outside of Selma.  [In Trump's Washington, rival powers and whispers in the president's ear]  Trump's meeting with Abe arose from a phone conversation between the Japanese leader and Trump. When Abe called to congratulate Trump shortly after his victory, he mentioned that he would be passing through New York this week and suggested a meeting. ""That would be awesome,"" Trump immediately responded, according to people briefed on the conversation. The two leaders have much to discuss. Trump has vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that Abe recently pushed through his parliament. And the president-elect caused jitters in both Japan and South Korea during the campaign by saying both nations were not paying enough for their defense and that he would make them pay more -- perhaps even all -- of the costs of hosting U.S. military bases. Since Trump's victory, the Japanese government has been taking a wait-and-see approach. ""Trump said various things during his campaign, but I will not presuppose what he will do as president,"" Tomomi Inada, Japan's defense minister, said late last week. She added, however, that Japan is paying its fair share toward base costs. In a new development Thursday, Trump's transition team announced that anyone serving in the new administration would be banned for life from lobbying for any foreign government. Trump had proposed such a ban in an ethics plan he unveiled last month, but it is unclear how the ban would be implemented. There is no current law that imposes a lifetime ban on post-government employment for administration officials, with one exception -- there is a lifetime ban on certain members of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office from representing foreign governments after leaving the agency. The reasoning is to prevent them from essentially ""switching sides"" and using the knowledge they gained while representing U.S. interests to weaken or amend the agreement to the benefit a foreign country.  A lifetime ban like the one Trump proposed raises constitutional issues, and would have to be more narrowly tailored to pass muster in the courts -- for example, if the ban was limited to certain State Department or Defense Department officials whose jobs involved working closely with foreign governments. But a blanket lifetime ban could be unconstitutional. ""Lifetime bans are really problematic from a legal standpoint because it prevents people from making a living,"" said Brett Kappel, a political law and government ethics attorney. ""A lifetime ban on anybody in the administration ever becoming a representative of a foreign government? I don't see how that would hold up in court.""  It is also unclear whether the ban would be implemented by legislation or executive order.  Meanwhile, the pace of the transition appeared to quicken. Offices prepared for Trump's teams in departments and agencies across the government had remained empty Wednesday. But the White House said that it received paperwork, signed Tuesday evening by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, necessary for the teams to move into the department offices and begin to receive briefings from current officials.  The names of people on the ""landing teams"" for the State Department, the Justice Department, the Pentagon and the National Security Council will be submitted to the White House on Thursday and announced Friday, the transition team said Thursday in a conference call with reporters. Economic policy landing teams will be announced Monday, followed by teams devoted to domestic policy and independent federal agencies. The transition released a list of 29 presidents and prime ministers with whom it said Trump and Pence have spoken since the election. And transition communications director Jason Miller said that reports of turmoil within the transition following the ouster of several senior team members in recent days came largely from ""folks on the outside"" and those who feared that Trump was preparing to ""drain the swamp, as he's promised."" Miller declined to speculate on the timing of appointment announcements, saying that ""the president-elect is going to get this right"" and that names would be put forward when Trump was ready. He also denied reports that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, had been instrumental in purging members of the transition seen as close to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whom Pence replaced as the head of the team last week. Miller said Trump met with several advisers and candidates for administration positions Wednesday, including Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), investor Steve Feinberg, Success Academy Charter Schools chief executive Eva Moskowitz and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.). Miller did not elaborate on which people on the list are candidates to join the administration. Price is considered a candidate to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump will meet Thursday with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.), Florida Gov. Rick Scott, former secretary of state Henry Kissinger and retired Gen. Jack Keane, among others, Miller said. Attention continued to be mainly focused on potential national security picks. Trump campaign surrogates said former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani remained at the top of the rumored list for secretary of state, along with former State Department official John Bolton. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who visited Trump on Tuesday in Manhattan, emerged as a defense secretary candidate. Farther down the defense list were George W. Bush national security adviser Stephen V. Hadley and former senator James M. Talent (R-Mo.). Frank Gaffney, a far-right conspiracy theorist who was described in some media reports as a Trump transition adviser and possible pick for a national security job, said Wednesday that he had ""not been contacted by anyone from the team."" His statement followed one by Miller, the transition communication chief, that Gaffney is ""a nice guy, but he's not part of the transition team"" and was not advising it. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), mentioned as a possible CIA director after the leading candidate, former chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan, was among those purged early this week, is a transition adviser but is ""not interested in a post,"" a congressional aide said. Former congressman Pete Hoekstra, also a Michigan Republican and a former committee chairman, said in an interview that he'd told the transition ""if they have a role for me, I'd be more than happy to discuss it with them."" Hoekstra said the Trump team was ""going to expand its outreach, absolutely. But they're going to do it in a methodical way."" Despite intense media scrutiny and swirling rumors in Washington, Trump's timetable was still well within the bounds of his immediate predecessors. Obama did not announce his first Cabinet pick until nearly a month after the 2008 election; he presented his national security team en masse Dec. 1 that year. Confirmation of George W. Bush's 2000 victory did not come until a Supreme Court decision more than a month after the Nov. 7 election.

Najib has kept an iron grip since graft allegations emerged two years ago in the indebted 1MDB state investment fund that he founded. The fund is at the center of investigations in the U.S. and several other countries. Electoral reform group Bersih said Najib must step down to allow an independent investigation into 1MDB.  ""We are taking to the street because there is something rotten in the state of Malaysia. Poor governance and a lack of accountability have resulted in grand corruption in 1MDB,"" said Bersih chairwoman Maria Chin. A ruling party politician, Jamal Mohamad Yunos, plans to lead a counter rally in Kuala Lumpur, prompting fears of a clash between his group dubbed the ""Red Shirts"" and Bersih's ""Yellow Shirt"" supporters. Bersih is supported by many civil groups as well as opposition parties. A rally it organized in August 2015 also demanding Najib's resignation attracted 50,000 people according to police estimates. Bersih said the number was much higher. Police have banned both rallies on Saturday and the government has warned that police will act against any participants. Najib, who was in Japan for a visit, was quoted by the national Bernama news agency as saying that trying to change the government through street protests is unconstitutional and leads to chaos.  ""You cannot indulge in any kind of physical clash at all. ... and that's not the culture that we will want to be accepted as our way of life in Malaysia,"" he said, adding the public should wait for the next election in 2018. Chin said the people have a right to peaceful assembly.  ""We are protesting because keeping silent on corruption and abuse of power is not an option,"" she said. The 1MDB fund has been at the center of investigations in the U.S. and several countries amid allegations of a global embezzlement and money-laundering scheme. Najib started the fund shortly after taking office in 2009 to promote economic development projects, but the fund accumulated billions in debt over the years. The U.S. Justice Department says at least $3.5 billion has been stolen from 1MDB by people close to Najib and initiated action in July to seize $1.3 billion it says was taken from the fund to buy assets in the U.S. The government complaints also say that more than $700 million has landed in the accounts of ""Malaysian Official 1.""

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)  ATHENS -- In an address aimed at a global audience as well as Americans at home, President Obama said Wednesday that ""the current path of globalization needs a course correction,"" even as he argued there was no turning back from an interconnected world. ""In the years and decades ahead, our countries have to make sure that the benefits of an integrated global economy are more broadly shared by more people, and that the negative impacts are squarely addressed,"" he said. The speech, given before a supportive crowd in the newly opened Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, represented the third time in as many days that Obama has sought to grapple with the wave of political discontent that swept Donald Trump into the White House last week and has roiled politics in Europe as well as other regions of the world. On Tuesday night, a few thousand globalization opponents sparred with police during protests in Athens. Paying homage to Greece's role as the birthplace of democracy, the president prompted a laugh when he said it was essential to defend ideals including freedom of speech, religion and ""free and fair elections--because citizens must be able to choose their own leaders, even if your candidate doesn't always win."" Greece, he added, gave humanity ""the most precious of gifts -- the truth, the understanding that as individuals of free will, we have the right and the capacity to govern ourselves.""   [Obama warns against 'a crude sort of nationalism' taking root in the U.S.]   Every country "" travels its own path, every country has its own traditions,"" Obama said. ""But what I also believe, after eight years, is that the basic longing to live with dignity, the fundamental desire to have control of our lives and our future, and to want to be a part of determining the course of our communities and our nations--these yearnings are universal."" But he acknowledged that the kind of ""inclusive economies"" and social tolerance he espouses have come under strain, as the glaring inequality between the world's economic classes has become more evident and different cultures have come into closer proximity with each other. ""Democracy is simplest where everybody thinks alike, looks alike, eats the same food, worships the same God,"" Obama said. ""An inequality that was once tolerated because people didn't know how unequal things were now won't be tolerated because everybody has a cellphone and can see how unequal things are."" ""If people feel that they're losing control of their future, they will push back,"" he warned. ""What an irony it is, at a time when we can reach out to people in the most remote corners of the planet, so many citizens feel disconnected from their own governments."" Obama rose to global prominence by addressing tens of thousands of supporters outside in Berlin, but his speech Wednesday -- which may be his final formal address overseas -- was a more subdued affair. An audience of several hundred invited guests sat inside a hall that resembled an opera house or old-fashioned theater, with rings of balconies marked by ruby-red upholstery. The crowd clapped approvingly at several points during Obama's remarks, but appeared more focused on his approving references to Greece's economic plan and willingness to host refugees than his broader remarks.    President Obama gestures as he speaks at the Niarchos Foundation in Athens on November 16 at the end of his official visit to Greece. (Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images)  In an email last week, George Papandreou, who served as Greece's prime minister from 2009 to 2011, said it was essential that Obama address the issue of how to ""humanize"" and ""democratize"" globalization in order to defuse the ""divisive politics of fear"" that has begun to gain currency around the world. ""Globalization without caring for those who have become poorer, those in the middle class who have lost the prospect of a better life, those who are struggling with new technologies and fear the loss of jobs, those who feel helpless when confronted with rapid economic and technological change,"" Papandreou said, ""or so many that do not see the global community uniting in the fight against climate change, those who feel that the rich are getting richer and all others are getting poorer, simply will not fly."" In his remarks, the president defended the idea of fashioning policies that knit the world more closely together while alleviating some of its economic ills. In a veiled allusion to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan, he said, ""So we can't look backwards for answers, we have to look forward."" But he also said that ""democracy is bigger than any one person,"" and it was important to accept the results of any free election. ""We compete hard in campaigns in America and here in Greece,"" he said. ""But after the election, democracy depends on the peaceful transition of power."" As Obama traveled through the streets of Athens, where schools were closed Wednesday, the city appeared largely deserted. The police imposed restrictions specifically for the president's visit, though the city is also facing protests that will take place Thursday on the anniversary of a 1973 student uprising against Greece's then-military junta, and the assassination of the CIA station chief in Athens a revolutionary group carried out two years later. Still, Obama was determined to do some sightseeing while in Greece. He began his second day here by touring the Acropolis, which was emptied out for the president and his entourage. Only a few stray cats, which regularly wander the ancient ruins, penetrated the security perimeter as the president received a guided tour from Eleni Banou, who directs the Ephorate of Antiquities for Athens at the Greek Ministry of Culture. ""Beautiful,"" the president remarked to himself as he walked through the nearby Acropolis Museum, which was also closed to the public for his visit. The visit amounted to a six-year-old rain check. In 2010, Papandreou invited the president to Greece during a visit to the White House: At the time Obama ""mentioned that he would want to take his two beautiful daughters on donkey rides on a Greek island,"" Papandreou recalled in an email. ""The invitation is still valid."" As Obama landed in Berlin on Wednesday and went into a private dinner with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the two leaders took a joint stand in favor of globalization, free trade and combating climate change. In a joint opinion piece that seemed to push back against the campaign agenda of Donald Trump, they also hailed NATO -- to which Trump as signaled a less than firm commitment -- as vital to maintaining security and stability in the region. In the piece -- excerpted on Wednesday and to be published in full this week by the German weekly Wirtschaftwoche -- the leaders argued that there ""will be no return to a world before globalization."" They argued in favor of pursuing a free trade deal between the United States and the European Union despite Trump campaign pledges that seemed to doom it after years of negotiations. They also stressed the need to push forward with the Paris Agreement on climate change struck last year to cut greenhouse emissions, and which Trump has said he plans to pull out of. ""It gives the world a framework for the common protection of our planet,"" Merkel and Obama wrote."

(Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: The uprising inside the House Democratic caucus is about much more than last week's election results. Yes, Nancy Pelosi poorly managed expectations. At one point, she said that her party could pick up the 30 seats necessary to win the House majority. Even during the home stretch, she mulled a gain of more than 20 seats. She wound up getting only six. But the blow-up that caused the postponement of leadership elections from this Thursday to Nov. 30 - a decision made at the end of a tumultuous, two-hour meeting - is really about young lawmakers who are frustrated by a seniority system that limits their influence, African Americans who don't feel like they have enough sway over Pelosi's strategy and members from the heartland who feel that the dominance of coastal elites in the caucus has made it harder for them to connect with their constituents. -- For years now, there has been a problematic lack of upward mobility for younger Democrats. Consider: The top three Democrats in leadership are 76 (Pelosi), 77 (Steny Hoyer) and 76 (Jim Clyburn). The top three Republican leaders, in contrast, are 46 (Paul Ryan), 51 (Kevin McCarthy) and 51 (Steve Scalise). Pelosi and Hoyer have together led the House Democrats for 14 years now. Ryan, of course, replaced John Boehner just last year after an open election process. (And while rank-and-file Republicans get to vote on who will chair the NRCC, Pelosi picks the leader of the DCCC.) House Democrats do not have term limits for their committee chairs, as Republicans do. The average age of the Democratic ranking members on the 22 House committees this Congress is 68. The average age of the Republican chairmen is 60. On only four of the 22 committees is the top Republican older than the top Democrat. The seniority rules mean that the most important committees are led by the oldest members. The ranking Democrat on Judiciary, John Conyers, is 87. Ways and Means ranking member Sander Levin is 85. Nita Lowey, ranking on Appropriations, is 79. Maxine Waters, ranking on Financial Services, is 78. For context, the Republicans who lead the four crucial committees are, from oldest to youngest, 78, 64, 61 and 59.    Dave Camp, then chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, questions CMS chief Marilyn Tavenner during a hearing with ranking member Sander Levin back in 2013. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)   -- There is palpable concern among Democratic elites around town that too many of these ranking members in the House are not pit bull types who can effectively argue for Democratic principles on television and during floor debates. It's a refrain you hear constantly: Do Democrats really want the 85-year-old Levin running point against the GOP's drive to repeal Obamacare and negotiating what could be the most significant rewrite of the tax code in a generation? Do they want the 87-year-old Conyers being the tip of the spear against a Trump Justice Department and all the scandals that could potentially bring? ""There is broad angst in the Democratic caucus,"" said Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), speaking of no one in particular. ""To stick with the same message over four bad election cycles is a mistake. I think part of it is that the messengers have to change."" -- This is a stark contrast to the Senate, where Democrats have several proven fighters who are ready to rumble with the Trump administration. Pelosi's team will complain that the aforementioned sentiment is ageist, but it's really about more than age. It's about temperament and drive. Bernie Sanders is 75 and Elizabeth Warren is 67, but no one doubts their willingness or ability to go toe-to-toe with the right.    Newly-elected House members gather for a freshman class photo on the Capitol steps yesterday. (Andrew Harnik/AP)   -- Junior House Democrats - chock full of potential and ambition - grumble constantly about how suffocated they feel. The reality, which no wants to grouse about publicly, is that toiling away on the back bench in the minority party is a pretty horrible existence. You think you're important when you get elected, but then once you arrive it turns out you're almost totally irrelevant. Only people in your home district actually care about you, and even there your name ID is probably embarrassingly low. Unlike the Senate, the lower chamber is a purely majoritarian institution. There is no filibuster. There are no earmarks. Unless you're a crazy firebrand, or have an especially impressive resume (e.g. you're a war hero), your press secretary probably cannot even get you booked on the three major cable news channels. You get fewer staffers than you assume when you arrive, and many of your employees are basically fresh out of college. They don't really know anything about legislating, but it doesn't really matter because leadership calls all the shots. The young members who do get lavished with attention are the ones in competitive districts that make them vulnerable. But those are the members who have to spend almost all of their time dialing for dollars, begging rich people they don't know for money from a windowless call center. You may wear the member's pin proudly, but really it is a life of indignity after indignity.    Seth Moulton campaigns north of Boston. (Steven Senne/AP)   -- The young generation of Democrats does not want to wait for God knows how long to be heard. Two whippersnappers illustrate this tension perfectly: Ruben Gallego, 36, is from Phoenix and Seth Moulton, 38, is from Boston. Both graduated from Harvard. Both saw combat as Marine infantrymen in Iraq. Both won a second term last week. Both envision themselves doing much bigger things. And both agitated publicly to delay the leadership elections. ""We don't want to rush to a leadership vote for them to think everything is business as usual,"" said Gallego. ""Everything is not good. Business as usual is not going to work."" ""Delaying the vote on leadership positions is the necessary first step to have that conversation,"" said Moulton, who defeated Democratic incumbent John Tierney in a 2014 primary. ""The American people cried out last week, and we've got to listen."" On Monday night, to prepare for the contentious caucus meeting, Moulton convened a strategy dinner of about 20 fellow insurgents at Acqua Al 2, the fancy Italian restaurant in Eastern Market. He declined yesterday to say whether he will back Pelosi.    Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi participate in the ""first nail ceremony"" kicking off the construction of the Inauguration Platform on the West Front of the Capitol in September. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)   -- Nancy Pelosi is both beloved and feared by her members. Even many of the young bucks who want to rise through the ranks faster recognize what an incredibly shrewd deal-maker she is. She's often out-foxed Republican leaders and has capitalized on the unruly and undisciplined House Freedom to extract big concessions at key moments. She's typecast as a limousine liberal, but the much better way to understand Pelosi is that her dad was the mayor of Baltimore. She learned machine politics in a big city. Pelosi knows how to keep her caucus in line, or at least the majority, and that's why she remains VERY HEAVILY FAVORED to stay on as minority leader - even with the postponed election. A smaller Democratic caucus even works to her advantage in some ways. With all but a handful of Blue Dogs gone, she's got California locked up. The female members adore her (More than 40 of the 54 have signed a letter offering support). And the bleeding-heart liberals, who dominate the Democratic caucus to a greater degree than at any point in U.S. history, see her as a fellow traveler. She's also one of the best fundraisers in political history. -- Tim Ryan is the likeliest challenger to Pelosi, but even he may still decide not to go through with it. He told our Paul Kane during an interview this morning that he has not made a final decision. ""This is not fun anymore. This is not fun to wallow in the minority,"" he said about the morale of rank-and-file Democrats. Asked about the party's standing, he deadpanned: ""You can't fall off the floor."" The Ohioan must consider what happened to Heath Shuler, a moderate from North Carolina, when he challenged Pelosi in 2010 after the party lost 63 seats: She crushed him like a bug, 150-43, and he subsequently left Congress. Some of the rambunctious youngsters are playing more of the inside game, recognizing the clear risks of crossing Pelosi. Joe Kennedy III, who like Moulton is a member of the Massachusetts delegation in his 30s, expressed support yesterday for retaining her as minority leader. Not only is he a member of the Kennedy clan, which guarantees a national profile, but he is considered the favorite to succeed Warren whenever his former Harvard law school professor decides to give up her Senate seat. (Moulton, if his bid to shake up the House fails, might feel compelled to, hypothetically, run against someone like Sen. Ed Markey in a primary.)    Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Missouri) in Kansas City last week. (Whitney Curtis/Getty Images)   -- The key issue going forward now is whether the Pelosi dissidents stay unified or break up into competing factions. As the trite but true Will Rogers aphorism goes, ""I'm not a member of any organized party. I'm a Democrat."" Some people just want to force the old guys at the top of the committee dais to be more politically and legislative active, which is altogether different than those who want to oust the top leaders. -- The Congressional Black Caucus privately would like to depose Pelosi, if she could be taken out. But, but, but: The CBC is also the leading opponent to creating term limits for committee chairs and steadfastly opposes other reforms that the younger, mostly white, members want. It was a CBC member, 72-year-old Emanuel Cleaver, who formally made the motion to postpone the leadership elections. ""We just got a shellacking last Tuesday,"" CBC chairman G.K. Butterfield said after the meeting. ""We got an unexpected defeat and we've got to recalibrate and decide how we go forward."" (For what it's worth, Cleaver and Butterfield claimed that this was not the first step in a coup d'etat.)    Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) speaks during a news conference. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)   -- Another flashpoint: Coastal elites really have a vice grip on the House Democratic caucus. In the current Congress, 121 of the 186 Democrats come from states on the Left Coast or the Eastern seaboard. That's two thirds, and the number will actually tick higher next year. Even more starkly, more than one-third of House Democrats hail from just three states: California (39), New York (18) and Massachusetts (9). Meanwhile, Democrats have gotten totally throttled in the Rust Belt: Pennsylvania's delegation has 13 Republicans and five Democrats. Ohio's delegation has 13 Republicans and five Democrats. Michigan has nine Republicans and five Democrats. Wisconsin has five Republicans and three Democrats. The fact that the GOP won big in the 2010 midterms and then controlled the redistricting process is a very important factor here, but it's a red herring to pretend that it is the only one. Democrats will never control the House again until they figure out how to flip those numbers. That's partly what animates Ryan's potential challenge. -- To be sure, Republicans have their own problems. Namely diversity. Seven of the top eight House Republican leaders are men. Just one is a woman. In fact, there are only 21 Republican women in the House...     Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:  President Obama after walking through the Propylaia, the monumental entrance to the Acropolis pic.twitter.com/IVXO51hUQY-- Arlette Saenz (@ArletteSaenz) November 16, 2016   -- A brand new Washington Post-Schar School national poll asked Americans about the path forward after the election. Key numbers, via Scott Clement and Dan Balz:  Just 3 in 10 Americans say Trump has a mandate to carry out his agenda. Six in 10 say he should seek compromise with Democrats when they strongly disagree with his proposals. More than 7 in 10 Americans said the campaign made them ""angry"" and more than half reported feeling ""stressed out"" by campaign news. Trump's supporters say they are largely ""ebullient"" about the result, while Clinton backers range from disappointed to fearful to ""apoplectic."" More than 6 in 10 said they expect to see ""major"" changes in Washington during his presidency. Trump supporters want to see decisive action in the next four years: 9 in 10 said they are dissatisfied with the country in recent years, and 8 in 10 say ""large scale changes"" are necessary to correct the nation's course. These responses are particularly striking when set against the fact that Obama's approval rating stands at 56 percent - and the 28 percent who ""strongly disapprove"" is the lowest level in more than five years.

From Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller: Ex-congressman Mike Rogers, a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the leading candidate for CIA director, was among at least four transition officials purged this week, apparently because of their perceived ties to the New Jersey governor.  ""As he had during the campaign, Trump appeared to be increasingly uncomfortable with outsiders and suspicious of those considered part of what one insider called the 'bicoastal elite,' who are perceived as trying to 'insinuate' themselves into positions of power. Those in the inner circle were winnowed to Trump loyalists and campaign staffers who helped devise his winning strategy."" -- A source close to Rogers told NBC that he was ""the victim of a Stalinesque purge."" -- Trump has requested that his son-in-law Jared Kushner sit in on his Presidential Daily Briefing, NBC News's Andrea Mitchell scooped.

From Mark Landler, Eric Lipton, and Jo Becker in the New York Times: ""He built a lucrative consulting and speechmaking career after leaving City Hall. His firm, Giuliani Partners, has had contracts with the government of Qatar and the Canadian company that is building the Keystone XL oil pipeline, and Mr. Giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department's list of foreign terrorist organizations.

Ms. Mercer, 42, the daughter of the New York investor Robert Mercer, has told Republican operatives and members of previous administrations that she was having trouble finding takers for posts at the under secretary level and below.

Fahrenthold and Frances Stead Sellers: After last year's terrorist attacks in Paris, Trump faced sharp criticism for saying the U.S. had ""no choice"" but to close down some mosques. ""Two days later, Trump called in to a radio show run by a friendly political operative who offered a suggestion. Was it possible, asked the host, [Steve Bannon], that Trump hadn't really meant that mosques should be closed? 'Were you actually saying, you need a [New York police] intelligence unit to get a network of informants?' Bannon asked. Trump -- presented with a less controversial but entirely different idea than what he'd actually said -- agreed."" Now, Trump is president-elect, and Bannon is slated to be one of his most influential advisers. ""The clearest public sense of how the two will work together -- and what policies Bannon may try to push -- can be gleaned from a series of one-on-one interviews on Bannon's radio show. ... In those exchanges, a dynamic emerged, with Bannon often coaxing Trump to agree to his viewpoint, whether on climate change, foreign policy or the need to take on Republican leaders in Congress. At times, Bannon seemed to coach Trump to soften the harder edges of his message, to make it more palatable to a broader audience, while in other cases he pushed Trump to take tougher positions. He flattered Trump, praising his negotiating skills and the size of his campaign crowds. The conversations marked a coming-together of Trump ... and the alt-right ..."" -- Meanwhile, a growing chorus of Democrats is seeking to rally the party around a common goal of resisting Trump, while pressuring moderate Republicans to reject Trump's most controversial administration appointments. Abby Phillip and John Wagner report: ""Congressional Democrats say they have not ruled out working with Trump on areas of common ground, especially on infrastructure and populist economic policies ... But they plan to train their attention on the immediate challenge of contesting Trump's appointments to key roles ..."" Meanwhile, organized labor leaders, who share a middle ground with Trump on certain economic issues, said the ascension of such figures as Bannon must be addressed before cooperation is put on the table. ""We can't do business with this guy as long as he's in the business of hate,"" the official said.  Harry Reid called on Trump to retract his appointment of Steve Bannon in an impassioned Senate floor speech on Tuesday, calling the former Breitbart CEO a ""champion of white supremacy"": ""If Trump is serious about seeking unity, the first thing he should do is rescind his appointment of Steve Bannon,"" Reid said. ""Rescind it, don't do it.""  (Elise Viebeck) ""This just keeps going back to, what is [Trump] going to do?"" Elizabeth Warren said. ""And he's now giving us at least the first tangible sign of his vision of how to run a Trump presidency and a big part of that are lobbyists and Washington insiders and the other part of it is to bring someone who is a white supremacist into the White House to be a senior strategist.""  -- Paul Ryan continued to dodge questions on Bannon, whose publication continues to aggressively criticize his leadership and promoted his opponent in the GOP primary. ""I'm not looking backwards; I'm looking forward,"" Ryan said. ""I'm looking to the future and I'm looking forward to how we make this work for the American people and how we make President Trump the most successful president in a lifetime."" (Politico) -- Was Bannon being paid illegally during the campaign? From The Daily Beast's Betsy Woodruff: ""A campaign watchdog group filed a complaint with federal election officials that alleges [Bannon] may have gotten paid illegally during Trump's campaign by pro-Trump billionaires. And now, a new set of [FEC] filings that haven't yet been reported on may give the group's case some additional heft. At issue are payments of nearly $200,000 that a super PAC called Make America Number 1 made to a company tied to Bannon ... On Aug. 17, Bannon left his post as chairman of Breitbart News and became the Trump campaign's CEO. Available FEC filings show the campaign didn't pay Bannon a salary.

With political stability finally restored, the country is again in position to become compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency, nearly eight months after it was suspended because of inadequate doping legislation. Spanish authorities say they have everything in place to approve the law changes that will allow the nation to abide by WADA's revised global anti-doping code. WADA declared Spain ""non-compliant"" this year after the country failed to adapt its legislation because it couldn't form a government following two inconclusive elections that prompted a political deadlock which lasted nearly 10 months. The country's political parties finally reached an agreement to end the stalemate last month, and Wednesday is the first day in which the parliament can start working on new legislation. Officials guarantee that it's only a matter of time before the required changes are approved and the nation regains WADA compliance. The country's top government sports official, Miguel Cardenal, said that the legislation changes are ""ready"" and just waiting for approval. Spain's anti-doping agency said that the negotiations to have the changes made had already been conducted even before the political impasse was resolved, leaving everything in place for a quick approval by the parliament.  ""(The changes) are important to assure that our athletes are subjected to the same rules as any other athlete in the world,"" said Enrique Gomez Bastida, director of Spain's anti-doping agency. ""It's fundamental that there are no differences between the rules in which athletes have to follow in their countries and the ones applied by their respective international federation."" There has been no timetable set by the government, but the new legislation could come into effect in a matter of weeks. The changes would make a greater number of infractions punishable, allow for harsher sanctions and extend the statute of limitation for violations.  ""WADA looks forward to receiving draft legislation from Spain at the earliest opportunity, so that we can check whether it is in line with the code,"" WADA spokesman Ben Nichols said. ""Once such legislation is deemed to be in line with the code, it has to be adopted and the independent compliance review committee will then be in a position to re-assess the situation and make a recommendation (regarding code compliance) to the foundation board."" Not long after Spain was declared non-compliant in March, WADA also suspended the accreditation of the Madrid drug-testing lab, dealing another blow to the country which has long been under scrutiny because of doping. Earlier this year, a Spanish court ruled that blood bags that were key evidence in Operation Puerto, one of the nation's worst doping scandals, had to be handed over to authorities for investigation, a major win 10 years after the revelation about the doping network involving some of the world's top cyclists. Several athletes, including Rafael Nadal, had been criticizing the delay to hand over the bags, saying the lack of closure on the case further damaged the country's image in the fight against doping. The president of the Spanish Olympic Committee, Alejandro Blanco, criticized local officials earlier this year for not being able to approve the necessary changes needed for Spain to comply with WADA's revised code. He said other countries also endured political problems but were able to make the changes and become compliant. WADA's anti-doping code was revised in 2015 to give the agency more power in the fight against doping. ___ Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

But he didn’t do enough to build the Democratic Party	"   (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)  President Obama has devoted most of his energies over the past eight years to building a policy legacy. He will leave office with many durable successes, from the economic recovery to the revived auto industry, the killing of bin Laden to new administrative rules and rulings that will be difficult to reverse. But President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Congress have vowed to undo many of Obama's other major accomplishments. Reports suggest they will move quickly to dismantle key legislation (Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank), reverse executive orders (gun control, immigration), renegotiate treaties (climate change, TPP, Iran) and block regulations (deportation enforcement, environmental regulation). Democrats will have few ways to stop them. (All hopes hang on the survival of the filibuster.) Clearly, policy accomplishments are only as durable as their political supports are strong. And President Obama, like most modern Democratic presidents, did not do enough to build up those political supports. Democratic presidents often shortchange their party As I discuss in my book on presidents and party-building, presidents can decide whether to invest their time and resources in building a policy legacy, a party legacy or both. Republicans have historically pursued both assiduously, while Democrats have almost exclusively gone the policy route. For example, Republicans raised money for their party and helped to fund down-ballot races. They helped to strengthen state parties. They helped to recruit quality candidates. They directed resources to voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives. They worked to cultivate and train a new generation of activists and campaign operatives. Democratic presidents in earlier eras had different priorities. With deep and durable majorities in Congress, state and local politics, and national party identification, they focused on policy accomplishments and left the party-building project to others, especially out-party chairmen during Republican administrations. John F. Kennedy exploited his party while making precious few investments in its capacities; Lyndon Johnson undercut his party and drained it of its resources; Jimmy Carter neglected and exploited it. Bill Clinton followed the same pattern until his second term, when in response to his party's flagging electoral fortunes, he launched a number of party-building programs. But the start-up costs were high and the downstream gains were gradual, with the biggest steps forward taking place during Howard Dean's tenure as Democratic National Committee chairman a few years later (2005-2009). Obama's limited party-building Obama, like Clinton before him, also responded to his party's weakened competitive electoral position by making a handful of party-building moves in his second term. Not enough, though, to prevent the decimation of his party's electoral standing or equip it to resist the rapid rollback of his policy legacy. Obama does have two months left in office. But there is enough of a public record to begin taking stock:  Obama campaigned hard for Clinton and several congressional candidates in 2016 and helped raise money for them as well as state parties in earlier years, as Brendan Doherty has shown. But campaign chairman John Podesta evidently found Obama to be ""prissy"" when it came to fundraising for super PACs, which have become increasingly important to campaigns.   His team launched the nonprofit group Organizing for Action (OFA) in 2013, which as Sidney Milkis and John York have shown, may very well may endure as a force for promoting progressive policies in the future. But Obama appears to have done little to help build a progressive organizational network at the state level, which Alexander Hertel-Fernandez and Theda Skocpol have demonstrated is woefully lacking on the left. Nor has he done much to help revitalize dying labor unions.   And after years of delay, Obama finally handed the technological infrastructure and analytic tools of his presidential campaign over to the DNC (""Project Ivy"") in 2014, which is one crucial party-building move no Democratic president had ever done in the modern era. At the same time, OFA did ""hoard"" the campaign's key data on small donors, volunteers and activists, leading to an awkward division of informational assets between the party and OFA. And of course by failing to address deeper problems at the DNC earlier, the national committee has become a laughing stock.  Clearly, the Democratic Party's diverse coalition was not so fractious to deter Clinton or Obama from doing at least some party-building. And some of Obama's efforts could still pay off in the long term, as Clinton's did. The problem was that neither Obama nor Clinton did enough of it to make much of a difference in the near-term. Moreover, they both treated policy successes as tantamount to political successes. Both Obama and Clinton argued that successful health-care reform would create supportive constituencies that would reward the party at the voting booth in the long run. But policies don't always generate their own political supports, which is the main difficulty Obama is confronting now. As he leaves office, the Democratic ""bench"" is weak and its ""farm team"" is virtually nonexistent. Democrats are already scrambling to rebuild, as the out-party always does. They'll do well to rebuild from the bottom up. One thing, however, is clear: With Donald Trump in the White House, Democrats will no longer be able to benefit from White House largesse, presidential fundraising prowess or the power of presidential persuasion. Yes, eventually Democrats will win a greater share of elective offices. But it will be an uphill battle. This, too, will be one of Obama's legacies.

She was 61.  The cause was endometrial cancer, said her brother, Roberto Ifill. Her ill health led to recent absences from her jobs as co-anchor of ""The PBS NewsHour"" and as moderator of PBS's ""Washington Week"" roundtable public affairs show. In February, she co-moderated a Democratic primary debate in Wisconsin between former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""NewsHour"" co-anchor Judy Woodruff called Ms. Ifill a consummate communicator who exuded ""the rare combination of authority and warmth. She came through the screen as a friend to people who watched her, but she also displayed the authority for people to believe you, to have credibility."" Woodruff added: ""She didn't mind telling anyone when she thought they were wrong, on camera. She kept it respectful. She was one of the most graceful interrupters I have ever seen.""     President Obama paid tribute to journalist Gwen Ifill, one of the most prominent TV anchors of her generation. Ifill died Nov. 14 at the age of 61. (The Washington Post)   Black television luminaries such as Bernard Shaw of CNN and Max Robinson of ABC performed highly visible anchor duties long before Ms. Ifill came on the national radar. But with her appointment in 1999 to lead what was then called ""Washington Week in Review,"" she became one of the first black women to preside over a major national political show.  Ron Simon, a curator at the Paley Center for Media in New York, said Ms. Ifill ""exemplified the journalistic ideals of Walter Cronkite, excelling in print and then bringing those talents to television. She was, like Cronkite, open to the many dimensions of human experience, she was curious about everything. I link her to that tradition, the journalistic integrity that Cronkite symbolized."" A preacher's daughter, Ms. Ifill (pronounced EYE-ful) grew up in a home where the church was paramount but familiarity with the news of the day was essentially a second religion. The Ifills gathered nightly to watch network newscasts, and the children were expected to be conversant in the major events of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Because of her father's low pay, she noted at one time that she was probably the only Washington journalist covering the Department of Housing and Urban Development who had also lived in federally subsidized housing. Later, as her career took her from The Washington Post and the New York Times to NBC News and PBS, she reflected ruefully on her family's struggle: ""I make more money in a week than my father made in a year.""  She began her reporting career in the late 1970s, with stints at newspapers in Boston and Baltimore, assertively carving a niche for herself as a political journalist at a time when black journalists and black female reporters, in particular, were rare in newsrooms and rarer still on the city hall beat. She recalled getting letters from readers (and once from a colleague) brimming with racial slurs and, in return, receiving shrugs from less-than-understanding editors. As she rose from covering Maryland politics to presidential contests in 1988 and 1992, she began showing up as a panelist on Washington public-affairs shows. But she also resisted many more such invitations, fearing that too many appearances would make her seem like a partisan pundit or self-promoting personality rather than a serious reporter well-versed in politics, international news and cultural affairs. She wrestled with job offers in broadcast -- all three major networks reportedly sought her as an on-air correspondent -- until Tim Russert, anchor of NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" helped engineer her move to his network in 1994. ""What are you afraid of?"" he reputedly asked.          1 of 18       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                           Skip Ad   x           Remembering PBS anchor Gwen Ifill      View Photos   Journalist Gwen Ifill dies at 61.

In 1999, she took her expertise to public television, which had a noticeably smaller audience than the networks but could devote more time to what she considered the complex and important issues of the day.  Her personal demeanor masked a not-entirely-unambitious side: She accepted the ""Washington Week"" offer only when the producers sweetened the deal to include a dual position as senior political correspondent for ""The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer."" In 2004, Ms. Ifill moderated a vice-presidential debate between incumbent Richard B. Cheney, a Republican, and then-Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.). She drew praise for asking a startling and revealing question about health care. ""In particular,"" she said, ""I want to talk to you about AIDS, and not about AIDS in China or Africa, but AIDS right here in this country, where black women between the ages of 25 and 44 are 13 times more likely to die of the disease than their counterparts. What should the government's role be in helping to end the growth of this epidemic?"" Cheney questioned her numbers, and Edwards talked about Africa. Many health experts lauded Ms. Ifill for shining the spotlight on office-seekers who appeared far removed from a largely invisible population. Ms. Ifill later moderated a 2008 vice-presidential debate between Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican contender, and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the Democratic candidate. In recent years, she hosted town-hall-style specials for PBS centered on fractured race relations, police shootings and gun violence -- ""America After Ferguson"" and ""America After Charleston."" ""I was taught that the search for truth and the search for justice are not incompatible and are, in fact, essential,"" Ms. Ifill told an audience of journalism students in 2013. ""Diversity is essential to the success of the news industry, and journalists must include diverse voices in their coverage in order to reach a broader audience. We have stories to tell, but many in our audience have stopped listening because they can tell that we're not talking about them."" Gwendolyn Ifill was born in Queens on Sept. 29, 1955, and grew up as the fifth of six siblings. Her father, O. Urcille Ifill, was a Panamanian immigrant who became a pastor in the African Methodist Episcopal church. Her mother, the former Eleanor Husbands, was a homemaker from Barbados. The Ifills led an itinerant life around the Northeast for her father's career, and Ms. Ifill graduated from high school in Springfield, Mass. She graduated in 1977 from Simmons College in Boston with a bachelor's degree in communications studies. After an inauspicious job at a local TV station, she joined the Boston Herald American, writing about food (""I couldn't cook,"" she once said) before advancing to the school board beat -- her first experience with bruising politics in a city cleaved by forced busing. Newsroom politics were also stark, she recalled. The ""old white guys"" who filled the paper had ""never seen anything like me -- a college-educated black woman,"" Ms. Ifill once told an interviewer. ""And they didn't know how to deal with me.""  She joined the Baltimore Evening Sun in 1981, covering city hall, and then came to The Post in 1984, initially assigned to the Prince George's County bureau and covering suburban politics. She eventually covered the presidential bids in 1988 of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and televangelist Pat Robertson, both long-shot candidates for the Democrats and Republicans, respectively.  In 1992, a year after the Times hired her as a congressional correspondent, she went on the presidential campaign trail covering Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton (D). When he defeated the incumbent, George H.W. Bush (R), Ms. Ifill became the newspaper's White House correspondent. Two years later, she made the leap to broadcast journalism and continued to cover a series of Clinton scandals surrounding alleged financial misdeeds as well as the impeachment hearings against the president stemming from his affair with a White House intern. In 1999, WETA, the public broadcasting station in Washington, fired Ken Bode as moderator of ""Washington Week in Review"" in a programming shake-up and offered the position to Ms. Ifill, who had made appearances on the show for much of the decade. Media watchers began to ponder if the revamping was intended to goose audiences by going the route of high-decibel, combative punditry on cable news shows, but Ms. Ifill's presence doused those four-alarm concerns. In Salon.com, journalist Robert Margolis likened Ms. Ifill to Walt ""Clyde"" Frazier, the former New York Knick, an athlete who embodied dedication to the sport and composure in the heat of play. ""Like Frazier,"" Margolis added, she ""maintains an external sense of cool and serenity, while underneath lie serious smarts, smooth execution and a healthy dose of skepticism."" She and Woodruff officially were named co-anchors of the ""NewsHour"" in 2013, two years after Lehrer left the anchor chair, and they shared managing editor responsibilities for directing coverage.  As her health deteriorated, Ms. Ifill kept up a daunting regimen. Her friend Richard L. Berke, a former senior editor at the Times, described it: chemotherapy on Thursday, ""Washington Week"" on Friday, collapse at home on the weekends and back to work on Monday. ""It was a strength and resilience I had never encountered before,"" he said. Ms. Ifill was the author of a book, ""The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama"" (2009), which traced a post-civil-rights generation of African American politicians.  Besides Roberto Ifill, of Silver Spring, survivors include another brother, the Rev. Earle Ifill of Atlanta; and a sister, Maria Philip of Silver Spring. At a peak moment of Ms. Ifill's broadcasting power, soon after becoming co-anchor of ""The NewsHour,"" she told the Times: ""When I was a little girl watching programs like this -- because that's the kind of nerdy family we were -- I would look up and not see anyone who looked like me in any way. No women. No people of color. ""I'm very keen about the fact that a little girl now, watching the news, when they see me and Judy sitting side by side, it will occur to them that that's perfectly normal -- that it won't seem like any big breakthrough at all.""

Bannon will be his chief strategist and senior counselor. (AFP/Getty)   With Breanne Deppisch and Elise Viebeck THE BIG IDEA: Reince Priebus will be chief of staff, but Stephen Bannon may be the one calling the shots in Donald Trump's White House. The pugilistic and polarizing former head of Breitbart News will be chief strategist and senior counselor for President Donald Trump, a role held in previous administrations by the likes of David Axelrod, Karl Rove, John Podesta and Ed Meese. Trump is said to have preferred Bannon for the chief job. But he was reportedly  persuaded in recent days to go a more conventional route by everyone from the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The 275-word press release announcing the hires said Bannon and Priebus will be ""equal partners,"" but Bannon got top billing. ""I want to thank President-elect Trump for the opportunity to work with Reince in driving the agenda of the Trump Administration,"" Bannon said in the statement. ""We had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory. We will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda."" -- If the campaign is indeed the model for their White House partnership, Bannon will hold more sway over Trump than Priebus. The chairman brought in money and ran interference, helping to keep wobbly GOP politicians in line. But he certainly did not set the candidate's direction and was more often than not troubled by it. For example, Bannon, 62, a former naval officer and investment banker, was the brains behind inviting the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to be Trump's guests at the second debate. He was seen smiling broadly when the GOP nominee held a surprise press conference with them. Priebus never in a million years would have come up with this -- or signed off on it, had it been up to him. After the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape emerged, Priebus quickly distanced himself. ""No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever,"" he said. Bannon's Breitbart, meanwhile, is reportedly in talks to hire Billy Bush, who got fired from the ""Today"" show for his part in the repugnant conversation.    Donald Trump and Reince Priebus on election night in New York. (Evan Vucci/AP)   AN EARLY WINDOW INTO HOW TRUMP WILL GOVERN:  -- With the biggest decision he's made during his first week as president-elect, Trump has made clear that he wants rival power centers. The likely result is that the same internal tensions that defined Trump's campaign will continue to exist in his West Wing. Remember Corey Lewandowski's perennial battles with Paul Manafort? Manafort never actually had the title of ""campaign manager,"" but he was in effect running the campaign as ""chairman."" Corey, pushed out as manager, tweeted out a damning story about his rival's Ukraine connections and then seemed to celebrate on social media when Manafort got ousted later on. -- His management style has long been to have rivals underneath him duking it out. Even when you think back to his reality TV show, ""The Apprentice,"" there were competing teams pursuing the same objective. -- White House veterans say power in the West Wing derives less from title and more from proximity. More than most, Trump has also shown that he can be heavily influenced by the last person he speaks with before making a decision. Trump has a deeper relationship with Bannon, which could be significant early on. Priebus, on the other hand, will have an office that's closer to the Oval. -- Trump likes to be in charge, and he tends to feel threatened when underlings accrue too much power. -- Some Bannon critics worry that he will wind up being Trump's Rasputin. The mystic maintained immense influence over Czar Nicholas after he stopped his son's bleeding from hemophilia. This caused countless problems and eventually hastened the fall of the monarchy in Russia. Does Trump credit Bannon's scorched-earth strategy with stopping his political bleeding this fall? Will he keep him close despite the backlash?    Bannon leaves Trump Tower on Friday night. (Evan Vucci/AP)   AN INSTANT LIGHTNING ROD: -- Every White House has a bogeyman that the opposition singles out, but Bannon will take the job as a much bigger lightning rod than anyone in memory. The Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League and the Council on American-Islamic Relations were among the groups that put out statements decrying Bannon last night. ""President-elect Trump's choice of Steve Bannon as his top aide signals that White Supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump's White House,"" outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's spokesman said in a statement.

(Eric Thayer/Reuters)   -- From Day One, part of Priebus's portfolio will surely include getting Trump reelected in 2020. He's a Republican apparatchik who cares first and foremost about winning elections. Surely more than Bannon, he will be thinking about winning the Virginia gubernatorial race in 2017 and protecting GOP candidates up for reelection in 2018, when anti-Trump headwinds will be strong (if history is any guide). That will mean urging Trump to be as conventional as possible while also building up a fundraising apparatus to support his future endeavors. -- The extent of the 44-year-old's legislative experience is that he was a clerk for the Wisconsin State Assembly's Education Committee between college and law school. (The son of an electrician went to the University of Wisconsin campus in Whitewater, and he earned a law degree from the University of Miami.) In January 2011, Priebus toppled Michael Steele -- who had previously been an ally -- by promising to focus more on fundraising than Sunday show appearances. The committee was in debt, and Steele had committed a stream of gaffes. Priebus's pitch to the 168 members of the party's governing body was built around the message that he would be ""no drama."" -- Priebus proved to be a voracious fundraiser, and major RNC contributors are relieved that they will have suction in the Trump White House. Priebus's selection ensures that Republican lobbyists will have an open door and suggests that the new administration will be more transactional than it might have been otherwise. Watch to see who gets the ambassadorships...    In September, Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell watch as Paul Ryan hammers in a nail for Chuck Schumer after he bent his during a ceremony to drive in the first nails to signify the start of construction on the 2017 presidential inaugural platform. (Andrew Harnik/AP)   -- But, but, but: The Priebus-Bannon duo signals that Trump does not think he'll need to actually work that much with Democrats. Reince spent the past five years traveling the country assailing people like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Howard Baker he is not ... This could be a strategic mistake. While Republicans have majorities in both chambers, the GOP only has 52 seats in the Senate. Unless Mitch McConnell invokes the nuclear option, and it's not clear there is enough appetite in his caucus to do so, that means that Trump will need to find eight Democratic votes to get the 60 votes needed to pass any big ticket piece of legislation. Who is the White House going to send over to the Capitol to negotiate?    Kellyanne Conway arrives at Trump Tower yesterday. (Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images)   FIVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEW ARRANGEMENT-- -- What role will Kellyanne Conway play? Will she be the Valerie Jarrett of the Trump administration? Ronald Reagan had a troika running his White House, and the model (mostly) worked. James Baker was the chief of staff despite having worked against the new president in the 1976 and 1980 Republican primaries, and longtime loyalist Meese (who had served Reagan in Sacramento) had more of the strategic role. Historian Michael Bechloss posts the breakdown of responsibilities both men agreed to 36 years ago yesterday:  Memo dividing duties between Reagan chief of staff Jim Baker & Counselor Ed Meese, dated today 1980: pic.twitter.com/f50Rulpa9x-- Michael Beschloss (@BeschlossDC) November 13, 2016   The third member of the so-called troika was Mike Deaver, who as deputy chief of staff focused mostly on the president's public image. Conway, who was campaign manager, said last week that Trump offered her a White House job. But we don't know which job. Perhaps she will play a role akin to Deaver's? -- Where do the kids fit in? The New York Times reports that Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, were the ones who convinced Donald not to give Bannon the chief of staff title. ""Mr. Kushner is likely to wield great influence over the new president regardless of whether he holds a formal title. Mr. Kushner, who has no experience in politics or government, often has the final word in advising Mr. Trump,"" Mike Shear, Maggie Haberman and Allan Rappeport write. ""The often undefined nature of the 'senior counselor' and 'chief strategist' job can be a blessing and a curse,"" Damian Paletta explains in the Wall Street Journal. ""The job will allow Mr. Bannon to weigh in on virtually any decision Mr. Trump seeks his advice on, but could also open him up to internal jostling if other advisers -- or family members -- try to marginalize his input. Mr. Axelrod's title in the Obama administration was 'senior advisor' and he said in an email that Mr. Bannon's impact could be unclear at first because 'every White House is different.' ... John Sununu, chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush, said there is only one person who really knows what role Mr. Bannon will play. 'Only Trump knows what he wants Bannon's job to be,' he said."" -- How centralized will the Trump administration be? Are Cabinet secretaries going to get empowered to a greater degree than in the Obama years? Who actually makes decisions about policy? ""It's like the dog chasing the bus and we've finally caught it,"" one Trump adviser told Phil Rucker this weekend. ""So now we have to figure out what to do."" -- Who will Trump choose to replace Priebus as RNC chair? The president gets to pick the party leader, by custom, but his choice must be ratified by the 168 members of the committee. ""One senior Trump aide said Lewandowski is among those being considered for the post. Another possibility is David Bossie, a Trump adviser who also serves as an RNC committeeman,"" per Politico's Alex Isenstadt and Marc Caputo. -- How many women will be in Trump's Cabinet? Hillary Clinton promised that half her cabinet would be women and said her administration would look like America. Trump has made no such promises. Only white men have ever served as White House chief of staff. That tradition will continue. (See a list of the 28 white guys who have held the job since Harry Truman created it here.)

""Even when one of its own reporters said Lewandowski had grabbed her at a campaign event, the campaign denied it -- and Breitbart (then being run day-to-day by Bannon) tried to prove that the campaign was right and its own reporter was wrong.

Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French National Front party, speaks at a rally in September. (Jean-Paul Pelissier/Reuters)   -- Bannon sees Trumpism as part of a much larger global movement of populism and nationalism.

She was elected to represent Vaucluse, a region in southern France with heavy ties to the National Front, a party founded by her grandfather, the 88-year-old Jean-Marie Le Pen. He once referred to the Nazi concentration camps as a ""detail of history.""  I answer yes to the invitation of Stephen Bannon, CEO of @realDonaldTrump presidential campaign, to work together. https://t.co/tPSoY5A2vS-- Marion Le Pen (@Marion_M_Le_Pen) November 12, 2016   -- Bannon has explained that Trump is more of a reactionary than a revolutionary. ""This is not the French Revolution,"" he told Businessweek for a cover story last month. ""They destroyed the basic institutions of their society and changed their form of government. What Trump represents is a restoration -- a restoration of true American capitalism and a revolution against state-sponsored socialism."" A sign of what's to come?

The interview taped Friday and aired last night. (Chris Albert for CBSNews/via AP)   -- Trump's first post-election interview aired on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" last night. He doubled down on several of his campaign pledges while softening his rhetoric on immigration and same-sex marriage. Watch the segment here. Six highlights:  On marriage equality: ""It's done,"" he told Lesley Stahl, seeking to assuage fears that a conservative Supreme Court would overturn the landmark 2015 decision. ""These cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They've been settled.... And I'm fine with that."" On abortion, however, he reiterated his campaign pledge to nominate a pro-life Supreme Court justice: ""I'm pro-life,"" Trump said. ""The judges will be pro-life."" If Roe v. Wade were overturned, Trump said, abortion rights issues ""would be decided by individual states."" On immigration, Trump pledged to deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records after his inauguration and ""make a determination"" on others later. ""What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,"" he said. After the border is secure, he said, his administration will make a ""determination"" on the others. (Amy B Wang) On the wave of racial slurs and threats that have spiked since Tuesday's election: ""I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, 'Stop it.' If it-- if it helps,"" Trump said, turning from Stahl to face another camera. ""I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it."" (Politico) Trump declined to say whether he would continue to investigate Clinton as commander in chief: ""They're good people,"" he said of the Clintons. ""I don't want to hurt them."" And he made clear he will keep using Twitter. ""I'm not saying I love it, but it does get the word out,"" he said, boasting that he gained 100,000 followers on Thursday alone.     Hundreds of thousands of protesters gather in Seoul to demand South Korean President Park Geun-hye's resignation.

(CNN) Four Americans were killed, and at least 17 others were injured, after a suicide bomber detonated his vest inside the largest NATO military base in Afghanistan this weekend. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, which took place during a ""fun run"" on the base. Experts worried that the attack could reinforce U.S. safety concerns and might prompt a future Trump administration to pull out the remaining 10,000 U.S. service members in the country.

Scott Applewhite/AP)   TRUMP TAKES WASHINGTON: -- Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham is under consideration to serve as Trump's White House press secretary. ""Trump appreciated Ingraham's loyalty through the campaign,"" The Hill's Jonathan Swan reports. ""A former white-collar defense attorney and Supreme Court law clerk, Ingraham helped Trump with debate preparation. She also campaigned on his behalf and offered occasional strategic advice."" Ingraham is reportedly in contact with people in Trump's inner circle and has ""expressed interest"" in the role. -- Irony alert: The House Freedom Caucus could find its influence crippled by the ascension of Trump. ""While Mr. Trump and the few dozen members of the Freedom Caucus may share the anti-establishment mantle, the caucus has yet to forge a relationship with the president-elect, potentially squandering an opportunity to help shape the party's agenda,"" the New York Times's Emmarie Huetteman notes. ""In assembling his presidential transition team, Mr. Trump has, so far, turned instead to less hard-line members of Congress. [And] Mr. Trump's victory defanged the Freedom Caucus's most serious threat: a challenge to the speakership of [Ryan], which could have been used as leverage toward other goals."" -- Economists say Trump's presidency will usher in a new era for the U.S. economy -- forecasting faster economic growth and higher inflation. From the Wall Street Journal's Josh Zumbrun on A1: ""The forecasts were collected from 57 academic, business and financial economists from Nov. 9 to Nov. 11. Their average forecasts for growth, inflation and interest rates in both 2017 and 2018 all rose, at least slightly, from a survey conducted before the election in October."" Meanwhile, the potential for a trade war topped the list of economic concerns, with 43 percent of economists citing it as the biggest risk. -- Chris Christie, who was replaced Friday night as leader of the Trump transition effort by Mike Pence, has lost lots of influence. The New York Post reports that Trump is so ""disgusted"" by Christie's handling of the Bridgegate scandal that the New Jersey governor is being removed from his inner circle. ""Trump thought it was shameful that Christie didn't take the fall for [convicted aide] Bridget Kelly,"" a source close to the transition team said. ""Trump is really angry that Christie is sending a soccer mom to jail. He believes 100 percent that Christie was behind it all."" Both former aides could face more than 20 years in jail. -- Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said he has no desire to serve in the president-elect's future administration, despite Trump's insistence that they could ""use somebody like him in the White House."" ""I'm not gonna go to Washington,"" Icahn said. ""My personality is such I've never worked for anyone in my life and I'm not gonna start now at my age."" (CNN Money) -- Trump's ex-wife Ivana expressed a desire to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic: ""It is where I'm from and my language and everybody knows me,"" she told the New York Post in an interview. ""I'm quite known all around the world.... I have written three books, and they were translated in 40 countries in 25 languages. I'm known by the name Ivana. I really did not need the name Trump."" -- Melania, Trump's current wife, is suing both the Daily Mail and a 70-year-old Maryland blogger for defamation, saying both sites published false stories about her involvement with an escort agency. Both sites have since issued retractions on the claim, and attorneys for blogger Webster Tarpley have asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, saying he wasn't necessarily advancing the assertions as truth. (Dan Morse)    President Obama leaves Joint Base Andrews yesterday after playing golf. (Yuri Gripas/AFP/Getty Images)   THE WORLD REACTS: -- President Obama begins his final world tour under a ""cloud of uncertainty"" about the future of America's role on the international stage, an outcome he repeatedly told nervous foreign leaders wouldn't happen. From Carol E. Lee and Marcus Walker in the Wall Street Journal: ""It isn't the curtain call that Mr. Obama expected after eight years of crisscrossing the globe to try to shape a new era of American foreign policy. In addition to ... individual meetings with [Angela] Merkel and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in Athens, [Obama] will also hold an expanded meeting with the leaders of Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and Spain while in Berlin. European leaders had hoped these meetings would focus on the economy, Russia, Syria and trans-Atlantic trade. But discussions now are likely to be dominated by what Europe might expect under Mr. Trump. 'In a moment of deep shock and depression in Europe ... this visit has become a kind of group therapy by which European leaders will try to reassure themselves that the America we know won't disappear,' said Stanford international studies scholar Josef Joffe."" -- A group of E.U. foreign ministers gathered to discuss the potential ramifications of a Trump presidency in Brussels on Sunday, vowing to hold firm on global issues -- including the Iranian nuclear deal and the Paris climate-change agreement -- while also signaling their commitment to work with the new administration. E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the United States is, for Europe, a ""key, indispensable partner"" and cited the necessity of strengthening ties with members of Trump's transition team. The session proved to be a contentious affair within the bloc, with leaders from Britain, France and Hungary each declining to attend. (Wall Street Journal) -- ""After Trump's coup, a worldwide populist deluge?"" by Griff Witte, Emily Rauhala and Dom Phillips: ""The populist wave of 2016 that carried Trump to the pinnacle of international power and influence didn't start in the United States. And it certainly won't end there. Instead, the biggest prize yet for a global movement built on a seemingly bottomless reserve of political, economic and cultural grievance is likely to be an accelerant to even more victories for people and causes bent on upending the existing world order. And unless something dramatic changes to curb the populist appeal, a scattering of surprise victories this year could soon turn into a worldwide rout -- the triumph of those who preach strong action over rule of law, unilateralism instead of cooperation and the interests of the majority above the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. 'Their world is collapsing,' tweeted an [adviser to] far-right leader Marine le Pen, following Trump's victory. 'Ours is being built.'"" -- Will a President Trump drive the world deeper into chaos and start a global trade war -- or will his radical instincts be tamed once he takes office? Two tests are likely to give us a better idea, Jackson Diehl writes. The first: appointments. Trump-tamers are hoping he will staff top national security posts with seasoned hands: Sen. Bob Corker; former national security adviser Stephen Hadley; David Petraeus. ""To do that they must overcome his strong inclination to install eccentric cronies.... The top appointments matter because they will determine whether scores of Republican foreign policy professionals join or shun the new administration."" The other big test will be Trump's handling of Putin: "" ... If he follows up on his suggestion of an early meeting with Putin, we will start to see if the new president is different from Obama and [Bush], both of whom started by trying to cultivate the Putin regime. Putin will ask for the lifting of U.S. sanctions ... and for a U.S.-Russia alliance behind the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Will Trump comply? If he does, we will know that the global order is shifting."" -- Chinese President President Xi Jinping called Trump on Sunday to congratulate him. The two ""established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another,"" according to a short statement from Trump's transition team. ""President-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward,"" it added. (CNN)    SUNDAY SHOW HIGHLIGHTS: -- Newt Gingrich said on CBS that Trump needs to be ""aggressive"" on immigration: ""They're called criminals. I mean, 2 million people would be a lot of people to deport,"" he said. ""And if, at the same time, you gain control of the border, and if you pass a guest worker program, you'd be a long way toward then three, or four, or five years from now dealing with the rest of the folks who are here without legal permission."" -- Meanwhile, Paul Ryan sought to assuage fears about Trump's immigration plan on CNN, stressing that the president-elect is not actually planning to have a roving ""deportation force"": ""We're focused on securing the border. We believe a security enforcement bill is our top priority. We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. [Trump] is not planning on that."" (Cleve R. Wootson Jr.) -- Rudy Giuliani said ""there will be a wall"" between Trump's decisions as president and his financial interests, encouraging the real estate developer to put his money in a blind trust on ABC's ""This Week."" ""For the good of the country, and the fact you don't want a question coming up every time there's a decision made, he should basically take himself out of it and just be a passive participant in the sense that he has no decision-making, no involvement,"" the former New York mayor said. ""And those decisions get made separate from him, which is the way it's done for most Cabinet offices.""  (Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Kristine Guerra) -- Kellyanne Conway called on Clinton and Obama to come forward and calm their supporters, putting the onus on the Democrats to quell the wave of anti-Trump protests that have swept across the country. Trump is ""there for them. And he is going to be a president that listens and takes the counsel of many different people, including those from the other side of the aisle,"" Conway said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""It's time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters, 'This man is our president.'""

(William Gagan/Reuters)   AMERICA, DIVIDED: -- Three in four Americans accept Trump's election as legitimate, according to a fresh Washington Post-ABC News survey. Among Clinton supporters, 58 percent say they accept the election results as legitimate, compared to 33 percent who do not. Other highlights, via pollster Scott Clement:  There are sharp racial and gender differences among the dissenters: While just 18 percent of Clinton-supporting whites say Trump is not the legitimate winner, 51 percent of black, Hispanic and other nonwhite Clinton supporters say Trump's victory was illegitimate. Women who backed the Democratic nominee are twice as likely to question Trump's win as legitimate (42-21).  -- Reports of hate-based intimidation and harassment have spiked in the United States since Election Day, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center: The civil rights organization has counted more than 200 incidents nationwide since Tuesday night's election, reporting that many -- while not all -- of the incidents directly referenced Trump's campaign. ""It's way outside of the norm,"" a spokesperson for the organization told ABC News. ""We do not see hundreds of incidents over a couple days ever. The only thing that is really analogous is the rash of hate crimes that occurred after the Brexit vote."" -- A University of Michigan student was approached by a stranger who threatened to set her on fire if she didn't remove her hijab, police said. They are investigating the incident as a hate crime.

""It's the very core of what we believe and who we are.... We don't allow a federal government that attacks immigrants to do so in our state.""

Ellison, who has emerged as a favorite for the position among liberal advocacy groups and lawmakers, has enjoyed broad support from Sens. Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer. Meanwhile, other potential contenders for the position are former Vermont governor Howard Dean, former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, South Carolina party chairman Jaime Harrison and DNC national finance chairman Henry Munoz III. (John Wagner) -- Ellison demurred on whether he would be willing to resign from his congressional seat to serve as DNC chairman, saying on ABC's ""This Week"" that the most important quality for the next party leader will be ""vision."" ""It's not about one person. It's about millions of people all working together to protect and advance the interests of working Americans,"" he said. His remarks come as some have argued that the party needs a full-time chairman at the helm as Democrats work to chart their path forward during a Trump administration. (John Wagner) -- A small group of House Democrats requested a delay in leadership elections scheduled for this Thursday, when Nancy Pelosi is expected to easily win another term as minority leader. The letter was signed by at least 20 rank-and-file members and comes as some Democrats are privately complaining that the party has struggled to regain power since the GOP gained control in 2010. Rep. Doris Matsui (Calif.) circulated a separate letter to members of the House Democratic Women's Caucus celebrating Pelosi's leadership. As of Friday afternoon 40 of the 54 women had signed the letter urging Pelosi to remain as leader. (Kelsey Snell and Karoun Demirjian)    -- Bernie said this year's presidential race was largely devoid of issues that matter to voters, urging the Democratic Party to ""pound away"" on real problems facing America's working-class voters. ""I am tired of watching television where you have a campaign which is about Mr. Trump's attitude toward women versus Hillary Clinton's emails,"" Sanders said on CBS. ""You know what? Those are not the major issues facing America. ... [And] on virtually every major issue -- raising the minimum wage, climate change, pay equity for women, rebuilding our infrastructure, making public colleges and universities tuition-free -- we are the majority,"" he said. ""That is what the American people want. And the Democrats will win elections by pounding away on those issues."" (John Wagner) -- Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore said Democrats would do well to nominate celebrity candidates for office, suggesting Oprah and Tom Hanks as 2020 contenders. ""We have so many of them,"" he said on CNN. ""The Republicans do this -- they run Reagan and the Terminator and other people."" He added: ""Why don't we run somebody that the American people love and are really drawn to, and that are smart and have good politics and all that?"" -- ""Soros bands with donors to resist Trump, 'take back power,'"" by Politico's Kenneth P. Vogel: ""George Soros and other rich liberals who spent tens of millions of dollars trying to elect [Clinton] are gathering in Washington for a three-day, closed door meeting to retool the big-money left to fight back against Trump. Yet the meeting also comes as many liberals are reassessing their approach to politics -- and the role of the Democracy Alliance, or DA, as the club is known in Democratic finance circles. The DA ... over the last decade [has] had a major hand in shaping the institutions of the left, including by orienting some of its key organizations around Clinton, and by basing their strategy around the idea that minorities and women constituted a so-called 'rising American electorate' that could tip elections to Democrats. 'The DA itself should be called into question' said one Democratic strategist who has been active in the group ... 'You can make a very good case it's nothing more than a social club for a handful wealthy white donors and labor union officials to drink wine and read memos, as the Democratic Party burns down around them.'""    Hillary Clinton arrived at The New Yorker Hotel in midtown Manhattan to concede last Wednesday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   WHY HILLARY LOST, CONT...: -- On a conference call for major donors Saturday afternoon, Hillary laid the blame squarely at the feet of James Comey, arguing that the FBI director's first letter stopped her momentum -- and his second one the Sunday before the election only exacerbated the damage. ""There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful. But our analysis is that Jim Comey's letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum,"" she told those who bundled at least $100,000. ""Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would -- saying there was no there there -- was a real motivator"" for angry or disappointed Trump voters to turn out, she added. -- ""Clinton's failure to attract enough supporters in Michigan and its Rust Belt neighbors Wisconsin and Pennsylvania cost her the election,"" Abby Phillip, John Wagner and Anne Gearan report. ""And while many reasons have been offered up, both inside and outside the campaign, one reality has emerged in the days since Clinton's stunning loss ... a series of strategic mistakes, including some made in the final two weeks, probably sealed the deal."" Three examples:  One error was to stick with the one-dimensional campaign strategy of attacking Trump, despite overwhelming evidence that the electorate was seeking a change candidate. ""There was an assumption that antipathy toward Trump would be enough to mobilize the base,"" said former Obama strategist David Axelrod. ""... [But] a certain lethargy ... sets in when you've had the White House for eight years. Your troops are just not as hungry."" Exit polls found that voters were aware of and repulsed by Trump's brashness, but it was not enough to compel them to vote against him. Another problem was devoting resources to states Clinton did not need, instead of shoring up support in critical Rust Belt states: ""Why go to Arizona? Who the hell needs Arizona?"" said Lou D'Allesandro, a New Hampshire state senator. ""You go to Michigan. You go to Pennsylvania. You play to your strengths in this business."" Clinton's lack of a simple or overarching economic message likely depressed voter turnout among her base.   -- ""Cracks, and not the ceiling kind, were evident on Clinton's last day on the trail,"" Anne Gearan recalls, looking back: ""It was somewhat jarring when the campaign added a hastily arranged midnight rally in Raleigh to the schedule. The slapdash affair in a gymnasium at North Carolina State University was a happy occasion. Trouble might have been in the air, though. Clinton badly needed black voters in North Carolina, and the crowd was overwhelmingly white."" -- ""The media narrative about the wretchedness of her political skills has obscured the fact that Hillary Clinton was a pretty great candidate for the presidency,"" New York Magazine's Rebecca Traister writes. ""Not a magnetic or inspiring speaker, no. The bearer of way too much awkward baggage, yes. But also: steady and strong and strategic and smart. Despite being under investigation by Congress and the FBI and the media, despite having her State Department emails made public ... and despite the rolling waves of sexism directed at her and the racism directed at her predecessor and political partner Obama, she literally won the popularity contest. And the fact that she tried to build a coalition of voters that brought together the marginalized groups that will one day be the majority in this country was inspired and forward-thinking, even in its ultimate failure. We have gotten a clear view of how deeply this country is invested in keeping women and people of color on the sidelines. This divide does not disappear now that the election is over, and the venom spewed by our future president and his supporters during the campaign is unlikely to subside."" -- One bright spot for Clinton: Hillary carried ORANGE COUNTY in California, the first time a Democrat has won there since FDR in 1936. ( WSJ) -- Michael Dukakis called for an end to the electoral college, blaming what he calls an ""anachronistic system"" for Tuesday's results. ""Hillary won this election, and when the votes are all counted, by what will likely be more than a million votes. So how come she isn't going to the White House in January? Because of an anachronistic Electoral College system which should have been abolished 150 years ago,"" he told Politico's Gabriel Debenedetti in an email. ""That should be at the top of the Democratic priority list while we wait to see what a Trump administration has in store for us. So far, all we know is that dozens of lobbyists are all over the Trump transition -- a strange way to drain the swamp."" -- ""To point out Clinton's popular-vote advantage is not a form of liberal denial,"" Post columnist E.J. Dionne argues. ""It's a way of beginning to build a barricade against right-wing triumphalism -- and of reminding immigrants, Muslims, African Americans, Latinos and, yes, our daughters that most Americans stood with them on Election Day. It is also not true that the emerging political coalition that elected [Obama] died on Nov. 8. That alliance maintained its national advantage ... despite an onslaught of partisan congressional investigations, Russian meddling and the last-minute political intervention of the FBI.... Obama and Clinton both did the expected thing in wishing Trump well, and Lord knows, nothing would make me happier than for Trump to surprise us by being a pragmatist who said a lot of stuff he didn't believe to win the presidency. That wish, however, does not absolve us of the obligation to vigilance against the other possibility: that the real Trump is the man we actually watched, many of us in horror, month after month.""

(Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images)   WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- ""Fraternity, not hatred, is the answer for survivors of Paris attacks,"" by James McAuley: ""Nov. 13, 2015, has already gone down as the darkest day in French history since World War II, when 130 people were killed here in an Islamic State assault on daily life: a concert, a soccer game and cafes. These assaults by homegrown terrorists have created a backlash against Muslims ... that views them as a threat to national security and strikes at the heart of one of the nation's most sacred virtues: the ideal of fraternity. But one group in particular has mobilized to defend that sense of fraternity threatened by the young terrorists. As unlikely as it is diverse, that group is made up of those who survived the Nov. 13 attacks and family members of those who died. In the year since the attacks, a surprising number of them have published books and made art in response to their grief. While each tells a different personal story, all share the same general message: Hatred is unacceptable.""

Barring a winter miracle of massive snows and rains extending into April, weather that has forsaken Southern California for more than five years, there will be 'no water available next year from the reservoir' ... A soft drizzle had fallen twice in the previous week, but the bone-dry ground absorbed it before any reached the reservoir.

But Portland's kumbaya image isn't wholly reflective of its past -- or its complicated present. Tension is high over soaring rents and gentrification that are forcing out creative types and low-income residents. And the roots of racial inequality and white supremacy simmer under the clean exterior of a growing city where just 6 percent of the population is black ... When Oregon was admitted into the Union in 1859, it was founded as a white utopia, the only state with black exclusion laws written into its Constitution -- language that voters didn't take action to remove until 2000. [Now], the contentious presidential race and the election of Trump ... seems to have provided an opportunity for Oregon's racial tensions to surface.

It means 16 of the 17 hottest years on record will have been this century. The scorching temperatures around the world, and the extreme weather they drive, mean the impacts of climate change on people are coming sooner and with more ferocity than expected, according to scientists. The El Nino weather phenomenon helped push temperatures even higher in early 2016 but the global warming caused by the greenhouse gas emissions from human activities remains the strongest factor. The WMO said human-induced global warming had contributed to at least half the extreme weather events studied in recent years, with the risk of extreme heat increasing by 10 times in some cases. 'It is almost as if mother nature is making a statement,' said climate scientist Michael Mann, at Penn State University.""

The New Orleans Saints battled back late in the fourth quarter against the Denver Broncos yesterday, tying the game 23-23 after quarterback Drew Brees threw a 32-yard touchdown with a little over one minute left, leaving just the extra-point to put them over the top. BUT Broncos defense blocked the extra point attempt and then safety Will Parks ran 84 yards for the two-point conversion the other way. Neil Greenberg says the odds of that happening were 17,000 to 1.
