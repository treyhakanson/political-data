The Federal Reserve Bank of New York says its Empire State index rose to a reading of 1.5 this month, up from minus 6.8 in October. Anything above zero signals expansion. Weaknesses still persist for New York factories despite the slight upswing. New orders and shipments turned positive this month, but manufacturers still appear to have shed workers and cut back on hours. Prices paid and received by manufacturers grew modestly. Manufacturers have been hampered by a strong dollar, which makes their goods more expensive abroad. Slow economic growth worldwide has also hurt demand. Manufacturers' outlook for the next six months became less optimistic in November compared to October. Separate reports suggest that manufacturing is still overcoming a prolonged bout of sluggishness. The Fed said last month that overall factory production rose 0.2 percent in September, although production for the past years has been flat. The Institute for Supply Management says its manufacturing index came in at 51.9 in October. Anything above 50 signals growth. Production and export orders grew faster in October. A measure of factory employment rose last month after falling for three straight months. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Lena Dunham, Shonda Rhimes, Elizabeth Banks, Chelsea Handler, Ted Danson and Constance Wu were among the entertainers who paid homage to the Democratic presidential candidate at Glamour's Women of the Year Awards Monday in Los Angeles. They listed Clinton's achievements and thanked her for her leadership as a guitarist played a somber tune.  ""We thank you for your composure, your compassion and your grace,"" Banks said, ""and for always looking so darn fierce in those freaking pantsuits."" Though Clinton wasn't in the audience, she was a presence throughout the two-hour ceremony as presenters and recipients lamented her loss to Donald Trump in last week's election. Actress Tracee Ellis Ross opened the evening by inviting guests to ""make a primal sound"" in response to the election results: She demonstrated with an exaggerated gagging noise. Despite disappointment in Clinton's failure to become the country's first female president, the tone was of empowerment and determined resolve as the magazine recognized women for achievements in art, activism, sports and business. Bono also received its first Man of the Year award. Amy Poehler introduced the U2 frontman, who was recognized for his commitment to gender equality through his ONE organization and its Poverty is Sexist campaign.  ""There is nowhere on Earth where women have the same opportunity as men,"" Bono said. ""And unless we address this problem -- both men and women together -- our world will continue down this misogynistic, violent and impoverished path."" Survivors of violence were also among the honorees Monday. Rashida Jones introduced 23-year-old Nadia Murad, who was saluted for her bravery and efforts to take ISIS to international criminal court. The extremist group murdered her parents and made Murad a sex slave, but she escaped and is fighting for justice. Stanford Law professor Michele Landis Dauber accepted an award on behalf of Emily Doe, the woman who was sexually assaulted by Stanford swimmer Brock Turner. Actresses Gabourey Sidibe, Freida Pinto and Amber Heard read portions of Doe's letter of Turner -- the powerful condemnation that went viral in June. One of the night's most poignant moments came when Rhimes recognized the founders of Black Lives Matter. Citing statistics that say black people are three times more likely to be killed by police officers than white people, Rhimes described the three women behind the movement as ""patriots."" Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi created Black Lives Matter after the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's killer in 2013.  ""These women have fundamentally altered the course of civil rights in America,"" Rhimes said. ""I believe (they) are patriots in the strongest sense of the word, for they are trying to form a more perfect union."" Other honorees included model Ashley Graham, singer-actress Zendaya and Olympic gymnast Simone Biles, whom Mindy Kaling introduced as ""my personal hero."" James Corden introduced Gwen Stefani, who thanked boyfriend Blake Shelton for ""kissing me back to life."" Venerable Vogue editor Anna Wintour presented an award to fashion designer Miuccia Prada. Laura Dern introduced lifetime achievement award recipient Christine Lagarde, the first woman to head the International Monetary Fund, who urged audience members to continue to work for gender equality.  ""No matter what sorrow, sadness, and frustration we feel, we just have to continue that fight,"" she said. ""What I hope is that all the young girls, all those yet to be born, will actually be empowered to be leaders: to be leaders in finance, to be leaders in politics, to be leaders in anything that they choose to accomplish, and will be free and will not be the victim of any discrimination. That is really worth your time and your energy, and all of mine."" ___ Follow AP Entertainment Writer Sandy Cohen at www.twitter.com/APSandy . Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Hillary Clinton blamed the renewed FBI inquiry into her State Department email system for blunting her momentum in the presidential election and the closure of that inquiry two days before Election Day for energizing voters for Donald Trump. ""There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,"" Clinton told top donors on a farewell conference call Saturday. ""But our analysis is that [FBI Director James B.] Comey's letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum,"" she said.   [A series of strategic mistakes likely sealed Clinton's fate]   ""We dropped, and we had to keep really pushing ahead to regain our advantage -- which going into the last weekend, we had. We were once again up in all but two of the battleground states, and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing. And we were feeling like we had put it back together,"" she continued.      Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said the letter from FBI Director James Comey announcing an inquiry into additional emails was ""pretty strange"" and ""unprecedented"" with days to go before Election Day. Clinton told supporters at a rally in Daytona Beach, Fla., that voters ""deserve to get full and complete facts."" (The Washington Post)   The surprise announcement of a revival of the shuttered FBI inquiry came at a time when the campaign was riding high, Clinton said. ""After the third debate, we felt so good about where we were,"" she said. Trump's performance in the Oct. 19 debate was widely panned, especially his refusal to say that he would respect the outcome of the election if he lost. Democrats called him a sore loser. ""We were up considerably in all but two of the battleground states where we were tied or one behind, according to our data,"" Clinton said. ""We were tied in Arizona. We just had a real wind at our back,"" before the first, stunning letter from Comey. Clinton's campaign insisted the reopened inquiry would turn up nothing, and many Democrats accused Comey of partisan motives. He was once a registered Republican. Comey has not commented publicly on either letter. His defenders have said there was no partisan intent and that he should not be blamed for Clinton's loss to an opponent who ultimately had a deeper well of support among voters. Clinton did not accuse Comey of partisanship Saturday. But she did say that what should have been good news essentially backfired. Comey issued another letter to Congress on the Sunday before Election Day, concluding that the nine-day examination of newly discovered emails had turned up nothing to change his earlier conclusion that there had been no criminal conduct. ""Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would -- saying there was no there there -- was a real motivator for Trump's voters,"" Clinton said. A day earlier, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri had told the same group of donors something similar -- that the news angered Trump voters and caused a spike in turnout, while Clinton's projected turnout fell. ""Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,"" Clinton said.   [Signs of trouble on Clinton's last day on the trail]   The Democrat focused on the outside events she said affected her campaign in the last three weeks of the election. She said nothing about other, larger forces at work -- Trump's message of change in a restive time, his pledge to represent the aggrieved working class, the difficulty of any political party winning a third consecutive presidential term, her own limited attention to economic anxiety, or the sexism and discomfort that surrounded her attempt to become the first female president.          1 of 57       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                         Skip Ad   x           Hillary Clinton's campaign comes to an end      View Photos   Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

Neither she nor Clinton herself addressed how Clinton's decision seven years ago to use a private system for her government communication had opened the door to the FBI inquiry in the midst of her second run for the White House. Clinton has said the decision was a mistake. ""I am heartbroken,"" she said Saturday, with a sad laugh. ""I'm not going to pretend otherwise. This is a very, very tough loss and especially because everyone worked so hard."" Before Clinton spoke Saturday, her finance director had congratulated the group of top fundraisers for bringing in more than half of the nearly $1 billion raised for Clinton's campaign. The National Finance Committee, as it was known, was made up of donors who amassed, or ""bundled"" at least $100,000 in donations from others. Finance director Dennis Cheng ran through numbers that illustrate how heavily Clinton relied upon big donors:  The campaign raised $972 million, ""of which 56 percent was generated by the people on this call."" More than 3 million people contributed. The campaign held more than 1,500 fundraising events, of which Clinton herself attended nearly 400. "

Rhyno faced challenges with balancing his political ambitions with his WWE travel schedule, however, which kept him on the road for much of the campaign. On Wednesday, Rhyno's opponent Hammoud hinted that may have given him an edge.

The remarkable triumph of the politically untested businessman was welcomed in some countries, such as Russia, while in others it was a major shock. When Trump takes office in January, world leaders will confront a man whose stated views represent a sharp break with U.S. foreign policy orthodoxy. He has cozied up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, warned stunned NATO allies they will have to pay for their own protection, floated a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and vowed to make the Mexican government finance a multibillion-dollar border wall. These changes, and others, have the potential to radically remake U.S. policy -- a prospect that has given stability-loving partners a cascading case of the jitters. Trump's victory was hailed in Russia, which has taken an increasingly aggressive stance toward the West in recent months. Putin sent Trump a congratulatory telegram Wednesday and made a televised statement expressing the hope that frayed U.S.-Russian relations could be put back on track.  ""We are aware that it is a difficult path, in view of the unfortunate degradation of relations between the Russian Federation and the United States,"" the Russian leader said, adding: ""It is not our fault that Russian-American relations are in such a state."" Russia became a focal point during the presidential campaign, with government officials and Hillary Clinton supporters suggesting Moscow was involved in hacking her campaign's emails. Trump raised eyebrows when he expressed admiration for Putin and his tough leadership style, and some Clinton backers questioned Trump's business dealings with Russia. Dmitri Drobnitski, a columnist at the generally pro-Kremlin website LifeNews, asserted Trump's victory will help the world.  ""I congratulate the American people with their will and with their democracy and with their strength and with their courage,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So this is not only a victory for the Americans, who defended their democracy against the liberal, global elite-- no, this is a victory that the American people brought to the whole world."" There is anxiety in Europe among NATO allies who are waiting to see if Trump follows through on suggestions the U.S. will look at whether they have paid their proper share in considering whether to come to their defense. That rhetoric has challenged the strategic underpinning of the NATO alliance -- in which an attack on one NATO nation is considered an attack on all -- at a time when Russia has been ever more confrontational.  ""As a candidate, Trump called into question NATO and trade agreements, and reached out to Moscow,"" said Daniela Schwarzer, an expert on trans-Atlantic relations at the German Council on Foreign Relations.  ""Even if President Trump doesn't implement everything, Germany and Europe can't rely on the trans-Atlantic partnership as usual, and will have to stand up for Western values themselves."" Trump's win also caused trepidation in Mexico, where his remarks calling Mexican immigrants criminals and ""rapists"" were a deep insult to national pride. Trump has suggested slapping a 35 percent tax on automobiles and auto parts made by U.S. companies in Mexico, and financial analysts have predicted a Trump win will threaten billions of dollars in cross-border trade. Trump's victory is ""as close to a national emergency as Mexico has faced in many decades,"" Mexican analyst Alejandro Hope said. It also caused concern in Cuba, over Trump's threat to roll back President Barack Obama's normalization of relations unless Cuban President Raul Castro agrees to more political freedoms.  ""If he reverses it, it hurts us,"" taxi driver Oriel Iglesias Garcia said. ""You know tourism will go down."" Trump's electoral triumph was also felt strongly in the volatile Middle East, where multiple crises are unfolding. One major concern is Trump's vehement opposition to the historic nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers under which Iran has curbed its nuclear program in exchange for a gradual lifting of international sanctions. In Iran, leaders emphasized the need to keep the agreement on track despite Trump's victory. The deal ""cannot be overturned by a single government,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said. Israel's leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, indicated a high comfort level with the next president, hailing Trump as a ""true friend of the state of Israel."" Iraq's leader, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, also congratulated Trump and expressed hope the ""world and the United States will continue to support Iraq in fighting terrorism."" ___ Katz reported from London.

Voters in the District's Ward 7, east of the Anacostia River, also resurrected the political career of former mayor Vincent C. Gray (D). They sent him back to the D.C.

She dismissed questions about how well she might be able to work with the new council. ""We share a lot of the same agenda around affordable housing and public safety and advancing our schools, and I intend to work with them very well on those items,"" she said. But Bowser focused most of her day on the statehood measure. She vowed to carry out the referendum quickly, delivering a petition for D.C. statehood to the next president and congressional leaders by Inauguration Day. ""This is what I've heard from D.C. residents all over the city. . . . They want to be treated like every American. They want two senators,"" she said. ""We need equality, and the only way to get there is with statehood.""  But an unexpectedly tight race for the presidency and control of the Senate left the future of the District's proposal in doubt late Tuesday.  [D.C. is about to declare it's independence -- from Congress]      View Graphic      Bowser and statehood advocates crafted the referendum in hopes of emulating how residents in Tennessee petitioned Congress to join the Union in 1796. Congress said it would grant statehood to Tennessee, a federal territory at the time, if residents there approved a constitution and committed to a republican form of government.  But partisan politics have long made D.C. statehood a non-starter with Republicans in Congress. The District has a population of more than 672,000 -- larger than that of Vermont or Wyoming -- and its residents pay more in federal taxes than do those in 22 states. But Democrats outnumber Republicans in the District by a margin of more than 2 to 1. That means that if it were allowed to become a state, the District would probably elect two Democratic senators and a Democratic member of the House, improving odds for Democratic control of both chambers for decades to come. Kathy Jasper, a third-generation Washingtonian, was among those who cast a vote in favor of the referendum. ""We pay federal taxes like we're a state. We need to see some of the benefits of being a state,"" she said. The retired recruiter said that she did not hold out hope that statehood would come soon but that it was an important message to the nation.  ""We've been trying for a long time, and we'll keep on trying,"" she said. ""It's the right thing to do."" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in an interview this year that D.C. statehood would never happen on his watch. Under the referendum, the District would create a new state for its residential areas, leaving a smaller federal district that contained government buildings and monuments. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not take a firm position on D.C. statehood during the campaign. But in an interview with The Washington Post's editorial board in the spring, he said statehood is a ""tough thing."" Bowser and statehood proponents had largely pinned their hopes for a national dialogue on the issue on the expected victory of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Over the summer, Clinton for the first time cast statehood as a presidential-election issue.   Pressing federal leaders on statehood could be one area of cooperation for Bowser and the incoming Gray. Bowser and Gray have been arrested together in a statehood protest, and as recently as Tuesday, Gray said he supports the mayor's referendum to further the cause.   But Gray also warned he would not back down on issues where the two disagree: ""I don't have any hesitation in speaking up on the policy direction I think we should take,"" he said. Dealing with Bowser won't be the only political intricacy Gray will have to navigate. His other challenges include a council that has grown increasingly liberal since he ascended to the mayor's office six years ago. The council raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour, higher than what Gray said he would support during his tenure as mayor. It also implemented a voter-approved ballot measure to legalize marijuana, a measure Gray's administration tried to stop. And the council backed Bowser in approving record spending on homeless shelters, which Gray tried to curtail as mayor. As he hugged and shook hands with a stream of supporters Tuesday, Gray said that he was confident he'd fit in and that he views himself as a progressive. But in interviews with dozens of voters Tuesday, it was clear that Gray may first have to validate his return to the council with constituents. Danielle Duncan, a 33-year-old registered Republican in Ward 7, pulled the lever for Clinton but said she still couldn't bring herself to vote for Gray. ""Ever since that scandal he was involved in, I don't trust him,"" she said. Robert Contee, 61, voted for Gray and said he welcomed his return -- in a benevolent, parenting sort of way. ""I say everybody deserves a second chance,"" Contee said. ""It's just like you would do from a parent to a child. . . . As a parent, you have to forgive.""

The District has a population of more than 672,000 -- larger than that of Vermont or Wyoming -- and its residents pay more in federal taxes than do those in 22 states. But Democrats outnumber Republicans in the District by a margin of more than 2 to 1. That means that if it were allowed to become a state, the District would probably elect two Democratic senators and a Democratic member of the House, improving odds for Democratic control of both chambers for decades to come. Kathy Jasper, a third-generation Washingtonian, was among those who cast a vote in favor of the referendum. ""We pay federal taxes like we're a state. We need to see some of the benefits of being a state,"" she said. The retired recruiter said that she did not hold out hope that statehood would come soon but that it was an important message to the nation.  ""We've been trying for a long time, and we'll keep on trying,"" she said. ""It's the right thing to do."" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in an interview this year that D.C. statehood would never happen on his watch. Under the referendum, the District would create a new state for its residential areas, leaving a smaller federal district that contained government buildings and monuments. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not take a firm position on D.C. statehood during the campaign. But in an interview with The Washington Post's editorial board in the spring, he said statehood is a ""tough thing."" Bowser and statehood proponents had largely pinned their hopes for a national dialogue on the issue on the expected victory of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Over the summer, Clinton for the first time cast statehood as a presidential-election issue.   Pressing federal leaders on statehood could be one area of cooperation for Bowser and the incoming Gray. Bowser and Gray have been arrested together in a statehood protest, and as recently as Tuesday, Gray said he supports the mayor's referendum to further the cause.   But Gray also warned he would not back down on issues where the two disagree: ""I don't have any hesitation in speaking up on the policy direction I think we should take,"" he said. Dealing with Bowser won't be the only political intricacy Gray will have to navigate. His other challenges include a council that has grown increasingly liberal since he ascended to the mayor's office six years ago. The council raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour, higher than what Gray said he would support during his tenure as mayor. It also implemented a voter-approved ballot measure to legalize marijuana, a measure Gray's administration tried to stop. And the council backed Bowser in approving record spending on homeless shelters, which Gray tried to curtail as mayor. As he hugged and shook hands with a stream of supporters Tuesday, Gray said that he was confident he'd fit in and that he views himself as a progressive. But in interviews with dozens of voters Tuesday, it was clear that Gray may first have to validate his return to the council with constituents. Danielle Duncan, a 33-year-old registered Republican in Ward 7, pulled the lever for Clinton but said she still couldn't bring herself to vote for Gray. ""Ever since that scandal he was involved in, I don't trust him,"" she said. Robert Contee, 61, voted for Gray and said he welcomed his return -- in a benevolent, parenting sort of way. ""I say everybody deserves a second chance,"" Contee said. ""It's just like you would do from a parent to a child. . . . As a parent, you have to forgive.""

"      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made his final pitch to voters in Grand Rapids, Mich., after midnight on Nov. 8. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   Whether he wins or loses, we need more people like Donald Trump in politics. I don't mean to suggest ambitious Republicans -- or Democrats for that matter -- should copy the GOP standard-bearer's braggadocio and flippant responses (to say nothing of his more crude moments) or stock up on red power ties. Love him or loathe him, there is only one Donald Trump. No one else can be him and, even if he wins, no one should try. Instead, smart politicians should take the best and leave the rest behind. That means abandoning overly scripted campaigns in favor of authenticity, listening to voters instead of to elite opinion and -- this is especially true for Republicans -- embracing the issues that propelled Trump's campaign instead of recurring to stale conservative checklists. Trump won the Republican nomination and may yet win the presidency on a platform that stands in stark contrast to the conservative catechism of the George W. Bush era. Trump's diagnosis of the problems faced by average Americans, if not his solutions, has more in common with that of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) than with that of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). And Republican voters overwhelmingly support him more for his policies than for his personality. This is evidenced by polling that shows Trump's electoral support exceeding his favorability ratings, sometimes by big percentages, and the spate of recent essays from influential conservatives encouraging voters to look at Trump's policies rather than at the man himself. Trump has run his campaign on three big themes, all of them at odds with the Republican orthodoxy of the last 30 years. Those themes are citizenship and border security, pro-worker trade policy, and an interests-based foreign policy skeptical of military intervention and winless wars. The result has been yuge opposition from Republican intellectual and policy elites, unenthusiastic endorsements from elected Republicans who are wondering how to get through this election cycle with their skin, and a base exhilarated by the message if not always by the messenger.   [The real reason Trump is winning: No one thought it was possible.]   Immigration has been central to Trump's campaign, and his promise to ""build the wall"" set him apart from his competitors for the Republican nomination. But Trump is simply reasserting the tried and true American principle that the people acting through their representatives have a right to decide who is allowed to become a citizen. Those representatives have straddled the issue for decades, intentionally avoiding making any decision. As a result, we have neither amnesty and the citizenship that goes with it nor the border security and enforcement of immigration laws that would decrease the population of undocumented immigrants living in the country. Americans expect their representatives to make hard decisions even if it the result is imperfect. Trump proposes border security -- the ""Build the Wall"" slogan separated him from his primary opponents -- and law enforcement. More important, voters find him more credible on this issue than incumbent politicians who have failed definitively to address the issue. When it comes to the economy, if only Nixon could go to China, maybe it will take a New York billionaire to bring Wall Street to heel. The serial depredations of middle America by the finance economy can no longer be ignored. For all the claims that the GOP is the party of Big Business, the truth is a bit more complicated. Yes, the policy establishment reflexively supports whatever Wall Street and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wants, often allowing their free market idealism to blind them to rent-seeking and crony capitalism. But rank and file voters have had it. The so-called ""carried interest"" loophole, for example, is a giveaway to the finance industry that Trump wants to end. His closest allies on this issue are Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). It's even the one piece of tax policy he and Clinton share in common. On trade and jobs, Trump and future Republican candidates can find common ground with many Americans who have traditionally supported Democrats. Too many Republicans have been held captive to an impractical orthodoxy, framing these issues as a purely ideological debate with free markets on one hand and statism on the other. But Trump supporters see them as real life, kitchen-table issues that need answers. Likewise, many Americans, and more Republicans than anyone would have believed a year or two ago, are highly skeptical of foreign military commitments -- the ""entangling alliances"" that George Washington warned against. They reckon the cost in blood and treasure is not worth whatever fleeting benefits are associated with winless wars. More than anything else, Trump picked up on a growing sense that elections don't have much impact on the direction of the country, that power is increasingly distant from the people. Conservatives, for example, have been too quick to back anything labeled ""free trade"" without regard to the impact on American workers. If we can restore the sovereignty of the American citizen over and against the will of so-called experts and can measure every policy by how much it benefits those citizens rather than by how closely it adheres to ideological orthodoxy, then Trump's candidacy will have achieved much good.   [Trump loves conspiracy theories. So do his supporters.]   Still, the temptation for dispossessed and displeased elites to learn the wrong lessons from this election will be almost irresistible. Trump's Republican critics contend that his supporters were too easily misled by an obvious charlatan. If true, the only solution is for the self-described grown-ups to reclaim control over the party apparatus that was snatched from them by the Trump insurrectionists. Voters had their tantrum; now back to business as usual. It's true that Trump has flaws that are uniquely his own, yet Republican voters bargained that those personal imperfections are of less national importance than the bipartisan failures of the country's existing political leadership. But there's no going back, and this analysis casually avoids the issues at the heart of Trump's campaign, issues that divide the Republican base from the professional political class. Most Americans, even those with strong ideological commitments, are Americans first and conservatives or progressives second. This is good. And it is a necessary precondition for a healthy and sustainable politics. Yet pols on both the right and left have adopted a reductionist view of politics pitting one ideology against the other in a zero-sum game. Those differences are real and they are important, but what we have in common as fellow citizens is the basis for self-government. We have politics so that we can work out those differences peacefully. Trump's candidacy represents an opportunity for intellectuals and politicians to create new alliances and unify a solid electoral majority around bedrock issues that straddle the current divide but nonetheless resonate with a majority of Americans. Whether Trump can capitalize on that or not remains to be seen, but he has tapped into a deep vein of American civic and political culture. Let's not squander it."

"   Voters line up Oct. 20 during early voting at Chavis Community Center in Raleigh, N.C. (Gerry Broome/AP)  After more than a week of warnings that early voting among African Americans was down significantly this year, number crunchers are now saying that black voters are showing up at or above their rates in 2012, when President Obama was seeking a second, historic term. That is, except for in North Carolina, where trackers are reporting that turnout among black voters is about 9 percent lower than it was four years ago. Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who also runs the U.S. Elections Project, compared the Tar Heel State with three other early-voting Southern states:   Something went very wrong for African-Americans' voting in North Carolina pic.twitter.com/ZpwjyEavmd -- Michael McDonald (@ElectProject) November 6, 2016   And Colin Campbell, a reporter for the News & Observer in Raleigh, tweeted that the state Republican Party also took note of the decline:   This @NCGOP press release on early voting statistics highlights decrease in African-Americans voting. #ncpol pic.twitter.com/wzlegECMVX -- Colin Campbell (@RaleighReporter) November 7, 2016   Although some political scientists and observers agree with McDonald's stats and concerns, others take issue with the narrative that black voters will sit out the election because Obama is no longer on the ballot. Although African Americans have said they are not enamored with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and they are even less attracted to Republican nominee Donald Trump, they have told pollsters that they think the election is important and they do intend to vote. Michael Bitzer, a political-science professor at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., said his numbers were similar to McDonald's and he attributes the decline to major changes in early-voting procedures in the state.      Donald Trump has called for his supporters to ""watch"" the polls in some cities. But claims of election rigging didn't begin with Trump's candidacy. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)   The state legislature passed a law in 2013 that lopped a week off the state's 17-day early-voting period, required specific types of identification and did away with same-day registration. The North Carolina NAACP sued, and a federal court struck down the law, restoring a week of early voting, among other provisions. But the court was not specific and some counties opted to open only one polling place during the first week of early voting.   [From a pulpit in battleground N.C., a civil rights warrior thunders a call to arms]   Bitzer pointed to Guilford County, which includes the city of Greensboro, as an example. The county has more than 364,000 registered voters, about 35 percent of whom are black, and for the first week of early voting had only one polling station open. ""Guilford has a pretty significant African American voter base, and they were substantially behind in their numbers throughout,"" he said. The North Carolina State Board of Elections rejected the argument that changes to early-voting procedures affected turnout. An emailed statement provided by Patrick Gannon, public information officer for the state board, said that each of North Carolina's 100 counties adopts its own early-voting plan that must get bipartisan approval at the county or state level. The statement also said that there were 16 percent more early-voting hours and 21 percent more early-voting sites. More than 3.1 million North Carolinians voted between Oct. 20 and Saturday, and the board, based on 2012 early-voting levels, estimates that ""66 percent of all those who will vote this election have already done so."" The statement acknowledged that some counties offered only a single early-voting site in the first week. ""However, 64 of 100 counties either matched or increased the number of early voting hours for the first week of 2016, compared to the first week in 2012. According to [elections board] data, African-American turnout decreased in all but four of those 64 counties during the first week, showing that the decrease in African-American turnout had to do with something other than the availability of early voting during the first week."" (The four counties that showed no decrease -- Ashe, Avery, Graham and Hyde -- have a combined total of 1,029 black registered voters, 829 of them in Hyde.) Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), said that the changes were disruptive, as was Hurricane Matthew, which brought flooding that shut down some small towns and dislocated residents. ""It had a profound effect on voter turnout,"" he said, but added that voters rebounded in the final week of early voting. ""I dispute any assertion North Carolina is underperforming,"" he said. ""The early vote in most of the counties that I am familiar with, and I represent 24 counties, we are equaling or surpassing the early vote in 2012,"" Butterfield said. He predicts that Clinton will take the state and that Democrat Deborah Ross will defeat Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican incumbent.   [Civil rights advocates work to prevent polling chaos]   Butterfield also disputes another oft-cited reason for lower turnout in North Carolina -- a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton and a general electoral ennui among black voters because Obama will not be on the ballot. Butterfield said what he hears from voters is just the opposite. ""I've lived in North Carolina all my life, and I can feel the energy in the African American community,"" he said. ""The ads are very effective, and man on the street is excited about the election."" Some men -- and women -- on the street would beg to differ. Michelle Foxx, 42, who two Sundays ago took part in a ""Souls to the Polls"" march from her church to an early-voting site in Greensboro, said the negative tone of the campaign has been a turnoff and Clinton has not been able to generate ""that spark."" ""A lot of people feel as though she's not genuine,"" Foxx said, but adding that people are prepared to vote for her just the same. ""No, she's not perfect. None of us are. However, the alternative is to either not exercise the right to vote or vote for a person who will not represent you in any kind of way . . . any manner that's going to be progressive to our situation or our needs."" Foxx said the best thing the Clinton campaign did was enlist Obama and first lady Michelle Obama to campaign for her in North Carolina. Both have made multiple visits to the state. Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University, said Foxx's comment is typical of what she and other researchers found in a survey on black voters' enthusiasm conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. She said although people said they weren't excited about the election, ""that doesn't mean they don't recognize that the election is important. Most people planned on voting."" In the survey, 89 percent of whites said they planned to vote, 86 percent of blacks and 83 percent of Latinos. Another poll released last week by the African American Research Collaborative showed that although black voters are far less enthusiastic than they were four years ago, they believe this election is more important than the 2012 presidential election and they intend to vote. Gillespie pointed out that there were differences among age groups, with black millennials saying they were less likely to vote than older African Americans. Older black voters also were more likely to frame their vote for Clinton as a positive statement of support, while younger black voters cast their choice as a vote against Trump. Gillespie also said she was cautious about some of her colleagues' jitters over the early-voting turnout numbers. She thinks comparing the numbers to 2012, when African Americans voted at a higher percentage than their share of the electorate, is unrealistic. A better barometer would be to look at turnout based on African American's percentage of the electorate. African Americans make up 22 percent of the state's voters and have cast 22 percent of the early-vote ballots, according to the figures in McDonald's chart and on the vote tracker on the Carolina Transparency website. Whites, who are just over 69 percent of registered voters, have cast 70 percent of early ballots. ""We shouldn't expect people to turn out at proportions larger than their numbers in the electorate,"" Gillespie said. She also said that as the numbers of Latino and Asian American voters grow, ""the black and white share of the electorate will go down."" ""We may not see record black turnout the way we did in 2012. However, it could very well be proportional to the black population itself,"" she said. ""I'm uncomfortable with characterizing black voters as being lazy and not showing up to vote. I don't think that's true or fair."""
9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2016/11/07/evan-mcmullin-supporters-just-want-to-feel-good-about-something-in-politics/	Evan McMullin supporters just want to feel good about something in politics	"   Presidential candidate Evan McMullin poses for a photograph with Derek Ball, 2, during a meet and greet at the One Man Band Diner Monday in Lehi, Utah. (Rick Bowmer/Associated Press)  LEHI, Utah -- Evan McMullin is not going to be elected president Tuesday. But his supporters don't care about that at all. The voters following him around Utah in this final campaign stretch have a simple desire to find one candidate in the 2016 election who they can feel good about. For them, that's more than enough. The line for pictures and handshakes stretched around the corner when McMullin showed up for lunch today at the One Man Band diner on Main Street here in Lehi, about 30 minutes south of Salt Lake City. Dozens arrived wearing shirts or other swag touting the 40-year-old former CIA agent who had no real political experience or name recognition before he joined the race in August. The polling in Utah is sparse. McMullin campaign staffers play down last week's Monmouth poll, which had their candidate in third place behind Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Another poll by Y2 Analytics released at the same time had McMullin in second place, five points behind Trump. Both polls show McMullin running strong with younger voters and Mormons, which makes sense considering he is younger and Mormon. Still, he is an underdog here and a long shot for sure. But for the vast majority of people I met Monday, none of that matters. ""Voting is not political chess. I want to vote for someone who I can actually support,"" said Brad Haymond, a 41-year-old Republican from Orem, Utah. ""I believe that my vote is sacred, I believe that my vote shows who I support, not who I'm against, not who I'm scared about."" The McMullin voter base is not a monolith. Some, like Haymond, are Mormons who are simply repulsed by Trump and cannot support the social policies that Clinton would put in place. ""The Mormons that are here in Utah don't believe in a man like Donald Trump,"" Haymond said. ""And most of the people in Utah are not interested in voting for Hillary Clinton in the first place."" Other McMullin voters are angry at the Republican leadership for allowing the party to fall into Trump's hands. They want to see some new political organization rise up and take its place, as McMullin has proposed. ""I was a Republican, I don't consider myself a Republican anymore,"" said Carolyn Taylor, 56, who traveled from Allen, Tex., to help get out the Utah vote for McMullin. ""The party could have put their foot down and not allowed this to happen."" Not everyone in Utah is happy with McMullin's popularity. A Trump supporter crashed his lunch event and screamed about how McMullin was handing the state to Clinton, before being escorted out of the diner by security. It's true some pro-Clinton PACs are running ads in Utah targeting Trump and even appealing to the Mormon aversion to prejudice against minorities. But undecided voters who are taking a look at McMullin in the final hours of the campaign don't want to be told they are wasting their votes. ""What I want is to feel good about the person I'm voting for, regardless of their chances of winning,"" said Taleah Kear, 28, of American Fork, Utah, who is still undecided. ""If more people stopped worrying so much about the overall outcome and just focused on what they believe in their heart, the world could be a lot different."" Many voters at today's event remarked this was the first year they could remember a presidential candidate doing old-fashioned retail politics in Utah. McMullin has about 22 paid staffers overall, but he is doing a lot of the heavy lifting himself, making several stops each day. He has one day left to make his case. My informal poll at a downtown Salt Lake City bar Sunday evening revealed that his biggest challenge will be to get more Utahans to overcome their deep disdain for politics overall after what has been an ugly and negative campaign season. Even the highway signs on Interstate 15 are darkly sarcastic about Tuesday's election. On the way back into Salt Lake City, one reads: ""Safety is the one candidate we can all live with."""
