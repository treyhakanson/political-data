Legal clinics are seeing an influx of clients. Public schools are fielding frantic questions from parents and students. Since the election, Donald Trump's tough talk on immigration has stirred anxiety nationwide among immigrants regardless of legal status. They are turning to lawyers, schools, advocacy groups and congressional offices for help.  ""We're operating with a lot of unknowns, and a certain amount of fear comes with that,"" said Vanessa Esparza-Lopez, a managing attorney at the Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center. In Chicago, a hotline run by the state's largest immigrant-rights group received more than 330 calls in the week after the election, compared with the usual 100 or so. Denver school officials sent a letter to parents in response to questions about the election's effect on students living in the country illegally. The New York Legal Assistance Group said it's receiving 40 to 60 daily calls about immigration, up from 20 to 30. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles reported 19 walk-ins on a single day, all with citizenship questions. The most urgent inquiries have been from young people benefiting from a 2012 federal program started by President Barack Obama's administration that allows immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to avoid deportation and get work permits. About 740,000 people have participated in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals system. Attorneys say the program is vulnerable because it was created by executive order, not by law, leaving new potential applicants second-guessing whether to sign up. Andrea Aguilera, a 20-year-old who attends a suburban Chicago college, feels in limbo with her DACA paperwork expiring next year. She was brought across the Mexican border illegally as a 4-year-old and largely kept her immigration status secret until she was able to get a work permit through DACA four years ago. She's since worked as a grocery store cashier and as a finance office intern at a Chicago organization. Two of her siblings are in the program. Another is a U.S. citizen.  ""It's been hard to focus on school,"" Aguilera said. ""I just don't know what's going to come next for us."" During the campaign, Trump pledged to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally and to build a border wall. The Republican president-elect has not detailed how he will proceed and recently walked back the number of anticipated deportees. The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels, explained the spike in activity as uncertainty about whether existing laws will be enforced by Trump's administration. Jon Feere, a legal analyst at the Washington D.C.-based research organization, said those enrolled in DACA were aware of the risks when they signed up. Others should have little concern.  ""Those who are in compliance with the law have nothing to worry about,"" he said. Still, even immigrants with permanent legal status have had questions since the election. Attorneys and immigrant organizations said green card holders feel new urgency to ensure that paperwork such as a renewal application is in order over fears that laws could change under a new administration. Most immigrants can seek citizenship three to five years after getting a green card. Roughly 9 million green card holders are currently eligible for citizenship, according to the most recent Department of Homeland Security statistics. Some citizens also sought clarity about when they could sponsor family members abroad.  ""People need reassurance,"" said Irina Matiychenko, who leads the immigrant protection unit at the New York Legal Assistance Group. ""People need guidance."" In Phoenix, local leaders planned a weekend meeting about being an immigrant in Arizona as an effort to ""guide us on the path of trust and unity."" Staff members at the Chicago office of Democratic U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez reported an uptick in activity with at least 60 new applications for citizenship the past two weeks. School districts, including Chicago and Denver, used the election as a way to communicate existing policy. Denver Superintendent Tom Boasberg said the 90,000-student district sent letters in four languages home in response to what teachers were hearing from students and parents. The letter reiterated that school officials do not ask about immigration status when students enroll.  ""In a time of fear and concern, lots of rumors and misinformation spread,"" he said. ""And that's why it's so important to get accurate factual information to our families from a very trusted source."" ___ Associated Press writers Astrid Galvan in Phoenix, Colleen Slevin in Denver, and Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Sophia Tareen at http://twitter.com/sophiatareen .

Theirs was a smaller and more hesitant demonstration than those staged earlier in the week by peers in Montgomery County and elsewhere.  While they were aware that Superintendent Jack Smith had called for an end to student walkouts, following incidents that left students injured or feeling threatened, the teenagers -- mostly legal immigrants or children of legal immigrants -- said they were determined to march on behalf of their undocumented classmates.  ""We are here to give those people a voice,"" said 17-year-old Odalis Moreno. ""Most of the Spanish-speaking students at our school are undocumented or working on getting their papers. . . . I want them to have that chance."" About 2 out of every 5 students at Gaithersburg High are Latino. Those who are American-born, like Moreno, don't hang out much with the newer arrivals, don't share classes and rarely interact. One group speaks English, the other Spanish. But both groups appear to share a collective dismay at Trump's rhetoric and the prospect of his presidency.   Students, including Angy Madrid, 15, holding ""End Racism"" sign, stage a morning walkout at Gaithersburg High School. (Allison Shelley/For The Washington Post)  Sophia Duran, 16, said undocumented students were discouraged by their parents from participating in Friday morning's walkout, for fear of calling unwanted attention to themselves. They were likely intimidated, she said, by the police presence outside their school and the administrators waiting to stop students before they began. ""That's why it's important we are out here,"" Duran said. ""For them."" Principal Christine Handy, bullhorn in hand, tried to direct students to the school's football stadium when they emerged from the front doors of the building at about 9:30 a.m. But the teenagers soon joined another group that had left through a back door, evading administrators, and started marching toward Lakeforest Mall.  Handy gave up on trying to stop them and decided to join them, saying she wanted to make sure they were safe. County and city police stopped traffic and followed behind the students as they chanted ""Not my president!"" and waved signs saying ""Dump Trump."" As they walked, the students heard affirming honks from passing cars, but also hoarse voices telling them to go back to school. There were middle fingers as well as fist bumps. Despite the superintendent's ban, there was no immediate talk of disciplinary measures. For Nery Espana, walking out was a way to stand up for his family and build a bridge between their experience years ago and what some of his schoolmates are facing. His parents arrived in this country from Guatemala illegally but eventually obtained citizenship. Now, Espana tutors the newly arrived Spanish-speaking students in his high school. ""We haven't talked much about it yet,"" he said about the students facing possible immigration problems. ""But I just feel like I don't want to bring it up because it will make them mad. It makes me angry."" "

The Catholic reburial service for the couple took place at St. Leonard's Crypt at the Wawel Cathedral in Krakow, where many of Poland's royals and writers are buried. President Andrzej Duda, first lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda and Prime Minister Beata Szydlo attended. The homily was said by Krakow Archishop, Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz who was personal secretary to the late pope St. John Paul II. The late president's twin brother, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is ruling conservative party leader, and the presidential couple's daughter Marta Kaczynska were also present in the small crypt. The tomb where the couple originally was laid to rest was damaged in the exhumation. A new one was crafted from white Carrara marble in two days, with Poland's national emblem, the crowned eagle on it and the couple's dates of birth and death. The bodies of Kaczynski and his wife, Maria Kaczynska, were submitted for detailed autopsies that aim to determine the cause of their deaths and of the crash in Russia. Separate investigations done by Poland and Russia right after the crash concluded it resulted from crew errors in bad weather. However, suspicion still surrounds the accident, in part because the identifications and post-mortems performed in Russia were flawed. Many followers of Jaroslaw Kaczynski think the plane was downed by an intended blast and blame Russia and Poland's prime minister at the time, Donald Tusk, who is now the president of the European Union. Analyst Marek Migalski said Kaczynski's Law and Justice party is fueling these beliefs because they consolidate the party's electorate. The private RMF FM radio station says it has learned unofficially that the couple's injuries appear typical for a plane crash, not for an explosion. Officials have said the findings from the new autopsies are expected within four months. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Large cities in states where voters were more likely to support Trump also lagged in job growth, a separate analysis by Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, a job search website, also found. The figures add credence to the idea that economic concerns contributed to Trump's unexpected victory. Eleven U.S. states reported healthy job gains in October, and the unemployment rate fell in seven, the Labor Department said Friday . Thirty-four states reported little change in employment from the previous month. The healthiest gains in the past year were in so-called ""blue"" states: Job growth was 3.5 percent in Washington state, the biggest gain nationwide. Oregon reported the next largest gain, at 3.3 percent. Other healthy increases were in Colorado, California and Nevada. There were exceptions to the trend: Florida, which supported Trump, saw hiring rise 3.1 percent in the 12 months ending in October, the third-highest total. But the smallest increases were in so-called ""red"" states that voted for the Republican candidate. Job growth was just 0.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 0.9 percent in Ohio and 1 percent in Wisconsin -- three Midwestern states that handed 48 electoral votes to Trump. And two states lost jobs in the past year: Wyoming and North Dakota, which have been hit by falling oil and coal prices. They both voted for Trump. Overall, the differences weren't huge: Job growth in blue states was 1.7 percent in the 12 months ending in October, compared with 1.5 percent in red states, according to Kolko's calculations. But there are similarities in the city data. Six of the ten metro areas with the slowest job growth were in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin. Allentown and Scranton, both in Pennsylvania, lost the most jobs of any city nationwide. Nationwide, the economy picked up in the fall even amid the contentious presidential election. Americans ramped up their shopping and applications for unemployment aid fell to a four-decade low, a sign layoffs are scarce. That's prompted steady hiring, though it has fallen from last year's pace. Employers added 161,000 jobs nationwide in October, enough to reduce the unemployment rate over time. The rate slipped to 4.9 percent from 5 percent in September. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

" A tense public meeting between the men who ran the Virginia campaigns for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton illuminated their differences and helped explain what happened on Election Day.  On one side of the stage at George Mason University sat Mark Kevin Lloyd, a tea party activist and Trump's man in Virginia. The folksy Lloyd lives outside Lynchburg -- what he calls god's country -- and relied on anecdotes to explain the Trump ""movement."" Next to him sat his counterpart on the Clinton campaign, Brian Zuzenak. Before managing the former secretary of state's Virginia operation, he worked for her friend Gov. Terry McAuliffe and ran a string of congressional races around the country. He loves data.  The pair answered questions on stage in an annual election postmortem organized by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. The questions came from Mark J. Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at the university, and the audience.  Clinton won Virginia, pulling 49.9 percent of the vote to Trump's 45 percent. It was the only Southern state to land in the Democrat's column.  Usually, the post-election analysis is a jovial conversation between two professionals who seem like they could sit down for beers after the political warfare. This wasn't that.  Here are some key moments:   It's no secret Trump was unhappy with some press coverage of the campaign. The Clinton camp wasn't thrilled either.   ""My beef with the coverage of the race is the concept of false equivalency,"" Zuzenak said. ""Emails do not equate to sexual assault and that's as simple as that.""   A testy exchange about sexual assault hinted at Trump's feeling he was falsely accused of groping women.  The release of a 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" video in which he spoke about women in lewd terms prompted many Republicans, including Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) to denounce him.  Lloyd defended his boss. ""Accusation is not adjudication. I got that from my boss. He was accused by a lot of people of a lot of things and we'll just leave it at that."" ""He also bragged about a lot of things so..."" Zuzenak said.  ""Well, we'll discuss that off line,"" Lloyd shot back.     They both hate public opinion polls.  Zuzenak: ""Public polling should be banned. It serves no purpose other than to create an artificial horserace and to get people to click, to get people to buy newspapers."" Lloyd: ""I'm with him on that."" Zuzenak: ""In a span of one week you had two polls that were 20 points different... In what world are those two polls both accurate?""   Minority groups don't vote with one voice.   Although Trump announced his campaign with a speech calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, Lloyd said there were Latino volunteers for Trump in Virginia. They favored Trump's plan to build a wall on the southern border because they spent tens of thousands of dollars to immigrate to the United States legally, he said.  A similar phenomenon played out with African Americans, he said. ""Some of my best volunteers were African American,"" he said. ""Basically they said the Democratic Party has been taking advantage of us for 50 years and we're still where we were. Give the guy a chance -- and that worked. We won.""    Clinton called Trump supporters a ""basket of deplorables"" and they wore the label proudly.  Zuzenak said he was glad Clinton apologized for the comment. And then he also took a jab at Trump.  ""I think that's a big difference between her and other folks in the race,"" he said. ""She was willing to admit when she misspoke even if there was some truth in it."" Lloyd said Trump benefitted from Clinton's blunder. ""Well they just started sending me T-shirt designs calling themselves deplorable,"" he said. ""They wore it as a badge of honor. Yeah, it motivated 'em.""   Neither side figured out how to inspire young voters.   Lloyd, a father and grandfather, said when he was growing up in the 1960s and 70s, his own parents were baffled by him in the same way that he is puzzled by young people today.  That goes doubly, he said, for millenials out ""storming the streets"" in protest over Trump.  ""That's a problem,"" Lloyd said. ""That probably began to be generated at home with baby boomers when they spoiled a bunch of kids. They're out there overreacting, throwing their temper tantrums.""   Asked to shed light on how the election could benefit women, the campaigns were lightyears apart.   Lloyd said job growth, limited government and ""the return on sanity"" under Trump would help all Americans, regardless of gender. ""A raising tide is going to raise all boats,"" he said.  Zuzenak did not agree.  ""They may have a job but they won't control their own body,"" he said.  "

The Investigative Committee said in a statement on Wednesday that Marat Oganesyan, the city's deputy governor in 2013-2015, has been detained on suspicion of embezzling 50 million rubles ($777,000) on a single contract to supply display screens for the new stadium. However, it could be only part of a much larger corruption case. Investigators said Oganesyan arranged for a friendly subcontractor to win the contract and funneled the money out via shell companies. Investigators said they have filed a motion with a local court to jail Oganesyan pending the probe. One official in the St. Petersburg city hall as well as three employees of the subcontractor are also under investigation in relation to the 69,000-seat stadium, provisionally called the Zenit Arena. Current deputy governor Igor Albin said on Twitter that ""the total sum of damages at the stadium ... exceeds 700 million rubles ($10.7 million),"" citing evidence presented to the city government's construction department.  ""No external events will influence the construction of the Zenit Arena now: the budget for the construction is balanced and everything that is needed has been bought,"" Albin added. Wednesday's announcement came amid a blitz of corruption-related arrests and investigations in Russia. Late Monday, Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev was detained over an alleged $2 million bribe, while Wednesday also saw reports of investigations at a state technology firm and a helicopter manufacturer. The St. Petersburg stadium has taken almost a decade to build, prompting Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to publicly call it ""disgraceful."" The stadium, which is to host a 2018 World Cup semifinal match, is set to cost more than $600 million. Until the ruble dropped sharply in value in 2014 against the backdrop of international sanctions and a low oil price, the same ruble budget was worth more than $1 billion, making it one of the most expensive soccer stadiums in history. The St. Petersburg City Hall in July fired the general contractor over repeated delays and cost overruns, also saying that authorities have gone to the police because it has allocated $39 million for the construction which has been unaccounted-for. Later than month President Vladimir Putin issued a special decree, ordering officials in St. Petersburg to speed up the construction. FIFA expects Zenit Arena to be delivered in December so that it is ready to host the Confederations Cup next year. There have also been several deaths of workers during construction. In the past 12 months, three have died in accidents, and investigators said Tuesday a North Korean man working on the stadium had died of an apparent heart attack in a workers' communal area at the stadium.

It was about race.	"   (Photo by Charles Ommanney/The Washington Post)  (This is the first of 3 posts.) Election swings are usually pretty uniform. States tend to shift together from one presidential election year to the next. Most demographic groups do as well. But there was one glaring exception this year: College-educated voters became a lot more Democratic and non-college educated voters became a lot more Republican. These patterns were particularly pronounced among white voters. The right-hand side of the Pew Research Center's graph below shows that college-educated whites were 10 percentage points more Democratic in 2016 than they were in 2012, while non-college whites were 14 percentage points more Republican. The upshot was a historic ""diploma divide"" in white support for Trump.    There are, of course, several plausible reasons for this growing education gap. No one factor explains everything. That said, a major factor was racial attitudes. Here is the evidence. Racial and ethnocentric attitudes were deeply implicated in Donald Trump's remarkable rise to the White House.  Racial resentment, anti-Muslim attitudes, and white identity, were all much stronger predictors of support for Trump in the 2016 primaries than they were for prior Republican nominees. Donald Trump made racial attitudes more important in the general election, too. I showed earlier that racial resentment, unfavorable opinions of African-Americans and ethnocentrism were significantly stronger predictors of whites' preferences for Trump or Clinton than they were in hypothetical match-ups between Clinton and Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. Many of these same racial attitudes are also heavily influenced by education. College-educated whites and whites who live in highly educated areas of the country have long been much more racially tolerant than other white Americans. It turns out that this relationship between education and racial attitudes explains a very large portion of the education gap in white support for Trump. Indeed, the graphs below show that the negative effects of education on white support for Trump vanishes after accounting for attitudes about both African Americans and immigrants.    Graph by Michael Tesler. Numbers at the bottom represent the sample sizes for each education category.  The left-hand graph is based on data from the September wave of RAND's Presidential Election Panel Survey. The red line shows that whites who did not attend college were about 30 points more likely to support Trump than were whites with a college degree. But after controlling for both racial and immigrant resentment, though, the black line shows that less educated whites were no more likely to support Donald Trump than their better educated counterparts. The exact same pattern occurred in YouGov's 2016 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project. The right-hand graph shows that the 25-point ""diploma divide"" in Trump support faded away after accounting for the fact that less educated whites tend to have more negative views of African-Americans and immigrants than better educated whites. In fact, no other factor explained the education gap in white support for Trump as well as racial and ethnocentric attitudes -- not partisanship, not ideology, not authoritarianism, not sexism, not income, not economic anxiety. Simply put, the education divide in white support for Trump is largely a racial attitude gap. Again, that doesn't mean that race is the only reason for the education gap in white support for Trump. Factors that aren't quantifiable in these two surveys -- such as anti-elitism and rural resentment -- likely contributed to the education gap as well. Moreover, these same surveys show that education affected support for Trump in the Republican primary even after controlling for racial and immigrant resentment. In the primary, there was clearly more to Trump's popularity among working-class whites than just race. Nevertheless, race clearly has a starring role. And it's a starring role that began before Trump announced his presidential candidacy. In the next post, I will show that racially resentful whites who did not attend college were moving away from the Democratic Party in response to Barack Obama's presidency even before Donald Trump burst onto the political scene.

The poll finds Americans still reeling from Trump's long battle against Hillary Clinton, with more than 7 in 10 saying the campaign made them angry and more than half feeling stressed out by campaign news. Trump's supporters are largely ebullient when asked how they feel about the result, while Clinton backers range from disappointed to fearful to apoplectic.  Nationally, just 3 in 10 Americans -- 29 percent -- say he has a mandate to carry out the agenda he presented during the campaign, while 59 percent say he should compromise with Democrats when they strongly disagree with the specifics of his policy proposals.  That 29 percent figure is sharply lower than the 50 percent who said the same for President Obama after his first election in 2008 and the 41 percent for former president George W. Bush after the 2000 election and the contentious recount that followed.    Beneath those findings are sharp partisan divisions in how supporters of Trump and Clinton now see the road ahead. What that means in terms of overall support for major policy changes such as repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act or reversing many of Obama's executive orders is less clear.  Not withstanding views of Trump's mandate, over 6 in 10 Americans expect to see major changes in Washington during his presidency. Almost as many say they are somewhat or very confident that the economy will improve on his watch, while 52 percent say they think living standards will increase.  On other matters, Americans are more worried. Slender majorities say they are not confident he will show respect for people with whom he disagrees or make wise decisions about war and peace.  The Post-Schar School poll was conducted Friday through Monday among 1,002 adults and included over 400 Clinton and 400 Trump voters.  More than half of all Americans say they have been dissatisfied with the way things have been going in the country and almost half, 47 percent, say they want to see large-scale changes in Washington. A 54 percent majority also say they are optimistic about the coming year. The survey finds Trump's supporters want the president-elect to take decisive action to address the nation's problems. Nearly 9 in 10 say they are dissatisfied with the country in recent years, and about 8 in 10 say ""large-scale changes"" are necessary to correct the nation's course. A 56 percent majority of Trump voters say he should carry out his agenda rather than compromise with Democrats, and 63 percent say they share his views on most issues.  These findings are set against the fact that Obama's overall approval rating stands at 56 percent -- a level he has maintained consistently for months -- and the 28 percent who strongly disapprove is the lowest level in more than five years.   Also, neither Trump nor the two parties in Congress are trusted on the issues. The poll finds fewer than 3 in 10 saying they agree with Trump, Democrats or Republicans in Congress on most issues. Majorities say they agree with each group on at least ""some"" issues. Trump said during the campaign that he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton's use of a private email account as secretary of state. The issue is one where Trump's supporters and the broader public are sharply at odds. The poll finds that, overall, 57 percent of Americans say he should not do so, while 69 percent of Trump's supporters say he should. Americans are not widely concerned about overreach at this point, with 30 percent expecting Trump to go too far while 48 percent think he will handle things about right. But the overall numbers read as a warning sign to Justin Gest, a professor of George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government, which collaborated on the survey. ""The polling numbers are telling him he should be acting more carefully,"" he said, ""That is statistically significantly lower than when Bush won despite losing the popular vote in 2000."" The acrimonious 2016 campaign appears to have taken a substantial toll on voters, particularly Clinton supporters looking back on her unsuccessful campaign. Overall, 55 percent of all Americans say they felt stressed during the campaign, with women far likelier than men to express that feeling -- 64 percent compared with 45 percent.  When asked to describe their reaction to Trump's victory in a few words, ""disappointed"" tops the list, followed by a slew of other downbeat emotions. Clinton voters also offered words such as ""shocked,"" ""scared,"" ""sad,"" ""disgusted,"" ""devastated"" and ""terrible"" to describe their reactions. While the tone of the 2016 election has been unprecedented in many ways, Clinton supporters' top-of-mind reactions this year are strikingly similar to laments of Mitt Romney's supporters in a Pew Research Center poll four years ago.  One indication of the divisions that remain after the campaign came on the question of whether the country is now ""basically okay"" or whether the campaign did ""real damage."" The results showed the country split almost evenly with 45 percent choosing each option. Eight in 10 Trump voters say the country is okay, while over three-quarters of Clinton backers detect real damage.  This Washington Post-Schar School of Policy and Government poll was conducted by telephone Nov. 11 to 14 among a random national sample of 1,002 adults and included landline and cellphone respondents as well as an oversample of respondents who supported Clinton or Trump in pre-election surveys. In total, the survey interviewed 423 Trump voters and 409 Clinton voters. Overall results have a four-point margin of sampling error.

Officer Michael Peters, an 18-year law-enforcement veteran, was seen flying the flag on Veterans Day during a ""Love Trumps Hate"" rally in Traverse City, Mich., three days after Trump's presidential win, according to the Traverse City Record-Eagle. The Traverse City Police Department launched an internal investigation into what Police Chief Jeffrey O'Brien called a ""reprehensible"" incident. ""I met with him this morning and I think he understands the ramifications of his actions,"" O'Brien told reporters during a Monday news conference. ""I'm not here to judge him; we have a process that we have to go through and we have to allow that process to be implemented. I'm asking everybody in the community to just be patient and let us do our job."" O'Brien said Peters, who is also facing a criminal investigation, was suspended with pay during the department's investigation. Hours later, the officer submitted his resignation, Traverse City Manager Marty Colburn told the Associated Press. Peters, Colburn said, apologized ""for the stain he put on the city"" and its police department. His behavior remains under investigation, Colburn said.   ['I've never seen anything like that': Confederate flags at California Veterans Day parade]   Marshall Collins, a black rally-goer, told CBS affiliate WWTV that he was with a group at the anti-Trump protest Friday night when he saw Peters pull up and rev his engine, with a Confederate flag waving from the back of his truck.      Marshall Collins Jr. attended the ""Love Trumps Hate"" rally in Traverse City, Mich., where a police officer flew a Confederate flag from his pickup truck. (9 and 10 News)   The Associated Press reported that Peters, who was off-duty at the time, parked near the rally and started drinking a beer. ""He is a role model and that's what he should be displaying here,"" Collins told WWTV. ""My confrontation was why you would bring that here, knowing what that stands for,"" Collins told the news station. ""Why would you bring that here? The fear that that flag instills in me, the fear that that flag has put in me and other people like me, why would you choose to display that?"" Collins said that ""to see him, knowing that he's a cop, knowing that he's out there to protect and serve, knowing that I have to look over my back for someone like that in our community and our department, it scares me, and it scares my family."" O'Brien, the police chief, said that any officer should understand that he lives in ""a glass house.""

""To many white Southerners, the flag is an emblem of regional heritage and pride. But to others, it has a starkly different meaning -- representing racism, slavery and the country's long history of oppression of African Americans."" The SPLC adds that ""it's difficult to make the case today that the Confederate flag is not a racist symbol. After being used sparingly for decades, it began appearing frequently in the 1950s and 1960s as white Southerners resisted efforts to dismantle Jim Crow segregation. It began to fly over state capitols and city halls across the region. Elements of it were also incorporated into several state flags. Worst of all, it became a mainstay at Ku Klux Klan rallies as the organization launched a campaign of bombings, murders and other violence against African Americans and civil rights activists."" The flag has long been the focus of debate in Southern states, a highly emotional conversation that began anew last year following a racially motivated massacre in a black church in Charleston, S.C. Subsequent images of the alleged gunman, Dylann Roof, holding the battle flag set off a bitter debate over the flag's symbolic role -- and its place on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. In one high-profile gesture, an activist climbed atop the flagpole on the statehouse grounds in Columbia, S.C., and removed the flag; she was arrested and the flag was replaced. Gov. Nikki Haley (R) eventually signed legislation to permanently remove the flag, which had flown over the capitol's dome or on its grounds for 54 years. ""In South Carolina, we honor tradition, we honor history, we honor heritage -- but there's a place for that flag, and that flag needs to be in a museum, where we will continue to make sure people will honor it appropriately,"" Haley said last year. ""But the statehouse, that's an area that belongs to everyone. And no one should drive by the statehouse and feel pain. No one should drive by the statehouse and feel like they don't belong.""   ['Stop it,' Trump tells supporters who are spreading hate. Is it enough?]   The flag incident in Traverse City came amid nationwide tension over the election results and reports that Trump supporters have been harassing religious and ethnic minorities across the country. A black student at Baylor University said she was shoved by a white male while walking to class on the morning after the election. Her assailant, a fellow student, told her ""no n -- s allowed on the sidewalk,"" she said -- then echoed Trump's campaign slogan, declaring: ""I'm just trying to make America great again."" Days later, a University of Michigan student was approached by a stranger who threatened to set her on fire if she didn't remove her hijab, campus police said. At a high school in Pennsylvania, two students paraded through the hallways with a Trump sign as one student shouted, ""white power!"" -- a moment that was captured on video. On Saturday, an Episcopal church in Silver Spring was vandalized with a chilling message: ""Trump nation. Whites only."" In an interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes"" broadcast Sunday night, Trump said that he was ""so saddened to hear"" that people were harassing others in his name. ""And I say, 'Stop it,'"" Trump said. ""If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say it right to the cameras: 'Stop it.'"" O'Brien, the police chief, said he received about 100 emails from people demanding the officer's termination, according to the Record-Eagle. ""To All Citizens, I hear you!"" O'Brien said Sunday in a statement, promising an investigation. ""Our uniform patch is embroidered with an image of the Flag of The United States. The inscription states: We pledge allegiance to the flag. The members of the Traverse City Police Department have sworn an oath and will uphold the Constitution of the United States."" He emphasized that the officer had due process under the Constitution and said, ""that process is sometimes slow."" ""We will get through this,"" O'Brien told the Record-Eagle. ""The community will get through this."" After speaking with Peters on Monday morning, O'Brien said he believed that the officer ""understands the seriousness of what he's done,"" though the chief did not elaborate on their conversation. O'Brien said he does not believe the Confederate flag should be flown; he added that Peters had displayed it on city property in the past and had been ""talked to"" about it. ""I've made my statement very clear that I do not condone Officer Peter's actions at all,"" he said. ""This is not reflective of our department. Please understand this.

But we have many misconceptions about what it is, how much of it we have, how it works and what place it occupies in history. Perhaps more than at any time in recent American history, democracy is now a subject of debate, as populist movements abroad and at home prompt questions about the rule of the many. The United States has just finished one of the most divisive campaigns in recent history, and there is no sign yet that consensus is on the way. While we ponder this election, there are certain facts about democracies at large that are worth considering.   Myth No. 1 Voters are selfish. In 2012, Mitt Romney's infamous claim that ""47 percent"" of Americans would vote for President Obama because they were ""dependent on government"" may have cost him the election. But the misapprehension Romney subscribed to is still conventional wisdom: Most people vote their pocketbooks. Rich taxpayers, the supposition goes, vote for low-tax Republicans, and poor tax consumers vote for high-tax Democrats. People vote to promote their narrow, selfish interests -- or so the myth goes. But political scientists who have studied voter behavior have found little evidence for this claim. The young and the old are about equally in favor of Social Security. Men and women are about equally supportive of abortion rights. The rich and the poor have roughly the same attitudes toward taxes and redistribution. Self-interest is a weak predictor of voter behavior. Voters are not selfish. Instead, they tend to vote for what they believe is in the national interest.  Myth No. 2 Democracy relies upon the consent of the governed. The Declaration of Independence pins the government's power to ""the consent of the governed ,"" and the Library of Congress considers the phrase key to the formation of the United States. Indeed, the idea that ours is a government of the people is a key aspect of our national self-conception.  But we no more tacitly consent to our government than a person kidnapped and placed on a ship consents to the captain's rule by refusing to jump overboard. Democracy gives the masses the power to change government, but that doesn't mean we consent to it. Philosopher David Hume made this point 25 years before the American Revolution, arguing that nearly all governments originated out of conquest.  Consider a consensual transaction. You order a pizza from Papa John's. The pizza comes only if you do something that signals you want it. If you tell Papa John's you don't want pizza, it doesn't send one. Further, when you give the company your money, it has to hold up its end and give you pizza. Your relationship to government isn't like that, even in a democracy. Regardless of what you do -- whether or how you vote, or if you dissent -- the same laws are imposed upon you. For government, your ""no"" means ""yes."" Further, courts have ruled (e.g., in  Warren v. District of Columbia ) that the government has no specific duty to protect you, even if you pay your taxes. Imagine if Papa John's took your money but never sent you pizza; you wouldn't say you consented to that deal. Myth No. 3 Political participation helps bring us together. The democratic ideal is that people with different perspectives and ideas will come together, talk, work out their differences and reach a compromise. From presidential debates to citizen comments at city council meetings, many of our attempts at political engagement center on efforts to hear one another out and join together in the project of democracy. But does it really work that way?    Many political scientists have checked. The results are generally disappointing. As political scientist Tali Mendelberg summarizes, political deliberation tends to increase conflict rather than reduce it. Deliberators either avoid talking about heated issues or, if they do talk about them, tend to become angry, try to manipulate one another or even come to blows. Legal scholar Cass Sunstein finds that deliberation pushes people to more extreme versions of their ideology; after talking to people with whom they disagree, they become more rigid in their views. Political scientist Diana Mutz finds that when people do try to understand the other side, it causes them to lose enthusiasm and stop participating in political activity.  Myth No. 4 America is a democratic country. So common is the know-it-all refrain that ""America is a constitutional republic, not a democracy"" that The Washington Post tackled that very issue last year , ruling that the two aren't mutually exclusive. And they aren't: The United States is a republic with democratic features. But we're not all that democratic. What's supposedly distinctive about democracy is that elected leaders try to give the majority what they want. Or, perhaps more precisely, politicians try to implement the policy preferences of the median voter, i.e., the voter who falls right in the middle of the ideological distribution, regardless of income or other characteristics. However, recent work puts this picture in doubt. Political scientists Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page asked: When voters at the 90th, 50th and 10th percentiles of income disagree about policy (keep in mind that they usually agree), with whom do presidents side? The answer: Presidents are much more likely to do what the wealthiest Americans want than what ordinary or poor Americans want. Surprisingly, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and President Obama tended to side with the rich even more  than George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan did. Presidents respond more to what high-income voters want than what the ideological majority wants. Just why this pattern holds is still being researched.  One possible upside: High-income voters tend to be better informed, so perhaps siding with richer voters gets us better government. Myth No. 5 Democracy is inevitable. In 1989, as the Cold War wound down, political scientist Francis Fukuyama claimed that liberal democratic capitalism was the ""end of history"" -- ""the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government."" Likewise, authors in the Harvard Business Review argued that widespread democracy is simply an inevitable consequence of the march of time. Listening to these theorists, you might conclude that the entire world is poised to adopt market economies and democratic government. But don't get too excited. Each year, Freedom House, a nongovernmental organization, and the Economist magazine independently produce indices measuring how many countries are democratic and how democratic they are. While the world generally became more democratic after the Cold War, in recent years, it's grown more authoritarian. Some formerly democratic countries are becoming non-democratic, and some democratic countries are becoming less democratic. Freedom House says that 2015 was the ""10th consecutive year of decline in global freedom,"" meaning that political freedom and freedom of the press both regressed.  Anti-democratic attitudes also seem to be on the rise. Some recent polls have found that fewer than half of millennials in Canada, the United States and Australia believe that democracy is the best form of government or that it is essential for justice.  outlook@washpost.com   Five myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.
