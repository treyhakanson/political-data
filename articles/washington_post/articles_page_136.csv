He'll meet Sunday with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in between other sessions with world leaders attending an annual Asia-Pacific summit being held in Lima, Peru. Obama also planned to take questions from the journalists who accompanied him to Greece, Germany and Peru before he flies back to Washington. Some of those questions are likely to be about Donald Trump, whose election to succeed Obama overshadowed much of the president's trip. Obama sought to reassure concerned leaders that the U.S. will stay true to its commitments despite the election of a president who opposed Obama on practically every issue.

Civil rights groups had been raising concerns about an anti-Muslim backlash in the U.S. even before the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, late in the year. The reporting period covers calendar year 2015, but comes at a time of heightened tensions following last week's presidential election. There have been reports of racist and anti-religious instances since Tuesday that have sparked outrage, including students at one school who chanted ""white power"" and a videotaped assault in Chicago that showed black men beating a white man as onlookers screamed, ""You voted Trump!"" In 2008, after Barack Obama was elected as the nation's first black president, there were also suspected cases of alleged hate crimes tied to the election. In 2015, there were 257 incidents of anti-Muslim bias compared to 154 incidents the prior year, an increase of 67 percent. The total is second only to the surge in hate crimes following the 9/11 terror attacks, when 481 incidents against Muslims were reported in 2001. The increase could be due, in part, to increased reporting by victims as well as better reporting and tracking by law enforcement agencies, although the number of all law enforcement agencies sending their data to the FBI decreased about 3 percent between 2014 and 2015. Overall, the number of reported hate crimes increased from 5,479 in 2014 to 5,850 last year, and religious-based hate crimes increased by 23 percent. Jews and Jewish institutions remain the most frequent target of religious-based hate crimes, representing 53 percent of all those reported. Crimes against Jews increased about 9 percent. ___ Follow Christina Almeida Cassidy on Twitter: http://twitter.com/AP_Christina. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that the number of incidents in 2014 was 154, not 184.

The approval comes almost a week after the Egyptian government floated its currency and raised fuel prices to qualify for the loan.

Investment and business activity also stalled, with inflation increasing to 14 percent and unemployment to 13 percent.

Now he’s on Team Trump.	"   Michael Meese, then an Army colonel and professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., introduces Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates during an event in 2008. (Cherie Cullen/Defense Department)  One of the first senior officials that President-elect Donald Trump has tapped to help guide his administration as it takes power is a retired military officer and highly regarded scholar who actively assisted Pentagon efforts to nation-build in Iraq and Afghanistan -- something Trump has repeatedly criticized. Retired Army Brig. Gen. Michael J. Meese was a senior adviser to Gen. David H. Petraeus in both countries, and spent nine years teaching at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y. He deployed from there to serve as Petraeus's assistant chief of staff in Afghanistan for a year beginning in July 2010, and to Iraq in both 2007 and 2009 to guide the surge and eventual withdrawal of U.S. troops there that Petraeus led. He also earned a doctorate from Princeton University while serving. Retired Army Col. Peter R. Mansoor, Petraeus's former No. 2 officer, said that Meese is known as bright, talented and conscientious among his peers. In Afghanistan, he was in charge of alliance relations in the headquarters of the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul, a complicated job at an especially bloody time in the war after the Obama administration surged tens of thousands of troops to battle the Taliban. ""Anyone who can keep that group heading in the same direction should be well suited to assisting the Trump team with government transition in the weeks ahead,"" Mansoor said. Meese, a 32-year Army veteran, declined to comment for this story. Originally a field artillery officer, he retired in 2013 and has served most recently as the chief operating officer of the American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association, a nonprofit that helps military families with insurance, financial planning and survivor assistance. He's seen as someone capable of assisting the Trump transition with both veterans and defense issues.    In 2012, Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter is escorted to his helicopter by Col. Michael Meese after delivering remarks to attendees at a conference at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y. (Glenn Fawcett/Defense Department)  Former colleagues describe him as affable, pragmatic and private with his political views. His father, Edwin, also is involved in the Trump transition, and is a longtime member of the Republican Party who served in several roles in the Reagan administration, including as attorney general. ""I suppose it makes sense that Mike would have inherited the same contacts and be recognized by the new administration for his gravitas,"" said Bruce Hoffman, the director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University. He recruited Meese to teach there part-time after he retired from the Army because he found his work as a founding member of the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy impressive. ""I think he's an enormously accomplished scholar and leader, and I've always found to have both an intellectual and practical approach,"" Hoffman said. In 2014, Meese argued in a piece written for the National Defense University that polarization in politics has limited the ability to enhance national security. He cited the federally mandated budget cuts known as sequestration, and argued that if defense spending must be cut, it should be used to bring down the federal deficit, and not spent on social programs. ""While some might argue the military should not comment on domestic programs or entitlement spending, it is not only appropriate, but it is essential that leaders provide their best judgment about the impact of those programs on economic security and national defense,"" he wrote. Retired Brig. Gen. Timothy Trainor, who retired as the U.S. Military Academy's academic dean in the spring, said that Meese was regarded as a team builder at the academy. He did not know Meese was considering a position with the Trump administration, but said him being involved could help reach across the aisle politically. ""The people who know Mike know that he can really help bridge divides and bring people together,"" said Trainor, now the president of Mount St. Mary's University in Maryland. ""People who know Mike know that, and know that he will be very helpful to the transition team there.""

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)  Vice President-elect Mike Pence will replace New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as chairman of President-elect Donald Trump's presidential transition effort, a change that will cement the Indiana governor's influence over the incoming administration's policy and personnel. Trump, in a broad transition shake-up announced Friday, also gave his son-in-law and three eldest children official roles as transition advisers. The involvement of Trump's adult children raises the specter of conflicts of interest, since they are poised to manage Trump's businesses over the next four years. The changes within the transition effort will substantially dilute the influence of Christie and his closest aides, add a conservative edge to the upper level of Trump's team and formally empower Trump's family in decisions about his administration. Rick Dearborn, chief of staff to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), will serve as the transition's executive director, replacing ex-Christie chief of staff Richard Bagger. Sessions is a Trump loyalist and a hard-line voice on immigration. The three Trump children -- Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump -- and Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, will serve on the transition's executive committee. The move comes after two former aides to Christie, whose administration in New Jersey has been hobbled by scandal, were convicted for their roles in politically motivated lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. Christie remains involved in the transition and was named a vice chair on Friday, along with Sessions, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Republican presidential primary contender Ben Carson -- all considered likely members of a Trump administration.   [Trump loyalists, inner circle poised to claim top government roles]   ""Together this outstanding group of advisors, led by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, will build on the initial work done under the leadership of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to help prepare a transformative government ready to lead from day one,"" Trump said in a statement. ""The mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington,"" the statement said. ""Together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation -- specifically jobs, security and opportunity.""      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   The changes come as the transition effort races to organize personnel and policy for the administration that will begin Jan. 20. Three days after Trump's surprise victory over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and one day after Trump met with leaders in Washington, campaign insiders spent Friday at Trump Tower in Manhattan discussing the next steps. The group included Christie, who met privately Thursday with campaign chairman and Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon for several hours, according to two people familiar with the meeting who requested anonymity to discuss Friday's shake-up. A senior Republican briefed on the Trump transition team's deliberations said Trump confidants, including Kushner and banker Steven Mnuchin, his campaign's national finance co-chairman and a possible Cabinet appointee, felt the transition team was too loyal to Christie and wanted to assert Trump's influence on the operation. The Republican spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks have been confidential. ""The Trump high command felt like the president-elect needed to get control of his transition,"" this person said. ""It was populated with Christie loyalists, not that they weren't for Trump, and it didn't appear to be as ramped up as it should have been. So taking a page from George W. Bush's book, he decided to put his vice president in charge."" Pence and Christie also met privately on Thursday for about 90 minutes, according to one Republican briefed on the meeting. Christie's sidelining comes as he is increasingly consumed by the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which George Washington Bridge traffic lanes were closed as political retribution against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, N.J. Christie has claimed he did not know about the scheme at the time, but multiple witnesses in the corruption trial against his former aides said he did know. The Democratic majority leader of the New Jersey Senate called Thursday for impeachment proceedings against Christie, who is seen as unable to focus full-time on transition work. Other people familiar with Friday's developments played down the reduction in Christie's power but acknowledged that he had been layered in the inner circle. They described Sessions and Dearborn as low-key presences at Trump Tower in recent days and the ""natural"" successors to Christie because of their loyalty to the candidate and populist instincts. Neither clashed with Christie, the people said. The appointment of Dearborn is intended to install someone well known to Congress to serve as a bridge between Trump Tower and Capitol Hill, helping recruit talent and processing incoming requests and resumes from lawmakers. Pence is also bringing on three of his senior advisers -- Nick Ayers, Josh Pitcock and Marc Short -- to assist him on transition work. Other prominent Trump allies, including Mnuchin, Bannon, billionaire investor Peter Thiel and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, will serve on the 16-person executive committee alongside Trump's children and son-in-law. Ethics experts and Trump opponents raised questions about the younger Trumps' participation in the transition, given the Trump Organization's announcement Friday that it is working to ""immediately transfer"" company leadership to them. ""The notion that Trump would put his company into a blind trust run by his children was already a total farce. Now, it's even more alarming that his children will be involved in the government while managing his dangerous conflicts of interest with our adversaries,"" said Jessica Mackler, the president of the liberal group American Bridge 21st Century. Other members of the executive committee are Reps. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Tom Marino (R-Pa.) and Devin Nunes (R-Calif.); Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi; conservative donor Rebekah Mercer; and New York investor Anthony Scaramucci. The transition staff will include figures familiar from Trump's campaign: Kellyanne Conway as senior adviser, Don McGahn as general counsel, David Bossie as deputy executive director, Stephen Miller as national policy director, Jason Miller as communications director and Hope Hicks as national press secretary. Dan Scavino will continue to run the social-media operation. RNC Chief of Staff Katie Walsh will serve as another senior adviser. Prominent Christie allies Bagger and Bill Palatucci, who formerly served as the transition's general counsel, will return to the private sector. Trump's announcement stated they would remain ""advisers"" to the transition. ""The signal is they've lost confidence in Christie and that Mike Pence will have a very outsized role,"" Republican consultant Rick Tyler said of the changes. ""Everything that is happening reflects the new dynamics and how Trump is going to be as president, focusing on the big picture and leaving details to others."" ""You've got people coming in who are going to help him with his agenda,"" added Tyler, a longtime adviser to Gingrich. ""This is going to be a team that's ready to work with Paul Ryan and Congress."" Giuliani was among the insiders who spent part of the day at Trump Tower. ""I can see already how he is going to be a great president,"" he told reporters in the lobby. Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.       Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani told reporters on Friday that his advice to President-elect Donald Trump is ""out of great loyalty"" and has ""no expectation"" about his role in Trump's administration.

President Obama, who had denounced Trump as unfit to serve as commander in chief, struck a conciliatory note in the Rose Garden of the White House, vowing to work with his successor to ensure a peaceful transfer. The two men, who spoke by phone early Wednesday morning, plan to meet Thursday. Claiming an electoral mandate after maintaining majorities in both chambers of Congress, Trump's resurgent Republican Party planned an aggressive and sweeping program to systematically dismantle Obama's policies and to usher in a new era of conservative governance. For the GOP, there were signs of unity after a season of acrimony brought by Trump's divisive candidacy, which antagonized party leaders. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who had all but abandoned the presidential nominee in the final weeks of the campaign, pledged that he and Trump would ""work hand-in-hand on a positive agenda to tackle this country's big challenges.""         1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flared up across the country Wednesday evening as opponents of President-elect Donald Trump expressed dismay with the election results, underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting a fractured country.

[How Donald Trump won: The insiders tell their story]  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that Trump could ""unilaterally"" unravel Obama's legacy early next year -- starting with the Affordable Care Act, the president's signature health-care accomplishment. But, McConnell said, ""I think it's always a mistake to misread your mandate, and frequently new majorities think it's going to be forever. Nothing is forever in this country. . . . We've been given a temporary lease on power, if you will. And I think we need to use it responsibly."" One key relationship for Trump could be the one with Sen. Charles E. Schumer, who is expected to become the Senate Democratic leader in January.  ""Is he going to reach out to build a Trump majority which will include Democrats, whether it's in the Cabinet or the essential relationship with Schumer, who he's known for many, many years?"" asked former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an adviser to Trump and a potential appointee in the new administration. ""He is positioned to be the president of a very large coalition -- and that coalition is bigger than the Republican Party,"" he continued. ""He has to think through, 'How do you operationalize that at a practical level that works?' ""     How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea View Graphic     How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea  Trump called Schumer on Wednesday and the senator congratulated him. ""It is time for the country to come together and heal the bitter wounds from the campaign,"" Schumer said in a statement. In New York, Trump confronted the urgent task not only of uniting a fractured nation but also of forming a government. The celebrity businessman, who has never before held public office, met at Trump Tower with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and their advisers and contemplated the makeup of his White House and Cabinet, as well as what he would do following his Jan. 20 inauguration. A transition team chaired by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) has been working in Washington since the summer to lay the groundwork for a Trump administration. The group has been run by Rich Bagger, a longtime Christie adviser; William Hagerty, a key player on 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney's transition team; and other establishment hands. Michael O. Leavitt, a former Utah governor and health secretary in President George W. Bush's Cabinet who was Romney's transition chairman, has been informally advising the Trump team. Something Trump must contemplate is how transformative his initial plans might be. ""Does he want to recruit people to manage the federal government or to change the federal government?"" Gingrich said. ""They're very different job descriptions . . . Do you go out and recruit people who've turned companies around and not just people who've managed companies? And do you set goals and metrics for them as change agents?""  [What America's choice of Donald Trump really means]  Throughout his insurgent campaign, Trump has relied on a tight-knit cadre of aides and associates and has valued their loyalty above all else. Many of them are expected to join him in Washington. Two leading candidates for White House chief of staff are believed to be Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, and Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager who is now a paid commentator for CNN, according to two people familiar with the deliberations who requested anonymity because the talks are private. Both Priebus and Lewandowski were at Trump Tower on Wednesday, as were RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer, policy adviser Stephen Miller, campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon and other advisers. Priebus and Lewandowski would bring different attributes to the job. As party chairman for nearly six years, Priebus boasts deep ties with the GOP's elected officials, donors and other luminaries, as well as a long friendship and shared Wisconsin roots with Ryan, which could prove helpful in managing relationships at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Lewandowski would be a relative newcomer to the Washington power structure but has the trust and confidence of the president-elect, having mapped out the strategy for his improbable campaign and executed it during the primaries. Trump fired Lewandowski in June, though they have remained close, and Lewandowski is credited with helping guide Trump's general-election campaign in New Hampshire.  ""Corey Lewandowski is trying very, very hard to become the chief of staff,"" said one Republican familiar with the talks about Trump's appointments. ""He's been talking about it for months, preparing for months and lining up all the right people to get it done. . . . Corey is saying it's about loyalty. Nobody is more loyal."" Trump's orbit was abuzz Wednesday with speculation about which other loyalists might land jobs in the new administration. Would Kellyanne Conway, a longtime pollster and communications guru who managed Trump's campaign in the closing months and became a calming influence on the often-undisciplined candidate, be at his side in the West Wing?  Who would be the face of the White House in the press secretary role? Boris Epshteyn, a Trump surrogate who appeared frequently on cable television and anchored the campaign's Facebook Live broadcasts? Jason Miller, the campaign's senior communications adviser? Or Spicer, a more familiar face for the Washington press corps?   [Many of Trump's sweeping promises will be hard, if not impossible, to fulfill]   Where might Christie land, after risking his political reputation to become in February one of the first establishment figures to endorse Trump? And would his connection to the bridge-closing scandal, in which two of his former aides were recently convicted, stymie his chances at Senate confirmation for Cabinet posts such as attorney general or secretary of state? Former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean (R), who has known Christie for decades, said Christie was certain to end up somewhere in the administration ""because Trump values loyalty more than anything."" William M. Daley, a former Obama White House chief of staff, said Trump should move slowly with making appointments and thoroughly vet his nominees. ""Stumbles can be devastating and convey not being ready for prime time, which will be something they should be sensitive to,"" he said. Daley counseled the president-elect's team to ""say little and act in a deliberate way,"" adding that the new administration must show that it is seasoned and can be trusted to handle a crisis. He noted Trump's poor approval ratings and the fact that Clinton beat him in the national popular vote, despite losing in the electoral college. ""People will watch to see whether the new administration acts as though it has a mandate or looks at the fact that more people voted against him than for him as a brake on those who want revenge or want to jam ideas onto a skeptical people,"" Daley said. Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former White House chief of staff to Reagan, said: ""Twenty-four hours ago, you and others were writing that Hillary's campaign was likely to succeed and we were in for four or eight more years of Obama. All that's out the window now. You have at least the opportunity for the Republicans to demonstrate that they not only have a desire but an ability to govern smartly and get this country back on track."" Leavitt said there were critical tasks for Trump beyond selecting senior White House aides and agency heads. He will be expected to craft a plan to turn his campaign priorities into legislative and executive actions; make initial contact with foreign leaders in an orderly and diplomatic way; and prepare to move his family to Washington. ""You're going from campaigning to governance, and there's a significant difference,"" Leavitt said. ""All of those are things that have to happen in 77 days [before the inauguration]. It's a massive process."" Patrick Caddell, a veteran pollster who is close to the Trump campaign, suggested that Trump ""get away to Mar-a-Lago for a few days to rest and think"" at his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., before fully diving into transition activities. ""He's got to think through how to translate a popular uprising and movement into governing,"" Caddell said. ""He's got to make sure the people he hires understand why he's there and aren't only from the management class or people who know him.""  Paul Kane contributed to this report.  "

On the last day of the presidential campaign, Clinton seemed to be a clear but not overwhelming favorite. She held a small lead in national polls and in key battleground states. Both candidates were hoping that these polls had missed something: Trump hoping for a surge in white voters that would allow him to win the White House; Clinton hoping for a surge in Latino voters that would put the race away. In Grand Rapids, Clinton talked about bringing the country together after the election was over. ""We've got to heal our country, or, as the Bible says, 'repair the breach,' because we have so much divisiveness right now,"" she said. ""We've got to start listening to each other, respecting each other.""   Donald Trump holds up a mask depicting himself as he speaks during a campaign event at Robarts Arena at the Sarasota County Fairgrounds in Sarasota, Fla., on Monday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Trump, on his final day, offered a starkly different message, full of dark warnings about what it would mean if he didn't win. He said the country was on a downward slope, hampered by a favor-trading political elite and a mismanaged economy. His opponent was corrupt. The system was rigged in her favor. And -- if Trump could not win on Tuesday -- he said his long and surprising campaign had been worthless for everyone involved. ""If we don't win, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy . . . and money,"" Trump said during a campaign stop in Raleigh. ""If we don't win, honestly, we've all wasted our time.""  [A year in Trump's America: Frustration, racial angst and a political movement]  Trump was scheduled to make stops in five states Monday: Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. He returned to themes familiar from his run to victory in the Republican primaries, attacking the news media as corrupt and protective of Clinton. These were the last rallies for Trump, the last gatherings of an unexpected movement that had begun with his ride down the escalator at Trump Tower in summer last year. The last crowds of Trump's campaign were boisterous, reflecting the GOP nominee's anger and magnifying it. They broke into shouts aimed at Clinton: ""Lock her up!"" In Raleigh, when Trump mentioned President Obama, some yelled out the same for the president: ""Lock him up!"" The atmosphere grew especially rowdy at a late afternoon stop in Scranton, Pa., where shouts of ""She's a demon!"" and ""She's a witch!"" could be heard as Trump lambasted Clinton.     At a rally in Raleigh, N.C., Nov. 7, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said it would be a different story if the United States had debt but was in ""tippy top shape."" But instead, Trump said ""everything"" from roads to schools to hospitals in the country is ""a mess."" (The Washington Post)   Clinton was scheduled to be in several states, making two stops in Pennsylvania and a stop here in Michigan, before planning to end the day with a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. President Obama also made four stops -- events that ended a chapter in his political career. Obama had begun his rise to the White House by defeating Clinton, the clear favorite, in the 2008 Democratic primaries. In making his last campaign appearances as president, he tried to help Clinton win the office he'd denied her eight years before. ""I am asking you to trust me on this one,"" Obama said at a stop in Ann Arbor, Mich. Later in the day, in the college town of Durham, N.H., Obama grew reflective, noting it was his final solo rally as president. He recounted the story of Edith Childs, the Greenwood, S.C., city councilwoman who coined the 2008 Obama campaign slogan, ""Fired Up! Ready to Go!"" -- the same story he told at his last rally on the eve of his first election. ""It's not often you have a chance to shape history. The world is watching us,"" the president told thousands of cheering supporters who filled an arena at the University of New Hampshire. ""This is one of those moments,"" Obama added. ""Don't let it slip away."" Later in the evening, Clinton held a massive rally with more than 33,000 supporters outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia, featuring a performance by rock-and-roll icon Bruce Springsteen. Clinton told that crowd that ""every issue that you care about is at stake."" Joined by former president Bill Clinton, their daughter, Chelsea, President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, the Democratic nominee pivoted away from the email controversy that dogged much of her campaign, casting the election as a choice ""between division and unity."" ""We choose to believe in a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America,"" she said. Michelle Obama, widely regarded as Clinton's most effective surrogate, spoke emotionally about the prospect of electing the first female president. ""Speaking here tonight is the last and most important thing I can do for my country as first lady,"" she said. Warning that presidential campaigns are ""breathtakingly close,"" Obama declared that the election ""is in our hands."" ""If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win,"" she said. ""But if we stay home or we play around with a protest vote, then Hillary's opponent will win. Period, end of story."" At the same time, Trump held a rally in Manchester, N.H. -- scene of his first primary victory -- in which he returned to themes of his aggressive primary campaign. He attacked the media. He called Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from nearby Massachusetts, ""Pocahontas."" He talked up his crowd size: ""Hillary can't fill a room. Look at this, look at this, this is called filling a stadium,"" Trump said, in an arena that seats less than 12,000. He then told the crowd he had received support from New England Patriots star Tom Brady and the team's coach, Bill Belichick.   [Among the few winners of this bitter election: The Obamas]  Polls will open across the country Tuesday morning, and the first polls will begin to close at 6 p.m. Eastern time. Although millions of Americans voted before Election Day, there were still some key states -- notably Pennsylvania and New Hampshire -- where nearly all voting will take place on Tuesday. Those states got special focus from both camps on Monday. For Trump, his message Monday was heavily influenced by the big news from the day before, when FBI Director James B. Comey said the bureau had completed its examination of newly discovered emails belonging to a Clinton aide -- an examination that had roiled the presidential race when it was first revealed last month. He said there was nothing in the emails to change the bureau's months-old decision not to seek charges against Clinton, the former secretary of state, for using a private email server to conduct government business. Trump, who had been trailing badly in many polls when the new emails were revealed, has since narrowed the gap, leaning on a message that Clinton was ""crooked"" and likely to be charged. On Monday, Trump changed his message about the emails, but only slightly -- adding Comey to his target list for criticism. At a midafternoon rally in Raleigh, N.C, where a supporter held up a sign reading, ""Comey You're Fired,"" Trump said the FBI director was ""obviously under tremendous pressure"" to conclude the inquiry. At the same rally, Trump painted a bleak picture of an America under Clinton, warning of imminent ""disaster,"" a hobbled economy and politics dominated by special interests. ""It's up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow,"" he declared. ""We're going to win."" ""Drain the swamp!"" his supporters chanted moments later. In the last few days of the campaign, Trump has invested time and resources in blue-leaning states, including Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Most recent opinion polls show Clinton leading in all three, but Trump is hoping for a surge among white voters who lack college degrees.  [She was born the day women got the vote. And then a century passed. . .]  ""The miners are going to come out. The steelworkers who lost their jobs are going to come out,"" Trump said Monday. He said that polls showing him behind were simply rigged. ""The women are going to come out big. It is all a phony deal. They are telling you a lot of phony stuff."" Trump also claimed -- without presenting any evidence -- that he was doing better than expected among African Americans and Hispanics. In fact, there are signs that strong Hispanic turnout could provide a big boost to Clinton. Polls have shown black and Hispanic voters overwhelmingly favor Clinton, and Clinton's campaign has touted heavy turnout among Hispanic and Asian Americans in early voting in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. More than 6.4 million voters in Florida have voted early, up nearly 35 percent over 2012, according to the Clinton campaign, with big early surges in majority-Hispanic Miami-Dade County. ""We are on the path to see more Americans vote than we have ever seen in our history,"" Clinton said in Pittsburgh. ""If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait."" Clinton made no mention of the conclusion of the FBI's email investigation during her campaign appearances. In a TV interview, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook criticized Comey's handling of the probe as ""bizarre.""  [For FBI, email investigation yields little but criticism]  ""We were glad obviously that this was resolved,"" Mook told ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""I don't understand why he couldn't have just looked into the matter and resolved it and not created such a ruckus in the campaign, but we're just glad in this last day Hillary can get back on the road.""  At her events, Clinton assailed Trump, ticking through the groups of people she said the businessman and reality TV star had targeted or offended. Clinton also criticized Trump for apparently paying no federal income taxes for several years and for refusing to release copies of his tax returns. ""There must be something really terrible in there,"" she said in a mocking tone.     The Justice Department said Monday that it would deploy more than 500 poll watchers from its Civil Rights Division to monitor voting in 67 jurisdictions in 28 states, including at least three in each of the swing states. Many of the jurisdictions have large Native American, black, Latino and Muslim populations. The department said its lawyers would be working to enforce federal voting rights laws ""to ensure that every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot."" It also has a hotline (toll free at 1-800-253-3931 or 202-307-3931) to register complaints.  Sullivan reported from Raleigh. David Nakamura, in Durham, N.H., and Matea Gold and Scott Clement in Washington contributed to this report. "

She was 78. Reno died from complications of Parkinson's disease, her goddaughter Gabrielle D'Alemberte said, adding that Reno spent her final days at home in Miami surrounded by family and friends. A former Miami prosecutor who famously told reporters ""I don't do spin,"" Reno served nearly eight years as attorney general under President Bill Clinton, the longest stint in a century. Her sister, Maggy Reno Hurchalla, told The Associated Press that Clinton called over the weekend said to ""tell Janet I love her"" and that many others from her career visited or called, including former Florida governor and Sen. Bob Graham. Bill and Hillary Clinton issued a statement praising Reno's tenure and President Barack Obama called her ""an American original"" in his own statement.  ""When Janet Reno arrived in Washington in 1993, the city had never seen anyone like her before -- and hasn't since,"" Obama said. ""Her legacy lives on in a generation of lawyers she inspired, the ordinary lives she touched, and a nation that is more just."" One of the administration's most recognizable and polarizing figures, Reno faced criticism early on for the deadly raid on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, where sect leader David Koresh and some 80 followers perished. She was known for deliberating slowly, publicly and in a blunt manner. Reno frequently said ""the buck stops with me,"" borrowing the mantra from President Harry S. Truman. After Waco, Reno figured into some of the Clinton administration's controversies and scandals, including Whitewater, Filegate, bungling at the FBI laboratory, Monica Lewinsky, alleged Chinese nuclear spying and questionable campaign financing in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election. In the spring of 2000, Reno enraged her hometown's Cuban-American community when she authorized the armed seizure of 5-year-old Elian Gonzalez. He was taken from the Little Havana home of his Miami relatives so he could be returned to his father in Cuba. During her tenure, the Justice Department prosecuted the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case, captured the ""Unabomber"" Theodore Kaczynski that same year and investigated the 1993 terrorist attack on New York's World Trade Center. The department also filed a major antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. and Reno was a strong advocate for protecting abortion clinics from violence. Attorney General Loretta Lynch praised Reno's integrity, and called her a trailblazer and ""one of the most effective, decisive and well-respected leaders"" in Justice Department history. Lynch said Reno applied one test: ""to do what the law and the facts required. She accepted the results of that test regardless of which way the political winds were blowing."" Miami U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer, who worked for Reno in Washington from 1995-2000, said, ""Even if you agreed or disagreed with her, you knew she was coming from a place of integrity."" He added, ""Through her work, through her decisions, she exhibited a lot of strength and a lot of courage."" After leaving Washington, Reno returned to Florida and ran unsuccessfully for Florida governor in 2002 but lost in a Democratic primary marred by voting problems. Born July 21, 1938, Janet Wood Reno was the daughter of two newspaper reporters and the eldest of four siblings. She grew up on the edge of the Everglades in a cypress and brick homestead built by her mother and returned there after leaving Washington. Her late brother Robert Reno was a longtime columnist for Newsday on Long Island. After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in chemistry, Reno became one of 16 women in Harvard Law School's Class of 1963. Reno, who stood over 6 feet tall, later said she wanted to become a lawyer ""because I didn't want people to tell me what to do."" In 1993, Clinton tapped her as the first woman to lead the Justice Department after his first two choices -- also women -- were withdrawn because both had hired illegal immigrants as nannies. Reno was 54.  ""It's an extraordinary experience, and I hope I do the women of America proud,"" Reno said after she won confirmation. A little more than a month of taking office, however, Reno became embroiled in controversy with the raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco. On Feb. 28, 1993, before Reno was confirmed as attorney general, U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents executing a search warrant made a surprise raid on the compound. Gunfire erupted, killing four agents and six members of the religious sect. That led to a 51-day standoff, ending April 19, 1993, when the complex caught fire and burned to the ground. The government claimed the Davidians committed suicide. Survivors said the blaze was started by tear gas rounds fired into the compound by government tanks, and that agents shot at some who tried to flee. Reno had authorized the use of the tear gas to end the standoff and later called the day the worst of her life.  ""It was a dangerous situation,"" Reno said during a 2005 lecture at Duke University. ""The tragedy is that we will never know what was the right thing to do."" In 1995 Reno was diagnosed with Parkinson's after noticing a trembling in her left hand. She said from the beginning that the diagnosis wouldn't impair her job performance. And critics -- both Republicans and Democrats -- didn't give her a pass because of it. Republicans argued she should have sought appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of Clinton-Gore fundraising violations. Democrats grumbled that she failed to act as a team player. In early 2000, Reno tried to negotiate the return to Cuba of 5-year-old Elian, who had been rescued after his mother and others drowned trying to boat from Cuba to Florida. He had been placed in the care of a Miami uncle, but his father, who lived in Cuba, wanted him returned to the island. When Reno decided talks had broken down that April, she ordered an early morning raid by federal agents who seized the boy, enraging Miami's Cuban-American community. Reno later said federal officials tried until the last minute to negotiate a voluntary handover and avoid the raid -- where Elian was found hiding in a closet and confronted by an agent with a gun.  ""We have been to great lengths to resolve this case in the least disruptive manner possible,"" she said at a news conference following the raid. As attorney general, Reno often was teased by late night talk show hosts for her unassuming appearance and no-nonsense attitude. Comedian Will Ferrell memorialized her in a recurring ""Saturday Night Live"" skit called ""Janet Reno's Dance Party"" and Reno visited the skit the night she left the Justice Department in January 2001. Reno began her career in Miami in the mid-1960s and had her first encounter with the ""glass ceiling,"" getting passed over for a job at a law firm because she was a woman. She later made partner. In 1972, she lost a race for a Miami-area legislative seat but learned the importance of sticking to her principles from mentor John Orr, a former state lawmaker.  ""Don't equivocate, don't pussyfoot, don't talk out of both sides of your mouth and you'll wake up the next morning feeling good about yourself,"" he told Reno. It became one of her favorite sayings. After losing that election, Reno was hired by the Dade State Attorney's office. In 1978, when State Attorney Richard Gerstein decided to step down, Reno became his successor. As prosecutor, Reno built programs to help reform drug dealers and combat domestic violence. Another program strong-armed deadbeat dads into paying child support, inspiring a rap song named after her. It included the line: ""All the money you get, all the checks you make; Janet Reno will make sure and take."" She also weathered a 1980 riot after an all-white jury acquitted five police officers for the beating death of a black insurance salesman. Eighteen people were killed in the rioting and crowds chanted Reno's name, accusing her of being a racist and demanding her resignation. Reno refused.  ""To resign was to give into anarchy,"" she said. Reno eventually won support in the city's black community, attending countless community meetings, church services and parades. Her last foray into politics was the race for Florida governor. Reno lost the primary to Tampa lawyer Bill McBride despite her name recognition. Republican Gov. Jeb Bush defeated McBride to win a second term. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who also worked for Reno at Justice in the 1990s, marveled at the twists and turns in her journey.  ""Hers was a great and uniquely American life and was well lived,"" Holder said in a statement. ""All who truly knew Janet loved her and all in this nation were made better by her service and by her sacrifice. I will miss her."" After retiring from politics, Reno served on the boards or as an adviser to several organizations. In 2004 she joined the board of the New York-based Innocence Project, which works to free prisoners who can be proven innocent through DNA testing. She also spent more time with her family. Shy and admittedly awkward, Reno never married but remained extremely close to her tight-knit family. Asked to describe her legacy after ending her gubernatorial campaign, Reno quoted George Washington: ""If I were to write all that down I might be reduced to tears. I would prefer to drift on down the stream of life and let history make the judgment."" ___ Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Jessica Gresko contributed to this report.
