According to the latest data released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed-rate average soared to 3.94 percent this week with an average 0.5 point. (Points are fees paid to a lender equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.) That's 37 basis points higher than a week ago when it was 3.57 percent and the fifth-largest one-week jump in the 30-year fixed rate since 2000. (A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.) It was 3.97 percent a year ago. The 30-year fixed rate hasn't been this high since January. The 15-year fixed-rate average jumped to 3.14 percent with an average 0.5 point. It was 2.88 percent a week ago and 3.18 percent a year ago. The 15-year fixed rate hasn't been above 3 percent since February. The five-year adjustable rate average climbed to 3.07 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 2.88 percent a week ago and 2.98 percent a year ago. This is the first time since January the five-year ARM has been higher than 3 percent. ""This week's increase in mortgage rates, being dubbed the 'Trump Tantrum,' is the biggest one week increase since the 'Taper Tantrum' in June 2013,"" said Greg McBride, senior vice president and chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.   [What effect the Trump administration will have on the housing market]   Since Trump was elected president, investors have flooded the stock market and pulled out of the bond markets. Treasury yields have skyrocketed, rising 44 basis points in the past week to their highest level since January. The yield on a 10-year bond went from 1.79 percent on Nov. 4 to 2.23 percent on Monday. The movement of the 10-year Treasury bond is one of the best indicators of whether mortgage rates will rise or fall. When yields go up, mortgage rates tend to follow. Higher home loan rates may put a damper on the housing recovery. With lack of inventory driving up home prices in some markets, higher rates will make housing less affordable. However, if the economy gets a boost and wages grow under Trump, higher rates may not matter as much.   [Low inventory is D.C. area housing market's biggest concern]   ""As we continue to learn more about shape of the new administration, their policies, and the global reaction, we expect more volatility as markets try to put a price on the political developments,"" said Erin Lantz, Zillow Group vice president of mortgages. ""Consumers considering buying or refinancing now should stay patient, as we'll likely see rates stabilize once markets find a new equilibrium."" Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found the experts it surveyed were split over where rates were headed in the coming week. Half said they would fall, 40 percent said they would rise and 10 percent said they would remain relatively unchanged. Brett Sinnott, vice president of capital markets at CMG Financial, is one who believes rates will move higher. ""Bonds continue to get hammered as the election results have both the stock market and the U.S. dollar soaring,"" he said. ""Many people have missed that China is continuing to sell U.S. Treasuries, which is also causing a disruption to the market. Investors still believe that there will be a rate hike by the Fed in December and markets are still trying to build in the change ahead of the Fed meeting. This will hopefully lead to a scenario similar to last year in which an initial overreaction was followed by a strong rally and falling mortgage rates. Markets continue to remain choppy as both the Fed's decision and the new President's agenda have yet to be fully uncovered, leading to uncertainty in several markets, both domestic and foreign."" McBride thinks rates will go down. ""Rates have rocketed higher -- too far, too fast -- based only on speculation and not specifics,"" he said. ""Time for a pause."" Meanwhile, higher rates caused mortgage applications to plummet this week, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market composite index -- a measure of total loan application volume -- fell 9.2 percent from the previous week. The refinance index sank 11 percent to its lowest level in eight months, while the purchase index dropped 6 percent to its lowest level since January. The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 61.9 percent of all applications. ""Investor expectations of faster growth and higher inflation are driving the jump up in rates, and rates have now increased for five of the past six weeks, spurring a commensurate drop in refinance activity,"" David H. Stevens, president and chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said in a statement."

The Baltimore Sun reports (http://bsun.md/2eJG0BT) state environmental regulators filed a petition Wednesday asking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to crack down on 19 coal plants in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia whose emissions they say make Maryland's air unhealthy to breathe on hot summer days. The plants have spent billions of dollars on technologies to reduce pollution, but state environment secretary Ben Grumbles says they're not using them every day during the summer, when the heat and sunshine cause the pollutant ozone to form and make air quality its worst. Officials estimate that 70 percent of Maryland's ozone pollution comes from upwind states. Maryland is asking the EPA to act before this summer. ___ Information from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/11/17/the-ultimate-qa-about-health-care-under-president-trump/	The ultimate Q&A about health care under a Trump presidency	"      Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)   While it's pretty much a given that the Affordable Care Act won't survive a Trump presidency and Republican Congress in its current form, there are sweeping implications of reversing a law that has reached in so many ways into our health care system. The government has never undone a major benefits program after it has taken effect -- and neither the incoming administration nor GOP lawmakers know exactly how they'll replace it. If your head is spinning because of the politics and lingo that's being thrown around, here's a primer on what we know about the president-elect's plans so far and what they might mean for the ACA marketplaces and for you personally. Let's start at the beginning. What did Donald Trump promise on the campaign trail? As a candidate, Trump released a plan, ""Healthcare Reform to Make America Great Again,"" which called for a full repeal of Obama's signature domestic achievement on ""day one"" of the new administration. You can read the original text here. He later said he would call Congress into special session to repeal the law. Now that he has been elected president, Trump's timeline is unclear. Most of what he wants to do requires an act of Congress. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill say that ending the ACA is a priority for them, too. But lawmakers' aides have not yet begun to compare notes with the president-elect and his transition team on substance or strategy. What has he said on the subject since the election? Last week Trump created a stir by saying he might ""amend"" the ACA instead of repealing and replacing it. But his views on the substance of the law didn't change. As he'd said during his campaign, he mentioned keeping the provision that forbids insurers to deny coverage to people with preexisting medical problems. He also said he'd like to continue letting young adults stay on their parents' insurance policies until they are 26 -- an idea that has been part of House Republicans' health-care plan.    (Excerpt from The Wall Street Journal interview with President-elect Donald Trump.)  On Sunday, Trump talked about the ACA during  an interview on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" with reporter Lesley Stahl. Repealing and replacing the law would be done ""simultaneously,"" he explained, so that people would not face a limbo period with no insurance. ""It'll be better health care, much better, for less money,"" he promised. ""Not a bad combination."" Trump has revised other health-care positions to conform more closely to the heart of Republican thinking in recent decades. On his presidential transition site, GreatAgain.gov, he has added antiabortion statements and several policy positions that were not part of his campaign's platform as well as deleted a few proposals. A Washington Post story that ran several days after the election detailed some of the changes.      Post reporter Amy Goldstein walks us through what changes health care will face under a Trump presidency. President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. (The Washington Post)   If Congress and the Trump White House repeal the ACA, how soon would my marketplace health plan go away? It's hard to know, but there are some clues. Early this year, when lawmakers sent Obama an ACA-repeal bill, which they knew he wouldn't sign, they included in the legislation a two-year period before the marketplaces and other parts of the law ceased. Right now, the fourth year's open enrollment for marketplace health plans is underway. The plans that consumers can buy until Jan. 31 have pledged to participate through 2017. More than eight in 10 ACA customers receive federal subsidies to help pay for their premiums, and it is unlikely that those will go away as soon as Trump takes office. According to the Health and Human Services Department, just over 1 million people chose ACA health plans during the first 12 days of this month, about 50,000 more than the same period a year ago. That puts enrollment roughly on pace to match the 1.6 million who signed up during the first three weeks of the last enrollment period. HHS officials said that sign-ups increased during the three days after the election. I have a 23-year-old son without a full-time job. Will he lose his coverage through my insurance plan? This is unclear -- but might not change. After the election, Trump began to say that he likes the ACA provision that lets young adults stay on their parents' policy until they are 26. House Republicans support this idea, too. I'm being bombarded with messages on social media urging me to get an IUD before coverage for birth control disappears. How seriously should I take this? Will I lose really lose that benefit?   I have truly never been more shocked in my life. Hug your friends a little tighter, promise to protect each other, & everyone go get an IUD -- Rachel Varina (@rachelvarina) November 9, 2016   In the 24 to 48 hours following the election, it was hard to ignore panic about birth control. Cosmo magazine reported that ""Women Are Urging Each Other to Get IUDs Now -- Before It's Too Late,"" and Quartz warned that ""a Trump presidency will threaten women's reproductive rights."" Many commentators raised the idea of women getting an IUD, a intrauterine device type of birth control that is reversible but long-lasting, noting that it could get them through an entire presidential term. For the past six years under the ACA, women have had access to free birth control through their insurance plans because of a provision requiring coverage for preventive health benefits. Trump hasn't addressed this issue, but fears have been stoked because he became more clearly opposed to abortion as the campaign went on. And Vice President-elect Mike Pence is a strong social conservative who opposes abortion in almost all circumstances. Technically speaking, Trump might not even have to rely on Congress to get rid of these benefits. HHS could redefine what types of services must be included among the preventive care the law requires insurers to provide. For more details on this, check out Vox's explainer. That's not very reassuring. What about coverage for other benefits we have now? Should I stock up on the medicine I have to take regularly for diabetes, arthritis or other chronic diseases or conditions? Feeling anxious about the upcoming changes is understandable because they will likely be pretty big. But doctors recommend against hoarding prescription drugs. Even if the law or federal rules change, it may take a little time to figure out exactly what has happened. When the ACA was passed, patient groups months combed through the documentation for months before figuring out that HIV drugs, for example, weren't covered adequately in some cases.    Marketplace guide Jim Prim works on Healthcare.gov as he helps a Delaware resident sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act in 2014. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)  Will the ACA insurance exchanges go away? If so, where would people who don't get insurance through an employer obtain coverage?  Trump has not provided a lot of details. Again, Congress's last attempt to repeal the ACA would have had a two-year transition period. And remember, for all the attention they get, marketplace health plans are covering about 11 million people -- a small fraction of the approximately 214 million people with any kind of private health insurance at last count by the U.S. Census.     What will happen to health insurance prices? This is a big debate among economists. To understand why this question is so difficult to answer, you have to look at the recent history of health plan prices before and after the ACA. Before, premiums purchased by individuals were rising about 10 percent per year -- but because insurers were able to deny coverage to sick people, they were able to keep overall costs down. That changed when the law required companies to insure everyone. In 2014, the first year of the insurance exchanges, analyses showed that prices for certain benchmark plans were 10 to 20 percent cheaper than before the law took effect. Prices have climbed since then, but liberal and conservative economists have argued over whether the increases were more or less than what would have happened without the ACA. An important point to keep in mind is that most people who buy in an ACA market get subsidies. Trump has not detailed whether he would offer similar assistance or whether his tax proposals would end up saving people more than under Obamacare. I'm getting a monthly subsidy that lowers the premium of my ACA plan. What will happen to this subsidy? The law's subsidies might go away. Under some Republican thinking, you and other consumers might be able to make up part of the money by deducting the premiums from your taxes. But critics say that would not help lower-income people, who do not pay much, if any, in taxes. I'm finishing college and deciding where to move. Which states are most likely to have affordable health care for people with low-paying jobs in the next few years -- and which are least likely? This is a tough one as we're still in the early stages of postelection discussion on what will replace the ACA. If you need to make an immediate decision, it's worth looking at how certain states have historically dealt with the issue of health insurance. Massachusetts has been at the forefront of offering universal access to health care for years and would probably still be a good bet. The state implemented its own version of the ACA several years before the federal law took effect nationally; that will remain in place even if the ACA goes away. It might also be helpful to look at states that set up their own insurance exchanges and expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA. While your low-paying job may or may not meet the Medicaid threshold, the overall trend in these states is toward more people being covered (though it is uncertain if those states would continue to get extra federal money for their Medicaid beneficiaries). Below is a map of the 19 states that opted against Medicaid expansion. The list, from the Kaiser Family Foundation, was current as of October.       Since Trump keeps saying he wants to replace the ACA, what are his main ideas and where do they come from? Have they ever been tried before? Taking away health insurance from about 20 million people -- which would happen if the ACA were repealed with no replacement -- would be wildly unpopular, and Trump has outlined several parts of a possible successor plan. Some of the ideas come from legislation that was introduced in recent years by congressional Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, but has never become law. The major changes Trump has endorsed, often without details, include:  changing the tax code to allow individuals to fully deduct all health insurance premiums; allowing insurance plans to be sold across state lines, presumably increasing competition; ensuring price transparency for medical procedures and other health care costs; expanding access to health savings accounts that are tax free; turning Medicaid into block grants to states; allowing medications to be imported, creating more competition in drug pricing. (This shows up on Trump's campaign page but not on his transition page.)  Give me the high-level numbers. What would be the impact of Trump's positions on insurance marketplaces and the economy? Most analyses agree that many more people would be uninsured but differ on how the federal deficit would be affected. According to Rand Corp., in the first full year of the new administration, Trump's proposals would result in about 20 million previously insured Americans going without health coverage and would add nearly $6 billion to the deficit.    (Rand Corp.)  In contrast, the Center for Health and Economy, which is nonpartisan and includes both liberal and conservative experts, estimates that 18 million people -- mostly low-income adults -- would become uninsured in the first year and that Trump's changes would decrease the deficit by $583 billion between 2017 and 2026. Previously, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which promotes fiscal constraint and is anti-deficit, calculated that repealing the ACA would double the number of uninsured, leading to more than 21 million people losing coverage, and would cost $550 billion over a decade. The Congressional Budget Office in 2015 estimated 22 million fewer people would have coverage in 2017 if a repeal bill were enacted. Tell me more about making Medicaid a block-grant program for states. What does that mean, and what difference would that probably make? Since it began in the mid-1960s, Medicaid has been an entitlement program, which means that it is an open-ended commitment to cover everyone who qualifies for it. In return, states must cover certain groups of people and certain benefits, though they have some freedom to include or exclude some discretionary benefits and to set eligibility rules. The result is that federal spending on Medicaid varies from year to year, depending on how many people are in the program and how much care they use. In contrast, under a block grant, the government would give states a lump sum of money. Kaiser Health News has a good explanation of how this would work. Critics say that, over time, a lot of money would be cut from Medicaid if the federal grants fail to keep pace with the program's costs, inevitably eroding eligibility and benefits. Yet supporters say block grants would encourage states to reduce waste, save the federal government billions of dollars and give states more freedom to choose how to implement the program. Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, block grants can be done in a way that would satisfy both sides. Speaking to Politico, Cass said that savings from implementing the grants could then be used for other anti-poverty programs. Another looming question is what will happen with the part of the ACA intended to expand Medicaid eligibility to people with slightly higher incomes -- up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which this year is about $16,000 for an individual and $33,000 for a family of four. Thirty-one states and the District did expansion. It is unclear whether, in making other changes to Medicaid, Trump would let them keep the extra federal money they received for enrolling newly eligible people. Lena H.

Some lawmakers, who are debating the 2017 budget proposals further Thursday, have warned that the budget changes will cause public unrest beyond the strikes, which are scheduled for Nov. 27-29. The government's budget proposals include a rise in sales tax from 15 percent to 17 percent, hikes in gasoline prices and higher taxes on cigarettes, as well as public sector salary freezes.  ""The list of new taxes will push people to the streets,"" Nora Mahiout of the opposition Front of Socialist Forces said during a debate Wednesday in the lower house of Parliament. Other critics have accused the government and well-connected tycoons of amassing fortunes while ordinary Algerians struggle with inflation. Legislators from the pro-government RND party, meanwhile, are criticizing the budget as inadequate to solve the gas-dependent country's deep economic problems. Algeria's revenues have shrunk sharply over the past two years as oil prices fell sharply.  ""The government doesn't have a viable strategy for solving the crisis. ... it has the tendency to turn to temporary solutions that are not up to the economic crisis that the country is undergoing,"" said Salah Dakhli, RND lawmaker. The government, he added, is ""waiting for a miracle instead of seeking solutions."" Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal appealed ""for the understanding of the Algerian people in these difficult times."" He said the government chose to raise taxes to keep debt under control, and noted that it is preserving some price subsidies. Economist Rachid Preur warned that the tax rises are just an ""hors d'ouvre"" and that the government will have to cut those subsidies eventually, too. ""Things will get complicated in the future, and it will be impossible to maintain the subsidy policy."" Algeria, which suffered a decade of violence in the 1990s between Islamic fundamentalists and security forces, has long used price subsidies to maintain social peace, notably as uprisings swept neighboring Arab countries in 2011.

""As of a little later today, that's accurate,"" she said when asked if she would be leaving her post. She declined to say whether she had resigned or was pushed out by management. ""I was thrilled to work at the magazine -- really, really thrilled, and we had a great staff and I'm really proud of what we did,"" she told this blog. Pollock said that memos would soon be issued by Bloomberg outlining the organization's plans for the magazine, though she declined to detail any of them. Whatever the memo may state, this turn of events cannot reassure staffers. Pollock, after all, will have served only about a year in her post, having taken over in October 2015 after the departure of Josh Tyrangiel. Even so, she was a Businessweek veteran, having started at the publication in 2007; before that, she'd spent 18 years at the Wall Street Journal. Bloomberg bought Businessweek in 2009. Notes a staffer: ""Ellen was universally beloved and respected, tough as nails in a male-dominated company, and the whole staff is astonished and grieving."" The weeks following the presidential election are busy ones for media organizations, which generally hold off on restructuring until the ballots have been cast. Back in May, Bloomberg LP founder Michael Bloomberg was asked at a Washington meeting what he'd do about the Bloomberg TV program ""With All Due Respect,"" which is anchored by political reporters Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. In a dismissive remark, Bloomberg said they'd probably run off and write a book -- which is an historically accurate observation, given their ""Game Change"" franchise. ""Mike wondered aloud if they were going to stay on after the inauguration,"" said a source. In a staff memo Thursday, Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait and Bloomberg Media CEO Justin Smith announced that Megan Murphy, Bloomberg News's Washington bureau chief, will take over as editor of the magazine and that Pollock's deputy, Brad Wieners, would be leaving. Though the memo praised the work of the magazine, it also cites ""challenges"" that it faces. ""The magazine is not integrated enough into the rest of our editorial operations. And BBW's business model has also not evolved as quickly as the market around it - and does not have enough of a focus on digital innovation. The revenue model is still too reliant on declining print advertising rather than digital or multi-platform subscriber revenue,"" write the executives.  A source at Bloomberg tells the Erik Wemple Blog that the magazine loses between $20 and $30 million per year -- and that Businessweek's status as a separate fiefdom was a consideration in Pollock's departure. Another source indicates that Pollock was ""blindsided"" by the events.  The integration of the magazine with the rest of the editorial operation at Bloomberg will require some thoroughgoing adjustments, and pain. ""What will emerge from this will be very different from the stand-alone magazine you all write for at the moment which Ellen has led so diligently,"" reads the memo. ""As we will explain later, many of you will soon report to different beat editors, and, once we have unveiled the new magazine, the central editorial team may well be smaller."" Change will also impact the commercial side of things. A new ""publishing director"" position is being created to insert a ""greater focus on consumer marketing (especially digital subscriptions) alongside advertising revenue."""

She put up images of several men with beards: An Orthodox Jew, a hipster, a communist, an Ottoman Caliph, a Sikh, and a Muslim. She wrote that having a beard was not what made a man holy or a Muslim. And she pointed out that one of Islam's staunchest critics during the time of Prophet Muhammad had an even longer beard than him. The frank comments are typical of this twice-divorced mother of six and graduate of Islamic law, who is in many ways a walking challenge to taboos in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia. Raised a devout girl in a large tribe where she tended sheep, al-Shammary is now a 42-year-old liberal feminist who roots her arguments in Islam, taking on Saudi Arabia's powerful religious establishment. She has paid a price for her opinions. She spent three months in prison without charge for ""agitating public opinion."" She has been barred by the government from traveling abroad. Her co-founder of the online forum Free Saudi Liberals Network, blogger Raif Badawi, is serving a 10-year prison sentence and was publicly lashed 50 times. Her father disowned her in public. None of it was enough to keep her quiet.  ""I have rights that I don't view as against my religion,"" says al-Shammary. ""I want to ask for these rights, and I want those who make decisions to hear me and act."" ___ Across the Arab world, female Islamic scholars and activists have long been pushing for interpretations of Shariah law that allow women more freedom. They hold that Islam considers men and women as equals before God, but centuries of selective interpretation have twisted its spirit.  ""Discrimination came from a reading of the religion, not the religion itself,"" says Olfa Youssef, a professor of Islamic studies in Tunisia and member of the Musawah global movement of Muslim feminists. Al-Shammary is one of the most vocal and high-profile religious and women's rights activists within Saudi Arabia. Advocates here are demanding an end to so-called male guardianship rules that essentially treat women as minors, and recently sent a petition to King Salman that garnered about 14,700 signatures.  ""She's very sure of what she's saying -- she doesn't hesitate,"" says Sahar Nassief, a friend and fellow Saudi activist. ""She literally comes from a Bedouin environment, a desert environment. She's very proud of her background, but this makes her a bit blunt with everyone and very blunt in what she says."" The boldness is evident in how she looks and carries herself. At a little past 10 p.m., al-Shammary arrives at a relaxed rooftop restaurant in the coastal city of Jiddah in a multi-colored abaya, the loose robe all women in Saudi Arabia must wear in public. But unlike the black abayas of most, hers is a rainbow of gold, beige and bronze stripes. Her auburn-dyed hair, infused with subtle but trendy streaks of blue, purposefully and willfully peaks out from under a loosely wrapped tan headscarf. Her pink lip gloss is shiny, her nails painted dark red. She counters what she calls the views of some women that all of life is just for ""worship, worship, worship.""  ""You can wear lipstick and take care of your looks,"" she says. ""I would say to them: This isn't forbidden."" Al-Shammary grew up the daughter of a peasant farmer in Ha'il, a landlocked province north of the capital, Riyadh. As the eldest of 12 children, she was in charge of the sheep. She was not just religious but a practicing Salafi, a Muslim who adheres to a literalist interpretation of Shariah. She even had leanings toward Sayyid Qutb, whose books are banned across much of the Arab world because extremists use them to justify killing Muslims and non-Muslims alike. She was deeply affected by the wars in Afghanistan and Bosnia, where Muslim men and boys were massacred. It was also at this time that the Sahwa Movement, or Islamic Awakening, was reaching its peak in Saudi Arabia. Conservatives demanded a bigger role for the clergy in government, and students no longer sang folk songs or performed traditional dance in schools. Women began wearing the full face veil even in communities where it wasn't the custom. Segregation of the sexes became more entrenched. Al-Shammary had little exposure to the outside world in Ha'il. There were no malls, no satellite television receivers and no movie theaters in sight. Her hobby was listening to the news bulletin on the radio, writing it out and reading it back to her father. She also listened to conservative sermons on tapes shared among neighbors and friends.  ""Around the world, stars are artists, actors, comedians, musicians. Our stars were religious men,"" she says. She graduated from the University of Ha'il with a degree in Islamic studies and became a public school teacher. She spanked girls if she heard them singing, and worked closely with other women to raise money for Sunni jihadis in Afghanistan fighting Communist Soviet forces. At 17, she married a man twice her age from the same tribe, who offered her financial stability. She had a girl, Yara, and was divorced at 20. She re-married, to the chief judge in Ha'il who'd overseen her divorce proceedings, a man of prominence and religious stature as head of the Shariah courts there. He had other wives and children, even grandchildren. Most importantly, though, he had no objections to her daughter staying with her.  ""He was older than my father,"" she says. ""It wasn't love but a feeling of security."" In the end, it did not protect her. ___ Al-Shammary's journey to activism began on the day her daughter was taken from her. Almost as soon as Yara turned seven, her ex-husband gained custody. Since al-Shammary had remarried, the court ruled that the girl should live with her father rather than in a house with another man.  ""When they took her and said, 'this is Allah's will' and 'this is Islam', this is when my internal rebellion was sparked,"" says al-Shammary. ""There is no way that there is a God in this universe that would accept this injustice and this pain on the basis that I am a woman."" Her ex-husband rejected tribal mediation as an alternative. Her husband, the judge, refused to interfere and wouldn't allow her to appeal, citing Shariah law. Her parents backed the court's decision and told her to be patient; it was the path to heaven. During long walks in Ha'il's hills and farms, al-Shammary stood under the open sky, refusing to believe that God could want a mother separated from her child. For eight years, she fought her parents, her community and anyone who stood between her and Yara, whom she wasn't able to see. She talked about the case in television interviews. She tried several times to whisk her daughter away after school, but was always stopped by authorities. Her ex-husband moved Yara to a farm outside the city to live in isolation with her grandmother.  ""I became crazy, but in front of my parents and my husband the judge, and the tribal community around him, and because of my position in the community and my name, I was expected to just sit like this and be a hero,"" she says, making an expressionless face and clasping her hands. She had five children from her second marriage, but it wasn't long before she was divorced for a second time. And nothing made up for the loss of Yara.  ""I prayed for a miracle to come down from the sky,"" she says. ""I'd open the Quran. From the first verse on the first page to the last verse on the last page, there isn't a single thing that says, keep a daughter from her mother."" When Yara's father fell ill and the grandmother passed away, he finally allowed her, then 16, to live with her mother again. Al-Shammary relocated to the more liberal city of Jiddah with all her children finally under one roof. She used her knowledge of Shariah by trying her hand at being a legal adviser for women in need, whom she had power of attorney to represent in court. She grew impatient with the judicial system, certain that it came down to personal connections or the whims of male judges. Sometimes her advice was more Machiavellian than pious. Once she told a friend of hers to wear some make-up, find out which judge was slated to oversee her case, and then cry in front of him and plead for her court date to be moved up. It worked. She shared her thoughts online on how Islam sees people, including women, as born free and equal. She began reading about liberalism. Although many in Saudi Arabia equate liberalism with heresy, al-Shammary began describing herself as a liberal, saying it was ""a translation of the spirit of Islam."" So began a war of words -- and of images. After she posted the pictures of men with beards, she was called a hypocrite, a disbeliever, wicked and evil. Sheikh Abdullah al-Manee, a member of Saudi Arabia's highest religious council, described her as ""malicious"" and called for her speedy trial. He told the state-linked Sabq newspaper that ""Souad al-Shammary is a criminal and she will be held accountable for her transgressions against the prophet."" Her outspokenness and her appearances on television talk shows without a face veil were not easy on her family in Ha'il. Her younger brother, Fayez, recalls being told by a community elder: ""You aren't a man. How can you allow your sister to behave like this?"" Fayez says he left Ha'il for about seven years because the comments became unbearable. His marriage proposal to a girl from another tribe was rejected because of his sister's reputation. He also came to blows with one of his younger brothers who cursed her flagrant disregard for social norms, with the two ending up in the hospital. He describes the moment she posted pictures online with her hair showing.  ""She opened a door that I couldn't defend,"" he said. Even Yara opposed her at first.  ""I was somehow against the idea. Like, mom, you are an activist? You are a human rights activist? You are women's activist? What does that even mean?"" Yara asked. ""I was so, so scared."" Kids at school would taunt her sons. In turn, they sometimes lashed out against their mother, says Fayez. Yara said they support their mother but also question how far she has taken her activism. Despite prominent figures calling for al-Shammary's arrest and trial, she didn't think it could happen. She was sure she had not committed a crime.  ""I hadn't crossed the line of Shariah,"" she says. ""I am a graduate of Shariah."" The authorities thought otherwise. ___ After several rounds of interrogation, she was detained at the women's section of Jiddah's Briman prison on October 28, 2014. She was accused of agitating public opinion. She was never tried or convicted. In prison, al-Shammary continued her advocacy behind bars, telling women that music is permissible and explaining their legal rights. She says female Muslim missionaries began appearing in prison more often, telling women their time there was the will of God. The television was always turned onto the religious Majd channel. Al-Shammary wondered what would come first: Her reading the Quran front to back, or her release from prison. She was released from detention on January 29, 2015 -- before she could finish reading the Quran. She had to sign a pledge to reduce her activism. And a male relative, Fayez, had to sign for her release. She continues to tweet to her more than 207,000 followers, though she says she weighs her words more carefully than before. She acknowledges being brash and unwavering by nature, first as a conservative Salafi and then as a liberal. Her brazenness, she says, is a part of her character. It has also helped her succeed in her goals. Fayez notes that the right of women to have their own identity cards, for example, would not have happened without people like his sister speaking out, at a cost. Yara supports her mother's activism, although she still wishes al-Shammary would not give others ammunition against her by arguing about the hijab or with influential religious figures.  ""She is so encouraging to me,"" Yara says. ""She survived stuff that you can't survive."" ___ Follow Aya Batrawy on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ayaelb Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Geoff Crimmins/Moscow-Pullman Daily News via AP)  One of the biggest political issues of the 2016 election has been immigration. The issue is a signature part of the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has pledged tougher vetting of immigrants and an impenetrable physical wall on the border with Mexico. ""We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country,"" Trump said in the first debate. Others in politics have put a finer touch on it. ""Absent visa reductions, the annual rate of immigration, the total level of immigration, and the percentage of the country that is foreign-born will continue surging every single year,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) said in a letter last year. But the problem with this view, as Ira Glass noted in a recent episode of the podcast ""This American Life,"" is that it really is not true. Although the flow of illegal immigrants across the border may be higher than some want, it has not risen in recent years. In fact, as a new report from Pew Research Center shows, the number of illegal immigrants working or looking for work in the United States has been roughly flat between 2009 and 2014, at about 8 million people. There is some movement across the border, but it's hardly massive: About 350,000 illegal immigrants have entered the country each year, but the same number have also left the country. Together, unauthorized immigrants make up 5 percent of America's civilian labor force, a proportion that is down slightly since 2009, Pew says. The unauthorized immigrant population in the United States grew rapidly in the 1990s and early 2000s, but those trends changed dramatically with the financial crisis.    Pew Research Center  Some sources, such as the Conservative Review, have reported a surge in immigration after 2014. It's true that data from one survey, the 2015 Current Population Survey, showed an increase in Mexican immigration. But Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew, says that over time, it has become more clear that results from that survey were an anomaly -- which is something that occasionally happens with individual surveys -- rather than an indication of a big migration event. ""Those numbers were not consistent with anything else we've seen,"" Passel said. Although that 2015 survey showed an increase in Mexican immigration, the 2015 American Community Survey, which is based on a much larger sample, showed that the total number of Mexican immigrants in the country is virtually unchanged over the 2010-2016 period, Passel said. The 2016 Current Population Survey, labor-force surveys of out-migration in Mexico and apprehensions of undocumented Mexicans at the Southern border all pointed to the same trend -- that the number of Mexican immigrants in the United States has been roughly constant for many years. ""By the end of 2015, there's no indication of this surge. If there had been a surge, there was a surge back by the end of the year,"" Passel said.

Her co-founder of the online forum Free Saudi Liberals Network, blogger Raif Badawi, is serving a 10-year prison sentence and was publicly lashed 50 times. Her father disowned her in public. None of it was enough to keep her quiet.  ""I have rights that I don't view as against my religion,"" says al-Shammary. ""I want to ask for these rights, and I want those who make decisions to hear me and act."" Across the Arab world, female Islamic scholars and activists have long been pushing for interpretations of Shariah law that consider men and women as equals before God. Al-Shammary is one of the most vocal and high-profile religious and women's rights activists within Saudi Arabia.  ""She's very sure of what she's saying -- she doesn't hesitate,"" says Sahar Nassief, a friend and fellow Saudi activist. ""She literally comes from a Bedouin environment, a desert environment. She's very proud of her background, but this makes her a bit blunt with everyone and very blunt in what she says."" Al-Shammary grew up the daughter of a peasant farmer in Ha'il, a landlocked province. As the eldest of 12 children, she was in charge of the sheep. She was not just religious but a practicing Salafi, a Muslim who adheres to a literalist interpretation of Islamic law. She graduated from the University of Ha'il with a degree in Islamic studies and became a public school teacher. At 17, she married a man twice her age from the same tribe. She had a girl, Yara, was divorced at 20 and then re-married, this time to the chief judge in Ha'il who'd overseen her divorce proceedings. Al-Shammary's journey to activism began on the day her daughter was taken from her. Almost as soon as Yara turned seven, her ex-husband gained custody. Since al-Shammary had remarried, the court ruled that the girl should live with her father rather than in a house with another man.  ""When they took her and said, 'this is Allah's will' and 'this is Islam', this is when my internal rebellion was sparked,"" says al-Shammary. ""There is no way that there is a God in this universe that would accept this injustice and this pain on the basis that I am a woman."" For eight years, she fought her parents, her community and anyone who stood between her and Yara, whom she wasn't able to see.  ""I became crazy, but in front of my parents and my husband the judge, and the tribal community around him, and because of my position in the community and my name, I was expected to just sit like this and be a hero,"" she says, making an expressionless face and clasping her hands. She had five children from her second marriage, but it wasn't long before she was divorced again. When Yara's father fell ill and the grandmother passed away, he finally allowed her, then 16, to live with her mother again. Al-Shammary relocated to the more liberal city of Jiddah with all her children finally under one roof. She used her knowledge of Shariah as a legal adviser for women in need. Sometimes her advice was more Machiavellian than pious. Once she told a friend to wear some make-up, find out which judge was slated to oversee her case, and then cry in front of him and plead for her court date to be moved up. It worked. She shared her thoughts online on how Islam sees people, including women, as born free and equal, ideas she found in line with liberalism. So began a war of words -- and of images. After she posted the pictures of men with beards, top clerics and other conservatives in the kingdom called her a hypocrite, a disbeliever, wicked and evil. Her outspokenness and her appearances on television talk shows without a face veil were not easy on her family in Ha'il. Her younger brother, Fayez, recalls being told by a community elder: ""You aren't a man. How can you allow your sister to behave like this?"" Fayez says he left Ha'il for about seven years because the comments became unbearable. His marriage proposal to a girl from another tribe was rejected because of his sister's reputation. He also came to blows with one of his younger brothers who cursed her flagrant disregard for social norms, with the two ending up in the hospital. Even Yara opposed her at first. And kids at school would taunt her sons. In turn, they sometimes lashed out against their mother, Fayez says. Al-Shammary was detained at the women's section of Jiddah's Briman prison on October 28, 2014. She was accused of agitating public opinion. She was never tried or convicted. In prison, al-Shammary continued her advocacy behind bars, telling women that music is permissible and explaining their legal rights. She says female Muslim missionaries began appearing in prison more often, telling women their time there was the will of God. The television was always turned onto the religious Majd channel. She was released from detention on January 29, 2015. She had to sign a pledge to reduce her activism. And a male relative, Fayez, had to sign for her release. She continues to tweet to her more than 207,000 followers, though she says she weighs her words more carefully than before. Yara supports her mother's activism, although she still wishes al-Shammary would not argue against the hijab or with influential religious figures.  ""She is so encouraging to me,"" Yara says. ""She survived stuff that you can't survive."" ___ Follow Aya Batrawy on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ayaelb Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
