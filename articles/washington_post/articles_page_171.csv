The attack took place in a forest area near Pengeri, a town 600 kilometers (400 miles) east of Gauhati, the Assam state capital, said police officer Mukesh Aggarwal. The rebels used homemade bombs to stop an army jeep and a truck and attacked the soldiers with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 assault rifles, he said. A helicopter evacuated the four wounded soldiers to a nearby army hospital. The area is home to a big army deployment and troops began hunting for the attackers with the help of local police and paramilitary forces. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but police suspect the rebels of the United Liberation Front of Assam (Independent) . They have been fighting for decades for independence from India. The group, led by Paresh Baruah, operates from hideouts along India's border with Myanmar and China. This was the second attack by insurgents this week in the region. On Wednesday, they looted a cash delivery van belonging to a tea company after killing one person and wounding two others in the vehicle. Dozens of rebel groups have been fighting the government and sometimes each other for years in seven states in northeast India. They demand greater regional autonomy or independent homelands for the indigenous groups they represent. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"  LONDON -- Allies recoiled. Adversaries rejoiced. And on the day after U.S. voters made Donald Trump the country's 45th president, the world was left to collectively wonder: What happened to America? The question hung in the air even as once-unthinkable congratulatory messages poured into Trump Tower from capitals across the globe.  Foreign leaders who had spent months disparaging the Republican nominee as unfit for office were forced to reckon with the reality that he will soon govern the world's sole superpower. U.S. foes who may have only dreamed of a Trump presidency seemed to scarcely believe their good fortune.  [Live updates from the 2016 election and reactions]  Through it all on Wednesday was a palpable sense that Trump's stunning victory could fundamentally transform the global order -- though in this endlessly unpredictable year, no one dared forecast exactly how.      In China, Russia and Israel, we ask people what they think of the election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States. We'll update this video as more voices come in. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)   ""We have no idea what this American president is going to do, when this voice of anger will be the most powerful man in the world,"" Norbert Rottgen, chairman of the German Parliament's foreign affairs committee, told public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. ""Whether he knows his allies and friends, how he is going to approach Vladimir Putin, an authoritarian ruler, how he is going to act when it comes to the question of nuclear armament, all these questions are completely open.""   That profound uncertainty was masked by a succession of bland statements from Trump's soon-to-be counterparts among the ranks of global leaders.   [Intelligence community is already feeling a sense of dread about Trump ]  Through gritted teeth, democratically elected allies congratulated Trump on his victory and promised business as usual.  In Britain -- where the Parliament in January debated banning Trump from even visiting the country -- Prime Minister Theresa May said her nation and the United States had ""an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise."" That, she insisted, would carry forward under Trump.  Global autocrats were far more enthusiastic.   News of the Republican's victory was greeted with broad smiles and a round of applause in the lower house of the Russian parliament. In a Moscow ceremony to welcome new ambassadors, Putin referenced Trump's call for warmer ties and said ""Russia is ready and willing to restore full-fledged relations with the United States.""          1 of 26       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                           Skip Ad   x           The world reacts to results of U.S. election      View Photos   People around the globe watched as Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States.

In a later statement, Sissi's office boasted that the Egyptian president was the first world leader to reach Trump by phone and personally congratulate him. Burundi's controversial leader, Pierre Nkurunziza, who has been accused of directing the killing of civilians, said of Trump, ""Your victory is the victory of all Americans.""  [Donald Trump wins the presidency in stunning upset over Clinton]  Democracy activists and human rights campaigners, meanwhile, were despairing.  In Brazil, analysts noted that the United States now has the kind of leader more commonly associated with Latin America -- a ""caudilho,"" an authoritarian and charismatic figure often linked to military or landowning elites who responds to a desire for ""dramatic solutions."" ""The North American electorate broke open the shell of the serpent's egg that Donald Trump incubated during the campaign this Tuesday,"" wrote Clovis Rossi, a columnist for Brazil's Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. ""Therefore all of the demons that the politically correct had buried or at least eased in United States society are loose.""  In the Middle East, Trump's win was seen as a decisive victory for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Egypt's Sissi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other leaders who routinely flout the rights of their political opponents.  ""[Trump] is not going to talk about human rights, definitely,"" said Hisyar Ozsoy, a parliament member representing Turkey's opposition pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party, or HDP, whose leaders have recently been arrested. ""He will remain deaf and blind to whatever happens here if he wants to work with Turkey."" Erdogan, who had criticized Trump during the presidential campaign for showing intolerance toward Muslims, said the Republican's victory was a ""positive sign"" and the ""beginning of a new era in the United States.""  [Markets staggered by Trump's shock victory but stage partial recovery]  There was no such optimism among the United States' closest democratic allies. In Europe, there was never any secret about the continent's overwhelming preference for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.  For months, leaders have spoken openly of their contempt for Trump and their fear of the consequences should he be elected -- views that, according to pre-election polls, were reflected in a European public that saw a Trump win as a reason to be ""afraid."" On Wednesday, the terms ""shock"" and ""nightmare"" were trending on Twitter in Germany. Trump's win had many European nations scrambling to understand his intentions on foreign policy, which have been only loosely sketched out.  Envoys from major U.S. allies typically meet campaign advisers to Democrats and Republicans ahead of elections to try to understand how elections will affect them. That was easy to do with the Clinton campaign, which was studded with veterans from her decades in the public eye. But countries such as Germany -- Europe's dominant power -- have not been able to secure meetings with the Trump campaign, officials said. In Brussels, diplomats fretted about the consequences for NATO, which was the target of sharp rhetoric from Trump during the campaign as he questioned the priorities of the military alliance. While the Obama administration has committed a battalion of troops to Eastern Europe to deter a resurgent Russia, Trump has proposed a radically different approach to the Kremlin. But mainstream leaders who just a day before were openly criticizing Trump moved quickly Wednesday to play nice, recognizing that they had no choice but to work with the new American president. ""It wasn't what we were expecting,"" said David McAllister, a German lawmaker who is the head of the European Parliament's delegation to the United States. ""We Europeans need the Americans to guarantee our security, and we have a huge interest in transatlantic relations."" The quiet grimaces from Europe's mainstream contrasted vividly with the cheers from the continent's far right. Trump's win was immediately seen as a possible harbinger of a far-right victory in France's 2017 presidential election, which analysts now say could represent a third chapter in a string of stunning populist upheavals. ""It's a divine surprise for the National Front,"" said Dominique Moisi, a co-founder of the French Institute for International Relations. ""Suddenly the possibility that after Brexit and after Trump there could be Marine Le Pen is striking the French."" To many in Britain, Trump's victory was stunning -- but also familiar, coming as it did less than five months after the country voted to leave the European Union. ""Trump said himself that his election would be 'Brexit plus plus.' and he was right,"" said Thomas Roulet, a management professor at King's College London.  [27 years after Berlin Wall, Europe wakes up to a U.S. president-elect promising a wall of his own]  Nowhere was the result felt more keenly than in Mexico, where the peso crumbled. ""It feels like our nightmare is here,"" tweeted Jorge Guajardo, who was Mexico's ambassador to China from 2007 to 2013. Trump's disdain for Mexican immigrants and his pledges to build a wall along the Mexican border and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement have made him a figure of hate for many Mexicans. ""Mexico will have a very big problem having good relations with him,"" said Raul Benitez Manaut, a professor at Mexico's National Autonomous University. ""Mexicans are very nationalistic, and they feel aggrieved by Trump."" In South Africa, as well, many were angered by the election of a man who had called their nation ""a crime-ridden mess that is just waiting to explode."" A Trump victory ""is a victory for right-wing, racist politics. It doesn't bode well for the world,"" Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille told the country's Business Day newspaper. Trump's victory was also deeply concerning to the governments in Japan and South Korea, Washington's two closest allies in Asia. On the campaign trail, Trump had repeatedly pledged to upend the American military pacts with both countries, saying neither was paying enough for its defense against a nuclear-armed North Korea and a strengthening China. ""The current situation seems like the beginning of the U.S.'s decline and a beginning of the failure of democracy,"" said Hasung Jang, a professor of finance at Korea University in Seoul. China's state media made a similar point. ""The probably most divisive and scandalous election in American history has eroded voters' faith in the two-party system, as many voters called it a game of money, power, and influence,"" wrote the state-run Xinhua News Agency. Meanwhile, governments that have been out of favor under President Obama foresaw new opportunities under Trump. Israeli politicians called for Trump to make good on his campaign promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, a long-running source of contention. And they predicted an even bigger triumph in the region's decades of conflict.  ""The era of the Palestinian state is over,"" said Education Minister Naftali Bennett. Others in countries on the outs with Obama were far less sanguine. In the Philippines, the mood was somber at the U.S. Embassy's election party, with a crowd of Filipino Americans and students eager to study in the United States expressing fear, shock and disappointment. ""The U.S. is known as a country for immigrants, as the land of the free, but he wants to build a wall,"" said Carlos Llamas, a 19-year-old college junior studying consular and diplomatic affairs. ""As president you are chief diplomat for your country, but he doesn't act like that.""  Denyer reported from Beijing.

The Democratic vice presidential nominee says, ""There's no place like home."" He's at an airport homecoming late Monday in Richmond, Virginia, where Kaine has lived for 32 years. He is with his wife, Anne Holton, and their daughter, Annella. Kaine is praising running mate Hillary Clinton as someone who unites people and saying Donald Trump isn't qualified to be president. The senator and former Virginia governor has not campaigned in his home state since shortly after he became the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Clinton has maintained leads in most Virginia polls for several months, though the polls have shown the race tightening. ___ 10 p.m. Donald Trump just can't help himself. The GOP nominee is reviving an insult derided as racist as he makes his final pitch to voters on the eve of Election Day. Speaking during a rally in New Hampshire, Trump referred to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as ""Pocahontas"" -- a reference to claims she made about being part Native American. He's also calling Warren a ""terrible person,"" ''a terrible human being"" and a ""terrible senator"" who is hated by her colleagues. The comment came as Trump continued to air grievances about the GOP primary and early concerns about whether he would be able to win more than 50 percent of the GOP vote. ___ 9:53 p.m. Donald Trump is bragging that he has the backing of two of New England's biggest sports stars. The GOP nominee says at a Manchester, New Hampshire, rally that New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady called him today to say he'd voted for him. He also claims he received a ""the most beautiful"" letter from Bill Belichick, the Patriots head coach, congratulating him, wishing him luck Tuesday, and commending him for the way he'd handled ""an unbelievable negative and slanted media.""  ""By the way, is there a better reference than Tom Brady and Bill Belichick?"" he later asked the crowd. ""I don't think so."" Brady told Boston's WEEI-FM Monday morning that he hadn't voted yet. Early voting in Massachusetts ended Friday. ___ 9:34 p.m. Hillary Clinton says at a large campaign rally with President Barack Obama that Tuesday's election represents ""the test of our time."" She asks, ""What will we vote for, not just against?"" Clinton rallied thousands of supporters outside Philadelphia's Independence Hall on the eve of the election. She tells the crowd that she deeply regrets how angry the tone of the campaign became, prompting someone to yell that it wasn't her fault. Clinton was joined on stage after the rally by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, her daughter Chelsea and the Obamas. The rally included performances by rockers Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi, all aimed at winning battleground Pennsylvania. ___ 9:07 p.m. President Barack Obama says voters don't have to settle for just voting against Donald Trump. He says they ""have somebody extraordinary to vote for"" in Hillary Clinton. Obama is delivering his closing pitch for Clinton during a star-studded rally in Philadelphia. He's trying to combat the notion that voters have to settle for Clinton because they're so turned off by Trump. Obama says he's had to ""bite my tongue"" throughout the ""nonsense"" of the campaign. He's decrying ""vicious, crazy"" attacks against Clinton and says she's been held to double-standards. Obama says despite all that, Clinton doesn't complain or buckle. He says she brushes it off because she's strong like the American people. ___ 9:03 p.m. Donald Trump is pulling out all the stops as he holds the second-last rally of his campaign in Manchester, New Hampshire. Trump is appearing with his running mate Mike Pence and many members of his family at the SNHU Arena, which is packed with thousands of cheering supporters. It's the same arena where he held his final rally before the New Hampshire primary. His win in that race paved his way to the party's nomination.  ""It all began for me in New Hampshire,"" Trump says after taking the stage. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, briefly addressed the crowd in support of her father. While his rival Hillary Clinton is campaigning with a cast of celebrities, Trump says, ""I have the best surrogates of all."" ___ 8:54 p.m. First lady Michelle Obama says voters have a chance on Tuesday to stand up to ""those who seek to divide us and make us afraid."" Mrs. Obama is rallying for Hillary Clinton along with President Barack Obama in Philadelphia. She's casting a Hillary Clinton victory as the continuation of a unique American story that included the election of the first black president. Mrs. Obama says voters can show that the U.S. has always been great. She says helping Clinton get elected is perhaps the last and most important thing she can do for the country as first lady. ___ 8:52 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton says Tuesday will mark a ""change election."" He says voters have to decide whether ""we are going to change forward together or backward."" Clinton says Hillary Clinton has ""lived her life dedicated to making changes for other people."" Clinton is speaking on behalf of his wife at a star-studded rally in Philadelphia on Monday night. He's joined by first lady Michelle Obama, President Barack Obama, singers Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. ___ 8:46 p.m. Rocker Bruce Springsteen says the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in Tuesday's election ""couldn't be any clearer"" and is telling a Philadelphia rally that Trump's ideas and campaign are ""going down."" Springsteen made his first appearance on the 2016 campaign trail on behalf of Clinton. He says her candidacy is based on ""intelligence, experience, preparation"" and a vision of America ""where everyone counts."" Springsteen has campaigned on behalf of President Barack Obama and John Kerry in the past. He says Trump's campaign allowed him ""to prioritize his own interests and ego before American democracy itself."" He says on Tuesday ""those ideas and that campaign is going down."" The Boss performed a short acoustic set that included ""Thunder Road,"" ''Long Walk Home"" and ""Dancing in the Dark."" ___ 8:05 p.m. Jon Bon Jovi is telling Hillary Clinton's supporters that ""the world is watching"" on the eve of Tuesday's presidential election. The rock band front man performed at a rally near Philadelphia's Independence Hall ahead of appearances by Clinton, President Barack Obama and rocker Bruce Springsteen. Bon Jovi says with the eyes of the world upon America, the nation needs to ask itself, ""What kind of world do we want? I want a world of hope and optimism."" Bon Jovi has raised money for Clinton's campaign. His set list included ""Who Says You Can't Go Home"" and ""Livin' on a Prayer."" ___ 6:54 p.m. Former vice president Al Gore says the future of the world is at stake in Tuesday's presidential election. Gore spoke on Monday in Boulder, Colorado, to supporters of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He declared: ""This is a climate election."" Gore did not mention Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. But he said Clinton would continue international efforts to reduce carbon emissions while Trump would walk away from them. He told the crowd it could all come down to the election returns in Boulder, the liberal heart of this battleground state. Gore became a high profile climate activist after losing the 2000 presidential election to Republican George W. Bush. ___ 6:37 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she intends to call rival Donald Trump if she wins the presidency in Tuesday's election. The Democratic presidential nominee says in a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest that she hopes Trump will ""play a constructive role"" in helping bring the country together. Clinton says in an interview on the final day of campaigning that if she wins, she wants to bring together people who supported Trump for a ""national conversation"" after the election. She says she wants to hear from people who supported Trump as well as people who supported her. ___ Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton is ""the face of failure"" and he's predicting a ""great victory"" on Tuesday.as he holds his final Pennsylvania rally of the campaign. Trump tells a roaring crowd in Scranton, Pennsylvania, that he doesn't believe polls that show him running neck-and-neck with rival Hillary Clinton. Trump says, ""I think we're going to blow 'em out tomorrow."" He adds, ""This is not the sound of a second place finisher."" Trump is continuing to paint Clinton as a corrupt Washington insider who has accomplished too little in her years in public life. ___ 5:41 p.m. President Barack Obama is reviving his own campaign call-and-response of ""Fired up, ready to go"" at a rally for Hillary Clinton. Obama is getting nostalgic at his rally in Durham, New Hampshire, as he tells the story of how the chant came about in 2008. He says when he started running he was just a ""skinny guy with a funny name."" Obama says a woman in a church hat in the back of a room at an obscure campaign event randomly started the chant, and it immediately caught on. He says it shows how one voice can change a room, and in turn change the world. ___ 5:19 p.m. President Barack Obama says Donald Trump's conduct might be acceptable in other countries -- but not in the United States. Obama is railing against Trump during a rally in Durham, New Hampshire. It's Obama's second-to-last campaign event for Hillary Clinton. Obama is mocking Trump for threatening to jail Hillary Clinton if he's elected. He says other countries discriminate against people based on their religion, but not the U.S. Obama says, ""Maybe Putin thinks it's ok. I don't think it's ok."" He's referring to Vladimir Putin and Democrats' claim that Trump is too cozy with the Russian president. The president says unlike Trump, Clinton ""actually knows what's going on in the world."" ___ 5:12 p.m. Donald Trump continues to say that he's put $100 million of his own money into his presidential run. Fundraising records show that with just 24 hours to go, he's about $34 million short of that amount. Trump's latest major contribution to his own campaign was $10 million on Oct. 28, according to Federal Election Commission reports. That brings his total investment to about $66 million. He most recently made his $100 million assertion at a rally Monday afternoon in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump's personal investment shrinks when accounting for about $9 million in campaign cash that has returned to his family and businesses. ___ 5:10 p.m. A soaring turnout from Latino voters has driven a record number of Americans to vote ahead of Election Day. Associated Press data show at least 43.2 million people have cast ballots by early voting. Record levels have been reported in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Millions more ballots are still coming in. The AP estimates that early votes could top 50 million. That comes to nearly 40 percent of all ballots. In 2012, there were 46 million early votes, or 35 percent. The latest numbers show declines in voting from blacks in North Carolina -- a drop-off after historic levels for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. But higher turnout by Latinos, who often lean Democratic, may be buoying Clinton in Florida. Both are must-win for Donald Trump. ___ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Easy for her to say, perhaps. It certainly has been exciting for anyone who sells antidepressants or anxiety medications to a public whose mood seems to range between apoplectic and apocalyptic, at least among those not apathetic. The Democratic candidate and her traveling show had arrived in Miami sometime on the far side of one in the morning the night before. The crowd she was addressing had been waiting on the unsheltered grounds and bleachers at a Pembroke Pines park, persisting soggily through three shower bursts. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger -- the money-line lyrics of Kelly Clarkson's familiar pop anthem, looped on the sound system between Latin numbers. What doesn't kill you gives you pneumonia, came the dry retort from the media tent. Seven minutes in, and the rains returned, harder, Hillary's light-blue pantsuit started taking on water, and she wisely cut short her vibrant stump speech, shouted her gratitude and skipped out joyously, just singing in the rain. It was a long way to fly for just seven minutes of action, coming down from Cleveland the night before and up to Philadelphia immediately after. But that is part of the deal during presidential campaigns. It is all about being there, whatever that means and wherever ""there"" is. Being in battleground states. Being on television. Being in perpetual motion. Being up on the latest. And a whole lot of being up in the air. Being there with the goal of actually getting there. Being there to try to get there is nothing new for Hillary. It was 24 years ago that she joined her husband on a 32-hour, 4,000-plus-mile zigzag that took them around and about to nine states from New Hampshire to the Rio Grande Valley before ending up in Little Rock, where on a chilled November night they realized they were on their way to being in the White House. By the time of that closing trip, an entrepreneurial camera crew from NBC had printed T-shirts to hawk to the bedraggled traveling media with the logo ""Camp Pain.""         1 of 57       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                         Skip Ad   x           Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail      View Photos   The Democratic presidential nominee on the road as Election Day nears.

Melina Mara/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        This time, even though Hillary's last scheduled campaign stop before the election is to be a Monday midnight madness rally in Raleigh, the traveling is both more precise and more relaxed. With Bill as the candidate, Clinton Time generally meant two hours later than scheduled. It meant watching the Big Dog work what Adam Nagourney, then covering the trip for USA Today, generously called ""rope lines from hell."" Hillary Time is at most an hour late, sometimes on time and even occasionally early. And no stops in places such as Kentucky or Texas or Arkansas, only states that might still make a difference. Bill by then knew that he was going to win, the last dog was not going to die, and his grand tour amounted to a victory lap. Hillary is not there yet, so her travels are much more targeted. And a maximum of four stops a day, with some mornings as leisurely as a lazy Sunday. Media baggage calls about 10:30. It may be material for Trump to harrumph again about sta-mi-na, except for the fact that she seems not fatigued but energized despite a raspy voice. There is also a strong component of being with in these closing days -- celebrity on celebrity, famous people being with her, this famous woman, and the rest of us watching. If the nation at some point became hooked on reality TV, and Donald Trump somehow emerged from that subculture, Hillary has her own version of ""The Voice"" going. The reason she proclaimed her excitement on that rain-slicked stage in Florida was because she had been up the night before on a stage in Cleveland with Jay Z and Beyonce and her pant-suited dancers who hip-hopped their expressions of support. On Saturday night, it was Katy Perry roaring her Roar for her in Philly, opening her show in a flowing blue coat that said ""I Am with Madame President"" on the back as 10,000 political concertgoers stood and raised their fists, roaring along. Then back to Cleveland again -- Ohio looks that close and important, if not vital -- for a joint appearance with King James himself -- LeBron, that is. And then rounding north to Manchester, ground zero of the first-in-the-nation primary, where another James, the one named Taylor, would try to help her get her New Hampshire ducks all in a row, as one of his songs goes. And with Bruce Springsteen still to come back in Philly again Monday night. The rush of fame all around, but all practiced, and none with the depth of meaning of a simple stop for Sunday services at the Mt. Airy Church of God in Philadelphia. ""We are firm believers in the separation of church and state,"" intoned the Rev. J. Louis Felton,setting the mood for the politics to come. ""We are separated, but not divorced."" The music, with a choir rising in song behind the angelic voice of a little girl, and then the resounding gospel intonations of BeBe Winans, provided an uplift that the million-twitter celebs could not match. And Hillary, with a scratch in her voice but softer and slower and more powerful than usual, seemed for once utterly at home. If she has struggled to close the deal with black voters, there was little evidence of that here. Like few other places in American life, the black church offers an embracing sensibility of forgiveness and hope. Hillary spoke about the lessons she used to teach at her Methodist Sunday school back in the Little Rock days: that love was a commandment; about the flaws and mistakes of every human life and the call of redemption and keeping on; about the long struggle for equality that connected women and African Americans, both rendered second-class citizens in the American democracy for so long; and about how President Obama had said he wanted to pass the baton to her, and she was just hoping ""he will bend down low enough so I can reach it."" She departed not long before news arrived that there would be no further actions in the FBI email investigation -- a separate blessing -- and with an echo of the words she had uttered right after listening to Winans. Every day in this campaign might be exciting, as she exclaimed in South Florida a day earlier, but this offered something more. ""I needed that,"" she said. ""I needed that."" "

Emanuel's personal account information turned up among the thousands of emails from John Podesta, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, the Chicago Tribune reported (http://trib.in/2frn1f5 ). Clinton has come under fire for her use of a private email server because doing so potentially jeopardized classified information. Emanuel registered his personal email domain, ""rahmemail.com,"" on May 16, 2011, the day he was sworn into office. The hacked emails also turned up evidence of Emanuel's personal Gmail account. Adam Collins, a spokesman for the mayor, said Emanuel's use of a customized email domain, or name, is common, and that it was created to ensure the mayor was not using a government email for personal or political purposes. He added that Emanuel has not and does not use a private email server like the one Clinton used to transfer emails. Collins did not say whether Emanuel has used either of the personal email accounts to conduct government business. The messages included in the Wikileaks leaks were among the first direct evidence that Emanuel has used personal email accounts as mayor beyond official city government accounts. Emanuel was sued by the Chicago Tribune last year in a still-pending case seeking access to his emails under the state's open record laws. Under Illinois law, government business conducted over email by a public official is subject to the state's open records law, but Emanuel's office argued that the emails sought by the Tribune are not public records. The newspaper's Freedom of Information Act requests filed since Emanuel took office have turned up little to no email communications from the mayor on his government email accounts.  ""After the mayor's election in 2011, the campaign fund set up a new email to ensure the mayor was not using government email for private or political use, which could violate city ordinance or state law,'"" Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins told the newspaper. ""A dedicated Gmail domain allowed for better security given the growing threat of cyberattacks."" Federal records show that since taking office, Emanuel used his custom email domain to send at least seven messages on two different strings to Clinton while she was secretary of state, the newspaper reported. One involved an invitation for a joint appearance in Chicago.  ""Sorry, but I'm scheduled to be in the Balkans so would love a rain check for next time. All the best, Mayor,"" Clinton wrote back. In June 2014, Clinton made good on her rain check, participating in a special Ideas Week interview. The hacked emails WikiLeaks released also showed Emanuel using his rahmemail.com domain to contact Podesta. The day after Emanuel was forced into a runoff in his re-election bid, Podesta used a Gmail address for Emanuel instead of the rahmemail.com account. ___ Information from: Chicago Tribune, http://www.chicagotribune.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Comey told lawmakers on Nov. 6 that the bureau won't recommend charges against Hillary Clinton after reviewing newly discovered emails. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Nine days ago, FBI Director James B. Comey shook the political world with a letter to Congress noting that emails ""pertinent"" to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server had been discovered on a computer owned by former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Today, 48 hours before Election Day, Comey sent another letter to key leaders in Congress -- this one making clear that no charges would be brought against Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. ""We have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton,"" Comey wrote. Um, what? Comey had to know that he would set off a political whirlwind with his first letter. The FBI investigation of Clinton's emails -- and the fact that she used a private server exclusively during her time as secretary of state -- has been an anchor around her campaign's neck for the entirety of the presidential race. Clearing Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing -- while simultaneously blasting her judgment -- in July, Comey seemed to put a stop to the political impact of the email controversy. To then turn around so incredibly close to the election and publicly announce that an investigation that had lain dormant for months was now back on because of the emails found on Weiner's computer suggested that there was some there there. And, the fact that investigators working on a case involving Weiner had known about the Clinton-related emails for weeks and had briefed Comey on them before he went public seemed to bolster the case that the director had a strong suspicion that something beyond what had already been discovered was on Weiner's computer. After all, it would be the height of irresponsibility to inject the email controversy back into the campaign on the off chance that something on Weiner's computer might implicate Clinton. If Comey had no real indication that there was evidence of problems for Clinton -- above and beyond the errors in judgment he had previously knocked her for -- then why go public with anything? Comey defenders will insist that he was in a no-win situation. Acknowledge the investigation of the Clinton-related emails on Weiner's computer publicly, find nothing, get blamed. Keep the investigation private until after the election and be accused by Republicans of pulling punches to help get Clinton elected. Sure, sort of. If this had been 2014 or even 2015, it's easy to see how Comey could and should make the choice he did. But, it's impossible to say that he and the FBI operate entirely outside of the political world or that the same rules of the road apply when it comes to when and whether things should be made public. Referees in the National Basketball Association ref the first 44 minutes (or so) of a game differently than they ref the final four minutes. They understand that in the final four minutes, the bar for a foul is higher because the stakes are raised. Shooting two free throws in a two-point game in the first quarter is very different from doing the same thing with 35 seconds left in the game. Same goes for Comey. He needed to understand that to say something about Clinton's email investigation so close to the election meant that he had very real concerns about the possibility of a president-elect being indicted. To simply say -- after a nine-day hurricane of news stories about Clinton's emails -- that there was never anything to see here is a remarkable swing and miss on Comey's part. The Clinton campaign won't say much about Sunday's Comey announcement for fear of re-injecting the FBI and her emails into the conversation in these last few days of the campaign. But, if I were them -- or lots of down-ballot Democrats -- I would be livid."

Al Franken claims that Donald Trump’s new ad on the economy is anti-Semitic	"      Donald Trump's campaign released an ad, Nov. 6, featuring billionaire investor George Soros, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. All three are Jewish. (Donald Trump)   Donald Trump's closing campaign ad paints a distinct picture of the way he sees America and the world: powerful men and women in suits, media magnates, financiers and politicians like Hillary Clinton, conspiring to concentrate power in their own hands. ""The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you,"" Trump's voice says near the end of the ad. ""The only force strong enough to save our country is us."" But Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) suggested on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Trump's ""Argument for America"" ad plays on an insidious chord that has been a rallying point for politicians for decades: anti-Semitism. Franken joined a chorus of people who have criticized the ad's undertones since it was released on Friday. The Anti-Defamation League, a nongovernmental organization that seeks to fight anti-Semitism, also seized on the ad, saying it conjured ""painful stereotypes and baseless conspiracy theories.""   Our thoughts on the #Trump closing ad. pic.twitter.com/pPUmkY6qdD -- ADL (@ADL_National) November 6, 2016     Wonder how Sheldon Adelson feels about @realDonaldTrump final ad? Is he proud? Angry?

It focuses heavily on what he calls the political and economic machine of the world, and the people he suggests operate it. ""People that don't have your good interest in mind,"" the ad says. Among those people, judging from the grainy images flashed in the ad, are prominent American Jews: Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, business magnate George Soros and Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO and chairman of Goldman Sachs.   [Report: No, Trump didn't cause anti-Semitic attacks on journalists. But ...]   ""It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities,"" the ad says as it shows an image of Blankfein speaking at a Clinton Foundation event. Franken, who is Jewish, said on ""State of the Union"" that the ad speaks ""to a certain part of [Trump's] alt-right base."" ""When I saw the ad I thought that this was something of German Shepherd whistle, a dog whistle, to a certain group in the United States,"" Franken told Jake Tapper. ""I'm Jewish, so maybe I'm sensitive to it. It had an Elders of Zion feeling to it, an international banking conspiracy to it and then a number of Jews"" are pictured. ""It's an appeal to some of the worst elements of our country. Some who are not sensitive to that may not see that, but that's the conclusion I draw."" The text Franken alludes to -- ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" -- is a document, later shown to be fabricated, that describes a Jewish plan for global domination, according to the U.S. Holocaust Museum. Originally written in Russian, the protocols purport to be the minutes of a late-19th-century meeting where Jewish leaders talked about controlling the media and global economies and fostering religious conflict.   [Trump supporters include most of anti-Semitic alt-right, and 19 percent of ... Jews?]   Henry Ford funded printing of 500,000 copies that were distributed throughout the United States. As Adolf Hitler rose to power, schoolchildren in Nazi Germany were required to study the text, even after it was shown to be fraudulent. On Sunday, Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called on Trump's campaign to be more responsible with its messages. ""Whether intentional or not, the images and rhetoric in this ad touch on subjects that anti-Semites have used for ages,"" Greenblatt said in a statement tweeted by the organization. ""This needs to stop . . . . It's a time when all candidates need to be especially responsible and bid for votes by offering sincere ideas and policy proposals."" Jason Greenblatt, who co-chair's Trump's Israel Advisory Committee, accused the ADL of engaging in partisan politics in a message to The Huffington Post. ""The ADL should focus on real anti-Semitism and hatred, and not try to find any where none exist,"" the statement said. ""I am offended and concerned that an institution such as the ADL would involve itself in partisan politics instead of focusing on its important mission. ""Mr. Trump and his campaign have laid out important ideas, a vision and critical policies for our country. The suggestion that the ad is anything else is completely false and uncalled for. Mr. Trump's message and all of the behavior that I have witnessed over the two decades that I have known him have consistently been pro-Jewish and pro-Israel and accusations otherwise are completely off-base."" Franken's comments aren't the first time Trump has been called anti-Semitic this campaign season. In July, Trump repeatedly defended himself for retweeting an image describing Clinton as ""crooked"" and the ""most corrupt candidate ever"" that included a red Star of David shape slapped onto a bed of $100 bills. The image, widely condemned as anti-Semitic, had its roots in the online white supremacist movement, but Trump dismissed it as ""just a star."" Last week, Trump's campaign manager disavowed a supporter as ""deplorable"" for chanting ""Jew-S-A!"" at an earlier rally, according to The Washington Post. The man's ""conduct is completely unacceptable and does not reflect our campaign or our candidate. Wow,"" Kellyanne Conway said during an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""That man's conduct was deplorable. And had I been there, I would have asked security to remove him immediately.""

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/13475c90-a13e-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html	What to know about the 15 states that will decide the election	"      View Graphic       Arizona: The Grand Canyon State hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996, but Democrats believe that increased Hispanic voter registration will keep things competitive. Recent polling has given Republican Donald Trump a slight edge over Democrat Hillary Clinton, but Democrats cite an advantage in early voting as evidence that it could be a close night. On Friday, the final day of early voting, thousands of Arizonans stood in long lines. Two other races in the state also signal the growing power of the state's Latino voters. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who has tepidly stood by Trump's candidacy this year, is running for a sixth term. McCain appears headed to victory due partly to modest Latino support. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a Republican who became a polarizing national figure in the debate over immigration and border control, is facing the toughest reelection of his 24-year reign amid tussles with the Justice Department. National liberal and Hispanic groups have targeted the race as a chance to knock off the man they consider the poster boy for unjust immigration detention policies.   Colorado:  Colorado is one of the most widely swinging battleground states. It cast its vote for Republican George W. Bush in 2004 by a higher percentage than the nation as a whole. Four years later, it did the same thing -- except for Democrat Barack Obama. That pattern is set to hold if the nation votes for Clinton. She's been leading in most polls in Colorado for most of the general election. Her campaign didn't run TV ads in the state for most of this campaign, though she has jumped in with ads in the past few days, as the race has tightened. Only termed a swing state in the past few elections, Colorado has been shifting to the left rapidly. This year, for the first time in decades, Democratic and unaffiliated voters outnumber Republicans. The state's growing Latino population, more than 20 percent as well as the Denver area's explosion of younger voters are among the reasons for the shift. Yet, like other Western swing states, Colorado is starkly divided, with a strong conservative streak as well. If Clinton wins Colorado, it will be the first time in a century Colorado has voted for the Democratic nominee for president three times in a row.   Florida: The Sunshine State is once again the center of the presidential campaign and has been a frequent stop for Clinton and Trump. Florida is essential to Trump's chances. Barring big upsets elsewhere, failure to win here blocks the Republican's path to the 270 electoral votes he needs to capture the White House. Clinton and Trump have focused especially on winning Central Florida, which stretches east to west from Daytona Beach on the Atlantic Coast and ending in Tampa. Democrats are buoyed by record-high early voting by Latinos fueled primarily by an influx of Puerto Ricans fleeing the island's economic difficulties. Across Florida, more Latinos had voted by Wednesday than during the entire early voting period in 2012, according to the Clinton campaign. The politics of South Florida are also shifting as young Cuban-Americans buck their elders and align with Democrats. The state's closely watched U.S. Senate race pits Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who used his presidential campaign to trash Congress, against Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.). Rubio has surged ahead, and Democrats have pared back ad spending, but Murphy could be helped if Clinton pulls far ahead of Trump.   Georgia: The last Democrat to carry Georgia was a fellow southerner, Bill Clinton in 1992, so the Peach State didn't appear particularly ripe for Hillary Clinton when the race began. But it has turned unexpectedly competitive this year. Several recent polls have shown the contest to be within the margin of error or Trump leading by a modest margin. Clinton is being buoyed by an overwhelming lead among black voters in Atlanta and elsewhere. She was up 89 percent to 5 percent among African Americans in an NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released last week. The booming Atlanta suburbs have opened a possible path to victory for Democrats that does not require winning over conservative whites, the bedrock of Trump's constituency. A key will be how well Clinton can mobilize not only African Americans but also growing populations of Latinos and Asian Americans. Some Democrats acknowledge they could be another election away from being consistently competitive. Sensing an opportunity, the Clinton campaign stepped up investments in its ground game in Georgia in August, and a supportive super PAC is airing television ads.   Iowa: Donald Trump's strength among white, non-college-educated voters could help swing Iowa to the GOP this cycle, after it voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012. Iowa is more than 90 percent white. Trump has a five-point lead, according to a polling average of recent surveys calculated by The Washington Post. The Clinton campaign has touted its robust ground operation in Iowa, but the candidate herself has not held many rallies in the state. Trump has faced criticism in many battleground states for implementing a late and weak ground operation and relying on operatives who lack the strategic experience to keep pace with Democrats. But in Iowa, Trump has Eric Branstad, the son of Gov. Terry Branstad. The Branstads know Iowa politics well, giving Trump a boost he doesn't enjoy in other important states. Trump has made several appearances in the Hawkeye State in recent weeks and has frequently sent his quintessentially Midwestern running mate, Gov. Mike Pence, to campaign there. Despite the buzz, Iowa has just six electoral college votes. Still, it is a must-win for Trump, given his limited path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.       How the electoral college works View Graphic     How the electoral college works    Michigan: This industrial, Midwestern state, which dealt a surprise blow to Clinton in the Democratic primary when it backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), could be poised for another upset in the general election.  Michigan voters have not supported a Republican for president since 1988. But backlash against globalization has made trade deals a major issue in parts of the state where Trump expects to do best, especially among white, non-college-educated voters. With national polls tightening in the final days of the campaign, Trump's campaign has made a late play for Michigan, and Clinton and surrogates have recently increased visits in an effort to boost Election Day turnout. Both campaigns are now airing ads statewide. On Monday, Clinton will visit Grand Rapids, and President Obama will visit Ann Arbor. With an electorate that is 72 percent white, Michigan is one of the least diverse states, meaning Clinton's demographic advantages -- she is strong among minorities -- could be limited. Clinton is trying to maintain her strength in the state's urban centers, particularly among black voters in Detroit. But theys are key, and there are signs in early voting elsewhere that she is struggling with them.   Nevada:  Nevadans have voted for the winner in every presidential election since 1992. But like most swing states, Nevada is starkly divided between red and blue. The state's southern tip, home to Las Vegas and surrounding Clark County, is blue. The northern city of Reno and surrounding Washoe County are purple. And the rural towns dotting the vast expanse of desert in between are red. Nevada is changing, though. Almost a third of the state is Hispanic, and there's a growing Asian American population as well. Democrats have worked hard to harness the state's new population in their favor, and Nevada is leading the way among Western states trending Democratic. Nevada has an independent and libertarian streak, and Trump seems to have tapped into that. He's leading or tied three of the past four high-quality polls, suggesting that his populist economic message is resonating with a Nevadans still struggling to recover from the recession. But early voters -- a solid indicator in Nevada -- favor Democrats in similar numbers to when President Obama won the state in 2012. This race looks like it could be a nail-biter.   New Hampshire: Tiny and independent-minded, New Hampshire figures most prominently in the presidential election as the site of the nation's first primary vote, typically a few days after the kickoff caucuses in Iowa. With four electoral votes, it's not a big prize in the general election, but is considered a battleground because of significant Republican strength amid solidly Democratic northeastern states. New Hampshire has voted Democratic in five of the past six presidential elections. Barack Obama took the state by about 5.5 percentage points over Mitt Romney in 2012, but Clinton looks unlikely to match that margin. The Democrat has suffered a reversal of fortune in New Hampshire in polls over the past two weeks, falling to a two-point lead over the weekend, according to a poll average calculated by The Washington Post. Some polls suggest a strong effect from the announcement on Oct. 28 of a renewed FBI inquiry into Clinton's State Department email. She is expected to return to New Hampshire for a final rally Sunday. In addition, Obama will travel to the state on Monday on the eve of the election -- a sure sign that it is closer than Clinton would like.   New Mexico: The Land of Enchantment has been a Democratic stronghold during the past two presidential elections, with President Obama winning by double-digit margins both times. Trump recently visited the state for an evening airport rally as part of an eleventh-hour attempt to put it in play. But not a single public poll has shown Clinton trailing the Republican nominee there. Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and repeated vows to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border have made him deeply unpopular among Latino voters. That presents a major challenge for him in New Mexico, where exit poll data showed the electorate was more than a third Hispanic in 2012. Clinton has been taking no chances with New Mexico down the stretch, opting to air ads in the state during the final week for the first time in the general election. Democrats have won five of the past six presidential elections in New Mexico. George W. Bush narrowly won here in 2004. One potentially complicating factor for Clinton and Trump: Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson served two terms as governor and has pockets of support. The most recent poll showed Johnson attracting 7 percent of the vote.       What one state shows us about political polarization View Graphic     What one state shows us about political polarization    North Carolina:   North Carolina has been one of the most heavily traveled states on the campaign trail this year and could tip either way. The state has historically been favorable turf for Republicans in presidential races. President Obama narrowly carried the Tar Heel state in 2008 but lost by a close margin to GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Democrats see longer-term trends in the state working in their favor: an influx of white, college-educated professionals along an urban and suburban corridor stretching from Raleigh to Charlotte, and an uptick in the African American share of the electorate -- part of the legacy of Obama's campaigns. To win in North Carolina, Clinton has been banking on an Obama-like turnout from African American voters. According to exit polls, African Americans accounted for about 18 percent of the electorate in 1996. By 2012, the black share of the vote rose to 23 percent. But early voting among that group got off to a slow start this year, raising a flag about enthusiasm. Donald Trump is trying to drive up turnout in rural North Carolina, including the east, where tobacco was once king and where the state is still suffering from manufacturing losses.   Ohio: This Rust Belt state's demographics play to Donald Trump's strengths, with a population that is about 80 percent white -- and heavy with working- and middle-class Americans who are anxious about the economy. Although President Obama carried the state in the 2008 and 2012 elections, Ohio has consistently polled in Trump's favor this cycle. After briefly falling to a tie in some polls in mid-October, Trump now leads Clinton by five percentage points, according to a polling average calculated by The Washington Post. Republicans are bullish that Trump will carry the state, which is a must-win if Trump hopes to take the White House. His considerable strength among white voters in the state, especially those without college degrees, is also bolstered by his double-digit strength among men. (Trump and Clinton appear to be tied with women voters, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll.) The Clinton campaign has made an aggressive push in Ohio in the final days of the election, hoping to compel enough nonwhite voters to cast ballots to stave off a Trump victory. On Friday night, musicians Beyonce and Jay Z headlined a concert in Cleveland to get out the vote.   Pennsylvania: With a large population of working-class and middle-class whites, Pennsylvania is an attractive yet elusive prize for Republicans despite having voted Democratic in the past six elections. Trump has sought to energize the Republican part of the state, which, in past elections, has been outvoted by solidly Democratic Philadelphia in the east and the area around Pittsburgh in the west. Clinton has focused primarily on those two large urban areas this year. For Democrats, winning Philadelphia has become the key to holding Pennsylvania, and doing so means motivating the large African American population in the city along with whiter suburbs at the periphery. Those ""collar counties"" have held appeal for Republicans in past elections but have not given Trump much hope this year. In 2008, Obama won nearly all of the Philadelphia suburbs atop the most populous urban areas. A polling average calculated by The Washington Post gives Clinton a 5-point advantage, but her campaign may see signs of trouble. She is campaigning twice in the state in the closing days of the race, and Vice President Biden, a Pennsylvania native, was spending the entire weekend there on her behalf.   Utah:   Utah, a red state that hasn't chosen a Democrat for president since 1964, isn't likely to do so on Tuesday. But it could be the only state to hand a loss to both Clinton and Trump, thanks to a former CIA agent. Evan McMullin, a Utah-born Mormon, is running for president as an independent. He claims to be competitive in 34 states, either on the ballot or as a write-in candidate. Some polls have shown him tied with Trump here, with Clinton not far behind. McMullin's surge reflects the qualms of Utahns, many of them Mormons, about voting for Trump, a brash, thrice-married New Yorker who has made lewd comments about women and wants to bar Muslims from the country. To take advantage, Clinton opened a campaign office and dispatched surrogates. Mitt Romney, who won Utah with nearly 73 percent of the vote in 2012, strongly disavowed Trump. Others have tried walking a finer line. After a tape emerged of Trump bragging about groping women because he is a ""star,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said he could no longer endorse him. Nineteen days later, Chaffetz said he would vote for Trump.   Virginia: Although Virginia is considered a swing state, for months Clinton had such a comfortable lead that both campaigns went off the airwaves in the summer. But polls have tightened, and both Clinton and Trump are back on TV, and Trump is scheduled to make a last-minute visit on Sunday. Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, will return to his home state the day before Election Day to try to shore up support among African Americans and others in Richmond, where he was once mayor, and in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, a fast-growing region that is rapidly diversifying and trending Democratic. Clinton has several advantages, including strength among suburban college-educated women, a sizable portion of the electorate in Fairfax, Loudoun and Henrico counties. And she stands to benefit from higher enthusiasm among Latinos in the state. Trump has sought to bolster his support among rural voters and made an appeal to the state's heavy presence of active-duty and military veteran. Obama carried the state in 2008 and 2012. A Democratic win could cement Virginia's status as a blue state in presidential races.       In less than a week, the United States will have a new president-elect. These are the pivotal points in Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's campaigns that led to this moment. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)     Wisconsin: The state where the Republican Party was formed has not gone to the GOP nominee for president since 1984, but Trump is making a last-minute and unsteady push to try to turn the state red. Trump had planned to campaign in the state Sunday but abruptly canceled his trip the day before. He had included Wisconsin in his $25 million multistate advertising investment during the final week of the campaign. Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, will barnstorm here Sunday as Democrats hope to maintain the lead they have built. Trump is wagering that his crusade against sweeping multinational trade deals will boost turnout among conservative white, working-class voters who have experienced firsthand the decline of the manufacturing industry in the United States. Wisconsin is the home state of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. The latter has had a rocky relationship with Trump throughout the campaign. The last time Clinton and Trump faced voters in Wisconsin, neither experienced much success: Both lost by double-digit percentage margins to opponents during the primary.   Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly said that if Evan McMullin were to win Utah, he would be the first third-party candidate to win a state in 92 years. George Wallace was the last third-party candidate to win a state; he won five states in 1968.   "

(Amanda Voisard)  A bipartisan group of congressional members and candidates is filing a federal suit Friday against the Federal Election Commission, seeking to force the agency to act on a complaint it brought against 10 super PACs in July. The maneuver is part of a legal strategy aimed at rolling back SpeechNow.org v. FEC, the federal appellate court decision that led to the birth of super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations. Once the FEC takes up the complaint and dismisses it or deadlocks on it -- as it is ultimately expected to do -- the group plans to file a broader suit against the agency that it hopes will ultimately reach the Supreme Court. If they succeed, said the plaintiffs' counsel Brad Deutsch, ""the consequence is the death of the super PAC."" The powerhouse legal team working on the case -- which includes Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University, and Richard Painter, who was the chief ethics lawyer for former president George W. Bush -- faces an uphill fight. Half a dozen federal appellate courts have held that contribution limits cannot be placed on groups doing independent spending. Supporters of SpeechNow said they were confident the challenge would fail. ""The lawsuit proposes a ridiculous theory and is a publicity stunt,"" said David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, who launched the original SpeechNow case. He said the plaintiffs are seeking ""to silence those who disagree with them."" ""It shows the real motivation of those behind the case,"" Keating added. ""They want government to limit speech."" The SpeechNow decision, handed down two months after the Supreme Court decided Citizens United v. FEC, arguably had as big of an impact on American politics as its more-famous cousin. The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit allowed wealthy individuals and corporations to give unlimited sums to political action committees that operate independently of candidates and political parties.

The group trying to overturn the decision is arguing that the D.C. appellate court erred in its interpretation of Citizens United, noting that mega-donors now give millions to super PACs that effectively serve as an extension of the official campaigns.
