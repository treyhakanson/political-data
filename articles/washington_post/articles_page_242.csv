Pat McCrory says the state is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for setting wildfires in the western part of the state. McCrory announced the reward during a briefing in Bat Cave, North Carolina, one of the towns evacuated because of threat of wildfires. McCrory also said dry conditions are causing the wildfires to spread, so people across the region need to continue taking steps to prevent wildfires. The governor said he was also concerned about air quality in western and central North Carolina. Smoke from the wildfires drifted eastward, specifically leaving a haze over the city of Charlotte. Also of concern is the weekend weather forecast, which calls for winds that could gust up to 50 mph. ___ 3 a.m. Thick smoke has settled over a wide area of the southeastern U.S., where wildfires are burning through decades of leaf litter, and people are breathing in tiny bits of the southern Appalachian forests with every gulp of air. It's a constant reminder of the dozens of wildfires threatening small mountain communities in Rabun County, Georgia, where people feel like they're under duress. Tim Free, a lifelong resident, breaks down with emotion as he describes how elderly neighbors are struggling with relentless smoke so thick it blocks the sun. Scott Cates, the pastor of Liberty Baptist church, says many fear the fires will consume their homes. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Saying less is usually the way to get more. But contenders -- and wannabe contenders -- for spots in President-elect Donald Trump's administration are upending that tradition. They're touting their qualifications in public appearances and chatting openly about their interactions with Trump's team. They're handicapping their rivals. Some of those who appear to be under the most serious consideration are conspicuously strolling by the pack of journalists gathered in the Trump Tower lobby on their way to meetings with the president-elect and his team. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani set the tone. After declaring that he wouldn't serve as attorney general, Giuliani was asked whether there were better choices for secretary of state than some of names being bandied about.  ""Maybe me,"" Giuliani said with a grin. Shortly after, a senior Trump official confirmed Giuliani was indeed under consideration to become the nation's top diplomat. So, too, is Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker -- at least according to the senator.  ""I know my name is in the mix,"" Corker said, adding that he nevertheless expected the State Department post would go to someone more deeply involved with the Republican's presidential campaign. In some ways, the more free-flowing discussion is a refreshing shift from the usual Washington parlor game, where job candidates publicly dismiss their chances with faux modesty, then use emissaries to ensure their name stays in the conversation. The current approach is also a reflection of the man whom the job hopefuls are trying to impress. Trump held what amounted to a public audition process when he was picking his running mate, inviting top contenders to appear with him at rallies and speak to his enthusiastic crowds. That approach had echoes of Trump's reality television show, ""The Apprentice,"" where contestants competed for a job in one of the host's businesses. But for much of the past week, Trump has uncharacteristically stayed out of the public fray as lawmakers, business leaders and others jockey for jobs in his administration. He's made only a handful of public comments since winning the election and has largely avoided speculating on who could end up in the White House and Cabinet agencies.  ""I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!"" Trump wrote on Twitter, which has served as his main form of communication this week. Kellyanne Conway, who managed Trump's campaign, suggested the president-elect finds the public wrangling counterproductive.  ""These conversations are always best in private, particularly when you're forming a Cabinet and a senior staff,"" Conway said Thursday on MSNBC. ""Which is why I don't say too much about myself."" Moments earlier, Conway had confirmed that Trump offered her a job.  ""Mr. Trump asked me immediately if I would serve with him, come to the White House with him,"" she said. It's unclear what job Conway was offered or whether she plans to accept. Others have been more specific about how they hope to serve the newly elected president. Scott Brown, the former Massachusetts senator, volunteered himself to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. He told New England Cable News that if Trump offered him the VA post, ""I'd do that in a second."" And if the Veterans Affairs job isn't an option?  ""Then housing, I'm very passionate about housing,"" Brown said. ""I'd be honored to work at HUD."" Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp has floated himself as a possible agriculture secretary. He told reporters Wednesday that someone ""close"" to Trump's transition team had reached out to discuss the post. Some potential Cabinet secretaries have preferred to go the more traditional route, bashfully brushing aside questions about the future. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a loyal Trump ally who has been discussed for multiple posts, wouldn't bite Thursday when he appeared before reporters. In this one instance, however, Trump himself decided to stoke the speculation. His transition team released a statement Thursday that appeared to tee up Sessions to be nominated for attorney general.  ""While nothing has been finalized and he is still talking with others as he forms his cabinet, the president-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Sen. Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama's attorney general and U.S. attorney,"" the statement read. ___ Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Steve Peoples contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Armed military police spent hours checking cars and carrying out investigations at Rotterdam The Hague Airport after an anonymous tip Thursday morning warned of a possible threat. Late on Thursday, police said in a statement that they had detained a suspect in Rotterdam, saying he had previously made false reports to police. His name was not released. The threat prompted military police to take up positions around the airport, checking some cars as they approached the terminal. Flights to and from the airport were not affected by the alert. Police said ""extra visible and invisible security measures"" put in place during the day and into the night were ""revised"" after the arrest, but gave no further details.

(iStock)  Carrie Kovarik, a doctor and associate professor of dermatology, dermatopathology and infectious diseases at the University of Pennsylvania, was saddened when colleagues on the faculty urged her to sign on to a letter addressed to President-elect Donald Trump. (You can read that letter, signed by more than 460 professors at Penn, here.)  Their letter, written immediately after the election and a racist incident on campus in which black freshmen were targeted with group messages full of slurs and references to lynching, called on Trump to denounce that incident. Kovarik was horrified by the racist messages -- some of which were sent to the daughter of a close friend of hers -- but she didn't agree with the tone of the letter.    [Black University of Pennsylvania added to racist social media account with 'daily lynching' calendar]   ""It is a tone of hate, division and segregation of people within our country -- and it is time to come together and stop the judgments of each other,"" she said. ""It is time to listen to each other."" She wrote a letter in response.  -- Susan Svrluga I was invited to attend a dinner with a dozen other accomplished professors from across the school. I heard one story after another about rooms set aside for our students grieving the election results, special sessions held the day after the election to support troubled faculty and students, as well as the feeling of those in the room of ""how this could happen."" After my decision to vote Republican in this election, I was faced with incredible judgment and ridicule from colleagues in academia. After initially expressing my opinion, I became tired of arguing --  being labeled with misplaced stereotypes only based on who I would be voting for --  and being judged regardless of the issues that mattered to me. No one seemed to be interested if anyone had a different opinion --  they just assumed everyone had the same opinion because of where we were and what we did. The feeling of political exclusion worsened as heinous acts on our campus against African American students (some of whom I know and respect) took place. Faculty openly expressed in large meetings their disgust for anyone who voted for Trump, while directing their anger my way. I understood their fears and frustrations; however, they never gave me a chance to explain my views. Many of the views shared by my colleagues, including embracing diversity on campus and access to health care, are exceptionally important to me; however, these are not the only opinions that need to be realized in this great country. America is great because we have people from all walks of life --  with different needs --  and many of us in this academic institution are not familiar with those needs.   [Man investigated for racist messages had been accepted to the University of Pennsylvania]   This somewhat protected academic mind-set is often reflected on our students and trainees. We are here to teach them all viewpoints --  not to teach them only ours. We are an institution of higher learning, where free thinking and debate should be taking place. Somewhere along the line we have lost that freedom. In medicine, I do my best to explain all sides of health policy and what can work for each patient and situation. As a clinician who primarily works with patients with human immunodeficiency virus, sexually transmitted diseases, and those with complicated social issues, I encourage each trainee to leave all assumptions at the door and learn about the patient as an individual. This is certainly where I have been able to make the biggest impact with individual patients, as they know that I respect them no matter where they have come from in life and they learn to trust me. Maybe this is how we should relate to each other no matter what the situation? As a physician that has worked over a decade to improve access to care for those in need and provide quality care, this election was very important to me. I saw it as an opportunity in many facets of health care that long needed change. I have seen that many Americans have benefited from the Affordable Care Act, but I have also witnessed the struggling inner-city working poor who cannot meet their high deductibles and are functionally uninsured. I have diagnosed potentially fatal conditions, including melanoma, in patients who are struggling to work and cannot afford health insurance. There are voices that cry out in rural America frustrated by incredible gaps in specialty care, including many community hospitals that lack needed emergency psychiatric and stroke services. Doctors are burning out and quitting practice due to intense government regulations and reporting requirements, which are also taking face time away from our patients. Putting insurance in the hands of people in this country is a small part of the equation that leads to increasing access to care. Once they have access, the bottleneck to care is moved down the line --  we don't have more doctors, specialists or hospitals --  so we need to plan for innovative solutions that will help to provide them care. Bringing quality-integrated telemedicine solutions to underserved communities, decreasing the regulatory burden on doctors to give them more time with patients, and working with other industries to allow for affordable drug prices are just a few pieces of the puzzle that can come together for a greater working solution. Right now, this is not happening to a significant degree --  so when my counterparts look at me with disdain, I say, ""Why not give change a chance?"" I would encourage decision-makers to start to think outside the box, because the box we are in is getting too crowded. I would look to individuals to start communicating and learning about each other --  leave your assumptions at the door --  and you may be surprised that we have more in common than you think."

They called on him to condemn the attack at his alma mater.   The letter has now been signed by more than 450 faculty members.  (And one professor wrote a letter countering this view, which can be read here.)  -- Susan Svrluga Dear Mr. President-Elect, We are writing you from the University of Pennsylvania, your alma mater. As you have probably heard a group of Black students in our 2020 class were assaulted on Friday by text messages, photos, and threats via a GroupMe chat to which they were added without their permission. As you have probably also heard, the attackers evoked your name numerous times in their onslaught, calling themselves ""Daddy Trump.""   [Black University of Pennsylvania freshmen added to racist social media group with 'daily lynching' calendar]   In their heinous chat, these attackers scheduled an event called ""lynching"" for the day of the GroupMe attack and also sent images documenting a lynching that took place in the U.S. In resurrecting our country's long history of brutally murdering black people and invoking our national legacy of white supremacy, the attackers followed a disturbing pattern that we, as a country, saw play itself out in the long weeks of the presidential campaign and in the harmful alliances that you built in your path to the election. We remember from that recent past, as the Southern Poverty Law Center has documented, that you named far-right extremists as advisers to your campaign; that in your campaign rallies and from your Twitter feed, you repeatedly circulated and amplified racism, sexism, anti-Semitism; that you gave press credentials to a white supremacist radio host; and that you refused to denounce the neo-Nazi David Duke's endorsement of your campaign for many months. Additionally, you encouraged violence and hate repeatedly in campaign stops all across the country and assumed a permissive attitude toward identity-based intimidation and aggression. It appears that these students were racially profiled and targeted for this vicious attack by individuals outside of our own institution. As the FBI, the Philadelphia Police Department, and the University of Pennsylvania administrators continue to investigate the origins of this hateful crime against our students, the president of the university, the governor of Pennsylvania, the mayor of Philadelphia, and numerous student, staff, alumni, and faculty have publicly condemned these attacks.   [Man investigated for racist messages had been accepted to the University of Pennsylvania]   You, Mr. President-Elect, Penn alum '68, have been noticeably silent. As your path demonstrates, Penn students are poised to be leaders in all aspects of social, technological, economic, and political life. The students who were viciously profiled and attacked are at the beginning of their college education. They and their families work hard and sacrifice much to provide this opportunity for them. They, like all Penn students, deserve the chance to learn in an environment that recognizes and values their ideas, their work and their contribution to our country. What happened Friday irrevocably violated the safety and security of the students who were singled out and attacked. It also violated the safety and security of countless students on campus who are subject to the larger climate of identity-based fear and intimidation that your campaign specifically engendered and that, in the wake of your election, has grown ten-fold. Friday's attack is one of several post-election incidents that have occurred on our campus and we are not alone in this experience. Students across the country are reporting verbal and physical assaults. It was reported over the weekend that a black student at nearby Villanova University was knocked to the ground by three white men who charged at her yelling your name. As members of the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, we denounce the actions of those who viciously attacked our black first-year students via social media on Friday. This particular attack was focused on black students, but we are deeply concerned that other students are and will be subjected to similar assaults, both verbal and physical, given the dramatic increase in hateful speech and prejudice exhibited during the presidential campaign. We commit ourselves to supporting the many University of Pennsylvania students, staff, and faculty who are targeted because of ethnicity, religion, sexuality, gender, gender expression, disability, or because of their status as undocumented immigrants. We condemn the racist, xenophobic, sexist speech and behavior that you so consistently drew upon and also inspired during your campaign for President. We implore you to immediately and publicly denounce Friday's attack on our students."

Then came the bombshell that echoed all the way from the Potomac to the Dnieper. ""AMERICA PLAYS THE FOOL"" was the headline looming above a portrait of Donald Trump the next day. (Sych's colleagues talked him down from his first choice: ""A boor, an ignoramus, and a racist: Meet the new president of the United States."") ""The major emotion here is anxiety and concern because he really said all those things, so he must believe some of them,"" Sych said. Among those things he said: He would befriend Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ""is not going into Ukraine,"" and, ""The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were."" As to lifting U.S. sanctions on Russia? ""We would be looking at that.""   A possible cover for Ukrainian weekly Novoye Vremya's first issue after the United States election. Editor Vitaly Sych decided not to publish this cover, which called Donald Trump a ""boor"" and a ""racist."" (Novoye Vremya)  And then there's former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, whose previous job was as political spin doctor for ousted -- and reviled -- Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, now hiding in Russia. If Russia was rooting for a Trump victory on election night, it stands to reason who wasn't. ""The big loser of the election is Ukraine,"" tweeted Michael McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Moscow. In private, some Ukrainian politicians agreed. One lawmaker said the concern was a ""primal fear of losing support in the face of Russian aggression."" Pressed about Trump's statement on Crimea, Oksana Syroyid, a deputy chairman of Ukraine's parliament, said: ""I resent that. I hope that since the campaign is over he'll reconsider.""  But one week after the election, the truth is that nobody here in government wants to discuss the things Trump said about Ukraine. Necessity, in this case, dictates thick skin and a timely bout of amnesia as Kiev looks to make its case to the president-elect and his Republican Party. Trump and President Petro Poroshenko spoke for the first time on Tuesday, and Ukrainian officials, optimistically, are hoping to arrange a meeting between the two in New York in February, when Ukraine chairs the U.N. Security Council. ""I see it as a challenge with a plus,"" said Victoria Voytsitska, a member of parliament who is concerned about Ukraine sliding deeper into corruption and complained about doublespeak from current U.S. officials. ""I really think he'll be straightforward. They will demand real changes. Unless he does that, we're doomed."" Wishful thinking aside, Ukrainian officials are looking to tamp anxiety about a Trump term. Two years after the country's ""Revolution of Dignity,"" which toppled the Yanukovych government, the country is looking to the United States as a counterweight to neighboring Russia and as a source of aid and impetus for change in Ukraine. There are two premises as to why not all is lost. First is that the president-elect was exaggerating, speaking ad hoc when he made statements during the campaign that don't reflect his real foreign policy.     Many far-right parties in Europe are celebrating Donald Trump's victory. (Jason Aldag,Ishaan Tharoor/The Washington Post)   ""I am certain that his ego will drive him to show who is in charge,"" Voytsitska said. ""The rhetoric about Russia? I believe it was just to be different from the usual. In reality, he will start to show the muscles of the great country."" And second is that a deep bench of hawkish Republicans would nudge Trump's foreign policy toward Ukraine and away from Russia. There is intense focus here on who will occupy key positions in the administration and questions about who will replace important players vis-a-vis Ukraine and Russia, among them Vice President Biden and the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, Victoria Nuland. She has been handling talks with Russia over the Minsk agreements, as they are called, which instituted an often-violated cease-fire in breakaway regions of Eastern Ukraine. ""Republicans are more pro-Ukraine than Democrats,"" said a high-ranking Ukrainian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president-elect candidly. ""And of course the Republicans are going to influence their candidate."" Ukrainian officials like the names that have been floated for secretary of state. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is known here for demanding that the United States provide Ukraine with lethal aid (the Obama administration has delivered tens of millions of dollars in nonlethal aid, but has not provided weapons or munitions). John Bolton, a former diplomat and leading Republican hawk, raises appreciative eyebrows. Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is also viewed positively. The hometown favorite -- before he said Thursday that he would not be taking a position in Trump's Cabinet -- was Newt Gingrich. The former House speaker traveled to Kiev in September to meet Poroshenko and spoke at the Yalta European Strategy conference, where he told attendees that Trump's policies if he were elected might differ from his campaign statements, according to a news release from the conference organizers.  Trump ""shocked some people,"" Sych said. ""We thought it was Ukrainian tactics to first try and win the election campaign and then try to build your views and values, because there's a lot of populists here. Nobody thought that could be the case in the U.S."" Ukrainian officials say their priorities now are to see U.S. sanctions against Russia rolled over, confirm the next tranche of U.S. financial aid to Ukraine, secure nonlethal assistance, strengthen the military partnership between the two countries and also find a way to make a symbolic statement of alliance. Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the Institute of World Policy in Kiev, said that officials were eager to establish good relations with Trump but were still testing channels of communication. She was concerned that ""there will be less input from the West in terms of conducting reforms,"" further reducing pressure on reluctant officials. Oleksiy Melnyk, the co-director for foreign relations and international security programs at the Kiev-based Razumkov Center, said that Ukrainian officials were caught off-guard by the results of the election. But he played down the potential, now theoretical, benefits of a Clinton victory. ""The attempt to believe that the election of Hillary Clinton would be a solution to the Ukraine conflict was very naive,"" he said. ""The good news is that we won't be disappointed. There were too many expectations for her.""

Clinton, backed by an emotional appeal from Barack Obama, urged voters to embrace a ""hopeful, inclusive, bighearted America,"" while Trump vowed to ""beat the corrupt system."" The candidates rallied voters late into the night, a frenzied end to a bitter election year that has laid bare the nation's deep economic and cultural divides. Clinton and Trump were both nostalgic at times, looking back fondly at a campaign that has put each on the brink of the presidency. Clinton campaigned with confidence, buoyed by FBI Director James Comey's announcement Sunday that he would not recommend criminal charges against her following a new email review. The FBI inquiry had sapped a surging Clinton momentum at a crucial moment in the race, though she still heads into Election Day with multiple paths to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the nation's first female president. Clinton closed her campaign alongside the last two Democrats to occupy the Oval Office, Obama and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, as well as first lady Michelle Obama. In a nod to the deep divisions that await the next president, Clinton said she'd come to ""regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became."" She cast the choice facing voters Tuesday as a ""test of our time.""  ""We know enough about my opponent, we know who he is,"" Clinton said, addressing tens of thousands of people sprawled across Philadelphia's Independence Mall. ""The real question for us is what kind of country we want to be."" ___ 10 Things to Know for Tuesday Your daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Tuesday: 1. CLINTON, TRUMP DASH TO FINISH LINE The candidates blitz through battleground states in a final bid to energize supporters, a frenzied end to a bitter election year. 2. WHAT COULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS A record number of Americans have voted ahead of Election Day -- driven by soaring turnout from Latinos, who often lean Democratic. ___ Members of group honoring FBI boss have longtime Trump ties NEW YORK -- FBI Director James Comey was honored Monday night by a group whose board includes several people with longtime ties to Donald Trump, including the CEO of the National Enquirer and a convicted felon who goes by the nickname ""Joey No Socks."" Comey, already criticized over his handling of Hillary Clinton's email investigation in the final days of the presidential campaign, accepted the lifetime achievement award from the nonprofit Federal Drug Agents Foundation. The group lists more than three dozen board directors on its website; another was the developer of a troubled Trump-branded tower in Toronto. An FBI spokesman said the foundation provides disability, bereavement and personal crisis support to federal agents and educational and charitable grants. Foundation representatives did not immediately respond to phone and email messages from The Associated Press. The foundation regularly hosts dinners and events honoring law enforcement officials. Past recipients of the lifetime achievement award include Attorney General Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan. It was not clear whether Comey -- a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan -- was aware of the board members' ties to Trump, or whether he decided those connections were not consequential given the group's stature with New York law enforcement. But the award and ceremony came as the FBI has been accused by partisans on both the left and right of injecting itself unnecessarily into the presidential race through Comey's statements and updates about the FBI's now-concluded review of Hillary Clinton's email practices. ___ Iraqi Kurdish forces advance as mass grave found near Mosul NEAR BASHIQA, Iraq -- Iraqi Kurdish fighters exchanged heavy fire with militants on Monday as they entered a town held by the Islamic State group east of Mosul, while troops advancing south of the city discovered a mass grave containing some 100 decapitated bodies. The offensive to reclaim the town of Bashiqa is part of the broader push to drive IS out of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, relieving those living under its occupation from the type of brutality, such as mass killings, that the group has committed. IS militants have carried out a series of massacres since seizing large swaths of southern and central Iraq in the summer of 2014, often documenting them with photos and videos circulated online. On Monday, Iraqi soldiers advancing into the town of Hamam al-Alil, south of Mosul, discovered a pit containing dozens of decapitated skeletal remains, the military's Joint Military Command said. The offensive to retake Bashiqa began at dawn with a Kurdish barrage of heavy artillery, Katyusha rockets and mortar rounds slamming into IS positions, providing cover for the advance of armored columns. Smoke rose from the town throughout the day, with large explosions sending dark clouds into the sky. ___ American volunteer medics treat casualties of Mosul combat MOSUL, Iraq -- When Iraqi forces pushed into Mosul's urban center last week, Derek Coleman, an American volunteer medic, was among those treating the wounded at a front-line field clinic. He said he helped treat 44 casualties before he lost count.  ""I think the Iraqi (military) got an awakening when they pushed too far forward,"" Coleman said, flipping through a notebook he uses to keep records of his cases. In all, 12 soldiers died at the clinic on Friday, he said. ""We had two Humvees just loaded with dead bodies."" As Iraqi forces struggle to secure the gains they made on Mosul's eastern edge, the fight against Islamic State militants has quickly transformed into close-quarters urban combat. With it, casualties among Iraq's troops and civilians are spiking, though Iraq's military has not released official death tolls. As Coleman spoke, hundreds of civilians could be seen in the distance pouring out of Mosul on foot, many holding white flags made of scraps of dishtowels, torn clothing and pillowcases. Iraqi soldiers gathered them on street corners and loaded them on trucks to be taken to camps for the displaced. ___ In defeat, SKorean president to let parliament choose her PM SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's president said Tuesday she will allow parliament to choose her prime minister, a major political concession to growing anger as she scrambles to defuse an escalating influence-peddling scandal. The announcement by Park Geun-hye, who has faced tens of thousands of protesters and an investigation into whether a mysterious confidante manipulated government decisions, could severely curtail her ability to govern in the 15 months she has left in her term. Park's decision, which came during a meeting Tuesday with National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun, means that the liberal candidate for prime minister who she nominated last week as a way to settle growing anger will apparently be replaced. But opposition and ruling party lawmakers must first agree on someone else. The political tug-of-war over the prime minister, who is typically chosen by the president as a No. 2, comes as opposition lawmakers demand that Park distance herself from domestic affairs because of the scandal involving Park's longtime confidante, Choi Soon-sil, who has no official government role. Park giving up the presidential prerogative to choose a prime minister will further weaken her politically. She already faces terrible approval ratings and calls from the public to step down. ___ Custody agreement reached in Jolie-Pitt divorce case LOS ANGELES -- Angelina Jolie Pitt will continue to have sole custody of her six children with Brad Pitt in a joint agreement reached by the actors, a representative for the actress said Monday. The agreement calls for the former couple's six children, who range in ages from 8 to 15, to continue to have ""therapeutic visits"" with Pitt. Jolie Pitt filed for divorce in September, days after Pitt was involved in a disturbance during a private fight with his family. She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the breakup, and an attorney said at the time she filed for divorce ""for the health of the family."" Monday's statement said the agreement was reached more than a week ago in consultation with childcare professionals. It says no further details could be provided, and it makes no mention of an investigation by child welfare workers into the plane incident. Pitt and Jolie Pitt reached a temporary custody agreement in late September that included at least some of the same terms -- visitation with his children and both sides agreeing to meetings with therapists. ___ Official: 40 to 50 buildings damaged in Oklahoma earthquake CUSHING, Okla. -- Dozens of buildings sustained ""substantial damage"" after a 5.0 magnitude earthquake struck an Oklahoma town that's home to one of the world's key oil hubs, but officials said Monday that no damage has been reported at the oil terminal. Cushing City Manager Steve Spears said 40 to 50 buildings were damaged in Sunday's earthquake, which was the third in Oklahoma this year with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater. No major injuries have been reported, and Spears said the damage included cracks to buildings and fallen bricks and facades. Oklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years, with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production. Sunday's quake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and about 25 miles south of where a magnitude 4.3 quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week. Some longtime Cushing residents said Monday they've become accustomed to the unsettled ground beneath their feet. Others shrugged it off as a cost of doing business living next to an oil hub. Fearing aftershocks, police cordoned off older parts of the city about 50 miles northeast of Oklahoma City to keep gawkers away late Sunday, and geologists confirmed that several small quakes have rumbled the area. Spears said an assisted living community had been evacuated after damage was reported. The Cushing Public School District canceled Monday classes. The Oklahoma Department of Transportation reported Sunday night that no highway or bridge damage was found within a 15-mile radius of the earthquake's epicenter. ___ Geologists explain Oklahoma earthquakes, ponder 'unknown' WICHITA, Kan. -- Thousands of earthquakes have rattled Oklahoma and neighboring states in recent years, with the most significant portion traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production. The latest strong temblor -- a magnitude 5.0 -- damaged dozens of buildings in Cushing, Oklahoma, but spared a major oil terminal and caused no major injuries. Here's a look at earthquakes in Oklahoma and what the future may hold: ___ WHY DOES OKLAHOMA HAVE SO MANY EARTHQUAKES? Scientists have linked Oklahoma's earthquakes to the underground disposal of wastewater during oil and gas production. Virtually every well produces some water along with the oil and gas that is pumped out of the ground. But wells in Oklahoma bring up a lot more -- as much as 10 to 50 barrels of water for every barrel of oil produced. That is far more water than is produced from wells in other U.S. energy producing areas like those in North Dakota where wastewater injection has not triggered earthquakes. ___ Authorities: 3rd body found on South Carolina man's property WOODRUFF, S.C. -- Investigators discovered a third body on the property of a South Carolina man who is now linked to seven deaths and the kidnapping of a woman who was found chained inside a storage container, authorities said Monday. Todd Kohlhepp, 45, became a suspect after the woman was found Thursday chained by her neck and ankle in a metal storage container on his 95-acre property near rural Woodruff. The body of her boyfriend was found a day later. The couple had been missing for about two months. The other remains were found near one another Sunday and Monday, and authorities are not sure who they are. Investigators were expected back at the property on Tuesday, but Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger said he didn't think there were any more bodies.  ""As the coroner, that's all I have been advised of. That was the total number of bodies I was told was on the property. If I am told there are more, I will be back,"" he said.

This notion, which has been around since FDR, holds that presidents have maximum political power in their first couple months in office and they must use it quickly and forcefully to enact their agenda. This theory of governing made sense when the country was in the Great Depression and was also understandable in Barack Obama's first days in office when the nation also faced dire economic times. As Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said then, quoting Churchill, ""never let a good crisis go to waste.""  In 2017, the new president will face a crisis all right, but it will be one uniquely ill-suited for the forceful imposition of political will. The crisis facing America today is not economic; the economy remains recovered, albeit weakly and unevenly. Rather, it is a political crisis. As this election has so depressingly underscored, our nation remains bitterly divided, and the two sides not only distrust each other, many of their loyalists hate each other. Politicians in Washington may offer an extreme and distorted reflection of their constituents' divisions, but they hold a mirror nonetheless. Neither party in the new Congress will be inclined initially to offer a new president much cooperation, let alone enact a sweeping agenda. Any new president in these partisan times, but especially ones as battered and reviled as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will have a deficit of political capital from day one. Should either interpret their victory as a mandate to enact an ambitious agenda in their first days in office, they will fail, further undermining their already weakened standing.   So instead of writing checks that will bounce for insufficient political funds, the new president in 2017 should try to use their first months to put political capital in the bank. Admittedly, that advice isn't an agenda but rather a governing philosophy and requires a fundamental change in how both candidates are thinking about their time in office. Both already have ambitious 100-day plans and seem intent on trying to impose their will and agenda. Here's an alternative for the new president to this conventional and outmoded approach to the first 100 days. Send a signal on election night that you understand the country's quarrel and that you know that almost as many people are condemning your victory as celebrating it. Announce that night that you will dedicate your first years in office to finding common ground. Use the transition to build a cabinet that has multiple members of the opposite party. Tell your staff to scrap the grand plans and instead ask them to draw up a strategy to win a series of small victories in year one of your presidency. As much as possible, avoid obviously controversial appointments so you are not immediately dragged down by endless confirmation fights. This will not be easy, especially on the Supreme Court, but there are ""compromise"" picks there too, such as Padmanabhan Srikanth Srinivasan and Patricia Ann Millett. Cancel the inaugural balls and parades and make a modest speech about trying to bring the country together while being realistic and respectful about its deep disagreements. Start small, so maybe you get to go big. Think not about a ""hundred days"" but a thousand."

Council to the left, ousting old-school politicians	" Like the nation's capital, the D.C. Council is changing. A wave of new lawmakers is replacing an older generation of mostly African American city leaders and reflects a younger, idealistic and more affluent electorate.  And those new council members are shifting the D.C. government to the left.  On Tuesday, the council approved legislation that would allow assisted suicide for terminally ill residents. It has enacted protections for transgender people and sought to regulate marijuana like any business. It wants to revive a moribund effort to strengthen campaign finance laws, after three former council members pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges.  But perhaps the new council members are most aggressive around economic issues and a commitment to use government to address inequality in a city with a growing income gap.  They have embraced a $15 minimum wage and are poised to approve legislation requiring employers to provide paid family leave. They want to enact regulations to create more predictable work schedules for hourly workers as well as new laws aimed at tightening rent control in a market with skyrocketing housing costs.    Councilmember Robert White, center, greets Darrell Gaston, left, as he and his brother, Michael, right, arrive at Changing Perceptions for a meet and greet. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)   [D.C.'s 16-week family leave plan would be most generous in U.S.]  The shift is fueling anxiety among the city's business leaders. Landlords are worried that their potential to earn a profit will be limited, and employers are concerned that new regulations will drive up costs and push down earnings. They fear that the council's taste for spending, taxes and regulation will drive away investment. Business leaders say the new D.C. Council needs to be more pragmatic and heed lessons from the District's budget crisis of the 1990s. ""You're definitely seeing rapid turnover [on the council], with a move toward members who are responding to younger voters with less of an institutional memory of hard times that the District faced,"" Kevin Clinton, chief operating officer of the Federal City Council, said. ""There's less collective memory about what can happen if you don't have restraint, if you overpromise as a government."" The council's new activism has also created challenges for Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). She worries that the council's actions will hamper business, discourage companies from creating jobs and strain the city's finances. She has recently created a task force aimed in part at analyzing whether the council's actions put D.C. at a competitive disadvantage with Maryland and Virginia.  Council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), elected in 2014 and viewed as a leader of a bloc of new progressives, sums up their goals as ""good government and economic fairness.""  The current council is often described as among the most liberal since Congress granted the city the authority to govern itself in 1973.      The District has approved raising the minimum hourly wage to $15. Here's how the measure will be implemented. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)   The trend partly reflects the idealism of new, younger residents who have moved into the District in the past decade, analysts say. A 2014 Gallup poll found the percentage of people living in the District who consider themselves liberal is higher than the national average and significantly greater than in any of the 50 states.  [A wave of mostly white voters is reshaping the politics of D.C.]  ""The biggest growing demographic in D.C. is college-educated whites, aged 25 to 35,"" Ed Lazere, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, said. ""Those are Bernie Sanders voters, right? They care about public safety, but they also are very interested in income inequality."" Some worry that the council has lost connections with the real needs of low-income people in the city.  ""There is a disconnect on the council with people who are progressive, and have these great and brilliant ideas, but at the same time, they're not from D.C.,"" said Dyana Forester, a union activist who lives in Ward 7. ""On the surface, they say the right things, but the implementation isn't equivalent.""  Forester welcomed the minimum wage increase and favors the paid leave and fair scheduling bills, but she said they are inadequate because too many people are working part time and don't benefit from those measures.  ""What about the people who have been here all their lives?"" said Forester, who is lead political and community representative for the United Food and Commercial Workers 400. ""I just think there's an extreme disconnect between the new legislators and the population that is underserved."" Beginning with the arrival of David Grosso (I-At Large) in 2013, seven new D.C. Council members have taken office. The new arrivals heralded a dramatic generational shift. All of them have been born since 1971, and they've changed the racial makeup of the body by a seat, giving whites a 7-to-6 majority.  Four of the newcomers belong to the progressive bloc: Grosso, Silverman, Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1) and Charles Allen (D-Ward 6). Many think they will gain a fifth ally with the arrival of Robert White Jr. (D-At Large), who took office in September after ousting longtime council member Vincent B. Orange, a quintessential old-school pol.  Grosso and White are candidates in the Nov. 8 election and are heavily favored to win. Two other nearly certain winners will be former mayor and council chair Vincent Gray (D), who is poised to take his old council seat representing Ward 7, and newcomer Trayon White (D), 32, set to represent Ward 8.  The progressive group gets support from other council members, depending on the issue. While the entire council is considered liberal, the bloc of five is seen as embodying a new approach and style that includes emphasizing honesty in government. ""I was trying to clean up the council [in seeking office], and make sure ethics is something we can believe in,"" Grosso told a recent candidates forum in Chevy Chase. ""Today, we're in a better place than we've ever been, because other people have risen up and run for office, people like Robert White, Brianne Nadeau and Charles Allen."" White beat Orange in the Democratic primary in June partly because of public concern about the incumbent's ethics. The city's ethics board had admonished Orange for intervening in a health department inspection of a campaign donor. While finishing his council term, Orange took a job as president of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, insisting that he could represent residents and businesses simultaneously. After complaints from the public and some council colleagues, Orange resigned his seat, and White was appointed to replace him until the general election. ""Above anything else, people were looking for candidates who would be focused on results and not on themselves,"" White said. ""I don't think voters trusted [Orange's] motives.""  [How a D.C. political novice unseated longtime council member Vincent Orange]  Silverman said the new members mark ""a power shift in the city"" that threatens the existing political structure. As the demographics of the city have changed, many new voters lack attachments to long-standing political networks in the African American community. Two council members replaced in recent years -- Michael A. Brown and Harry Thomas Jr. -- were sons of influential black politicians.  New D.C. Council members reject the old ways in which relationships drove decision-making, Silverman said. Instead, they want metrics and measurable results to undergird policy and contracting.  ""We are focused on campaign finance reform, for instance, and that is threatening to the entrenched political powers who have generally relied on relationships and money to keep their power and contracts with the District government,"" Silverman said.  White said the council's new efforts are focused on social and economic problems that cross race and class divides.  ""The consensus for a new style of leadership isn't restricted to any single demographic,"" White said. ""There are a lot of young people [of all races] who cannot afford to live in D.C. They are bunked up in one- or two-bedroom apartments and can't afford to pay rent.""  The cross-racial appeal was apparent when White attended a meet-and-greet event with constituents on a recent Saturday morning on Capitol Hill. It was at the home of Graham McLaughlin, 35, a white activist who chairs the board of Changing Perceptions, a nonprofit group that assists felons when they are released from prison. McLaughlin was hosting a pancake breakfast, and many of the guests were African American.  ""We see folks who have been in D.C. for a long time falling further and further behind, and that is not right,"" White said.  Kawan McCoy, 26, recently released from jail, told White, ""It's a blessing to have your support for this program.""  McLaughlin said several new council members support the nonprofit, including Grosso, Nadeau and Allen.  ""They represent me, but I also think they represent all the other folks who are here, who are different from me from a race, class, economic perspective,"" McLaughlin said.  Showdowns between the council and the mayor are looming over economic issues, beginning with the family leave bill.   [Bowser, council chair  spar over D  .C. paid family leave: 'What is the secrecy?']  The original bill, proposed by Grosso and Silverman, would have provided the most generous paid leave in the nation: 16 weeks a year, funded by a tax on D.C. businesses.  The bill is being revised under the direction of Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D). But Bowser thinks it's still too expensive. Her administration claims that D.C. businesses would bear all the cost while most of the benefit would go to people who work in the city but reside in the suburbs. ""Our reading of the Chairman's discussion draft is that more than 60 percent of the beneficiaries will be from Virginia, Maryland or elsewhere,"" said John Falcicchio, Bowser's chief of staff. ""While we're not suggesting we build a wall, we are guided by the principle that District resources should be used to give District residents a fair shot."" Council members expect the bill to pass, however, and next year is likely to bring more battles over regulating workers' schedules and rent control.  It's not just ideology that makes the council willing to spend tax dollars or to require businesses to treat workers differently. It's also the city's prosperity.  Grosso contrasted the current environment with the time he worked on the staff of former council member Sharon Ambrose from 2001 to 2007.  ""When our economy was in the dumps, you couldn't talk about what was best for your values,"" Grosso said. ""Every week you were thinking about what you could cut. But now we're in a time of plenty."" "

(Photo by James Hohmann)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: WINTER PARK, Fla. -- October has been full of surprises. Donald Trump's 1995 tax records came out on the 1st of the month. The video of the Republican nominee bragging about how he can kiss and grope women without their permission because he is a celebrity emerged on the 7th. A dozen women then came forward to accuse Trump of touching them inappropriately. The Obama administration's announcement one week ago that health-care premiums will rise by 25 percent would be the big surprise in any normal election. But this, of course, is not a normal election. Then James Comey set off a firestorm with his letter to Congress on Friday about reopening the FBI's investigation. What might yet happen on this final day of October? Republicans, struggling to hold their majority in the Senate and limit their losses in the House, have been riding this roller coaster and repeating the serenity prayer. To a person, they celebrated the Comey news as a lifeline. Most still believe Hillary Clinton will win in eight days, but strategists and members in tough races think that the FBI inquiry gives credence to their argument that Clinton needs a check and balance. They also hope that it drives to the polls those moderate Republicans who might otherwise have stayed home. By taking the spotlight off their polarizing nominee, however briefly, the news allowed Republicans to play offense this weekend -- a rarity in 2016.  ""That was a nice little break for Trump, my God,"" said Rep. John Mica, a Republican who has represented a suburban Orlando district since 1992 and now finds himself in one of the costliest and most competitive House races in the country. ""The way I figure it is Comey had to get it out because he knows we're continuing the investigation. What if the election had gone by and he had not revealed it, and she was president-elect?"" Mica's challenger, Stephanie Murphy, is a first-time candidate who did not decide to run until this June -- after polling showed Trump had made him vulnerable. She was also motivated by the massacre at the Pulse nightclub -- literally across the street from the district's boundary -- which ignited a local debate over gun control and LGBT rights. Murphy and her allies have been hammering the powerful congressman with ads linking him to The Donald, but on Saturday she twice declined to discuss Clinton's emails or defend her amidst the FBI reopening its inquiry. ""I'm really just focused on the issues that are important to the voters in central Florida,"" she said during an interview in a conference room at her headquarters in downtown Orlando. When I pointed out that she had spent the preceding four minutes attacking Mica for supporting Trump, she replied: ""For our campaign, we're really just focused on the issues that are important here."" Does that mean the emails are not important? ""I think people see me as 'Stephanie Murphy for Congress.' I don't think there's that connection to the top of the ticket,"" she protested. ""The reason we're connecting Congressman Mica to the top of his ticket is because he's saying and doing a lot of the same things.""    Stephanie Murphy talks with volunteers during a phone bank at her headquarters in Orlando. (James Hohmann)   Mica won reelection in 2014 with 72 percent of the vote, but now he might be in the swingiest House battleground in the swingiest swing state. Court-ordered redistricting brought downtown Orlando into the 7th District last year. So one-quarter of the voters are new to him. One-third of the new district is nonwhite. Democrats have a slight voter registration advantage. Barack Obama even campaigned in the district Friday night, with a rally at the University of Central Florida (which has 54,000 undergrads). Trump is struggling in suburban districts like this one across the country, and it will prove costly for his adopted party. To get the 30 seats needed to win the House, Democrats must topple some entrenched lawmakers like Mica. (My colleague Dave Weigel filed a dispatch this morning from San Diego, where Darrell Issa -- another veteran Republican -- is also in an unexpectedly tough fight. Read it here.)    Mica talks with his door knockers in Longwood. (James Hohmann)   -- On the ground in Florida, both sides agree that Mica is outperforming Trump, but they disagree on how much. The congressman says his internal polling has him up a few points. Murphy says her polling has her up a few points. Mica believes he can withstand some Trump drag but recognizes there is a limit. ""We think that we're holding our own,"" he said during a sit-down at Anna's Polish Restaurant in Winter Park, where he lives. ""We do eight to 10 points better than the presidential."" (For what it's worth, Murphy told me her internal polling has had Clinton ahead by double digits in the district and that, even with the race tightening statewide, her most recent survey still puts Clinton ahead by nine points.) Asked whether Trump might cost him his seat, Mica expressed sincere uncertainty. ""I don't know,"" he said, pausing to take a bite of a sauerkraut and mushroom pierogi. ""Trump is pretty strong in Central Florida. He was behind and then he's come up. So I just don't know. We're concentrating quite a bit on the independents and the soft Ds. ... We just haven't responded to all the attacks. I don't really want to spend all my time on defense. ... We've had some people call and say, 'Is it okay if we put up your sign next to a Hillary sign?' Fine with me!"" Mica argued that the mainstream media narrative underplays the extent of Clinton's unpopularity. Modeling turnout is far more difficult than usual this cycle because certain base voters on both sides will ultimately stay home, he predicts, but it's not clear how many. ""It's going to be weird at the polls,"" the congressman said. ""Who turns out?"" This is a top-of-mind concern for Democrats, too. Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) flew down from Boston to campaign with Murphy this weekend. Speaking with two dozen volunteers at a phone bank, he stressed: ""How much Hillary wins Florida by makes a big difference down the ticket."" A few hours later, a poll from Marist University, NBC and the Wall Street Journal put Clinton up just one point. And the New York Times, in partnership with Siena College, released its own poll giving Trump a four-point lead in the Sunshine State.    Mica visits a clinic that tests for the Zika virus as part of a Puerto Rican outreach effort on Saturday afternoon. (James Hohmann)   -- Mica is the consummate insider in this year of the outsider, and he's using that to his advantage the best he can. On Saturday morning at 10 a.m., he greeted 80 volunteers at a commuter rail train station in Longwood that was built a few years ago because he arranged for the federal money. The former chairman of the House Transportation Committee played a leadership role in bringing the whole SunRail project to fruition. He unapologetically boasted about the ""earmarks"" that made the beautiful station possible. The congressman invited me to shadow him for the day, and he and his wife Pat gave me a ride to his second stop of the day -- a parade in Winter Park. As he drove us around in a rented silver Prius, unstaffed, he showed off various road projects. He pointed out a major overpass that he said he got the funds for. He pointed out construction work to expand Interstate 4. He talked about a program to synchronize the traffic lights of 27 local jurisdictions. ""I made some money available in the last transportation bill for deploying the technology,"" he said. ""You can talk about national issues, but I think the light synchronization is probably the most important.""  He pointed out ""a strip joint"" by the county GOP headquarters and joked about how a redevelopment project he supported drove several other such establishments out of business. ""You see why my wife won't allow me to Twitter,"" he said. ""I think I am one of only three or four members of Congress that don't Twitter."" ""You don't have to Twitter, my dear husband,"" Pat Mica deadpanned. ""You just talk!""    Mica campaigns with his wife Pat. (James Hohmann)   The 73-year-old has been engaged in local politics longer than his 38-year-old opponent has been alive. He served in the state House during the 1970s. At one point during another drive later Saturday, he pointed out an old office building where he helped run Paula Hawkins's 1980 U.S. Senate campaign, along with Charlie Black and Dick Morris. Hawkins rode to office on Ronald Reagan's coattails that year, the first woman ever elected to a full Senate term without a family political connection. Mica moved to Washington to be the senator's chief of staff. A decade later, he ran for Congress himself. He's betting that the relationships he's made over the years translate into a fair amount of split-ticket voting. A surprising number of the 80 volunteers who came to that train station to knock on doors for Mica are city councilmen, county commissioners, school board members or former state legislators. ""He's on a first-name basis with everyone in local government,"" said Win Adams, 74, a former Seminole County commissioner. ""We ask him for anything, and he's always there. I've never seen her,"" added Brian Sackett, 63, the former mayor of Longwood. After the 2010 round of redistricting, Mica faced a primary against another Republican member of the congressional delegation. Sandy Adams ran hard to this right. ""She had Sarah Palin, Joe Arpaio, Phyllis Schlafly and Allen West,"" Mica recalled. ""Oh my God, the list was very long! But every one of her surrogates was from outside the district. I had the mayors and the local electeds."" Mica whupped Adams by 22 points. Because of these relationships and his clout, national Democrats struggled to recruit a credible challenger until the day before the filing deadline. ""My opponent isn't even known by people here,"" Mica said, dismissing Murphy as the daughter-in-law of a deep-pocketed Democratic donor. His wife cut him off. ""The opponent is really the DCCC,"" she said. ""Her campaign is being run out of Washington."" ""Nice lady,"" the congressman said, jumping back in, ""but she's not ready for prime time.""    Murphy talks with supporters at her office. (James Hohmann)   -- Stephanie Murphy has an impressive life story. She escaped Vietnam by boat as a refugee with her family. She was a civilian employee at the Defense Department and now teaches at a local college. I asked her about the critique that she does not have deep relationships with local leaders. She said their votes count no more than anyone else's. ""That almost feels like an elitist comment. And it's a little old school,"" she said. ""One thing he says to me is, 'I've never seen you before.' Well, congressman, we live in a district of 750,000 people. That you haven't seen a woman in her 30s who teaches full time at Rollins College and has two small children is not an astonishing idea, nor is it a disqualifying factor! I do plenty of work in the nonprofit, volunteer space."" When Murphy announced in June, her first private poll showed that only 6 percent of registered voters recognized her name. Now it is 66 percent, and Mica hovers around 80 percent. ""You all have increased my name ID in this district,"" she told the group phone banking for her. ""Now I can't go out without my make-up on!!"" Murphy explained that a third of the electorate in Florida's 7th District is politically independent, and that residents are more transient than Mica understands. ""We are a district that is wealthier, younger, more diverse and more educated than the average district in Florida,"" she said. Democrats also argue that Mica's bring-home-the-bacon pitch rings hollow in the post-earmarks era. He is termed out as chairman of the Transportation committee. Funding formulas now drive most federal appropriations for road projects. ""At a bare minimum, your representative should be bringing home federal dollars,"" Murphy said in the interview. -- Gun control is a major issue in this race. The shooting at the Pulse nightclub in June, which killed 49 and injured many more, happened just outside the boundary of the district. Mica talks about the attack by Omar Mateen in national security terms. Murphy uses it to call for stricter background checks. The gun issue comes up as one of the top three voter concerns in Democratic polling of the district, with large majorities supportive of stricter laws. Murphy likened being in Orlando right now to being in D.C. after the Sept. 11 attacks, and she attacks Mica for taking money from the NRA after the incident as part of her stump speech. Accompanying her at the phone bank Saturday was Christine Leinonen, whose 32-year-old son was among those murdered at the nightclub. -- Mica acknowledges that he was slow in ramping up for what has become the toughest general-election race of his career. His wife was diagnosed with colon cancer last October. Pat had surgery and then underwent six months of chemotherapy that ended the week of July Fourth. ""It probably slowed me down a little bit the past year because I paid a lot of attention to her,"" Mica said. ""We arranged her treatments so she had them on Monday mornings before I had to go to Washington. So I was with her for all of them. It really refocuses your attention. We've been married 44 years. ... Every week she's gotten stronger."" Because he did not build a massive war chest, Mica and his allies are now being outspent. At the train station, he pulled out his iPhone to read aloud an email from his media buyer that laid out how many points both sides have on the air. ""It's a least $5 million they've spent against us,"" he tells his volunteers, trying to motivate them to knock harder.    Mica participates in a parade in Winter Park. (James Hohmann)   -- Mica has lost track of how many times he's ridden in the Halloween parade in his hometown over the years, even as the complexion of the community changed. During our drive to the staging area, he spilled a large McDonald's ice tea on his dress shirt. So he gamely threw on a black blazer and held a bag of candy to cover the stain. He took off his wingtips to stand on the leather seat of a supporter's red Corvette. Over a two-mile stretch, he threw Dum Dum lollipops to children. A sheriff's deputy blocking off traffic yelled to thank Mica for all he's done to help out the department. ""See that,"" the congressman said, turning to me as I chased after him. ""That was unsolicited!"" At the end of the route, he thanked three other cops doing traffic control. ""See you guys next year,"" Mica said. ""I hope!!"" As the Corvette turned right off the parade route, the congressman passed over a bike trail. A middle-aged woman was cycling. He waved at her, and she stopped. ""How do you like that trail?"" he said. ""I love it,"" she replied. ""You know, I worked on making this trail possible,"" he told her. ""I don't doubt it for a minute,"" she replied. He smiled. ""I'm not voting for you though,"" she added. Then she kept biking. Mica shrugged his shoulders. Eight more days...     Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.

(Charles Dharapak/AP)   WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Federal investigators obtained a warrant to begin searching a trove of emails from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, as prosecutors scramble to assess their significance before Election Day. There are also reports that FBI agents stumbled upon the trove ""WEEKS"" ago. From Matt Zapotosky, Ellen Nakashima and Rosalind S. Helderman: ""People familiar with the case said that agents on the Clinton email team had known about the messages since soon after New York FBI agents seized a computer related to their investigation into [Anthony] Weiner, who has been accused of exchanging explicit messages with a 15-year-old girl. Officials said the agents probing Clinton's private email server didn't tell the director immediately because they were trying to better assess what they had. [Now, investigators] will look at whether the newly uncovered emails contain classified information or other evidence that could help advance the Clinton email probe. It is possible, though, that the messages could be duplicative of others already recovered elsewhere or that they could be a collection of benign, personal notes."" How long will it take? Investigators said they found 650,000 emails on the shared computer, with underlying data suggesting ""thousands"" of those messages could have been sent to or from Clinton's private server. It will take a week, at minimum, to determine whether the emails are work-related, or how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the department. The disclosure lays bare longtime tensions inside the bureau and the Justice Department over how to investigate Clinton. From Devlin Barrett in the Wall Street Journal: ""New details show that senior law-enforcement officials repeatedly voiced skepticism of the strength of the evidence in a bureau investigation of the Clinton Foundation, sought to condense what was at times a sprawling cross-country effort, and ... told agents to limit their pursuit of the case. The latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau's second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner ... they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin. ... The probe of the foundation began more than a year ago to determine whether financial crimes or influence peddling occurred related to the charity. Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity ... Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case."" The FBI's New York field office was one of a few that were ""looking into topics"" that touched on the Clinton Foundation's work. From Zapotosky, Helderman and Tom Hamburger: ""Agents in New York wanted to examine allegations of corruption and conflicts of interest that have swirled around the charitable organization of the Clinton family. ... The Clinton Foundation said it was never contacted by the FBI, suggesting the bureau's efforts were in a preliminary stage as prosecutors weighed in. But agents in New York have sought to keep their inquiries alive, feuding with the Justice Department about the lengths to which they can go."" Justice Department officials could have overruled Comey's decision to notify Congress about the renewed email investigation, but stopped short of ordering him to back down. From Sari Horwitz: ""Their decision partly reflected the institutional power of the FBI director, Comey's personality and the political realities they were facing. ... In this case, officials said Comey put the department in an untenable position by informing them that he was sending a letter to Congress because he had an obligation to lawmakers or they would feel misled. 'At the end of the day, if you have the FBI director telling Justice that he has an obligation to tell Congress, there is no way you can direct the FBI to do otherwise,' said one official. 'That's too fraught. You can't direct someone to withhold information from Congress.'"" -- Trump has taken to accusing Clinton of ""willful and deliberate criminal conduct."" ""In the diamond business, in the coal business ... they go, 'This could be the mother lode!"" Trump said yesterday in Las Vegas. ""This could be the 33,000 that are missing. This could be the 20,000 that are missing. ... I would think they have some real bad ones, but we're gonna find out...Maybe not."" (Sean Sullivan, John Wagner and Abby Phillip)    Eric Holder and James Comey in 2014 (Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA)   -- Eric Holder rebukes Comey in an op-ed for today's Post, writing that his Friday announcement violates long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions: ""I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI. And he has allowed -- again without improper motive -- misinformation to be spread by partisans with less pure intentions. I served with Jim Comey and I know him well. This is a very difficult piece for me to write. But good men make mistakes ... In this instance, he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications."" -- A bipartisan group of nearly 100 former Justice Department officials, including Holder and former deputy A.G. Larry Thompson, criticized Comey's actions in an open letter: ""Director Comey's letter is inconsistent with prevailing Department policy, and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections,"" the group says in the letter. -- Harry Reid said he thinks Comey ""may have broken the law"" by violating the Hatch Act, which prevents FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election: ""I have been a supporter of yours in the past,"" the Senate Minority Leader said. ""When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant. With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.""   -- Freshman Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) responded angrily:  Harry Reid is a disgrace to American politics, among worst men ever in Senate. He can't go soon enough, & many Democrats privately agree. https://t.co/4lCKx5pKi4-- Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) October 30, 2016   -- But even the former chief ethics lawyer under George W. Bush said he filed a complaint against the FBI for a possible violation of the Hatch Act: ""The F.B.I.'s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election,"" Richard Painter writes in a New York Times op-ed. -- A high-ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee called on Comey to resign: ""While I cannot know Director Comey's reasoning ... it was plainly premature, careless and unprecedented in its potential impact upon a Presidential election without a speck of information regarding the emails in question, their validity, substance or relevance,"" Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) said in a statement. ""There is a reason that FBI investigations are not usually made public until they are completed. To do so gives an impression of guilt before all the facts have been determined."" -- ""Weiner"" has become almost a curse word over the past several days for many Democrats. From Maggie Haberman and Alexander Burns in the Times: ""The fury that many leading Democrats feel toward Mr. Weiner had been building for years. His sexting habits embarrassed them. His attempted political comeback in 2013 disgusted them. [For many], the news resurrected memories of previous Weiner scandals. 'He is like a recurring nightmare,' said the Rev. Al Sharpton. 'It's like one of those 'Damien' movies -- it's like every time you think he's dead, he keeps coming again.' For some, the development touched off more worry than anger: former President Bill Clinton, who learned of the news en route to his last event of the day, in Pennsylvania, fretted that it would draw hostile attention to Ms. Abedin. ... Around the country, former aides to Mr. Weiner ... traded emails and texts throughout the weekend, fuming at the 'collateral damage' inflicted by their onetime boss."" -- The probe has left some wondering whether Abedin's role in a potential Clinton White House could be jeopardized. From WSJ's Laura Meckler: ""Some Democrats said Sunday they had no doubt Mrs. Clinton would bring Ms. Abedin with her to the White House. [Others] point to Mrs. Clinton's loyalty to her friends and staff, many of whom have been with her for years. Ms. Abedin, who is said to be personally closer to the candidate than any other adviser, is often described as akin to a second daughter."" Trump repeatedly pressed the issue at campaign rallies this weekend, mentioning her by name: ""Is she going to keep Huma?"" Trump asked Saturday in Colo. ""Huma's been a problem. Do we agree? Huma. Huma's been a problem. I wonder if Huma's going to stay there."" -- ""For Clinton, the damage -- at least at the moment -- is done. The conversation in the race is now all about emails. And whether Clinton did or didn't do anything wrong,"" writes The Fix's Chris Cillizza. ""That means Trump was out of the spotlight, which is the best/only place for him to be if he wants to have a chance at a comeback. At the start of this week, it looked like Clinton was running away with the 2016 race. She still might, but the last seven days aren't at all how she wanted to close the campaign."" -- Overplaying their hand: A Trump rally speaker in Vegas fantasized about the deaths of Clinton and Abedin while warming up the crowd. ""Conservative commentator Wayne Allyn Root, describing his fantasy of a made-for-TV movie about Clinton and Abedin, said, 'We all get our wish. The ending is like 'Thelma and Louise.' (In the 1991 film, the title characters drive over a cliff to their death.) 'It's Hillary in a White Ford Bronco,' he said. 'She's got Huma driving, and they're headed for the Mexican border. I have a name for the future TV movie. It's called, 'Driving Ms. Hillary.' He added, 'When they make the run for the border of Mexico, there's nowhere to go, because President Trump has built a big, beautiful wall.'"" (Politico's Ben Schreckinger) -- The email controversy was the focal point of all the Sunday shows. Trump surrogates praised Comey's decision as an ""example of real leadership"" while Clinton's surrogates characterized it as unfair. From Elise Viebeck:  ""This is clearly a very serious matter and we respect the institution of the FBI and we are confident that they'll handle this in a professional and timely way,"" Mike Pence said on ""Fox News Sunday.""  ""I guess he was trying to clear his own conscience,"" Trump manager Kellyanne Conway said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""As far as we know now, Director Comey knows nothing about the content of these emails,"" Tim Kaine said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""We don't know whether they're to or from Hillary at all ... If [Comey] hasn't seen the emails, I mean they need to make that completely plain -- then they should work to see the emails and release the circumstances of those once they have done that analysis."" Clinton chairman John Podesta defended Huma on CNN when asked whether she withheld information from the FBI. ""I think it's clear that she complied to the best of her ability turned everything over that she had in her possession,"" he told Jake Tapper. ""I don't think she knows anything more than what we have seen in the press to date.""  -- Not all Republicans piled on Clinton. She got some unlikely support from former Illinois Republican Rep. Joe Walsh last night:  Look, I think Comey should have said prosecute her back in July.But what he just did 11 days b4 the election is wrong & unfair to Hillary.-- Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 31, 2016      Fans celebrate after the Cubs beat the Indians 3-2. (Elsa/Getty Images)   -- The Cubs beat the Indians, 3-2, to force a Game Six in the World Series. ""Sweet home, CHICAGO!"" -- that's what they're singing now, all over Wrigley Field and its surrounding streets, and most everywhere else around this enormously relieved city, Thomas Boswell writes. ""Cubs players, their jersey tops off, in shirt-sleeves, are waving at their fans in the third base stands, thanking them and vowing that their season will go on ... and on. There have been celebrations of World Series triumphs -- you know, the ones that actually get you a ring -- that were not as loud nor as happy. All this joy, at a mere 3-2 victory in Game 5, to force this series back to Cleveland on Tuesday night, is actually about something else, something that the Cubs and their fans understand better perhaps than any group in the game: This night was about avoiding baseball humiliation. Not in the eyes of others, in the view of critics or other cities -- but in their own eyes. And all of them, team and town together, could barely stand that thought, a grievous image that's been building here all weekend.""

A woman joins Trump as he holds up a ""Latinas for Trump"" sign during a campaign rally in Las Vegas. (Reuters/Carlo Allegri)   THE DAILY DONALD: -- Desperate times call for desperate measures: Trump is redirecting his attention to three traditionally Democratic states in the final days, launching an eleventh-hour attempt to expand what for weeks has been an increasingly narrow path to victory. From Robert Costa and Abby Phillip: ""Trump rallied Sunday in Colorado and New Mexico, and he was scheduled to make two stops Monday in Michigan -- and visit Wisconsin the day after that. Clinton, meanwhile, is focused on shoring up turnout and enthusiasm, particularly among minority voters, in such critical battlegrounds as North Carolina, Florida and Ohio. Early voting data from Ohio contains ominous signs of a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton, notably in places such as Cleveland's Cuyahoga County, where high black turnout propelled President Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012."" Trump campaign chief Steve Bannon has settled on three states - Michigan, Wisconsin, and New Mexico - where the campaign plans to devote more time and money. Obama handily won all three in 2008 and 2012, even when the Badger State favorite son Paul Ryan was on the ballot. ""Bannon believes that if GOP voters rapidly 'come home' nationally in light of recent events, that turnout plus late-breaking support among independents and blue-collar workers could bring new states into play beyond Pennsylvania, Nevada and Colorado -- Democratic strongholds where Trump has been campaigning for months and remains behind,"" Costa and Phillip write. But early turnout in several of the states in question has already begun tilting Democrat, with Trump behind by mid-to-high single digits in some of the state contests.  -- Kellyanne Conway forcefully disavowed a supporter as ""deplorable"" for chanting ""Jew-S-A!"" at a Trump rally, in what is the latest incident of anti-Semitic rhetoric used by some of his supporters. ""That man's conduct was deplorable. And had I been there, I would have asked security to remove him immediately,"" she said on CNN. (Jose A. DelReal and Sean Sullivan.

(Amy B Wang) -- Police in Ohio are investigating a truckload of manure that was dumped in front of a Democratic Party office outside Cincinnati. Party officials said a similar incident occurred at the same location in 2012. (Amy B Wang) -- Trump and his supporters have touted their similarities to Britain's ""Brexit"" vote, predicting a ""Brexit times five"" on Nov. 8. Trump even calls himself ""Mr. Brexit"" in his stump speech. But The Post's London bureau chief, Griff Witte, says the analogy only goes so far: ""Even with the race appearing to tighten and with the FBI's investigative disclosures shaking up the contest, a Trump victory would amount to a far more dramatic upset than Brexit was, one that would defy evidence from polls, early-voting data and the organizational infrastructure of the two campaigns. 'The political comparison is absolutely apropos,' said Marcus Roberts [from the polling firm YouGov]. ""The electoral comparison is not.' As much of a shock as Brexit was, the polls were not far off. In their final surveys before the vote, two major polling companies got it wrong and predicted a victory for 'remain.' But two others got it right ... [and] another four had results within the margin of error."" Roberts acknowledged there may be some ""shy Trump voters,"" but he doubted the level of support is enough to overcome Clinton's apparent lead: ""For the Trump claim to be right, these polls would have to be wrong by double the margin of error,"" he said.    Trump, right, poses with New York City's Park Commissioner Henry Stern holding a pair of ice skates. (AP/G. Paul Burnett)   -- ICYMI: ""Trump boasts about his philanthropy. But his giving falls short of his words."" David Fahrenthold, who spent the past year researching Trump's claims of charitable giving, wrote a comprehensive review of his findings for the Sunday paper: ""For as long as he has been rich and famous, Trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public -- even nationally televised -- promises to give his own money away. It was, in large part, a facade. A months-long investigation ... has not been able to verify many of Trump's boasts about his philanthropy. Instead, throughout his life in the spotlight, whether as a businessman, television star or presidential candidate, The Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given -- or had claimed other people's giving as his own."" Anecdote du jour: In 1996, Trump attended the star-studded ribbon-cutting for a nursery school serving children with AIDS. He took a VIP seat for big-dollar donors up front, despite having never given so much as a dollar to the nursery or the associated charity. ""Nobody knew he was coming,"" recounted Abigail Disney, a donor on the dais. ""There's this kind of ruckus at the door, and I don't know what was going on, and in comes Donald Trump ... [He] just gets up on the podium and sits down."" Afterward, several donors recalled, Trump left without offering an explanation. Or a donation. One honored donor was stuck in the audience because Trump took his seat - and the charity spent ""months"" attempting to repair their relationship with him. Follow the money: The Trump Foundation's largest-ever gift of $264,631 was used to renovate a fountain outside the windows of Trump's Plaza Hotel. Its smallest-ever gift, a $7 donation, was paid to the Boy Scouts in 1989, at a time when it cost $7 to register a new Scout. Trump's oldest son was 11 at the time. Trump did not respond to a question about whether the money was paid to register him.    Nate Silver (Nam Y. Huh/AP)   WAPO HIGHLIGHTS: -- ""Nate Silver blew it when he missed Trump. Now he really needs to get it right,"" by Margaret Sullivan: ""If a statistics guru can be a rock star, Silver surely is. But even rock stars have bad days. Silver, 38, had a run of them a few months ago, when it became obvious that his consistent early dismissals of [Trump] were flat-out wrong. And this University of Chicago graduate wasn't used to being wrong ... Last week, in his Upper West Side newsroom ... Silver talked about learning that lesson the hard way -- and about the next hurdle."" -- ""Inside Evan McMullin's 10 years undercover in the CIA,"" by Josh Rogin: ""Vetting a former spy for the nation's highest office isn't easy ... This has left McMullin vulnerable to attacks he cannot publicly address. But I interviewed six former CIA officers who worked with McMullin during his 10 years inside the agency. What emerged was a picture of a young case officer who volunteered for duty in the world's most dangerous places and had a unique talent for recruiting members of extremist organizations as assets. After graduating in 2001, McMullin joined the CIA's directorate of operations ... and he soon found himself in a southwest Asian country where the U.S. military was deeply engaged in the new war on terror. While specific details of McMullin's missions remain classified, intelligence goals at that time included gathering information on the Taliban, developing intelligence for strikes on terrorists and searching for high-value al-Qaeda leaders, including Osama bin Laden. ... As a Mormon, McMullin could not indulge in the vices that often help to build such bonds, so he used his piousness and his experience before college as a missionary in Brazil to his advantage. 'He believes in what he says and that's how he recruited people,' the station chief said. 'People fundamentally trust Evan.'"" -- ""For 25 years, it has been Clarence Thomas v. Controversy,"" by Robert Barnes: ""Justice Clarence Thomas marked 25 years on the Supreme Court last week, and if he remains for another dozen or so, he could become the longest-serving member in the court's history. But the unofficial title of the court's most polarizing justice seems his to keep regardless of tenure. Dedicated supporters are determined that the 68-year-old Thomas gets his due as one of the court's most productive, if unorthodox, thinkers, and they seized on the 25th anniversary to make their point. They have created websites and a Twitter account to remind the world of his accomplishments [and] held a symposium on his jurisprudence ... His detractors continue to characterize his mostly silent demeanor on the bench during oral arguments as disinterest. The subject himself tends to leave the debate to others. 'I don't spend a lot of time looking back,' he told an appreciative audience that gathered at the Heritage Foundation on Wednesday to congratulate him. 'I'm not a navel-gazer.'""    Obama speaks during a campaign rally for Clinton in North Las Vegas, Nevada. (Ethan Miller/Getty)   -- ""From hope and change to Trump and Clinton,"" by Greg Jaffe: ""In his quest to help Clinton win the presidency, Obama is spending his final days in office facing a 'hopeless' electorate. For many who will wait hours in line to hear him speak, Obama's 2008 election represented one of the most hopeful moments in American politics in decades. ... Today those words sound as if they came from a different era. Obama will close out his presidency at what is perhaps the least hopeful moment in American politics in decades, a time when the two major-party candidates have historically low approval ratings and are locked in a bitter and coarse election contest. For much of this year, Obama, like the people who pack his rallies, has puzzled over what happened. 'It's one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,' he said earlier this year.""

The new standards must still be approved by the Texas State Board of Education where creationists are fighting to reverse the changes. The board members, unlike the education agency staff, are elected officials. That means the fate of creationism in Texas could be determined on Election Day.
