Far right leader Marine Le Pen, capitalizing on frustration with globalized trade and the status quo, reveled in her visit Friday to the ""Made in France"" exhibit in southern Paris. Socialist Arnaud Montebourg -- who once posed on a magazine cover wearing a striped French sailor's jersey and holding a French-made blender -- also toured the expo. Montebourg, who as economy minister tried to reinvigorate French manufacturing, is seeking the left-wing nomination for president. Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, running in a conservative primary Sunday, visited the exhibit, too. Donald Trump's election in the U.S. could notably bolster Le Pen's populist agenda, which includes resisting free trade deals and abandoning Europe's shared currency.

Gen Michael Flynn the influential position of national security adviser. (Video: Reuters / Photo: AP)   The Post reports: The most influential national security job in the still-forming Trump administration will likely go to a retired three-star general who helped dismantle insurgent networks in Afghanistan and Iraq but then surprised -- and sometimes dismayed -- colleagues by joining the political insurgency led by Donald Trump. ... Flynn has also shown an erratic streak since leaving government that is likely to make his elevation disconcerting even to the flag officers and senior intelligence officials who once considered him a peer. Flynn stunned former colleagues when he traveled to Moscow last year to appear alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a lavish gala for the Kremlin-run propaganda channel RT, a trip Flynn admitted he was paid to make and defended by saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels such as CNN. Flynn's personal testiness, unhinged zealousness, rash judgment and anti-Muslim hysteria echo Trump's deficiencies. Critics point out that Flynn's confrontational behavior and ""chaotic"" management style got him forced out from his last job as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn's presence in the national security realm will make it that much harder for Trump to attract quality people, according to multiple foreign-policy experts whom I contacted. Putting Flynn in the national security adviser spot makes sense if one wants to avoid a confirmation hearing. However, insofar as the national security adviser is supposed to be an honest broker who ensures that the president gets input from the State Department, the Pentagon, etc., installing a volatile personality, prone to extreme rhetoric, is asking for trouble. Most disturbing is Flynn's blatantly unethical conduct as Trump's adviser. According to Yahoo News: What was striking, according to ethics experts, is that given his overseas consulting business, Flynn began sitting in on classified intelligence briefings with Trump last summer. Flynn was reportedly so assertive during the initial briefing in August, peppering the briefers with rapid-fire questions, that Trump's adviser Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who also attended the briefing, was prompted to try to calm him down by placing a hand on his arm. Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, an outside watchdog group, said that she finds it ""deeply disturbing"" that Flynn attended these briefings at a time that he was representing foreign clients with interests before the U.S. government. ""It's exactly the kind of foreign entanglements our laws are designed to prevent,"" she said. One retired military officer who has advised both Republican and Democratic presidents said of the allegations about Flynn: ""If this is true, it's a disqualifying conflict of interest -- if not by ethics laws, certainly in the spirit of conflict of interest, not to mention security regulations. We should be deeply concerned about his ethical judgment, but more specifically how can he possibly provide unbiased advice to the POTUS about Turkey and Russia, when he's taken money from both."" One does wonder whether this egregious self-dealing was what Trump voters expected. Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, blasted the pick, citing Flynn's affinity for Putin, inflammatory comments about Islam, disregard for human rights abuses in Turkey and hair-trigger personality. ""Ideally, the president-elect, who strikes me as someone with an impulsive personality, ought to have someone who is a stable hand smoothing out the rough, impetuous edges of the president,"" he said on Thursday at a defense conference. ""The impression I have of Gen. Flynn is that he has a like personality to the president-elect."" That impression is widely shared. Although Flynn's appointment is not subject to Senate confirmation, his behavior in receiving intelligence briefings while representing foreign clients is well within the scope of congressional oversight. Are there Republican committee chairs willing to take this on, to drain the swamp and make sure those who misused access to the U.S. government are not rewarded? By the way, given that the FBI was apparently looking into Hillary Clinton's far less blatant conduct (meeting foundation donors on legitimate State Department business), where is James B. Comey? We hope his eager and leak-prone investigators aren't interested in examining only Democrats' foreign conflicts. Two points should be kept in mind. Historically, some of a president's initial round of appointments don't last very long. James Jones washed out as President Obama's first national security adviser pick in less than two years. In early summer 1994, President Bill Clinton cleaned house -- replacing his childhood friend and chief of staff, Thomas (""Mack"") F. McLarty III, with Leon Panetta and bringing in David Gergen. In July 1982, Al Haig (whose personality is closest to that of Flynn -- who famously declared ""I am in charge"" after President Ronald Reagan was shot -- was out as secretary of state, and one of our best secretaries of state, George P. Shultz, was in. In other words, presidents often make bad picks early on. As they come to understand the job and manage conflicting personalities, the troublemakers and the weak links wash out. House and Senate Democrats -- along with whatever brave Republican souls they can round up, plus outside groups and ordinary citizens -- need to take a stance on White House staff appointees such as Stephen K. Bannon and Flynn who are unworthy of high government posts. Two of Trump's first, most important hires turn out to be the chief executive of a Web site that panders to white nationalists and a Putin toady who got classified intelligence briefings while working for a foreign client. Loyalty is crowding out competency and decency in the Trump White House -- shocking, I know. If the president is going to insist on cramming one sleazy crony after another into the West Wing, perhaps the White House staff and funding should be substantially reduced. Someone has to drain the swamp."

Matt Maloney, with the online food delivery service, sent a companywide email Wednesday in which he said he was ""trying to reconcile my own worldview with the overwhelming message that was delivered last night,"" referring to Trump's win. ""While demeaning, insulting and ridiculing minorities, immigrants and the physically/mentally disabled worked for Mr. Trump, I want to be clear that this behavior -- and these views, have no place at Grubhub,"" he wrote to his employees. ""Had he worked here, many of his comments would have resulted in his immediate termination. We have worked for years cultivating a culture of support and inclusiveness. I firmly believe that we must bring together different perspectives to continue innovating -- including all genders, races, ethnicities and sexual, cultural or ideological preferences.""   [Millennials increasingly can't be bothered to go out to eat]   Maloney wrote that those who do not agree with his statement should resign ""because you have no place here. We do not tolerate hateful attitudes on our team."" Grubhub, which partners with more than 45,000 restaurants in more than 1,100 U.S. cities and London, serves 7.7 million active customers, according to the company's website. In a statement on the company website Wednesday, Maloney said he understood that emotions were raw in the wake of a divisive presidential election that had been a source of anxiety for many employees at his company, which is why he reached out to them ""during this time of transition for our country.""   [Why fast-food chains are making 'increasingly outrageous' creations to get you through the door]   ""I absolutely reject the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump and will work to shield our community from this movement as best as I can,"" he wrote in the email to employees. ""As we all try to understand what this vote means to us, I want to affirm to anyone on our team that is scared or feels personally exposed, that I and everyone else here at Grubhub will fight for your dignity and your right to make a better life for yourself and your family here in the United States."" Maloney also alluded to Clinton's concession speech earlier in the day, in which she told the American people: ""We owe [Trump] an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power."" ""But,"" Maloney said, ""never stop believing that the fight for what's right is worth it."" In his website statement, Maloney said his email may have been misconstrued by the news media, explaining that he did not tell those who had voted for Trump that they were not welcome to work for his company.   GrubHub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees, regardless what you may have read. https://t.co/jF6oG6hg6M -- Matt Maloney (@M3aloney) November 11, 2016     Thank you for your perspectives, everyone's is welcome.

(Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post)  Behind the barber's chair where Claude Rasnake diagnoses many of the world's problems, he charted the to-do list of the Trump administration. Social Security, Medicare, the tax code -- maybe Trump and a Republican Congress can finally get them fixed. Dismantle Obamacare and fix roads and bridges, too. But all that comes later, after the top priority.  ""The first thing I'd like him to do is fire that lady that runs the EPA,"" Rasnake, 81, said, working the trimmer around a customer's ear. The Environmental Protection Agency makes regulations that limit the use of coal, and here that kills jobs. Rasnake had pondered his vote for months. He didn't like Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton -- didn't like the insults and the lies. But about a week ago he made up his mind, and it came down to this: Clinton had promised to put coal companies out of business and Trump donned a miner's helmet and said he would help the dying industry.  [McConnell says it's 'hard to tell' if President Trump will bring back coal jobs]  ""That was the basis of our economy here,"" Rasnake said, as his customer began to grunt in agreement. ""That's really hurt. I've lost customers -- some have had to move away. The one's that are left have a hard time getting by, month to month.""     Claude Rasnake, 81, sits in his barber shop in Lebanon, Va. Rasnake voted for Trump with hopes that he would bring jobs to the area. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post)  This part of Virginia, the far Southwest, is almost as distant from Washington as Boston is. These are the red-state voters who went overwhelmingly for Trump but were canceled out by blue Northern Virginia. But while the Washington suburbs helped Clinton take Virginia's 13 electoral votes, the people of these hard-hit hamlets and towns woke up Wednesday to find that their man had actually won the presidency. ""I was elated. I was super surprised,"" said Roy Bonney, 49, who owns Red Oak Trading Co., a hardware and home improvement store in Coeburn. He had thought Trump shot his mouth off too much to get elected. Many voters here said the same, that they were unhappy with the way Trump talked and conducted himself. But they voted for him by a huge margin. Russell County, where Lebanon is located, went 78 percent for Trump, 19 percent for Clinton. Wise County, where Coeburn is located, was 80 percent Trump. Dickenson, Tazewell, Lee, Scott and Buchanan counties -- coal country -- were all the same. Many areas went more heavily for Trump than they did for Mitt Romney four years ago.    Variety's window in Coeburn, Va., displays support for Trump. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post)  Unemployment in these counties runs roughly twice the statewide rate of 4 percent. Most of the job losses are from mining and related industries. Virginia coal production last year dropped 70 percent from its peak, in 1990, and is declining every year. The growth jobs are in retail, food services, health care and social assistance, according to data from the Virginia Employment Commission. A lot of the work is part time. ""We've had a lot of factories closing down. Families have lost jobs,"" said Linda Smith, 39, who works part time at the Food City grocery store in Lebanon and can't afford health insurance, even under the Affordable Care Act. Her husband, who once worked in mining, is disabled from a car accident. ""Men don't know how to do nothing at all except work in the coal mines. . . . If [Trump] can get some of that opened back up, people will be happy."" In Wise County, Juan Lopez, 42, climbs down off the huge mining truck he's been repairing, hands blackened with grease. He came to the United States in 1991 from Mexico, got married, got his citizenship, had two children. ""We go to church,"" he said. ""We're trying to do it right.""  Lopez voted for Trump. It was a vote to keep his job. ""They say if Trump can do it better [with the coal industry], we might be able to have jobs two or three more years,"" he said. ""But if not, we might be out by the end of next year.""     Juan Lopez, 42, works at Double R Trucking in Coeburn, Va. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post)     Ricky Meade, 47, owner of Double R Trucking, stands between his trucks in Coeburn, Va. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post)    Lopez's employer, Ricky Meade, owns a vast fleet of trucks for hauling or loading coal -- yellow and red Peterbilt and Kenworth rigs with 35-foot trailers, about 70 of them sitting idle behind a chain-link fence bearing Trump/Pence signs.  ""We went from running 85 trucks to running eight trucks, over the past three or four years,"" said Meade, 47. He grew up here, but now lives an hour's drive away in Bristol, Tenn., so his daughters can have more opportunities. His customer base is down to a single mine. From 105 employees, he now has about 25. He's had to hire a man to do nothing but start up trucks and move them around, so they can stay in working condition. The whole area, he said, is literally built on coal. All the commercial buildings are on sites that had been leveled by mining. All the jobs are connected. ""Everything you see, everything we got came in some way from coal. If it wasn't for coal this part of Virginia wouldn't exist.""    Trucks are parked at Double R Trucking in Coeburn, Va. The trucking company has seen a loss of business because of a decline in coal production. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post)  Meade stayed up long past midnight Tuesday, watching election returns. Then he couldn't sleep and turned them on again. He never thought Trump would win, and didn't much like him. ""He was the lesser of two evils, but he was our only hope,"" he said. ""With Hillary I don't know that we would survive."" Now he wants to see if Trump will deliver on what he promised. If he lowers restrictions on power plants, then use of steam coal may go up and some miners may go back to work. ""I know he can't wave a magic wand. I know we can't get back to where we were two or three years ago,"" he said. ""I hope we can get back at least part of it."" That alone is a tall order. Coal is simply on the wane worldwide as climate change becomes more of a concern, natural gas remains cheap and alternate forms of energy become more cost-effective. U.S. coal consumption dropped 13 percent last year. Back at Rasnake's barber shop, where he keeps his guitar in a chair because ""a lotta barbers play music, especially up here in these mountains,"" hope is barely hanging on. ""If we're going to have any jobs here it's going to have to be the coal companies. This little town is just drying up,"" said Kenneth Jessee, 67, who retired from a coal company three years ago to farm. As Rasnake talked about his decision to vote for Trump, the man getting a haircut finally spoke up at the question of whether Trump can make a difference. ""No, he can't,"" said William Sisk, 78, of Buchanan County. ""You won't see those people working in the coal industry no more. Natural gas is too cheap. Any kind of market for coal anymore is very weak.""     Empty train cars sit on the tracks near Dante, Va. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post)     ""Laid Off?"" reads a sign outside Dominion's Hybrid Energy Center in Virginia City, Va. (Julia Rendleman/The Washington Post)    Sisk spent 30 years at Pittston Coal, he said, as Rasnake finished and whipped the cover off him. ""I made a good living at it, got a good retirement. But it's gone,"" he said, referring to the industry, but also Pittston, which sold out years ago after a crippling strike. ""It was the life's blood here,"" Rasnake agreed. ""A lot of people talk about [President] Obama's war on coal,"" Sisk said, standing and getting his cap. ""But the coal war was on long before Obama got there. The bottom dropped plum out when he got in there and he got all the blame for it. But I don't think it's ever going to come back."" As Sisk stepped out into the sunlight, he confessed that he didn't vote for Trump. ""He's too radical. He promised too much,"" he said. ""You can promise anything, but you got to deliver."" Sisk didn't vote at all. "

Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), seen her in a file photo, is facing questions about his future as Speaker of the House. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)  JANESVILLE, WIS. -- House Speaker Paul D. Ryan is something of a political darling here in his hometown. There was near universal agreement among voters here Tuesday that Ryan seems like a stand-up guy, most people just call him Paul, and they are proud to see him on the national stage. But some Republicans in his home state and across the country still feel uncomfortable that he never seemed to fully embrace GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump during the campaign. ""It hurts the party that he doesn't support the Republican candidate,"" said Zach Molitor, 20, who cast a ballot for his hometown congressman at the Janesville public library and said he still keeps at home a framed note he received in sixth grade from Ryan. ""I'm disappointed."" After months of criticism over his soft support for Trump, Ryan spent the last several days trying to shake the idea he wasn't in the GOP nominee's corner while making the case to voters that supporting Republican candidates up and down the ballot is the best way to enact a conservative agenda for the country.          1 of 31       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                     Skip Ad   x           What it looked like at the polls on Election Day      View Photos   Voters cast their ballots in the 2016 presidential election.

But the loudest applause line came when Ryan held himself up as an example of GOP unity. ""I voted Trump, Pence, [Sen. Ron] Johnson, some guy named Ryan and every other Republican on the ticket,"" Ryan said to booming applause during an event that was part of his recent mad dash across Wisconsin in an attempt to shore up votes for the embattled Johnson. ""Republicans, we need to come home. We need to unify and we need to go vote."" [Paul D. Ryan won't defend or campaign for Trump ahead of election] Ryan's plea for unity was as meaningful for the party in the waning days of the election as it is for his own political self-preservation. Regardless of who wins the presidential election, he will return to Washington next week as the leader of a House GOP in crisis. Several members of the approximately 40-member House Freedom Caucus have openly discussed removing Ryan as speaker, in part, because they are upset about his early waffling over whether to support Trump and then his timid endorsement of the nominee until recent days. [Paul D. Ryan just finished his first year as speaker. He may not see a second.] He likely has enough votes from members of his party to be chosen as the GOP nominee for speaker during leadership elections next week. But he will also have to survive a vote on the House floor in January where he will need 218 votes to keep his gavel. Republicans currently hold 240 seats in the House, but the GOP is widely expected to lose at least 10 seats on Tuesday. If the GOP majority slips to around 230 it would take less than one third of the Freedom Caucus Members to end his one-year run as leader of the House. If Trump wins, Ryan will likely have to quickly repair his relationship with a nominee who has called him out for not giving him enough support. This relationship could be helped by Republicans' strong showing in Wisconsin -- Trump was leading in the state early Wednesday morning -- following the speaker's recent campaign efforts there, including a rally with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence. Trump had a clear advantage in the battleground states early Wednesday morning and House Republicans kept control of the House with what appears to be a stronger margin than expected. ""Speaker Ryan called Donald Trump earlier this evening, and the two had a very good conversation,"" Ryan spokesman Zack Roday said. ""The speaker congratulated Trump on his big night and also spoke with his good friend Governor Mike Pence."" Ryan easily won reelection and told the crowd Tuesday night that he was eager to return to watching the results pour in from across the country. ""I've just been sitting there watching the polls,"" Ryan said. ""By some accounts this could be a really good night for America."" Ryan's allies have pointed to all he's done to help the GOP maintain control of the House this election as evidence he is worthy of remaining speaker. In the past year, he has participated in 196 events in 31 states in support of vulnerable Republicans. He also transferred $40 million to the House Republican campaign arm and helped candidates raise $20 million by doing special guest appearances at campaign events. [Inside Paul D. Ryan's bid to woo the House Freedom Caucus] But despite his fundraising work and calling for solidarity on the trail in recent days, Ryan's less than enthusiastic embrace of Trump is still causing some heartburn for many Republicans. ""I'm glad he came around,"" said Bob Young, a former mayor of Augusta, Ga. and a former regional director at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the George W. Bush administration who traveled to Wisconsin to help campaign for Republicans. ""I wish he would have come around a lot earlier but you'll take what you can get."" As they left the Monday night rally, most voters expressed confidence the party would come together after the elections and said the discord was all par for the course in a difficult political year. Some borrowed a phrase Ryan himself likes to use when Republicans have differences: They said it was a family conversation. ""We're family and we have internal bickering sometimes,"" said Joseph Galvan, who traveled to Wisconsin from Elgin, Ill. Young and others said that if Trump loses to Clinton they expect GOP leaders like Ryan to get to work putting the party back together. ""At some point if we're going to be a player four years from now on a national stage,"" Young said. ""There's no question that we have to come together as a party.""

But it appeared that disgraced former lawmaker Joe Morrissey was out of the running, placing a distant third in the popular vote. Pre-election polls had shown Morrissey leading, but he was plagued by a number of sex scandals, including a legal client's recent claim that he made unwanted sexual advances. Former Secretary of the Commonwealth Levar Stoney led the popular vote and former leader of an economic development organization Jack Berry was in second place. But a candidate must win five out of the nine council districts to avoid a runoff election. Stoney led in five districts, but one of them by fewer than 300 votes without absentee ballots being counted. The top two candidates in the popular vote go to a runoff in December. ___ 10:40 p.m. Hillary Clinton has won the presidential contest in Virginia -- the home state of her running mate, Tim Kaine. The Democrat beat Republican businessman Donald Trump in the swing state to pick up 13 electoral votes on Tuesday. Clinton was favored to win Virginia, which Kaine represents in the U.S. Senate. The vice presidential candidate previously served as governor of Virginia and mayor of Richmond. Current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is also a close friend of the Clintons. Clinton's victory marks the third consecutive Virginia presidential win for Democrats. President Barack Obama took the critical swing state in both 2008 and 2012 after several years of Republican victories. ___ 9:50 p.m. Freshman Republican Barbara Comstock has won re-election in Virginia's 10th Congressional District, fending off a strong challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett. The Comstock-Bennett race was the most closely watched congressional race in Virginia; Comstock started off with an advantage but many analysts rated the contest a tossup in the campaign's final weeks. Comstock emphasized her clout with the GOP's House leadership and took steps to distance herself from presidential nominee Donald Trump. Bennett, a real estate developer, was making her first run for public office. The 10th District stretches from the wealthy suburbs of McLean inside the Capital Beltway out west to Winchester. ___ 9:40 p.m. Democrat Donald McEachin has won election in Virginia's 4th Congressional District, giving Democrats control of a seat that has been in Republican hands since 2001. McEachin, a state senator from the Richmond area, defeated Republican Mike Wade, the sheriff in Henrico County. While the 4th District has long been represented by a Republican, McEachin's election was no surprise. The district boundaries were altered significantly after a panel of federal judges ruled that black voters had been wrongly packed into a neighboring district. The redistricting made the 4th District, which stretches from the Richmond suburbs to parts of Hampton roads, significantly more friendly to Democrats. The district had been represented by Republican Randy Forbes, who tried unsuccessfully to run in the 2nd District after the new boundaries were drawn. ___ 8:25 p.m. Republican Scott Taylor has won election in Virginia's 2nd Congressional District, defeating Democrat Shaun Brown. Taylor, a former Navy SEAL and state delegate from Virginia Beach, will succeed moderate Republican Scott Rigell, who decided not to seek a fourth term. Taylor's most significant challenge came in the primary, where he defeated Randy Forbes, a sitting congressman who tried to move from the 4th District to the 2nd District after a court-ordered redistricting erased the GOP's edge in his own district. The Democratic candidate -- Brown, a community activist from Newport News -- was the only Democrat who filed to run for the seat. ___ 8:15 p.m. Virginia's incumbent congressional representatives have made a strong showing in Tuesday's election. The Associated Press has declared incumbents in seven districts the winners of their races. In the 1st Congressional District, Republican Rob Wittman won another term, defeating Democratic challenger M.D. Rowe and Glenda Gail Parker, an independent. In the 3rd District, Democratic Bobby Scott defeated Republican M.L. ""Marty"" Williams. In the 6th District, Republican Bob Goodlatte beat Democrat Kai Degner. In the 7th District, Republican Dave Brat defeated Eileen Bedell. In the 8th District, Democrat Donald Beyer beat Republican Charles Hernick and independent Julio Gracia. In the 9th, Republican Morgan Griffith defeated Democrat Derek Kitts and independent Janice Allen Boyd. Incumbent Gerry Connolly, a Democrat who was unopposed, took the 11th District. ___ 8:10 p.m. Republican Tom Garrett has won the open seat in Virginia's 5th Congressional District, keeping the seat in GOP hands. Garrett, a state senator from Buckingham County, defeated Democrat Jane Dittmar, the former chair of the board of supervisors in Albemarle County. The district stretches from Fauquier County on the edge of northern Virginia through Charlottesville and down to much of southside Virginia. It has been represented since 2011 by Republican Robert Hurt, who opted not to seek re-election. The race drew national attention when a gun-toting supporter of Donald Trump carried out a one-man protest outside a Dittmar campaign office. Gun-rights supporters criticized Dittmar after one of her campaign volunteers called police in response to the man's presence. ___ 5:45 p.m. The head of Virginia's Department of Elections says complaints about problems at the polls have so far not been any greater than in previous years. Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortes said at a news conference Tuesday evening that among the ""isolated issues"" were long lines in Richmond, Chesapeake, Prince William, Spotsylvania and Staunton. He says elections officials are monitoring the lines and reminds voters that anyone in line by the time polls close at 7 p.m. will be able to vote. Cortes says several precincts in northern Virginia's Fairfax County didn't properly load their electronic poll book data, so some people who likely were registered weren't showing up. He says those people were given provisional ballots and the elections office will work quickly to process them. He says the department also got complaints from some voters who had registered at Department of Motor Vehicle offices but weren't on the rolls. Cortes says that happens every election and an audit process is in place to confirm who registered and process their provisional ballots. ___ 3:50 p.m. An election official in Virginia's most populous county says some poll workers were inappropriately asking voters for their driver's licenses instead of the other forms of identification they presented. Fairfax County General Registrar Cameron Sasnett says the poll workers were reminded that numerous forms of ID are accepted at Virginia polling places. He says no voters were turned away. Sasnett says the confusion arose in part because the county is using new devices that can scan driver's licenses and look up voters more quickly. He says he knows of at least two polling places where the problem occurred. ___ 1:45 p.m. Virginia elections officials say there have been scattered problems at polling places in the state, but nothing major. Virginia Department of Elections spokeswoman Dena Potter says police were called after two voters started yelling at each other in Chesterfield County. She says officers resolved the issue and no one was arrested. Potter says there was a display issue with electronic voting machines in Nottoway County. After voters made their choice for president, the selection was displayed under the header ""U.S. Senate."" She says the votes were still counted accurately despite the inaccurate display. Potter also says there have been long lines because of high turnout at some polling places, including in Richmond. ___ 8:15 a.m. Tim Kaine is not letting the biggest election of his life get in the way of his Tuesday routine. After voting at 6 a.m. and doing a round of national morning TV shows, Kaine met a group of friends for breakfast at the City Diner in Richmond. Kaine and his friends try to meet every Tuesday at the diner, a few miles from his home. The U.S. senator and former Virginia governor was greeted with cheers as he walked into the restaurant. ___ 6:15 a.m. Tim Kaine has cast his ballot for president in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia. The Democratic vice presidential nominee and his wife, Anne Holton, voted shortly after polls opened at 6 a.m. at a retirement community near their home. Kaine was cheered by supporters waiting in line. After voting, he spoke to reporters where he encouraged Americans to vote and said that if elected, he and running mate Hillary Clinton would try and bring the country together.  ""The sign of a vigorous democracy is one where a lot of people participate,"" Kaine said. ___ 5:30 a.m. Virginians are deciding whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump will win the swing state's 13 electoral votes, and voters also will weigh in on several crucial congressional and mayoral races. Leading to Tuesday, polls have shown Clinton leading Trump in Virginia, which is the home of her running mate Tim Kaine. Kaine represents Virginia in the U.S. Senate and previously served as mayor of Richmond and governor of Virginia. Other key races to watch include the battle for Virginia's 10th Congressional District, where freshman Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock is trying to fend off a serious challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
