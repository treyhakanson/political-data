(U.S. Senate Drug Caucus)   President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be attorney general of the United States, The Washington Post and other news outlets reported Friday. Sessions is a vocal opponent of marijuana legalization whose elevation to attorney general could deal a blow to state-level marijuana legalization efforts across the country. At a Senate drug hearing in April, Sessions said that ""we need grown-ups in charge in Washington to say marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized, it ought not to be minimized, that it's in fact a very real danger."" He voiced concern over statistics showing more drivers were testing positive for THC, the active component in marijuana, in certain states.   [Senators held a hearing to remind you that 'good people don't smoke marijuana' (yes, really)]   Sessions further argued that a lack of leadership from President Obama had been one of the drivers of the trend toward marijuana legalization in recent years. ""I think one of [Obama's] great failures, it's obvious to me, is his lax treatment in comments on marijuana,"" Sessions said at the hearing. ""It reverses 20 years almost of hostility to drugs that began really when Nancy Reagan started 'Just Say No.' "" He added that lawmakers and leaders in government needed to foster ""knowledge that this drug is dangerous, you cannot play with it, it is not funny, it's not something to laugh about . . . and to send that message with clarity that good people don't smoke marijuana."" Opponents of legalization say the Sessions nomination could be a game-changer in legalization debates around the country. Sessions ""is by far the single most outspoken opponent of marijuana legalization in the U.S. Senate,"" Kevin Sabet, of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said in an email. ""If I were betting on the prospects for marijuana legalization, I'd be shorting.""   [What the future of marijuana legalization could look like under President Trump]   Advocates for legalization are, conversely, sounding the alarm. ""Jeff Sessions is a drug war dinosaur, which is the last thing the nation needs now,"" Ethan Nadelmann, of the Drug Policy Alliance, said in a statement. ""Those who counted on Donald Trump's reassurance that marijuana reforms 'should be a state issue' will be sorely disappointed."" Sessions's anti-pot positions have been consistent throughout his career. As far back as 1986, he joked that he thought the Ku Klux Klan ""was okay until I found out they smoked pot,"" according to the New York Times.      The 2016 election has proved to be the biggest victory for marijuana reform since 2012, with voters in California, Massachusetts, Nevada and Maine approving recreational marijuana initiatives. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)   At the Senate hearing in April, Sessions spoke approvingly of the ""progress"" made on drug use, starting with the harsh anti-drug policies of the 1980s. ""I can't tell you how concerning it is for me emotionally and personally to see the possibility that we would reverse the progress that we've made and let it slip away from us,"" he said. ""Lives will be impacted, families will be broken up, children will be damaged."" He added, ""I believe the Department of Justice needs to be clearer"" on marijuana legalization. Whether an Attorney General Sessions would bring such clarity to the office is an open question at this point. President-elect Trump has said that he believes marijuana legalization should be an issue left to the states. Under Obama, the Justice Department explicitly adopted a hands-off approach to marijuana enforcement in states that have legalized the drug, allowing those laws to proceed without interference provided that a number of enforcement priorities, including keeping pot out of the hands of minors, were met. The announcement of that stance in 2013 played a key role in allowing Colorado and Washington to move forward with their marijuana markets. ""A lot of people forget that [recreational marijuana markets in] Colorado and Washington were pretty much on hold until the governors there received guidance from the Department of Justice,"" John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said this month. Even simply reversing that guidance could have a chilling effect in states like Maine and Massachusetts that recently approved legalization. Without a tacit green light from the federal government, governors in those states may be hesitant to move forward with legalization policies that remain at odds with federal laws on the books for more than 40 years. ""I'm still hopeful the new administration will realize that any crackdown against broadly popular laws in a growing number of states would create huge political problems they don't need and will use lots of political capital they'd be better off spending on issues the new president cares a lot more about,"" said Tom Angell of the pro-legalization group Marijuana Majority. Angell pointed out that recent polls show roughly 60 percent of Americans approve of legalization and that strong majorities of voters across all parties say the federal government should not interfere with state-level marijuana laws. Asked about the senator's approach to marijuana issues as attorney general, Sessions's office responded that it had no information at this moment. This post has been updated.

""We did it during World War II with the Japanese,"" said Carl Higbie, a former spokesman for the Great America political action committee, on Fox News. When pushed on that point, Higbie said he wasn't proposing going back to the days of internment camps. ""But I'm just saying there is precedent for it,"" he added. Higbie has since said his comment was not in reference to internment camps, but was about registering immigrants. Trump has previously said he would require Muslims to register in a database, though a spokesman said this week that Trump would not seek ""any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion."" The spokesman added that Trump would announce other policies to vet foreign visitors from ""high terrorism"" countries. If the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II creates some kind of precedent for the treatment of Muslims in the United States today, it's worth remembering exactly what that history looks like. That's something a stunning series of historical photographs from the Library of Congress, now housed at a Yale University site, makes easy to do. After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, a sense of paranoia spread about the loyalty of people of Japanese ancestry living in the United States. By February 1942, that suspicion culminated in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's signing of an executive order that led to the incarceration of many Japanese Americans for the duration of the war. More than 100,000 people of Japanese ancestry, most of them U.S. citizens, were forced into internment camps during the war. Those with ancestors from Korea and Taiwan, which were Japanese colonies, were also interned, as well as some with German and Italian heritage. As they were shipped off to the camps, many Japanese Americans lost their businesses, livelihoods and savings. Because many were only allowed to take what they could carry to the camps, business owners were forced to shutter their shops and sell off their stock for cents on the dollar. In the 1942 photograph below, the departing owners of a shop in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo left a message saying, ""God be with you till we meet again."" Families also rushed to sell their homes, furniture and other belongings.    (Russell Lee, April 1942, Los Angeles. Library of Congress)  At the time, many Japanese Americans in the West worked as farmers, such as the onion farmer below. Before evacuation, they were forced to sell their unharvested crops and equipment at steep losses, often to the material benefit of white farmers in their area.    (Russell Lee, April 1942, Los Angeles. Library of Congress)  Under the watch of the U.S. military, Japanese Americans boarded trains that would take them to internment camps. In the following photographs, people wait for trains that would take them from Los Angeles to the Owens Valley camp, more than 200 miles to the north.    (Russell Lee, April 1942, Los Angeles.

Library of Congress.)     (Russell Lee, April 1942, Los Angeles. Library of Congress)  In the photograph below, Japanese Americans arrive by car at a ""reception center"" in Santa Anita, Calif., a former racetrack that was surrounded by barbed wire.    (Russell Lee, April 1942, Los Angeles. Library of Congress)  Conditions in the camps were harsh. Most were located in desolate places, such as deserts or swamps. Some were set up on old racetracks and fairgrounds, others on Native American reservations. Their occupants lived in flimsy, cramped and hastily erected shelters, often without plumbing, electricity or privacy. Food was limited, and there were outbreaks of dysentery. Some who tried to leave their camps were shot. In the camp below, in Nyssa, Ore., Japanese Americans lived in tents without electricity. As photographer Russell Lee wrote in the photograph's original caption, the occupants were accustomed to better living conditions.    (Russell Lee, July 1942, Nyssa, Malheur County, Ore. Library of Congress)     (Russell Lee, July 1942, Nyssa, Malheur County, Ore. Library of Congress)  The photograph below shows a family in their tent home in the Nyssa camp. As Lee wrote in the original caption: ""One of the sons of this family is in the U.S. Army. Two of the sons were studying engineering at an American university before the evacuation and are now greatly worried about possibilities of continuing their education.""    (Russell Lee, July 1942, Nyssa, Malheur County, Ore. Library of Congress)  Lee also documented people in the Nyssa camp enjoying the few entertainments that they had -- playing a gramophone record in the shared ""recreation tent,"" playing baseball, swimming, or reading and writing letters.    (Russell Lee, July 1942, Nyssa, Malheur County, Ore. Library of Congress)     (Russell Lee, July 1942, Nyssa, Malheur County, Ore. Library of Congress)     (Russell Lee, July 1942, Rupert, Minidoka County, Idaho. Library of Congress)     (Russell Lee, July 1942, Rupert, Minidoka County, Idaho. Library of Congress)  But time in the camps was spent laboring in the fields. As young men around the country went to war, local farms turned to incarcerated Japanese Americans as a valuable source of labor. Here are Japanese Americans sowing the fields in the Tule Lake Relocation Center in Newell, Calif., in 1942:    (Unknown, 1942, Siskiyou, Calif., Library of Congress)  Here are other farmworkers in a camp in Twin Falls County, Idaho:    (Russell Lee, July 1942, Twin Falls, Idaho. Library of Congress)  Internment ended by 1946, but the suffering of many Japanese Americans did not. Many left the camps almost penniless, set back a generation or more in terms of wealth, and returned to their communities to confront violence and racism. It wasn't until the 1970s that a U.S. president, Gerald Ford, would denounce internment. In 1980, the U.S. government issued a report saying the policy was caused by ""race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership."" The U.S. government ultimately paid out more than $1.6 billion in reparations to those who were interned.

The demonstration planned against the introduction of bond notes failed to take off Friday, after the violence against the organizers. The European Union delegation in Harare said in a statement Friday that social activists were brutalized before the anti-government demonstration. The EU statement expressed concern at the recent growth of human rights violations in Zimbabwe. Local media reported that six people were beaten and two cars were burned Thursday night in what was seen as a warning against going ahead with the protests. President Robert Mugabe's government, in power since independence from Britain in 1980, is facing an economic crisis that has caused massive cash shortages. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   Ever since alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos sent actress Leslie Jones a string of tweets insulting the comedian's race and intelligence, Twitter has made banning abusive accounts a priority. At the time, the company offered a statement, which read in part: . . . our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others . . . we've seen an uptick in the number of accounts violating these policies and have taken enforcement actions against these accounts, ranging from warnings that also require the deletion of Tweets violating our policies to permanent suspension. We know many people believe we have not done enough to curb this type of behavior on Twitter. We agree. We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it's happening and prevent repeat offenders Recently Twitter suspended more accounts associated with the alt-right, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as ""a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that 'white identity' is under attack by multicultural forces using 'political correctness' and 'social justice' to undermine white people and 'their' civilization."" Included among them was the verified account of Richard Spencer, whom The Washington Post described as a leader of the alt-right and ""one of the most media-savvy thinkers in the movement."" Twitter also suspended the account of the Virginia-based National Policy Institute, an alt-right white nationalist think tank of which Spencer is the president, and that of Radix Journal, a magazine run by Spencer. Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also had their accounts suspended. In response, Spencer posted a video to YouTube in which he said, ""I am alive physically, but digitally speaking, there has been execution squads across the alt-right.""    ""It's corporate Stalinism, in the sense that there is a great purge going on, and they're purging people on the basis of their views,"" Spencer said. He said these suspensions are unlike Yiannopoulos's. ""I supported people like Milo when they were banned from Twitter, but Milo was engaging in something that could be called 'harassment,'"" Spencer said of the man who used the platform to call Jones ""barely literate,"" ""fat and ugly, ugly, ugly, fat"" and ""a hot black dude."" Added Spencer, ""Again, I totally think he should have stayed."" Spencer, though, drew a sharp distinction between the way Yiannopoulos used the platform and the way he did. ""I and a number of other people who just got banned were not even trolling,"" he said. ""I was using Twitter just like I always used Twitter: to give people some updates and maybe comment on a news story here and there.""   [What's the alt-right?

Heidi Beirich, spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, told the USA Today that the organization had previously asked Twitter to remove more than 100 accounts of white supremacists but said on Monday (before the suspensions), ""They have done nothing."" Spencer compared the account suspensions to the Night of Long Knives, also known as Operation Hummingbird, in which Hitler ordered ""a bloody purge of his own political party, assassinating hundreds of Nazis whom he believed had the potential to become political enemies in the future,"" according to History.com. The video's title is ""The Knight of Long Knives,"" a play on the operation's name. Many on Twitter expressed confusion and outrage concerning Spencer's suspension. ""Richard Spencer advocates for my people, doesn't hate anyone, is a gentleman, and a friend, and Twitter suspended him,"" one user tweeted. "" Pax Dickinson and Richard Spencer have been banned from Twitter. The left knows social media helped Trump and is cracking down,"" tweeted another.  This was Richard Spencer's final tweet. Can someone explain how this violates Twitter policy? @davidfrum @jack @help pic.twitter.com/tt63UdpRNH -- Bunker  Smith (@bunkerwsmith) November 16, 2016  Spencer said that this could be seen as a victory for the alt-right movement. ""This is a clear sign that we have power,"" he said. ""Even if it's in our own little small way . . . we have power, and we're changing the world."" Twitter did not respond to a request for comment from USA Today, stating, ""We don't comment on individual accounts, for privacy and security reasons."" Finally, Spencer mentioned that he might transition to GAB, a social media platform used by many who identify with the alt-right. It prides itself on free speech. On its landing page, the platform includes a quote from writer and poet Charles Bukowski, ""Censorship is the tool of those who have the need to hide actualities from themselves and from others.""

They left more than seven hours later, each holding the handful of bills, worth $60 at the very most, that they'd been allowed to take home. By midday, the lines snaked back and forth across the parking lot outside the Axis Bank branch in central New Delhi. Occasionally, a policeman carrying a long bamboo club would slap someone who stepped out of line. No one complained. In a crowd like this, largely working-class and uneducated, no one talks back to a policeman. Especially not one carrying a club.  ""They keep telling us that that this is good, and maybe they're right,"" said Shahida Parveen, a 36-year-old woman whose family had almost no usable money left. ""But I don't see anything good happening."" This is just one bank, in one city, in a country of 1.3 billion people, millions of them increasingly desperate for cash amid a chaotic government effort to crack down on corruption by banning high-denomination currency notes. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in a surprise nighttime TV address that all 500- and 1,000-rupee notes, worth about $7.50 and $15, would be withdrawn immediately from circulation, a move designed to fight corruption and target people who have been dodging taxes by holding immense stockpiles of cash, known in India as ""black money."" In a nation hobbled by corruption, and where less than 3 percent of people file tax returns, the plan at first earned widespread approval. But as the days ticked by, it became increasingly clear that the government was ill-prepared for a plan that suddenly pulled 86 percent of the country's money supply out of circulation. Families began hoarding small-denomination currency, merchants reported plummeting business and salaries went unpaid. Many businesses were refusing to accept the only new note rushed into circulation, worth 2,000 rupees, because they were unable to make change for it. The government says it's also trying to get new 500-rupee bills into circulation, but they remain rarities. Modi acknowledged the transition to the new currency might be briefly difficult, but said the government ""spent long hours trying to figure out how to minimize the inconvenience.""  ""The poor are now enjoying a sound sleep, while the rich are running around to buy sleeping pills"" because of anxieties over their hoarded money, he said. But in the parking lot outside the Axis Bank, no one was talking about a sound sleep.  ""This is only to harass people like us,"" said Parveen, a stay-at-home mother whose husband works as a small-time broker for rental properties, but has had no work for the past week. Hundreds of millions of Indians do not have bank accounts and use only cash. Many businesses only accept cash. ""The people with all the black money, they'll find a way to manage."" She's right. The price of gold spiked in the hours after Modi's announcement, as the rich looked for ways to get rid of their old currency. Accountants say there has been a surge in questions about laundering cash, with one saying a client had come in admitting he needed to get rid of more than $5 million in discontinued notes. Others have used a range of ploys, from buying expensive train tickets that can be refunded later, to getting fake receipts, backdated to before Modi's announcement, to make their black money look legitimate.  ""Do you see anyone with black money here?"" demanded Chote Lal, 59, who had taken the day off from his office job to wait in line. ""Only the poor are getting hurt. Who else is suffering?"" A New Delhi businessman with connections to underground currency traders said it was still fairly easy to exchange the withdrawn currency -- as long as you're willing to pay twice the legitimate exchange rate to get rid of the old notes.  ""They can take as much as you need to get rid of,"" the businessman said, speaking on condition of anonymity to be able to speak freely about illegal transactions. How are money launderers getting rid of outdated currency? Some are presumably using corrupt bureaucrats or banking officials. Others, however, are getting help from people in line at tens of thousands of banks across India. Some of those waiting at Axis, like Parveen, were there to exchange their own money. She pulled a wallet from her purple-and-pink purse, revealing two crumpled 100-rupee notes and two 50-rupee notes, worth a total of about $4.50. It was all her family of five had left to spend, at least until she got to the front of the line and could exchange 4,000 rupees in the old currency. But it was an open secret that more than a few of those waiting with her were being paid to exchange currency for wealthier people.  ""I'm not doing that, but many of these people are exchanging for others,"" said Sahil Saluja, a young airline employee, gesturing around him. He eventually gave up waiting after more than four hours in line. The often-shifting regulations allow a one-time swap of 4,000 rupees, or about $60, in exchange for smaller notes to meet immediate needs. That limit was raised to 4,500 rupees on Wednesday. The government insists the system will be back to normal by the end of the year. Overwhelmed banks had no reliable way to ensure that people didn't line up more than once, so on Tuesday, the government announced that banks would begin using indelible ink to mark the fingers of people swapping scrapped currency notes. India uses the same system during elections, to stop people from voting repeatedly. Old notes can be deposited into bank accounts before the end of the year, though the government says it will investigate deposits above 250,000 rupees, or about $3,700. Immense fines will be levied on anyone found to have been illegally avoiding taxes. But for at least the next week, and perhaps many weeks, hours-long bank lines and strict limits on withdrawals (most people are limited to about $30 a day), mean lots of frustration ahead. The government, meanwhile, insisted all was well. The ""public need not be anxious,"" said a weekend statement from India's national Reserve Bank. ""Cash is available when they need it."" ___ Follow Tim Sullivan on Twitter at http://twitter.com/ByTimSullivan Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

For the moment, aides to President Barack Obama still have world leaders to worry about, distant wars to help manage and decisions to make that affect the nation. All that will come to a crashing halt on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day. Hoping to ensure that his staffers find decent jobs, Obama and his team have brought in representatives from Facebook, Instagram and other companies to offer insights into the job market. Officials from LinkedIn are helping White House staffers identify ways to market their skills. And Georgetown University, not far from the White House, has designed a custom professional development program dubbed ""Future44"" -- Obama is the 44th president -- to teach Obama's political appointees how to position themselves for life after the White House.  ""You go through a detox period,"" said Michael Wear, who worked for Obama for four years on faith-based outreach. ""It was like my brain, after so much time working incredible hours and having to be so attentive to so many inputs, I would be holding my glasses and asking my wife where my glasses were."" Even before the election, few if any of Obama's aides were expected to stay for the next administration. Many are flat-out exhausted and anticipated that Hillary Clinton, if elected, would want to install her own team. But Donald Trump's upset victory foreclosed any possibility that any of the nearly 500 staffers will stick around. For those who have dedicated years to Obama's mission, often missing out on holidays or family occasions, Trump's win and his promises to undo most of Obama's accomplishments were a demoralizing blow. And the fact that Republicans retained control of both the House and Senate means there will be fewer opportunities for Obama-era aides to move into other government jobs here. At Georgetown, 271 Obama appointees have already gone through the Future44 program, provided at no cost thanks to an anonymous donor. Participants register for either four 2-hour evening sessions or one 8-hour ""boot camp.""  ""We designed this unique curriculum to help these staffers think through how to market themselves or market their competencies,"" said Kelly Otter, dean of Georgetown's School of Continuing Studies. Many outgoing White House staffers are expected to move to the San Francisco area and New York, places with high-tech jobs and cultural sensibilities that overlap with the culture in Obama's White House. Those staffers would be joining dozens of other former Obama aides who have gone on to work for Google, Amazon, Vice, Snapchat and similar companies that cater largely to millennials.  ""There are a lot of mission-driven organizations here,"" said Clark Stevens, who moved to San Francisco to work for AirBnB after working in the White House and the Homeland Security Department. ""These are areas of innovation, and they're providing new solutions. That aligns in a lot of ways with the focus of the president."" To help prepare staff for post-West Wing life, the White House has been hosting ""digital brown bag"" lunches about digital media and technological developments, involving both outside speakers and Obama staffers who worked recently at Google and other companies. Smaller sessions within specific departments have focused on making the transition from government to the private sector. White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman said Obama had directed staff to keep working on his priorities full-speed until Inauguration Day, but was mindful that the end is a little more than nine weeks.  ""The transition out of government is a reality for most appointees, which brings both excitement about prospects for the next chapter or a long-awaited chance to recharge batteries, and a keen awareness about a big, impending change,"" Friedman said. That change can be jarring for longtime staffers, and even a letdown. Ivan Adler, a headhunter at McCormick Group who specializes in government affairs, said most go on to work in one of two settings: firms, like consulting and lobbying agencies, or organizations like trade associations, think tanks and nonprofits.  ""I tell everybody: You have to understand there's likely nothing you will do professionally that will have the same amount of excitement you've just gone through in the White House, unless you become a racecar driver or an astronaut,"" Adler said. For Wear, who left Obama's orbit in 2013 after the re-election, life after the White House involved starting his own consulting firm, then penning a forthcoming book called ""Reclaiming Hope"" about the intersection of faith and politics in the White House.  ""I've been healthier since I left,"" Wear said. ""And I'm very much enjoying my life now."" ___ Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP.

That scares its critics, which consider Breitbart News the home of cheerleaders rather than journalists -- and often offensive ones at that. Despite the opponents, Breitbart is unquestionably on a high following the surprise election of Trump, whose candidacy the web site unceasingly backed both before and after its leader, Stephen K. Bannon, was brought in to run the general election campaign. Trump on Sunday named Bannon chief strategist and senior counselor for his administration. Breitbart is planning a move into more spacious Washington offices, looking to add reporters in Germany, France, the Middle East and Asia, wants to add coverage of the media and technology to its conservative-framed news and hopes to produce more video, said Alexander Marlow, the site's editor in chief, on Monday. Its own cable network is a dream, but unlikely now, he said.  ""We're going to be the best place for news on the Trump White House,"" Marlow said. ""That is my intention and I have no reason to think that's not a fully attainable goal. I think a lot of the mainstream media already consider that the expectation and they're none too happy about it, which of course is a delight to me."" ComScore reported that Breitbart had 19.2 million unique visitors to its site in October, the most ever for the service founded in 2007 by Andrew Breitbart, a Los Angeles man intent on offering a conservative view on politics and the media. Breitbart died of heart failure in 2012 at age 43, opening the door for Bannon's rise as top executive. The site adopted Trump as a champion as his campaign took off. There were objections from those who considered Trump not conservative enough, and Breitbart lost staff members last spring when it failed to back its own reporter after she was roughed up by then-Trump campaign chief Corey Lewandowski. Among the site's headlines Monday: House minority leader Nancy Pelosi ""continues to lead Democrats to glorious defeat""; ""Anti-democracy crybabies march by thousands nationwide""; and ""Dow Jones had best week since 2011 due to Trump win."" A column on Trump's new appointment was headlined: ""Stephen K. Bannon, friend of the Jewish people, defender of Israel.""  ""Breitbart will continue to be what it has been during the campaign -- it was just a propaganda arm for Donald Trump,"" said Kurt Bardella, a public relations consultant who dropped Breitbart as a client this spring following the incident with reporter Michelle Fields and Lewandowski. ""This is as close as we're ever going to be to having a state-sponsored media entity that will effectively be operating out of the West Wing."" Bardella said he believed Breitbart was on a path to being a more serious news organization before embracing Trump. Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who also left following last spring and is now editor of the Daily Wire site, said he can't imagine Bannon not continuing to have input on what Breitbart publishes.  ""The site will continue to be popular, although they could run into trouble if Trump decides to move away from the populist right and they're stuck shilling for him,"" Shapiro said. Bannon has been on a leave of absence from Breitbart since he began running the Trump campaign, and Breitbart said he will take steps to leave the company in accord with government rules when he takes the White House job. Marlow said Bannon has had no formal communications with the company, although he said he talked to him Wednesday. ""He gave me a couple of war stories and I gave him a big hug,"" he said. Marlow said Breitbart wouldn't be afraid to criticize Trump if he strays from the populist message that got him elected. He said Breitbart doesn't just have readers, it has fans; one of the first things visitors see on the site is a line of merchandise for sale. The dismissal of its readers as haters ""was really rejected by the voters, who are much more savvy, much more sophisticated and much more informed than a lot of people at CNN think they are,"" he said. But some of Breitbart's reputation comes from headlines that some readers could easily find offensive: ""Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy"" and ""The solution to online harassment is simple: women should log off."" Bannon was quoted before leaving Breitbart that he considered the site ""the platform for the alt-right"" -- a movement often associated with far-right efforts to preserve ""white identity,"" oppose multiculturalism and defend ""Western values.""  ""I've never made an editorial decision based on whether the alt-right would like it or not,"" Marlow said. ""I don't consider myself part of the alt-right. If I am, I don't even know it.  ""The implication is that we're OK with racism and bigotry and we're absolutely not,"" he said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kushner held no formal role in Trump's campaign, and is said to be undecided on whether he'll join the administration. But his presence during the White House visit served notice that Kushner will continue to be an unparalleled power center in Trump's orbit, with or without a West Wing office. In the days since Trump's stunning victory over Hillary Clinton, Kushner has been deeply involved in the decision-making over senior White House and Cabinet posts, according to people close to the transition team. He's said to have been an advocate for Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus becoming White House chief of staff, an appointment that was announced Sunday. Kushner, 35, and husband of Trump's daughter Ivanka was frequently by his father-in-law's side during the final stretch of the bruising White House race. He spearheaded the campaign's data operation, had a hand in some policy speeches, and was often the last person Trump spoke to before making major decisions.  ""Everyone on the campaign and transition leadership team would love him to come to Washington,"" Hope Hicks, Trump's press secretary, said of Kushner. Noting Kushner's expansive role in the campaign, Hicks added, ""People are hopeful that will continue in the administration."" Kushner, who runs the Kushner family's real estate and construction business, has no experience in government and was not involved in politics before the 2016 election. As Kushner walked through the bustling West Wing during Trump's visit last week, he was heard asking Obama aides, ""How many of these people stay?"" Nearly the entire West Wing staff will leave at the end of Obama's term. Filling their jobs is just one piece of the massive undertaking Trump faces as he sets up his administration before taking office on Jan. 20. Kushner's options for a White House job are limited given his family ties to the president, according to Richard Painter, who served as President George W. Bush's White House ethics lawyer. Congress passed an anti-nepotism law in 1967 that prohibits the president from appointing a family member -- including a son-in-law -- to work in the office or agency they oversee. The measure was passed after President John F. Kennedy appointed his brother, Robert Kennedy, as attorney general. But the law does not appear to prevent Kushner from serving as an unpaid adviser. Painter said that arrangement would allow Kushner to both advise Trump and sidestep ethics rules requiring federal employees to comply with conflict of interest laws.  ""You can be an informal adviser to the president with lots of conflicts of interest,"" said Painter, a Republican who supported Clinton during the campaign. Trump is already facing questions about how he will avoid conflicts with his vast business interests. The billionaire has said he plans to fully turn his companies over to his adult children -- Ivanka, as well as sons Don Jr. and Eric -- but the arrangement he's described does not appear to legally wall him off from information regarding the operations. Kushner is directly tied to Trump's business interests through Ivanka, who oversees domestic and global expansion of the Trump Organization's real estate interests. And Kushner also has deep business ties of his own, serving as CEO of his family's New York-based real estate company and publisher of the New York Observer, a Manhattan-based newspaper read largely for its high society and real estate coverage. According to the Kushner Companies' website, the organization completed more than $14 billion in transactions and $7 billion in acquisitions since 2007. Kushner, who is Jewish and the grandson of Holocaust survivors, has defended Trump against charges of anti-Semitism and racism. In an opinion piece this summer, he wrote that the worst Trump's detractors can fairly say about him ""is that he has been careless in retweeting imagery that can be interpreted as offensive."" Kushner wrote the piece after Trump tweeted an image of Clinton featuring what appeared to be the Star of David over a backdrop of dollar bills. Trump has again come under criticism this week for naming conservative media provocateur Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon's ex-wife said in court papers that he refused to send his children to school with Jews when they were selecting a private school for their daughters to private school nearly a decade ago. Kushner took over his family's real estate firm at the age of 23 after his father, Charles Kushner, went to prison for tax evasion, making illegal campaign contributions and witness intimidation. Charles Kushner's two year sentence was part of a plea deal negotiated by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a prominent Trump backer who previously served as a federal prosecutor. Kushner is said to have tolerated Christie's role in the campaign, though he notably advocated for Trump to pick Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate over Christie -- and succeeded in convincing his father-in-law to do so. On Friday, as Kushner was announced as a member of Trump's transition team, Christie -- who had been chairing the operation -- was demoted. ___ Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire and Kathleen Hennessey contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
