Dick Schoof said in an interview with The Associated Press that would-be fighters are also heeding messages from the militant group ""asking them not to come to Syria and Iraq, but to prepare attacks in Europe."" One result is that over the last six months the number of ""foreign terrorist fighters"" hasn't grown, he said, but the fact that they're not traveling ""does not mean that the potential threat of those who would have traveled is diminished."" Schoof said military operations to oust the Islamic State from its self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq are scattering the extremist group's fighters and supporters. This will probably lead to a gradual increase of refugees that will pose a danger to the national security of the Netherlands and other European countries, he said. Schoof said even though the Netherlands hasn't been hit by a major attack by Islamic extremists such as those in Belgium and France, ""the chance of attack in the Netherlands is real.""  ""We have seen 294 terrorist fighters go overseas in Iraq and Syria and there are still 190 over there,"" he said. ""And what happened in France and Brussels and Germany could happen to us."" There are probably between 4,000 and 5,000 European ""foreign terrorist fighters"" in Iraq and Syria, Schoof said. While the number from the Netherlands, a nation of 17 million people, may seem low, he said, ""whether there's 190 or 350, I think the number is big enough to worry."" Schoof, who was in New York to speak at a roundtable on ""returning foreign terrorist fighters,"" said the Netherlands' program to deal with the threat balances ""repression and prevention"" and relies on strong cooperation between local and national authorities. On the ""repression"" side, he said, fighters returning from Syria or Iraq are taken into custody and prosecuted, and courts have recently handed down six-year prison sentences in several cases. The government also takes away passports, freezes assets, and has beefed up security measures and the police force, he said. On the prevention side, Schoof said, there's a lot of family support, with local authorities deciding the best interventions and providing education and psychological help if needed -- but there also could be arrests. Jozias van Aartsen, the mayor of The Hague, said building trust and having close relations with the Muslim community is very important.  ""They are Dutch citizens,"" he said. ""There are some in the Netherlands who say shut down mosques. That's absolutely wrong policy."" But Van Aartsen said there is a need for vigilance. ""The apparatus of local government can be very important as a watchdog against radicalization,"" he said. Schoof stressed that the Netherlands does not tolerate ""anti-democratic behavior.""  ""We try to prevent hate preachers coming in by not giving them a visa,"" he said. The government is also concerned about the development of an ultraconservative strain of Islam known as Salafism, he said. Last week, Schoof said, the Federation of Mosques, without any urging, sent a letter to all mosques in the country saying ""the mosques themselves must realize that hate speech should not be accepted in the mosques.""  ""Those are important signals that you can build on in your trust relationships,"" he said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

That dynamic was amplified by the peculiar mathematics of the Electoral College, which gave a megaphone to less-educated voters in the Midwest. A look at the building blocks of Trump's win over Hillary Clinton: WORKING-CLASS WOES These voters spoke with a shout, particularly in Rust Belt states that have mostly favored Democrats in recent elections. Noncollege-educated whites made up about a third of the electorate nationally, but they accounted for more than 4 in 10 voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio and made up fully half of all voters in Iowa. In all four states, and nationally too, the margin by which Trump won noncollege whites surpassed Mitt Romney's margins in 2012. Nationwide, some 67 percent of these working-class voters backed Trump, attracted to his insurgent's pledge to upend the status quo. Trump's strong support among those with less than a college education is at least partly a reflection of how little the economic recovery since the Great Recession has benefited them. Their job opportunities have dwindled and their incomes have fallen, even as broader measures of the nation's job market show improvement. Middle-aged white men with only high school degrees -- the core of Trump's support -- saw their inflation-adjusted incomes plummet 9 percent from 1996 through 2014, according to Sentier Research, a data analytics firm founded by former Census Bureau officials. RURAL OOMPH Democratic candidates have long worked to stockpile votes in urban centers to offset the more conservative electorate in America's small towns and rural areas. A color-coded map of the 2016 results -- a sea of Republican red in the country's midsection with blue states largely arrayed along the two coasts -- amply illustrates the rural/urban divide. Clinton won about 6 out of 10 votes in cities with more than 50,000 residents; Trump won about 60 percent of votes in small towns and rural areas. Voters in the suburbs largely split their votes between Clinton and Trump. But Trump made some crucial inroads. He won Pennsylvania, for example, by toppling a 20-year-old Democratic maxim to build an insurmountable lead in Philadelphia and its suburbs. Clinton did build an impressive lead in Philadelphia and its suburbs, surpassing Barack Obama's showing there in 2012, but Trump swamped Clinton in the rest of the state. The last time Pennsylvania voted for a Republican for president was 1988. RACIAL POLARIZATION The white vote has shrunk in recent years -- from about 80 percent in 1996 to 70 percent of Tuesday's vote -- but that's still a powerful number. Trump dominated with whites no matter how you dice their votes -- among men and women, young and old, college-educated and noncollege-educated. That diluted the potency of Clinton's strong performance with Hispanics and blacks. In North Carolina, where Trump won by a 4-point margin, the race was decided less on Clinton's failure than on Trump's unanticipated success. Clinton's campaign had hoped African Americans would make up 20 percent of the electorate, and they did. Nine in 10 blacks supported the Democrat. But Trump's strength with white, rural and small-town voters overwhelmed her support among blacks. Likewise, in Florida, where Trump won by just over 1 percentage point, Hispanics favored Clinton by almost a 2-to-1 margin and nearly 9 in 10 blacks backed her. But their outsized support for her was swamped by Trump's 2-to-1 lead among white voters, who made up more than 60 percent of the electorate. AGE MATTERS Millennials came through for Clinton, but one lesson of the 2016 election was the older voters still pack a punch. Some 55 percent of the electorate is 45 or older. Clinton got her most intense support from voters who are 18 to 29, winning more than half of that group. Her support dropped among older voters, winning about 45 percent among voters older than 45. That percentage held for the Democratic nominee among voters who are least 65. For Trump, the trend was reversed. He won a little more than a third of the youngest voters and captured a majority of voters older than 45. ELECTORAL COLLEGE In the end, it didn't matter that Clinton was on track to win more popular votes than Trump nationally: Her voters were too geographically concentrated to save her where it mattered most, in battleground states that tipped to Trump by small margins to produce a lopsided victory in electoral votes. With three states too close to call, Trump led Clinton 279-228 in electoral votes. In the popular vote, Clinton was leading 47.7 percent to 47.5 percent, or by about 236,000 votes. Trump pulled out victories in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida by the narrowest of margins, yet collected 74 electoral votes from them, or more than a quarter of the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. ___ Associated Press writer Bill Barrow contributed to this report. ___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac , Thomas Beaumont at https://twitter.com/TomBeaumont and Bill Barrow at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Khan made a passionate speech at the Democratic National Convention about his son, Humayun Khan, who died while serving in Iraq as a captain in the Army in 2004. (The Washington Post)   MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The father of a Muslim U.S. Army soldier killed in Iraq rebuked Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday as an embarrassment to the United States, as a somber and reflective Hillary Clinton pledged to work for ""healing and reconciliation"" after the election. Khizr Khan, making a campaign trail debut after coming to prominence at the Democratic National Convention, retold the story of his son Humayun Khan. The younger Khan died in 2004 when he told his men to stay back as he approached a suspicious car. He was the only American to die in the explosion. Khan waved and raised a fist in the air before introducing Clinton, whom he praised for her experience and temperament. He told a supportive crowd that after he spoke at the convention and Trump attacked him as a Democratic shill, he and his family had received thousands of letters and messages of support. ""This election will decide the future of America and the future of the world,"" Khan said. ""On one hand, we have Donald Trump and his policies of hate, exclusion, intimidation and division,"" he said. ""On the other hand, we have Hillary Rodham Clinton and her lifelong public service to the country."" Khan is an unlikely political star, a middle-aged Pakistani-born lawyer, but his convention speech is one of the most memorable moments of the campaign. It also was a turning point, with Trump's angry reaction setting off weeks of disarray on the Republican side. Trump recovered politically, but Clinton's campaign has sought to keep the powerful story of Khan and Trump's willingness to attack the dead soldier's parents at the center of the political contest. Clinton gave a subdued version of her stump speech focused largely on the threat she said Trump poses to American values and national security. ""In a race that has been marked by ugly suspicions and insults and attacks of all kinds ... Mr. Khan, I think, reminded all of us that we are Americans,"" she said. ""His son was an American who gave his life for our country. We cherish the Constitution, and we will defend it."" New Hampshire is one of the battleground states where a testimonial ad featuring Khan is playing. The ad, released last month, shows Khan walking through his home, looking at his son's pictures and military honors. It closes with a tearful Khan addressing Trump directly, as he did at the convention. ""I want to ask Mr. Trump: Would my son have a place in your America?"" he asks.    [Khizr Khan featured in Clinton ad]   Before Khan took the stage, musician James Taylor performed several songs with an election theme, including ""You've Got a friend"" and ""(You Are My) Only One,"" which he dedicated to Clinton. It was Clinton's second celebrity serenade of the day -- R&B singer Bebe Winans sang to her at a church service in Philadelphia -- and it was part of a star-spangled final few days that put Democrats' ties to the entertainment world on display. Katy Perry sang on Saturday night in Philadelphia, and Jay-Z and Beyonce performed Friday night in Cleveland. Clinton's campaign announced that Bruce Springsteen will perform at a closing rally Monday night at which President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will join Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton.

(Jung Yeon-Je-pool/Getty Images)  SEOUL - The South Korean political system has been shaken to its core over the revelations that President Park Geun-hye has been taking secret advice from Choi Soon-sil, a friend of 40 years who held no official position and had no policy background. The saga began with a simple and apparently self-contained incident: The chief executive of Nature Republic, a South Korean cosmetics company, was arrested for gambling in Macau in November 2015. Gambling is illegal for South Koreans and is punishable with prison time, even if the South Korean citizen is caught gambling abroad. Chung Woon-ho, the executive, was found guilty and sentenced to a year in prison. During the appeal process, Chung had a legal dispute with his attorney. In the process of probing this dispute, a typically South Korean act of corruption was uncovered involving a prosecutor, a businessman and a government official. But this time it was really serious, involving the former chief of the prosecutors' office, a high-ranking judge, the conglomerate Lotte and a senior secretary to the president. The investigation uncovered the existence of Lotte slush funds and ended with the suicide of Lotte's vice chairman, who left a note taking full responsibility. The former chief of the prosecutors' office and the judge were arrested. However, the senior secretary to the president and a former senior prosecutor, Woo Byung-woo, walked away unscathed. Eight months later, South Korea's biggest newspaper, the conservative Chosun Ilbo, broke news of another scandal involving a business, a prosecutor and a government official. A familiar name surfaced again: Woo Byung-woo. The Chosun Ilbo reported that an Internet game company, Nexon, did a favor for Woo by buying his family's land for $120 million, at a time that they were having a trouble selling it. The allegation was that the land had been bought in return for Woo turning a blind eye on a prosecutor's unlawful gains from Nexon shares. Woo had been in charge of vetting this prosecutor for promotion in 2015. The nation was incensed by this allegation of systemic corruption in the justice system. The fact that Woo was not investigated only increased suspicion that it was he who held the real power inside the presidential office, enough to influence the national justice system. Local media began calling him an ""emperor."" Then, a further Chosun Ilbo investigation led to yet another government official being exposed for abusing his power. This time it was another senior secretary to the president, An Chong-bum. An had allegedly been strong-arming conglomerates to donate money to the newly established MI-R Foundation. An had reportedly used the threat of painful audits to extort money from as many as 30 conglomerates. Local media reported that it was suspected that An had been raising money that was to be for Park's personal use after she retires in 2018. The former head of the MI-R Foundation later said in an interview with the Chosun Ilbo that he was told, ""Woo at the presidential office and the prosecutors' office had their back."" Just as the Chosun Ilbo's focus was moving ever closer to the president herself, one of the lawmakers in Park's ruling managed to deflect attention away from this embarrassing probe and back on to the newspaper by highlighting the fact that the Chosun Ilbo's chief writer had received expensive trips from Daewoo, a shipping company, in 2011. The incident significantly damaged the paper's reputation and it suspended its reporting on the relationship between the foundation and the presidential office. Then another local newspaper, the left-leaning Hankyoreh, brought the story back to life with a surprising twist. It published a story that named Choi Soon-sil as the de-facto owner of the MI-R Foundation. Choi had been friends with Park since the 1970s and was the daughter of Choi Tae-min, a cult founder who was believed to have had huge influence over Park until his death in 1994. Park Geun-hye and Choi Tae-min's strange relationship was an open secret in South Korea but had never been investigated. As the investigation rolled on, suspicion grew concerning Choi Soon-sil's undue influence: 14 shell companies were linked to her in Germany, then a friend claimed that Choi's favorite hobby was ""changing Park Geun-hye's speeches."" Park initially dismissed the allegations as mere rumors, but when a cable channel reported on Oct. 24 that the president's speeches had been found on Choi Soon-sil's tablet computer, such denials were no longer plausible. The president has since made two public apologies but these have not been enough to assuage the public's growing anger, and tens of thousands of citizens have taken to the streets over the past two weeks calling for her resignation. Park's approval rating has plummeted to 5 percent, according to Gallup Korea, the lowest for a president in the poll's history. The investigation is only just beginning but already Park's senior secretary, An Chong-bum, and Choi Soon-sil have been arrested for abuse of power and attempted fraud, and corporate officials from conglomerates including Samsung are being questioned by prosecutors. ""Emperor"" Woo Byung-woo, was also summoned for questioning Sunday. As the senior secretary to the president for civil affairs, Woo's role is to monitor corruption of the people close to the president. How he will come out of this scandal remains to be seen. No one knows where the chips may fall in this ongoing saga, but this much is clear: What began with one businessman playing cards at a table in Macau has now grown into South Korea's largest political scandal since its democratization in 1987."

The pressure was intense. FBI Director James B. Comey had told legislators in late October -- less than two weeks before the election -- that the bureau's work had resumed, igniting a firestorm of criticism that his revelation had affected the election. The agents' work, at first, seemed endless. They had to use special software to sift through some 650,000 emails. But on Sunday, just two days before the election, Comey announced that the team had news to share. After reviewing ""all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State,"" he wrote, investigators had ""not changed our conclusions."" The messages, U.S. officials familiar with the case said, were either personal or duplicative of those found earlier in the investigation. The recommendation marked the culmination of a nightmarish 10 days for the bureau. But coming two days before the election, it also generated renewed skepticism from both political parties about the FBI's handling of the high-profile case.     The Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton campaigns quickly reacted to the news that the FBI stands by its original decision not to recommend charges against Clinton for her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Republicans said the announcement was vague and that they had unanswered questions about how investigators concluded that Clinton should face no charges in the first place. Democrats, meanwhile, said they remained concerned that Comey had told legislators so close to Election Day that the email investigation was resuming, though they were heartened to see the matter ostensibly put to rest. ""In the days that come,"" said Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich), ""we will have many questions about the handling of this investigation."" From the moment Comey announced in July that he was recommending Clinton not be charged, the bureau has been under pressure and Comey at the center of a political firestorm. Republicans have questioned whether FBI agents were thorough and aggressive enough, while Democrats have said that Comey was wrong to offer so much public detail on his findings. When he made the July announcement, Comey opined that Clinton and her staffers were ""extremely careless"" in their handling of classified information -- an allegation that critics say maligned the Democratic presidential nominee without a trial in which she could defend herself. Comey has said he offered so much detail to assure the public that the investigation was handled appropriately and without political influence. He testified for hours before Congress about what investigators had found and released to the FBI's website hundreds of pages of interview summaries and other documents in the case. But with his public path came pitfalls. And when FBI agents were looking into allegations about disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) and found on Weiner's computer emails potentially relevant to the Clinton probe, Comey had a dilemma. Should he update Congress, with the election so close, that the Clinton email investigation had resumed? Or, with so little information, should he wait, potentially inviting criticism that he had buried information to help Clinton get elected?         1 of 57       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                         Skip Ad   x           Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail      View Photos   The Democratic presidential nominee on the road as Election Day nears.

Weiner is the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and U.S. officials have said that they found correspondence of Abedin and Clinton on his computer. Abedin has said that she is unsure how her emails would have ended up on her husband's laptop. When agents first found the materials, they were legally prohibited from sifting through them for Clinton email probe purposes. They got a warrant to do so Oct. 30. ""I don't think anyone was unaware of the calendar,"" one senior U.S. law enforcement official said. As the agents worked, the bureau faced a seemingly endless torrent of criticism. News leaked that agents in the FBI's New York field office had been advocating for a separate investigation of the Clinton Foundation, even though public integrity prosecutors had told them that they did not have a case. That fueled the perception that at least some in the bureau, an organization of predominantly white men, might have partisan motivations, and Democrats called for the Justice Department inspector general to look into the matter. Republicans also questioned whether -- if the Clinton email investigators had used more aggressive tactics -- they might have uncovered information that could have been used by those wanting to look into the Clinton Foundation. Given the reasoning Comey laid out for not recommending charges in July, it was always unlikely that the new email review would change anyone's mind. The FBI director already had said that classified information traversed Clinton's private server. He said that in 110 emails, information was deemed sensitive enough to be classified at the time it was sent or received. Eight chains, he said, even included information deemed ""top secret"" -- the highest level of classification. Adding to those totals would not seem a reason to alter his conclusion. Now, though, the bureau will face more questions. In a statement, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the chair of the Judiciary Committee, said that the ""vague"" announcement by the FBI failed to provide context and that he was unsure if the review was over. ""The growing number of unanswered questions demand explanations: Is the FBI continuing to review the newly-revealed emails?"" Grassley said. ""Did the FBI limit its review to email from when Clinton was Secretary of State, leaving out emails that could shed light on possible obstruction of Congress?"" This time, though, Comey's timing did not seem as much of an issue. Republicans and Democrats had called on him to complete the new review swiftly and announce his findings publicly. Ron Hosko, a former assistant director at the FBI, said that he believed Comey gave Congress information when it was available to him and that Sunday's revelation served as evidence of that. ""I thought, if anything, now would be the time to sit quietly until after the election, but here we are again,"" Hosko said. ""They were able to give clarity on a Sunday evening, two days before the election, and he felt like, 'If we have the question answered now, we have to answer the question now.' "" "

It has united the rival Koreas, at least in one area: indignation against South Korea's leader. North Korea's propaganda mavens have never been shy in calling South Korean President Park Geun-hye an incompetent, power-hungry clone of her late dictator father, Park Chung-hee -- and that's when they're pulling their punches. Inconceivable a week ago, many South Koreans now seem to be reaching Pyongyang levels of fury over an investigation into whether Park allowed a longtime confidante with no official government role to manipulate her administration from the shadows. The North's fondness for vicious threats is generally missing in the South, but the anger over the scandal -- sometimes partisan, mostly spontaneous on the part of many South Koreans, but more violent and somewhat canned in the North, where carefully cultivated outrage is a state commodity -- often seems to be in lockstep. For instance, in wording that North Korea would be right at home with, Ahn Cheol-soo, a lawmaker from a small South Korean opposition party and a potential presidential candidate, recently said of Park: ""You no longer have the authority to destroy the constitution. You no longer have the authority to stomp on the pride of our people."" Here's how a similar sentiment looked when North Korea's main newspaper recently attacked Park: ""It's deplorable that the South's politics have become the joke of the world and its economy and people's livelihoods are left in shreds."" To be clear, the expressions in South Korea, even at their sharpest, are still a long way from the odious linguistic swamp of violence and sexism that characterizes much of North Korea's propaganda. The North, for instance, has called Park a ""dirty prostitute who licks her master's groin,"" an ""aging witch,"" a ""female dog"" and an ""American parrot."" Pyongyang has also repeatedly called for her death. But there has been an uptick in both rage and sexism in the South, especially online, where Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, have been called ""crazy bitch,"" ''chicken head,"" a slur meant to attack their intelligence, and ""stupid Gangnam ajumma,"" a term often used to insult middle-aged women living in affluent southern Seoul. People have also declared that South Korea will never again vote for a female president or trust a woman's leadership. It is not just happening in obscure corners of South Korea's social media or the web, never the cream of public discourse.  ""Park Geun-hye threw away her authority as (the person) ultimately responsible (for governing the state) to a common street woman of unknown roots,"" Jae-myung Lee, the opposition mayor of Seongnam, told more than 10,000 people taking part in a recent anti-Park rally, referring to Choi. ""Park has lost her authority as president and has shown that she doesn't have the basic qualities to govern a country."" That Park, who has 15 months to go in her single five-year term, should go has long been a mainstay of North Korean rhetoric. But similar sentiments are also emerging in South Korean media.  ""If we had to pick one person who made the country into the shattered mess that it is now, it's none other than President Park,"" the South's Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper said in an editorial on Saturday, calling for Park's resignation. ""The citizens no longer want Park to govern state affairs ... She lost the political leadership to persuade and guide the ruling and opposition parties, the parliament and the people. Her moral authority as the head of state has fallen to the ground ... Continuing this state for another year and three months will make everyone miserable."" North Korea's state media have at times seemed overwhelmed with the amount of negative stories, both international and South Korean, about Park, and have often just rounded up the coverage, with some insulting comment added. Six days after Park first acknowledged that she had sent Choi, the daughter of a shadowy religious figure who emerged as Park's mentor in the 1970s, drafts of her speeches for editing, North Korea's main newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, released a lengthy, painstaking summary of the saga, replete with sexist, violent insults. The newspaper described Park and Choi as ""two women who have lost their minds."" It also broke down reports that Choi influenced important government decisions, including Park's move to shut down the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, a jointly run factory park in the North Korean city of Kaesong.  ""This shows to the world that Park Geun-hye is not merely a first-class dog controlled by a large monster that is the United States, but also doubly and triply a puppet manipulated by strings pulled by one 'Gangnam' woman,"" the North Korean newspaper said, referring to the Seoul neighborhood where Choi reportedly built a fortune on real estate investments. Observers of North Korean propaganda have wondered about the length of time it took the newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party, to weigh in on the scandal -- nearly a week. It's almost as if the paper's propaganda experts, after firing at much smaller targets for so long, couldn't quite believe the huge gift they'd been given. Pyongyang has more recently stepped things up. For instance, the North's official Korean Central News Agency published a statement by a Foreign Ministry unit said that Park's actions had caused a ""hideous power-backed scandal unprecedented in history."" It predicted that a ""mass struggle"" of enraged South Koreans will leave Park at a crossroads where she is forced to choose between quitting her presidency on her own or facing impeachment. With tens of thousands of South Korean protesters calling for Park's ouster over the weekend and bigger crowds expected in coming days, Pyongyang's breathless, over-the-top propaganda might not be so far off the mark. ___ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.

Comey has found himself at the center of the presidential campaign in recent days. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   For most of his career, James B. Comey served as a federal prosecutor. Most prosecutors learn legal ethics on the job. But Comey came to his profession primed with an undergraduate degree in religion, and when he speaks, you can hear the undertones of that education. Comey has often said that the Department of Justice is supposed to be the ""other"" in government. A most carefully selected word, as biblical exegesis teaches that ""other"" is synonymous with ""holy."" Now Comey, the director of the FBI, is being accused of interfering in the presidential election for notifying Congress last week that federal agents had found new emails that could be pertinent to the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton's private server. What Comey is doing, though, is what he's always done: standing up for what he believes is right, no matter the political consequences. Prosecutors and agents who worked alongside Comey, as I did when I was the U.S. attorney for Arizona, know him as a straight shooter. Comey burnished that reputation all the brighter the first time he famously refused to follow what one might call accepted Justice Department practice. In March 2004, while serving as deputy attorney general, Comey found himself traveling with lights flashing and sirens blaring to intercept then-President George W. Bush's top aides. Bush's emissaries were at that time attempting to get Attorney General John Ashcroft, then in an intensive care unit, to sign off on what Ashcroft and Comey saw as an unlawful domestic surveillance program. Comey's predecessors within the department had previously approved that program. Acting at a time when the Sept. 11 attacks were much more present in our memories and with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq still raging, Comey faced a choice: accept the program out of deference to Justice Department norms and custom, or reject the program as constitutionally infirm. In a dramatic and very real showdown in Ashcroft's hospital room, Comey put norms to the side and refused to bend to the president's wishes. In June 2013, Comey's reputation for courageous and independent thinking brought him to the White House Rose Garden. There, President Obama announced Comey's nomination to be the seventh director of the FBI. At the time, Obama called Comey a ""rarity."" Why? ""He doesn't care about politics,"" said the president. Later that year, at his Senate confirmation hearings, Comey committed to ""transparency,"" a concept he said would be crucial when dealing with Congress. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), then the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that Comey had ""shown a willingness to stand his ground if necessary."" The president could have sought, or the Senate demanded, a more compliant FBI director, one who cared about politics more than transparency. One who would have toed Justice Department policy lines, attended to the political whims of his bosses and exercised little, if any, independent thought. But that's not Comey, and Republicans and Democrats alike knew that when they confirmed Comey's appointment with a 93-1 vote. This June, while speculation about a federal criminal investigation into Clinton's emails coursed through the media, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch took a meeting with former president Bill Clinton on the Justice Department's private jet parked at the tarmac of Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport. After that encounter, so as to better protect the integrity of the criminal investigation, Lynch publicly ceded her decision-making authority to Comey. In so doing, she effectively delegated the discretion to bring charges from the nation's chief prosecutor to Comey, the nation's chief investigator. No policy, no precedent, nothing in the Justice Department's history allowed for such a shift in responsibility. Even so, no credible authority doubted the wisdom of allowing Comey to make the call about whether to charge Clinton with a crime. Neither political party objected to what was so clearly a deviation from Justice and FBI norms. Yet when Comey announced his decision that no reasonable prosecutor would charge Clinton, critics were quick to point to policy that would have had Comey conduct himself differently. Republicans believed he should have charged her. Democrats were upset that Comey gave too much detail and information. And this past week, after Comey alerted Congress that the discovery of additional emails mandated further review, critics with hands on hearts again cried that Comey had run afoul of policy. Where were those same critics and hard-liners when Comey bucked Bush in 2004? Why the grateful applause when he willingly shouldered Lynch's responsibility in July? All prosecutions of political figures are fraught with such perils, and predictable. Comey knew this, as do I. I served as a federal prosecutor for 16 years. In 2006, while the U.S. attorney, I led a criminal investigation into a member of Congress. Because I am a Republican, as was the target of our investigation, Democrats were quick to complain that I would let my fellow Republican off the hook. As we got closer to indictment, Republicans joined the chorus, and complained that I was not a ""loyal"" party member. In May 2005, long before the High Noon drama at Ashcroft's hospital room was known to the public, Comey gave a speech to an audience of government attorneys working in the intelligence field. Comey addressed the need for public servants to act courageously. He counseled his audience that when faced with difficult decisions, they must employ a unique ability: ""the ability to transport ourselves to another time and place; and the ability to present facts to an imaginary future fact finder."" Making difficult decisions, Comey argued, ""takes more than a sharp legal mind."" It takes ""moral character."" In making his decisions with regard to Clinton, Comey looked to our nation's future and exercised his own, and independent, judgment. With Comey, past is prologue. Where policy and Comey's sense of what is right conflicted, Comey would do what is right. While many may disagree with Comey's decisions today, we are better served if we reserve judgment. In the near future, the nation will look back and realize the wisdom of trusting a public servant with moral character.

Adams would really hate to see Twitter today. With less than a week to go until the election, the country seems to have descended into full partisan battle mode. It's not just your imagination. The United States is more divided politically than it has been in years, and the gulf between the parties has surged since 2004, as seen in fascinating graphics created by Robert Rouse, an analytics consultant at data consulting company InterWorks. Rouse has become increasingly turned off by the intense partisan divisions of the presidential campaign this year, and wondered how it compared to the past. So he used more than two decades' worth of data on political polarization by the Pew Research Center to create graphics that were recently nominated for Kantar's Information is Beautiful awards. The chart below shows how beliefs have changed for the general population, as measured by Pew's ideological scale. The squares at the extreme left and the extreme right get fatter as you move down the timeline, showing Democrats have become far more consistently liberal and Republicans have become far more consistently conservative over time. In 1994, for example, only 0.6 percent of all Democrats were 10 points left of center on Pew's ideological scale, while 1.3 percent of Republicans were 10 points right of center. By 2015, those proportions rose to 6.2 percent of Democrats and 3.5 percent of Republicans.    Robert Rouse, InterWorks  The lines that travel down the middle show the ideological position of the median Democrat (in blue) and the median Republican (in red). The graphic shows that Democrats swung to the left ideologically in the 1990s under President Bill Clinton, then once again shifted left in recent years under President Obama. The Republican Party steadily shifted to the right in the late 2000s and early 2010s under Obama. Overall, however, the chart shows that the divide between Republicans and Democrats has more than doubled since 2004. Rouse charts the same figures for Americans who are politically engaged, which Pew defines as those who are registered to vote, and follow politics and vote most of the time. Here, the swings and the divides are even wider, with the ideological gap between Republicans and Democrats once again roughly doubling since 2004.    Robert Rouse, InterWorks  Rouse also created a graphic to visualize the ideological difference on several major political issues. As the chart below shows, gun ownership, health care and abortion remain among the most politically divisive issues in the United States. Perhaps surprisingly, immigration appears to be a much less polarizing issue, at least in 2014, when the survey was taken. And the graphic shows that there are still a few issues on which opinions aren't so divided by party - for example, Social Security benefits and National Security Administration surveillance.

Here’s how we can recover.	"   Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off forcefully in the final presidential debate. (Paul J. Richards/AFP)  Are you a political junkie who has grown tired of the news? Flip over to Fox -- no, not Fox News -- and you might catch the network's reboot of the iconic ""Exorcist"" book and film franchise. The story, a tale of faith-rattling possession and exorcism, has continued to capture the imaginations of new audiences since the 1971 publication of the original novel and subsequent release of the first film version in 1973. At the heart of ""The Exorcist's"" narrative is the tension between facing evil in the world head-on and the risk of falling into despair. ""Yet I think the demon's target is not the possessed; it is us ... the observers ... every person in this house,"" author William Peter Blatty wrote in the 1971 novel, ""And I think -- I think the point is to make us despair; to reject our own humanity ... to see ourselves as ultimately bestial; as ultimately vile and putrescent; without dignity; ugly; unworthy."" The relentless onslaught of ugliness gripping our American politics does not feel too far afield from the description of possession and the faith-rattling, soul-shaking effects described by Blatty. The Christian tradition has long used the specter of the demonic to describe humanity's conflict with that which would undo us. At the same time, ancient theologians and philosophers have discussed how being a witness, bystander, or participant to morally damaging actions wounds our own moral well-being. This election certainly makes a strong case for that point of view. Recent reports tell us our political culture is affecting our health and damaging our relationships. Roughly 60 percent of Americans told Pew they were sick and tired of the election -- and that was back in July. Anger and divisiveness between political opponents has intensified to a fever pitch, and many voters say they lack respect for our country's democratic institutions and one another. Therapists are increasingly treating patients for election-related anxiety, and in October, the American Psychological Association produced coping tips for the more than half of Americans who are suffering from election stress. We are, quite literally, becoming politically soul-sick. As Blatty points out, the consequences of moral injury are profound. When we are this thoroughly demoralized, we begin to doubt our own ability to recognize humanity and dignity in both ourselves and others. We become tempted to paint our opponents as truly demonic, to give into the impulse to destroy rather than redeem. For many Americans who have lived relatively insulated and privileged lives, the sensation may feel new. For those living under systemic racial or economic oppression, soul-sickness may be far more familiar. And a soul-sick politics of despair is a danger to democracy. After Nov. 8 comes and goes, how can we begin to heal? The wisdom of 20th-century theologian Walter Wink seems especially apropos here. In his seminal ""The Powers That Be,"" Wink writes: ""Evil can be opposed without being mirrored. Oppressors can be resisted without being emulated. Enemies can be neutralized without being destroyed."" Our nation contends not only with fraught politics, but the long struggles for justice and equality that can succeed only as Americans resist cynical despair and instead compassionately seek to see themselves -- and not an enemy -- in the other. In other words, the only way to move beyond the vast divisions wrought by this year's political tumult is to place boundaries on the role politics plays in our thinking, self-image and interactions with others. To speak of politics in this way is to welcome feelings of vulnerability and doubt. We should all know how the game works by now, right? The average American has unprecedented access to political commentators who dissect the electoral consequences of every decision and utterance. We're deluged with political news around the clock, with every campaign stop, hacked email and shock poll covered thoroughly. We are all political strategists now, and scoring political wins -- either on the Hill or on Facebook -- has become an end in itself that justifies almost any means. Yet at the same time polarization has hit an all-time high, and politics have overwhelmed our thoughts and conversations, we have become cynical about politicians. If political gamesmanship is our end, it will be difficult to identify a path toward resisting oppressors without emulating them or neutralizing enemies without destroying them, as Wink suggests. Instead, we need to put politics back in its proper place. We need boundaries. We do not need to let politics hold sway in our most personal spaces. We might say, ""Come over for dinner, politics, but stay on the first floor of the house and stay out of the bathroom medicine cabinet."" And honestly, after Nov. 8, it might be best to keep politics on the front porch for a little while. It's all right to say: I want to talk about anything else but politics, if it keeps you talking with your neighbor and puts the weight of the election in proper perspective. The personal is political, but we cannot allow the political to overwhelm our ability to see personhood in the other. Which is not to say that there's never a time to focus on the political. Our nation faces big challenges, and politics can helps us meet them. The political change we need the most will not result from the decision we make on Nov. 8, but rather from the choices we begin to make on Nov. 9. Politics is not all that makes up the substance of our shared life together as a nation. Perhaps in the wake of this ugly campaign -- one that offered so little of value and so much that was vile -- we will limit the reign of this politics of despair in our lives. Politics ought to be subject to our values; our values should no longer be subject to politics. Election Day is quickly approaching, but the moral injury suffered by the inhabitants of this American democracy will not heal when the last ballot is counted. In the New Testament, Jesus describes a metaphorical house presumably ""swept clean"" of evil spirits only to be repopulated seven times over. Be careful, Jesus seems to warn, not to confuse kicking out the ""bad guy"" with doing the necessary work it takes to revive your home with the presence of goodness. When the election is behind us, we need to devote our energy to reaching out to our neighbors, interacting as fellow citizens and placing our shared values of human dignity and care at the center of our politics. When it comes to morality and moral leadership, it is not enough to simply ""clean house."" Kicking our demons out leaves only an empty house. If the dream of American democracy is to survive, we need a re-imagined politics that is motivated and nourished by values that supersede politics itself."
