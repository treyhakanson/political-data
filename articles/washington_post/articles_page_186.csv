UD president Dennis Assanis presented an operating budget request of $122.4 million on Friday. That's about $4 million more than the school's current general fund appropriation, which includes $10.3 million for scholarships. UD is also seeking tens of millions of taxpayer dollars for capital expenditures, including $60 million over three years to build a new science building, and $15 million a year to help with deferred maintenance. Assanis, who's been at the helm of UD for about six months, says the university, which has an endowment portfolio of about $1.5 billion, has a maintenance backlog of $512 million over five years.

Morphou Mayor Charalambos Pittas said the peaceful demonstration was intended to get President Nicos Anastasiades to live up to his pledge of making his fertile town a part of the ongoing reunification talks.  ""What counts for us is that the president keeps his word that Morphou is returned,"" Pittas told the Associated Press. Anastasiades and breakaway Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci are meeting in Mont Pelerin, Switzerland for two days next week to negotiate how much territory each side would administer under an envisioned federation. A domain agreement would pave the way for a final summit where Greece, Turkey and Cyprus' former colonial ruler Britain would make post-settlement security arrangements. Meanwhile, hundreds of Turkish Cypriots marched in the streets of northern Nicosia on Friday in support of peace, urging the two leaders to overcome any remaining hurdles during their talks in the Swiss resort. A 1974 Turkish invasion triggered by a coup aimed at uniting Cyprus with Greece split the island into a breakaway Turkish-speaking north and an internationally recognized, Greek-speaking south. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence, and the country keeps more than 35,000 of its troops stationed in the north. Former Morphou residents say having the town and its surrounding agricultural land under a Greek Cypriot administration would go far toward enabling around 100,000 people who lost homes and property in the war to reclaim it. Up to 37,000 Greek Cypriots could reclaim property if Morphou is returned, Pittas said. At the time of the invasion, the town produced most of the island's citrus exports. Under any deal, Turkish Cypriots want to minimize the displacement of people now residing in Greek Cypriot homes. Many Turkish residents had to leave properties in the south and move north when the island was divided. Michael Jordanou, 88, a Greek Cypriot whose family was forced to abandon 37 acres of citrus orchards in Morphou, said he hopes housing for the town's Turkish Cypriots will be built so their relocation creates as little hardship as possible. At the same time, Jordanou said he strongly doubts a peace accord can be reached without the town's return.  ""I can't see any solution without Morphou,"" he said.

The statement tied Lozano to the events that occurred in Allende between March 18 and 20, 2011.

(The Washington Post)   Donald Trump said at a debate last month that he would appoint a special prosecutor to examine Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state and remarked that she would ""be in jail"" if he were president. In about two months, he'll have the power to potentially make that a reality. He wouldn't, of course, be able to snap his fingers and throw his political rival behind bars. He would have to order his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor, then count on that special prosecutor to agree with his assessment that Clinton's email practices violated criminal laws about mishandling classified information. And even if he did all that and Clinton was charged, she would still be afforded a trial, and Trump's special prosecutor would have to contend with evidence that led the original team of federal investigators to conclude there was not sufficient basis to believe a crime occurred.   [One of Clinton's biggest critics in email case says he'd tell Trump not to jail her]   Getting that process started, though, would not seem that difficult. Trump gets to pick and appoint the attorney general. FBI Director James B. Comey recommended in July that neither Clinton nor her aides be charged with any crimes in connection with her use of a private email server during her term at the State Department, saying ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring such a case. He said in recent weeks that his conclusion was unchanged, even after investigators examined a new, potentially relevant batch of emails discovered on a computer belonging to disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Trump rallies have sometimes been marked with chants of ""lock her up,"" and his supporters repeated those cries as the Republican moved toward an upset victory Tuesday night. Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, did not rule out appointing a special prosecutor in TV appearances Wednesday morning. ""We didn't discuss that last night and he did not discuss that with Hillary Clinton on the phone,"" Conway said in one appearance.      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has suggested jailing his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Here are some countries where the threat of prison is a political reality. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   President Obama could short-circuit the affair entirely, pardoning Clinton before he leaves office in January. Legal analysts have said that could happen even though Clinton is not charged with any crimes. Such was the case with Richard Nixon, who was given a full pardon by Gerald R. Ford before he was indicted for all offenses he ""committed or may have committed or taken part in"" during his time in office. Even prominent conservatives in the legal field have said that for Trump to act to jail Clinton would be inadvisable, and it would politicize the Justice Department in an alarming way. Former attorney general Michael Mukasey, one of Clinton's most vocal critics on the email issue, told The Washington Post last month, ""It would be like a banana republic."" Those remarks came after Trump broached the idea of a special prosecutor at a debate. ""I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception,"" Trump said. ""There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor."" Later, when Clinton said, ""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,"" Trump replied, ""Because you'd be in jail."" Conway later said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" that Trump's remark about jailing Clinton was a ""quip."" She added, ""As for the special prosecutor, I think that's Donald Trump channeling the frustration he hears from thousands of voters out on the stump every day."" During his victory speech, Trump said, ""It is time for us to come together as one united people"" and said that Clinton had ""worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country."" He made no mention of Clinton's emails. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately return an email seeking comment. This post has been updated.

Intolerance won.	"   (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)  THE MORNING PLUM: For many of us who were wrongly convinced that Hillary Clinton would be elected president yesterday, there seemed to be a kind of upside to running against Donald Trump. Whereas the 2012 campaign centered on a big argument over government and the economy, Campaign 2016 presented the occasion for a grand argument between a vision of an evolving America that embraces pluralism, tolerance, inclusion, and cultural change -- and one that is standing athwart those changes. Trump crudely but shrewdly positioned himself as that latter vision's champion, through an explicit embrace of intolerance, bigotry, ethno-nationalism, and white identity politics. Simply put, our operating premise was that the inhabitants of that evolving America outnumbered those who are resisting it. Clinton could assemble large numbers of nonwhites, millennials, and just enough college educated whites -- particularly women -- who were horrified by Trump's racism, misogyny, and hatred to constitute a winning coalition. Barack Obama had done something similar twice before, even without facing a monstrous bigot and hater like Trump, and the national majorities embracing culturally changing America would rally behind Clinton and continue to deliver Democrats the White House. Clinton -- who came of political age in the south and rose to national prominence during an era when Democrats still winked at white grievance -- was an imperfect vehicle for this argument. But she gamely took it on, and we cheered when she went all in on an effort to force a national debate over Trump's overt mainstreaming of hate, as she put it.      Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump rejoiced across the nation on Election Night as their candidate defied the polls. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   I thought she had won this argument. It turned out she lost it. At least she lost it in the sense that it failed to win over enough white voters to build a winning coalition, and failed to sufficiently energize the core elements in the Democratic coalition that were supposed to enthusiastically march into this battle.   [A stunning cake and a stunned nation]   Ron Brownstein aptly describes the election as a ""cultural civil war,"" and explains why Democrats lost it this time. Trump ran up enormous margins among blue collar whites, in part because Clinton under-performed among them relative to Obama: The Trump coalition was centered on white voters without a college education. Exit polls posted on CNN.com showed him crushing Clinton among those voters by enormous margins almost everywhere....Trump beat Clinton among non-college whites by 18 percentage points in New Hampshire, 21 in Colorado, 22 in Arizona, 24 points in Wisconsin, 31 points in Michigan, and 35 points in Missouri.... In several cases, those showings represented significant declines for Clinton relative to Obama in 2012...her share of the vote among non-college whites, relative to Obama's showing in 2012, fell 14 points in Maine, 13 points in Michigan, 12 points in New Hampshire, 11 points in Colorado, 10 points in Wisconsin, nine points in Pennsylvania, and six points in Florida. In some states, Clinton not only failed to hold down Trump's huge margin among noncollege whites; she also failed to supplant it with enough college educated whites: In some traditionally Democratic states, Clinton was able to overcome this surge with strong performances among minority voters and college-educated whites. The exit polls gave her 55 percent of college whites in New Jersey and Wisconsin, 54 percent in New Hampshire, and 51 percent in Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Washington. Compared to Obama, she improved the Democratic showing among college-educated whites in Arizona, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. But in other key battlegrounds like Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Ohio she only essentially matched his performance; in Florida she slipped slightly among the white-collar whites. Meanwhile, all this was exacerbated by Clinton's failure to run up quite enough of a margin among Latinos in states like Florida, though we need much more data to understand what the role of the Latino vote played here and why it fell short of having the impact Democrats expected. Now, Clinton's awful performance among non-college whites -- and particularly her underperformance among them relative to Obama -- will prompt a searing debate among Democrats over whether Clinton and the party failed to articulate a strong enough economic message. That's a debate we can and should have. Meanwhile, surely there are countless Trump voters who supported him for reasons having nothing to do with his racism and displays of hate.   [Trump voters will not like what happens next]   But what is undeniable for now is that in too many battleground states, enormous numbers of white voters either did embrace Trump's bigotry and intolerance, or were not sufficiently alienated by those traits for it to make a difference, or simply found Clinton's spirited rebuke of them to be insufficiently compelling or inspiring or relevant. I am not quite as despairing about this as are David Remnick and Brian Beutler and Paul Krugman, all of whom feel as if Trump's win reveals America to no longer be the open and tolerant country they thought they inhabited, and threatens to drag us backward in dangerous ways. After all, Clinton does seem to be winning the national popular vote, suggesting there still is a popular majority aligned with our side of the argument. But it certainly was a horrible shock to discover that there are so many of our fellow Americans on the other side of it. **************************************************************************** * HOW THE POLLS GOT IT WRONG: Nate Cohn tries to explain what might have happened: The polls were wrong about one big thing: They missed Mrs. Clinton's margin in the Midwestern states, like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania....Perhaps undecided voters broke for Mr. Trump; maybe there really were ""silent"" voters for him, people who were reluctant to tell pollsters that they backed him....Maybe Republican voters came home to the party over the last week in well-educated suburbs, while undecided white working-class voters broke for Mr. Trump. All of the internal Democratic polling I was privy to also showed Clinton leading, though the margins were pretty tight. There will probably be a major reckoning in the polling industry now. * CLINTON ADVISER SAW 'RAGE' OF TRUMP VOTERS: Dan Balz talks to a Clinton adviser about Trump's appeal: One Clinton adviser described it as ""a quiet rage"" that existed in the privacy of living rooms and around kitchen tables, frustration with the political system and the lack of tangible results from government's actions for many hard-working Americans. Well, Trump did essentially vow to break the system over his knee and get it working again, so maybe the details he offered -- or lack of them -- were beside the point entirely. * TRUMP VOWS MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING: This nugget from Trump's victory speech is noteworthy: ""We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it."" After so much resistance to infrastructure spending among many Republicans, it should be interesting to see if the GOP Congress is suddenly willing to spend this money. * TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL UPEND WORLD ORDER: Peter Baker spells out just how massive a shift in American's posture towards the rest of the world this could mean: Mr. Trump's win foreshadowed an America more focused on its own affairs while leaving the world to take care of itself. Mr. Trump's success could fuel the populist, nativist, nationalist, closed-border movements already so evident in Europe and spreading to other parts of the world. For Mexico, it seemed to presage a new era of confrontation with its northern neighbor. For Europe and Asia, it could rewrite the rules of modern alliances, trade deals, and foreign aid. For the Middle East, it foreshadowed a possible alignment with Russia and fresh conflict with Iran. One immediate question will be whether Trump moves to scrap the Iran nuclear deal. * OBAMA CONGRATULATES TRUMP: The President called Trump early this morning to congratulate him, and: Obama invited Trump to meet with him at the White House on Thursday to discuss the transition. That might get a bit awkward. * CLINTON TO SPEAK ABOUT TODAY'S RESULTS: She is set to speak at 9:30 a.m. This should be one for the ages. * AND EVANGELICALS BACKED TRUMP IN FORCE: The Wall Street Journal ferrets out an amazing number from the exit polls: More than 80 percent of evangelical and born-again Christians backed Trump. And despite Trump's lewd boasts about groping women and multiple allegations of unwanted advances, more than 75 percent of evangelical women backed him. Well, Trump did repeatedly vow to Make Christianity Great Again, so maybe that explains it. That's not merely a joke: As one expert recently noted, evangelicals respond deeply to Trump's appeals to nostalgia and vow to restore a mythical golden age.  "

The city has over 478,000 registered voters, so turnout was around 60 percent, about what it was in 2012. Unofficial election results posted on the District of Columbia Board of Elections website show that 287,403 voters cast ballots. Hillary Clinton won the District's three electoral votes with just over 90 percent of the vote, about what President Barack Obama received in 2012. Donald Trump received 11,553 votes or about 4 percent of the total. 1 a.m. Voters in the nation's capital have decided to support becoming the 51st state, though that doesn't mean another star will be added to the nation's flag any time soon. The statehood referendum added some interest to a sleepy general election Tuesday in the nation's capital, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 12-to-1, and Hillary Clinton easily won the District's three electoral votes. On the statehood question, voters endorsed a draft constitution that would have residents electing a governor, not a mayor, and a 21-seat state legislature instead of a city council. The constitution includes new borders for the proposed state, with the White House, the Capitol and the National Mall carved out as a separate federal enclave. The city's mayor, Muriel Bowser, was scheduled to speak on statehood Wednesday morning. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Moreover: By 58 percent to 32 percent, more voters prefer Clinton's personality and temperament, and by 55 percent to 36 percent, more say she has better qualifications for the job than Trump does. [Clinton] also holds an eight-point advantage on the question of which candidate has a better understanding of the 'problems of people like you,' and a seven-point lead when voters are asked which candidate has stronger moral character. In 2012 Mitt Romney won white, college-educated women by 6 points; Clinton leads them by 16 points. Likewise, the Wall Street Journal/NBC polls shows Clinton leading by 4 points in a 4-person race. Once again we see: ""Among white women with a college degree, Mr. Trump is losing by an even larger margin, 18 percentage points. And by 8 points, Mr. Trump trails among suburban women, an important swing group that makes up nearly a third of the electorate."" None of this comes as a surprise to the #NeverTrump voices in the GOP who back in the spring warned that a candidate so obviously misogynistic and racist, running on an incoherent agenda of made-up facts and xenophobia, would be about the only candidate who couldn't beat Hillary Clinton.   [A final plea: The case against Trump's dangerous authoritarianism, in one chart]   Trump's bombastic style of politics based on demonization of ""the other"" and white, male grievances makes him anathema to minority voters and college-educated voters, who acutely feel a lack of respect. First Lady Michelle Obama caught the essence of offensiveness: It reminds us of stories we heard from our mothers and grandmothers about how, back in their day, the boss could say and do whatever he pleased to the women in the office, and even though they worked so hard, jumped over every hurdle to prove themselves, it was never enough. We thought all of that was ancient history, didn't we? And so many have worked for so many years to end this kind of violence and abuse and disrespect, but here we are in 2016 and we're hearing these exact same things every day on the campaign trail. Hearing him disdain, insult and objectify people in poverty and war zones, call Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and say a judge cannot do his job because he is ""Mexican"" (Trump denies a judge born in Indiana the status of ""American"") millions of non-whites feel like he's turned the clock back to the pre-Civil Rights era. Everything about Trump -- from his views on women to his notion that ""globalism"" (i.e., modernity) is the enemy -- is reactionary. Reactionaries, as political theorists explain, suffer from false memory and the need to shut out current reality: ""[The reactionary's] story begins with a happy, well-ordered state where people who know their place live in harmony and submit to tradition and their God. Then alien ideas promoted by intellectuals--writers, journalists, professors--challenge this harmony and the will to maintain order weakens at the top. (The betrayal of elites is the linchpin of every reactionary story.) A false consciousness soon descends on the society as a whole as it willingly, even joyfully, heads for destruction. Only those who have preserved memories of the old ways see what is happening. Whether the society reverses direction or rushes to its doom depends entirely on their resistance. For Trump ""a happy, well-ordered state"" means women are docile, minorities do not compete for white males' jobs and the United States stands apart from the world. This infatuation of the past is characteristic of  the alt-right (who'd like to reverse 60 years, at least, of racial progress). It likewise reflects the vibe of white Christian evangelicals who resent no longer dominating the culture (hence the obsession with getting everyone to say ""Merry Christmas"") and who have adjusted poorly to the rapid influx of non-whites. He perfectly encapsulates the sentiments of the anti-immigrant exclusionists who fear newcomers will deform America (i.e., move it away from its white, religious, Christian origins). The people who adore Trump are those who have lost status for the past few decades; his most ardent foes (professional women, minorities) those who have gained the most. Ironically, Trump keeps asking: What do you have to lose? The last 50 years, answer women and minorities.   [The Trump campaign's war on reality made me question what I saw]   This is where the GOP is heading -- backward. You see it in the party's refusal to accept gay marriage, in its idolization of the smokestack industry of the 1950's and in its condescension toward women. If they seem uninterested in finding concrete solutions to real problems it is because they do not wish to accept where we are; they engage in magical thinking to imagine going back. ""Make America Great Again"" is a reactionary plea for the present to become like the past. If the center-right is to maintain a viable political movement it will have to banish the reactionaries, flee from their party or stage an intervention. If there is to be a conservative renaissance it will need to come from the groups whom Trump has most alienated and who have the most to lose from his vision -- millennials, women, minorities, the college-educated. Many Republicans figured this demographic and philosophical reckoning would come in a decade or so. Thanks to Trump, that process has been accelerated. With an electorate that much more closely resembles contemporary America than Trump's America, this political collision is occurring before our eyes, in real time.          1 of 8       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                     Skip Ad   x           Eight of the most memorable moments from the 2016 presidential campaign      View Photos   A look at some of the historic, amusing and cringe-inducing events of the race between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

(Carlo Allegri/Reuters)  Everyone I know has Election Derangement Syndrome. They're nine or 10 stages beyond being merely nervous, atwitter, jittery. They're compulsively checking the polls, wandering dazed through the halls. They moan and keen and snivel. At night they have dreams of falling off a cliff, and in those dreams they try desperately to wake up before impact because we all know what happens if you don't. But enough about me. It's gonna be close, folks. Another close presidential election. Control of the Senate is also a touch-and-go matter. This is Game 7, Cubs-Indians, late innings. And the only thing at stake is the future of the republic. (Channeling Jason Robards as Ben Bradlee: ""Nothing's riding on this except the, uh, First Amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country."") [Andrew Sullivan: ""this republic is in serious danger.""] It's unlikely, but definitely possible, that we'll see some kind of muddled outcome, possibly even a recount situation, akin to what happened in 2000 in Florida. The electoral college tally typically exaggerates the difference in the popular vote, but the opposite can also happen (ask Al Gore, who won 540,000 more votes than George W. Bush). And you don't have to spend much time playing around with the Create Your Own Map functions on political websites to find a path to a 269 to 269 tie (which would send the election to the House, where each state delegation has one vote, Wyoming has as much power as California, and the Republicans have a solid edge). Why have American elections become so close? Maybe because polarization has become industrialized. When President Obama made his famous 2004 convention speech, he said there's not a liberal America and a conservative America. That wasn't true then, and it's even less true now. Division isn't entirely new in the United States (we had that little event known as the Civil War, for example), but in recent years Americans have, in fact, become more divided politically. See our story that ran this summer: Polls show a widening gap in political attitudes. [Check this out.] This reflects the widening ideological divide between the major parties, particularly as the tea party movement has pulled the Republican Party rightward. [Update: A reader of this blog item points to a longer-term trend. ""The issue is realignment of the parties, with liberals and moderates leaving the GOP for the Democratic Party and conservatives (mostly Southerners) leaving the Democratic Party for the GOP, giving us a more parliamentary-like legislature. Plenty of polarization in 1964 and 1968 if you care to look for it.""]    [America really is more divided than ever]   We're not only divided, we're divided rather evenly on the national scale even as regionally and locally one party or the other has dominance (ideological segregation). Polarization did not happen accidentally, or through some quirk of personalities among the candidates. This has to be, to some extent, a media-driven phenomenon. We have shifted from a few gatekeepers of information to a multiplicity of information sources, and many of those news and opinion outlets -- and political candidates -- understand that divisiveness can be an effective organizing strategy. Donald Trump's polarizing campaign, for example, is strategic. The message is: Those people over there aren't our opponents, those people are our enemies. This is the tribalization of American politics. Question: What's the Latin phrase for the opposite of e pluribus unum? In past elections we have talked a lot about undecided voters. This year, you have to wonder who might need more information to make a decision in the presidential contest. If they still find this to be a coin flip of a vote, then you would suspect that no amount of data or analysis could push them in a linear and logical fashion toward the candidate who most represents their interests. Turnout, though, remains an issue. The polls in recent days showed Hillary Clinton's once-solid lead over Donald Trump eroding but not collapsing entirely. The recent polls could lead to a bandwagon effect that benefits Trump -- people often like to go with the winner at the last minute -- or they could, to the contrary, prove motivation for liberals and moderates who were considering voting third party or staying home but will now head to the polls to vote for Clinton in an effort to stave off what they view as the Trumpocalypse. Remember to breathe."
