(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  CNN reports: President-elect Donald Trump will meet this weekend with one of his fiercest critics: 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, a senior Republican source told CNN on Thursday. The two men are set to meet this weekend to discuss ""governing moving forward"" and potentially a role for Romney in Trump's Cabinet, the source said. Before anyone gets excited, we think it highly, highly unlikely Romney would want to work for Trump or Trump would have him. If we have learned anything about Trump, it is that loyalty matters most. From Romney's standpoint, if he truly believes (which we think Romney does, accurately so) that Trump is morally and intellectually unfit, he'd give advice -- from afar. If Trump simply wants to show how magnanimous he is (he isn't) or pick Romney's brain, Romney should certainly give him some advice. Here are 10 suggestions for him to start with: 1. Get out of New York. The appearance that Trump is holed up in a ""safe"" environment, unwilling to devote himself completely to the new job, is terrible. He doesn't want to be seen (much as we would prefer) as a hands-off guy who lets everyone operate on autopilot. Most of all, he doesn't want to give those below him the impression that they are running things. 2. Hire people who will instantly have the respect of people in their building. If a novice gets sent to State, the permanent civil service will run roughshod over him or her. (The Foreign Service tries that even with experienced hands.) 3. Make a decision: The kids either run the business or help in government. They cannot and should not do both. (By the way, Trump is often paralyzed with indecision, so this is probably impossible advice for him to follow. Do you want A or B, Mr. President? Yes!) The old adage that it is hard to fire family is true, by the way. In addition, keeping ownership of Trump properties and/or letting his kids run them would set Trump up for ethical and legal complications that would give Hillary Clinton the giggles. If he starts out filling (not draining) the swamp, he'll have lost before he's gotten started on his agenda and infuriate his supporters who thought he was not going to be corrupt like other pols. Romney should remind him that the ""blind trust"" he wants to set up is a farce and will cause him and his kids grief. Cut the ties. Sell the assets. Let someone else control them. He's president, for goodness' sake! He'll make another fortune after he leaves office. 4. Don't hire people who refuse to play well with others. If someone has been a perpetual irritant -- someone who never fits in or is constantly blaming others -- don't hire him. (We gave this advice to the voters, but they elected Trump anyway.) The problem child will chase off good people, who won't want to work with him. He'll consume your time. He'll give the press the juicy narrative, namely ""infighting!"" 5. Don't hire someone just because you want to talk to him. When you are president, people will take your calls! Trump is picking people for the White House and Cabinet to do the work, to implement what he wants. That is different than what loyalists in a campaign do. He needs people who will immerse themselves in the details and whip the bureaucracy into shape. 6. Don't hire scandal-plagued people. If they have a track record of financial, political or personal shadiness, it will come out in the confirmation hearings and embarrass the president. The Swamp Drainer in Chief surely does not want to start his term by giving people the sense that they rejected Crooked Hillary only to get Crooked Donald. 7. Get a professionalized communication staff. The White House press secretary and communications director cannot look and sound like campaign flacks. They need to develop credibility, stick to the facts and engender some respect from the media. Trump can go to war with the media every day, like he did in the campaign, but that will make him a failed president. The White House has the huge advantage of stature and authority; picking a talk show host or a campaign spinner sacrifices that advantage. His focus has to be on his own agenda, not on score-settling. And, sorry, no personal tweeting. 8. Don't be hoodwinked like the last two presidents. Trump shows very little regard for President George W. Bush or Barack Obama, yet he seems bent on duplicating an early error that undermined both: trying to win over Vladimir Putin. The Russian president is not going to be charmed or mollified; he understands strength. Unless Trump wants to be caught implementing a failed ""reset"" policy, he should go back to the tried and true: Europe, whole and free and at peace. No more election meddling. All borders are respected. In the Middle East, Putin is not our friend. He's helping Iran, assisting in war crimes, destabilizing our allies and looking at setting up a military presence in the Middle East, something presidents of both parties have blocked. If Putin wins, Trump loses. It is that simple. 9. Avoid overexposure. Yes, we are talking Donald Trump. But Obama made the mistake of being everywhere and talking to everyone; no news or entertainment outlet was too far out for him. He sacrificed the specialness and the stature of the presidency, the excitement generated when the president comes to talk to the nation. The public knows Donald Trump well enough; President Trump has to operate on a different level. (Just as his public remarks since the election have been appropriate for a president-elect rather than a campaigner.) 10. When things go wrong, come clean quickly and completely. The Clintons never understood that. Obama didn't much either. (Remember how long it took him to give the non-apology/apology for telling us we could all keep our doctors?) And about those tax returns ... let's stop hiding behind an ""audit"" and put them out there. He'll be president, so what does it matter what's in them? The last thing he wants is his tax information eventually to leak out -- after someone in his administration has doled out special treatment to a company or bank he's doing business with. You cannot set up systems to prevent conflicts and corruption unless you know what Trump has, what he owes and whom he is in business with. Put it all out there -- even on Christmas Eve. At least that will be behind him.      Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said he was ""offended and dismayed"" by Donald trump's conduct, after The Washington Post published a 2005 video in which Trump makes lewd comments about women.

Tim Ryan launches long-shot challenge to Pelosi as Democrats struggle with postelection strategy	"      Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) on Nov. 17 announced a bid to replace House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) at the helm of the Democratic caucus. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) launched a long-shot challenge to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's reign atop the Democratic caucus, sending a letter to lawmakers Thursday telling them that last week's elections were a call to ""bring a new voice into leadership."" The secret-ballot election, set for Nov. 30, will test Pelosi's public declaration of victory Thursday when she said at a news conference that she has more than two-thirds support in the Democratic caucus. It also shapes up as a test of just how strong her hold is on a caucus that has been so supportive that she's only faced one nominal challenge, after the disastrous 2010 midterm elections, in the past decade. Ryan, 43, a seven-term lawmaker, has never held a leadership position within the party and acknowledged that he lacked the sort of profile that would have prompted others to look at him as a successor to Pelosi or any other senior Democrat. But the elections, in which Democrats gained just six seats after Pelosi predicted a more than 20-seat gain, turned sharply against Democrats across the Midwest. ""While having a position in Democratic leadership has never been my life's ambition, after this election I believe we all need to reevaluate our roles within the caucus, the Democratic Party, and our country.  That is why I am announcing my run for minority leader,"" Ryan wrote in his letter. Ryan's district, anchored in Youngstown, an old steel manufacturing town, is emblematic of the appeal of President-elect Donald Trump to white working-class voters. President Obama won Mahoning County in 2012 by more than 30,000 votes, with more than 63 percent, but Hillary Clinton won by less than 3,000 votes and did not even reach 50 percent in the Northeast Ohio county. Ryan is not running as an ideological moderate -- he hails from the union-friendly corner of the caucus -- but he and his small band of supporters are upset that the political focus in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign was on cultural issues related to Trump's fitness for office. Instead, this group of Democrats wanted a core economic message that could have resonated in industrial-centric districts. As speculation built that she might face a challenge, Pelosi brushed off the threat and said the party needed to come together to fight Trump's agenda. ""Without even asking anybody for a vote, I have over two-thirds of the caucus supporting me. When -- it's a funny thing in a caucus or any place, when somebody challenges you, your supporters turn out both internally in the caucus and in the country,"" she told reporters. Pelosi remains a dominant figure, and her ability to raise money from deep-pocketed liberals, ranging from Silicon Valley to Hollywood to trial lawyers, is unmatched by anyone in her party on Capitol Hill. In the third quarter of 2016, Pelosi's aides said she raised $35 million for Democratic candidates and committees. In his eight campaigns for Ohio's 13th Congressional District, Ryan has never raised more than $1.4 million in a single tw0-year period. But a new generation of Democrats, elected in the past four years and having never served in the majority, are adding energy to the usual group of Pelosi antagonists. ""I think that it's very healthy for there to be competition for leadership,"" said Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), who was first elected in 2012. He added that a full debate about the caucus's direction was ""desperately needed."" Pelosi defended her bullish predictions that Democrats were on their way to large gains and possibly the majority, telling reporters that she has told her caucus the elections were changed by the letter sent by FBI Director James B. Comey less than two weeks before Election Day. The letter said that agents were reviewing new material in their previously closed case examining Clinton's email security while she served as secretary of state. ""We could just see it in the numbers, you know? We thought we were like at 20 (pickups) and trying to go for more,"" Pelosi said, pointing upward to show the direction Clinton was headed  before the Comey letter. Pelosi wanted to wrap up the leadership elections by Thursday, but a revolt Tuesday within the caucus demanding more introspection over the elections led her to delay the vote until Nov. 30. That led to two days of rolling speculation about other lawmakers jumping in to challenge her. Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), a junior member of leadership, spent Wednesday and early Thursday contemplating a bid. His state's large delegation, plus his track record as a good fundraiser, made him a more legitimate threat to Pelosi, but by Thursday afternoon, he backed down and reconfirmed his plans to run for chairman of the caucus, the No. 4 leadership post. Ryan's challenge is Pelosi's first since 2010, when a conservative Democrat, then-Rep. Heath Shuler (N.C.), ran an ideological challenge from her right after the party lost 63 seats and the majority in that year's midterm elections. She routed Shuler, winning 150 votes to his 43, and has not faced a challenge since. Some Democrats privately see her proclamation of already having more than two-thirds of the votes as a true test for her strength within the caucus -- should she exceed that number, she remains truly powerful. If someone like Ryan gets a surprisingly large share of the vote, Pelosi's grip on power may be less than believed, even if she wins another term atop the caucus. That would show that some people lied to her, telling her that she has their support but voting against her in the secret ballot. Here is Ryan's letter in full to the caucus: Dear Democratic Colleague, Last Tuesday's election will forever be remembered as a major turning point for the United States of America. Like many Americans I was disheartened by the results, but I also realized that Democrats must not let this opportunity for change pass by without a fight. I have spent countless hours meeting and talking to members of our caucus, and the consensus is clear. What we are doing right now is not working. Under our current leadership, Democrats have been reduced to our smallest congressional minority since 1929. This should indicate to all of us that keeping our leadership team completely unchanged will simply lead to more disappointment in future elections. Over the last 18 years, Democrats have only been in the majority of the House of Representatives for two terms, and last week's election results set us back even further. We have lost over 60 seats since 2010. We have the fewest Democrats in state and federal offices since Reconstruction.  At this time of fear and disillusionment, we owe it to our constituencies to listen and bring a new voice into leadership. The American people need to know we understand that they elected us to fight for economic opportunity for all. We need to create America 2.0 -- a multicultural, progressive, and innovative country that fights every day for ordinary people. While having a position in Democratic leadership has never been my life's ambition, after this election I believe we all need to reevaluate our roles within the caucus, the Democratic Party, and our country.  That is why I am announcing my run for minority leader of the Democratic Caucus and humbly request your support. In the days and weeks ahead, I will put forward policies and ideas to help us energize the diverse base of our party, and fight the intolerance and dangers that President-elect Trump represents. I expect the entire caucus to hold me accountable. That is why if I am successful, I will not serve again without the support of two-thirds of the caucus. We need more voices at the Democratic leadership table. Every member of our caucus must play an important role in the future of our party and our country. Vote for me and I will dedicate all of my energy to lead us back into the majority. Our constituents deserve nothing less. Thank you for your support. Sincerely, Tim Ryan This post has been updated."

John Conyers	" HOUSTON -- Police in Houston were searching Thursday for longtime U.S. Rep. John Conyers' youngest son, who was reported missing this week. Carl Conyers, a 21-year-old student at the University of Houston, was last seen Tuesday by his roommate, police said. His girlfriend, Daisha Lewis, told WWJ Newsradio 950 in Detroit that she was supposed to meet him on campus Wednesday, but that he never showed. When she and friends checked his apartment they found some clothes and other items missing. Houston police spokesman Kese Smith said the department is working with the FBI and Secret Service to find the student. The Secret Service is involved because Conyers is the son of a congressman. John Conyers, who was first elected to Congress in 1964 and is its longest-serving member, said his wife, Monica, is in Texas awaiting any developments in the search.  ""I'm very worried,"" the Detroit Democrat told The Detroit News on Thursday. ""It's very unlike him. He's a very stable young guy."" A spokeswoman for the congressman issued a statement saying the family asks for privacy ""as they work through this situation of uncertainty."" Carl Conyers' roommate, Chet Ball, suggested Conyers may have been overwhelmed by his studies.  ""School can be hard on a person,"" Ball told reporters outside of their apartment. ""Stress is very serious."" Corey Gentry, a friend and schoolmate of Conyers, told the Houston Chronicle that Conyers is active on campus, as president of the school's Black Business Students Association and a member of an arts group called Uncommon Colors.  ""Usually Carl's a very logical and rational thinker,"" Gentry said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst  The government's consumer watchdog wants to know if you're having a hard time accessing your financial data. At a field hearing in Salt Lake City on Thursday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau launched an inquiry into the challenges consumers might face when using websites such as Mint.com, which aggregate details about consumers' finances. The agency said it wants to know what consumers are told about how their data is shared and stored. Officials also want to know if consumers have had issues with their banks slowing down or blocking access to their data. ""We are concerned that some financial institutions have threatened to cut off the flow of information to some websites and mobile applications,"" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in prepared remarks. ""We also hear of financial institutions that make consumers jump through so many hoops to access or authorize access to their own financial records that they are discouraged from even trying."" The call for more information is a sign the agency is moving ahead with potential rules regulating how banks must store, protect and share consumers' financial data, despite the major questions that have been raised about its future since the election. With Cordray's term not up until 2018, the agency is continuing to tackle the items on its regulatory agenda -- even though it's not clear how those efforts may fare under the new presidential administration. The CFPB and the Dodd-Frank legislation that created the agency have been marked as a target by President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has not said specifically what changes he would like to make to the consumer protection agency, but a website from his transition team says he wants to ""dismantle"" the Dodd-Frank Act. In the past several months, Republicans have proposed making significant changes to the way the independent agency is run or funded, including a proposal to replace the director's slot with a five-member bipartisan commission. Since Election Day, many government agencies have accelerated their timelines for regulations out of concern over how their offices might fare under the new administration. For instance, the Interior Department finalized a rule Tuesday that affects the oil and gas industry. But other groups are slowing down their agendas. The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary Jo White, announced that she is stepping down two years before the end of her term. And the Federal Communications Commission has signaled that it would not be rolling out more major regulations this year. Research is typically the first step in the CFPB's rule-making process, which also usually involves releasing an outline of what those potential rules might look like, before regulation is officially proposed. The agency has been busy this year, proposing rules for payday lenders and regulations that would ban financial companies from using arbitration clauses to keep customers out of class-action lawsuits. It's unclear how these proposed rules, which would probably not be finalized until next year, will fare with a Republican in the White House and under a Republican-controlled Congress. With its latest inquiry, the CFPB is moving to ensure that consumers can access details about their recent purchases, deposits and account balances when using third-party apps or websites that can help them budget or set other financial goals. Over the past several years, new Fintech start-ups have popped up to help consumers keep track of their bills, track spending patterns and meet other financial goals. At the field hearing, which was announced before the election, Cordray said the agency also wants to make sure the companies are storing information securely."

The states -- Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kentucky and Iowa -- failed to show how the law would affect them and not just individual egg farmers, a unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. The court upheld a lower court decision that dismissed the lawsuit. California voters approved a ballot initiative in 2008 that set the space requirements for egg-laying hens in the state. The standards say chickens must spend most of their day with enough space to lie down, stand up, turn around and fully extend their limbs. The measure gave farmers until 2015 to comply. California egg farmers raised concerns that the measure would put them at a competitive disadvantage with their counterparts in other states. In 2010, California legislators expanded the law to ban the sale of eggs from any hens that were not raised in compliance with California's animal care standards. The California law cites concerns about protecting people from salmonella and other illnesses. The six states argued that the law would force their egg farmers to stop selling in California or spend hundreds of millions of dollars complying with the California standard. Ninth Circuit Judge Susan Graber said that argument did not give the states standing to file suit.  ""Large egg producers certainly could file an action like this one on their own,"" she said. The states also argued that the price of eggs for their consumers would change. Graber said that argument was speculative since the suit was filed before the law took effect. But even if prices went up, the states would still not have standing to challenge the law because nothing in the law directs farmers to raise prices and that eggs -- unlike products such as natural gas, are not of ""central economic significance"" to a state, Graber said. A call to the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which argued the case for the states, was not immediately returned. The 9th Circuit ordered the case dismissed without prejudice, which gives the states the right to bring another lawsuit against the law in the future. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

In one case, the justices decided that death would amount to unequal punishment; In the other, they said mitigating factors should have ruled out execution. Robert McCloud, 35, faced capital punishment for the 2009 murders of Tamiqa Taylor, 26, and Dustin Freeman, 23, who were killed while McCloud and three other men tortured and robbed Wilkins Merlin, a known drug dealer, according to court documents. The group ransacked Merlin's house, taking about $5,000 in cash, $10,000 in marijuana and a handgun. But they were convinced Merlin was hiding more and tortured him, trying to learn where. They dropped a 40-pound dumbbell on his head, sliced his arms with a steak knife, doused him with boiling water and bleach, and shot him several times in the stomach, testicle and thigh. They also killed Freeman and Taylor, with gunshots to the heads from close range. Merlin survived, as did his 3-year-old daughter, who was found physically unharmed at the crime scene. Prosecutors could have sought the death penalty for all four. Instead, they made plea deals and the other three received sentences of 10 to 15 years for second-degree murder in exchange for their testimony against McCloud. The Supreme Court said McCloud's double death sentences were unfair because his co-defendants were just as culpable and received far less severe sentences. The court also noted that the jury determined McCloud wasn't the shooter. Terrance Phillips, 25, had been awaiting execution for the murders of Mateo Hernandez-Perez, 26, and Reynaldo Antunes-Padilla, 30, whom he shot during a botched 2009 robbery. After two women posing as prostitutes entered the victims' apartment, Phillips and a friend burst in and a struggle ensued, during which Phillips fired three shots, killing both men. The Supreme Court agreed Phillips is guilty, but said he shouldn't have been sentenced to death because he was 18 at the time and is borderline intellectually disabled.

The top U.S. intelligence official also said he had formally submitted a resignation letter effective at the end of President Barack Obama's term. In one of his last appearances on Capitol Hill, Clapper defended the administration's response to allegations that intelligence officials at the U.S. Central Command, which oversees the Middle East, pressured analysts to discard information that reflected poorly on the war effort in Iraq and Syria. He also predicted that the information warfare that Russia has conducted since the Soviet era would likely continue beyond the U.S. election cycle. Hacked emails from Democratic Party officials were released by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks during the presidential campaign, revealing details embarrassing to Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign. Clapper and the Department of Homeland Security said in October that based on the ""scope and sensitivity"" of the hacking efforts, only Russia's ""senior-most officials"" could have authorized the hacking. Russia has denied involvement.  ""After the issuance of the statement and the communication that I know took place between our government and Russian government, it seemed to have curtailed the cyberactivity that the Russians were previously engaged in,"" Clapper said. He said he was specifically referring to the ""cyber-reconnaissance"" that had been observed prior to the statement. ""That sort of activity seemed to have curtailed,"" he said. He said intelligence agencies don't have good insight on when or how Wikileaks obtained the hacked emails. The committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., took Clapper, along with two defense officials who testified, to task about allegations that CENTCOM massaged intelligence reports to make it appear the U.S. was doing better than it was in Iraq and Syria. Nunes said lawmakers have not seen any ""meaningful correction actions"" taken by defense or intelligence officials. The allegations are still being investigated. Clapper noted that a recent survey of intelligence employees has shown increases in the percentage of employees who think their reports have been satisfactorily handled. ""This is a one-year period, but it does show a positive trend,"" Clapper said. On Ukraine, Clapper predicted that Russia would sustain its presence in the eastern part of the country. Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its support for separatist rebels in the east brought relations between the two ex-Soviet neighbors to the verge of full rupture.  ""Clearly, the Russians want to sustain influence in a traditional part of greater Russia, which is the Ukraine. ... I think we just continue this sort of semi-stalemate we're in."" Clapper said. Also on Russia, Clapper said he did not foresee a change in Russian aggression in NATO countries in light of President-elect Donald Trump's plan to seek improved U.S.-Russia relations. He noted that Russia's only aircraft carrier recently deployed to the Mediterranean Sea -- an indication that ""the Russians are there to stay."" He said Russia's navy repair supply facility in the Syrian port of Tartus is its only base outside the former Soviet Union. ""I expect they're planning on expanding their presence at Tartus to support naval operations in the eastern Mediterranean,"" he said. On his retirement plans, the 75-year-old Clapper said it ""felt pretty good"" to submit his formal letter of resignation Wednesday. All top administration officials sign resignation letters before they depart on Jan. 20. Clapper said his resignation letter is effective at noon on Inauguration Day. Committee members jokingly asked him to stay on for perhaps four more years. Clapper could be asked to stay on temporarily until his successor is confirmed, but that would be up to Trump and it's unclear if Clapper would agree to stick around.  ""I got 64 days left and I think I'd have a hard time with my wife anything past that,"" Clapper said. Clapper, who has been in the intelligence business for more than 53 years, has been director of national intelligence since August 2010. A lieutenant general in the Air Force, Clapper has held multiple intelligence positions since the 1960s, including director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

This past week did nothing to allay my fears; see this wrap-up in the New Yorker, and that's before the Trump adviser told Megyn Kelly that hey, we did the Japanese-American internment camps, you do what you have to do.  Well, we'll do what we have to do, and that's write some zingy songs for Style Invitational Week 1202. When this contest occurred to me a few days back, I was, if not optimistic, at least a little bit hopeful that somehow the American Way would prevail. Okay, I still am. What's the alternative?  This contest follows only by a few months our Week 1177 contest for songs about the campaign season. As I said in the results, ""most of the lyrics had one of two themes: 1. He's horrible. 2. They're both horrible."" So we are covering at least somewhat different territory this time around. Still, if you think your parody is still applicable and was robbed of ink last time (I can't possibly run all the good parodies a given week), you're welcome to submit it again, perhaps updated or otherwise reworked. Note that I'm giving you two weeks to enter; I'll try to read entries as they filter in, so I'm not expecting a logistical problem -- feel free to submit them one at a time. Once again, I'm suspending my usual distaste for co-written entries; keep it to two names, though. Video clips are a lot of fun, and I like linking to them, but they're not a factor in what gets ink. Make sure that your settings will let readers see the clip by clicking on the link I give. (The clip doesn't have to be searchable.) YouTube has made loading videos vastly easier than it used to be -- you can sing straight into your computer or phone, even, and ta-da.  If you're not a regular contributor to Invite parody contests, take a few minutes to read these guidelines that I wrote up in the Conversational for Week 1113.  In a nutshell, a song contest whose results are meant to be read, rather than performed, demands two particular qualities that the Weird Al opus need not have:  -- As opposed to sung songs, in which they're extremely useful to make the song catchy, repeated lines and choruses become tedious on the page. If you repeat a verse, you'd need to change something so that it continues to enhance the wit of the song. And a strong, clever ending, not an anticlimax, works much better as humor.  -- ""Sound rhymes"" that rely on the same vowel sound, rather than true rhymes, are much less forgivable as witty lyrics to be read. Even if the original song's rhyme scheme ""rhymes"" ""heart"" and ""dark,"" your parody can't. And of course you can't shoehorn words into your song that end up accented on the wrong sylLAbles. My big rule: Hand a copy of your song to someone else, sit back, and see if that person can sing it without becoming confused.  If that person can't, I probably can't either.  I noted that, as always, I try to fill the limited space of the print version of the Invitational -- and that will include the winner and three runners-up -- with eight or 10 parodies that readers are more likely to be able to sing along with. So that means they're set to songs that (I'm optimistic) are widely known: Given that the results of this contest will be running the week before Christmas, holiday tunes could fill the bill, right? But also: children's songs, patriotic songs, well-known tunes from musicals and movies, classic rock and pop from the past 40 years, and songs that are inescapable on today's pop radio. I do like to provide a mix on the print page as well as a much broader mix online, where I can provide links to songs that might be new to many readers, so don't throw out the idea of parodying a lesser-known song; it's just not going to get into the print edition -- whose circulation of somewhere under 1 million inevitably reaches a smaller and smaller fraction of the HUGE Washington Post readership. I always enjoy discovering new songs -- from all eras -- when I judge parody contests.  One more thing: In recent years, I've especially enjoyed parodies that you can really sing as a full song, not just a few lines -- say, verse-bridge-ending, or even verse-verse-bridge-ending. Don't worry that I'll toss it simply because of its length. BUT BUT BUT those verses all have to be interesting and mechanically sound, preferably finishing in a clever way. And I like to intersperse short songs with the long ones.  Shortly after the results of Week 1177 ran this past summer, Loser parodists and former co-workers Barbara Sarshik and Duncan Stevens joined me one afternoon for a milkshake at a downtown Potbelly. Duncan brought some printouts, and the three of us sat at an outside table and gleefully sang some of Barbara's parodies (and maybe some of Duncan's) -- even the one to ""Springtime for Hitler"" from ""The Producers,"" ""Should I Choose Hitler or Hillary?"" (No, that one didn't get into the print paper.) For guidance and inspiration, here are some links to recent parody results:  Week 1154, songs about animals Week 1113, songs for special occasions Week 1074,  songs about a play, set to a tune from another show Week 929, songs about a TV show, a la the ""Beverly Hillbillies"" theme  LITTER-ALL TRANSLATIONS*: THE 'PLAIN ENGLISH' OF WEEK 1198  (*Non-inking headline idea from Howard Walderman)  Well, we did run into a little problem with some of the entries in  Week 1198, our contest to choose a line from The Post or another paper and (loosely) ""translate"" the bureaucratic, euphemistic or insincere sentence into what it really means. It's best demonstrated by this otherwise inkworthy entry by Mark Raffman: Paul Ryan: ""To me, it's all about the moral authority to put [our program] in place after the election.""  Translation:  ""To me, it's all about avoiding the taint of Donald Trump after the election."" It doesn't seem that Paul Ryan has been grabbed by any taint in the past week.  But there was more ink to be had for Mark (who filed from Vietnam!), as for plenty of other Losers skilled in seeing through governmental and corporate fluff and fog. Dave Prevar noted the age-old administration practice of announcing news in the form of an anonymous quote; Francis Canavan saw how the denial that a company was for sale was combined with a list of rosy business figures, concluding probably safely that the quote amounted to a big For Sale sign. And of course there are the postgame comments and the big-sale ads and the happiest thing you could say about a crashed spacecraft. Kevin Dopart, the Invite's top finisher for seven straight years until finally being eclipsed in Year 21, finds himself back ""above the fold"" after an uncharacteristic couple of months' drought (though he's gotten plenty of magnets). This week, in fact, Kevin gets two of the four spots in the Losers' Circle: his 24th win and his 78th runner-up (he's opting for the Grossery Bag rather than yet another Inkin' Memorial bobblehead).  Danielle Nowlin's Camusian angst turned to autumn shopping lists snags her her 34th ink above the fold, and 246 blots in all, and Neal Starkman of the SeaTac Loser Bureau gets his 10th, making for an impressive ratio to his 61 total inks.   What Doug Dug:  Ace copy editor Doug Norwood agreed with my choices on the winners this week (that's a good editor, Doug) and also especially liked Marni Penning Coleman's entry about the eagerness to touch untouched Antarctica, Warren Tanabe's deft wordplay about the NFL's violence policies, Hildy Zampella's dig at the forever-diggable Metrorail system.   Speaking TOO plainly -- the unprintable: Given that the Taste Police let Hildy Zampella call Bob Dylan a ""douche,"" I seem to have flagged just one entry as Convo Only for taste. It's from Jeff Contompasis: ""But even as smoking rates have fallen, oral cancer rates have remained about the same and researchers in recent studies have linked the increase to HPV.""   Plain English: ""Mouth infections are going up as more guys are going down."" Jeff also sent in an entry that wasn't a taste problem but was a bit too Loser-insidey for the Invite itself, referring to one of our most memorable prizes: ""In the world of prestigious prizes, the honor is yours whether you like it or not.""Plain English: ""Smile and accept this Smorked Beef Rectum.""  SEE YOU SOONER THAN YOU'D THINK  Next week, I'll be dropping by a day early: The Invitational and Conversational will publish Wednesday, Nov. 23, since that's when the Arts & Style print section will be going to press. Wednesday is usually my magnet-mailing day, so people who got ink this week will probably have to wait another day or two. So I won't wish you a happy Thanksgiving just yet.

The staffers will be dispatched to 67 jurisdictions to watch for potential civil rights violations, such as discrimination on the basis of race. The announcement comes amid rising concerns about voter intimidation, particularly aimed at minorities. The number of personnel is fewer than the roughly 780 monitors and observers who were dispatched during the 2012 presidential election. The Justice Department has said its poll-watching presence has been curtailed by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion that gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Acts. That decision has led to a reduction in trained observers, who enjoy unfettered access to the polls and cannot be removed from the sites. Even so, the Justice Department said it was still sending staffers to five more states than it did during the 2012 election. Most of the more than 500 staffers will be monitors, who rely on the cooperation of local officials to do their jobs. Observers in this election are limited to a handful of jurisdictions around the country where federal court orders are in place that authorize their presence. Justice Department officials say they hope voters will not detect any difference in the federal presence.  ""In most cases, voters on the ground will see very little practical difference between monitors and observers,"" Vanita Gupta, head of the department's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. ""We work closely and cooperatively with jurisdictions around the country to ensure that trained personnel are able to keep an eye on the proceedings from an immediate vantage point."" Among the states receiving federal monitors are those that have changed their voting rights laws since the last general election, or that are seen as more likely to experience problems on Tuesday. The Justice Department listed five counties each in North Carolina and Florida where staff will be sent.  ""The department is deeply committed to the fair and unbiased application of our voting rights laws and we will work tirelessly to ensure that every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement. ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  On Friday, a major milestone will arrive for global climate change diplomacy. The so-called Paris climate agreement, an international accord forged last December by countries across the world, will become a legal reality far sooner than almost anyone anticipated. The rapid pace with which countries have ratified the agreement underscores the urgency many nations feel in the wake of a string of record hot years and ever more severe climate impacts. Next week in Marrakesh, Morocco, leaders from around the globe will gather to celebrate the achievement and to begin ironing out the details of how individual countries plan to live up to the ambitious commitments they've made to slash their emissions of carbon dioxide. When it comes to efforts to combat climate change, ""it's the best of times, it's the worst of times,"" said David Sandalow, the inaugural fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. Leaders have moved with unprecedented speed recently to combat global warming: In addition to the Paris accord, there has been progress this year on limiting international airline emissions and powerful greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs. But most scientists agree that the world continues to move too slowly.      The Paris Agreement is expected to come into force within the next few months. The Post's Chris Mooney explains where we go from here. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)     [The world is racing to stop climate change. But the math still doesn't add up]   The current pledges countries have made under the Paris agreement would still allow the world to warm by 3 degrees Celsius or more above pre-industrial levels, an amount well beyond the 2-degree threshold that many experts agree is likely to trigger severe changes to the environment. In the meantime, 2016 has offered a litany of grim reminders of an already changing climate, from extensive coral death at the Great Barrier Reef to particularly sharp Arctic temperatures in a year virtually certain to become the warmest in recorded history. ""The signals the climate system is sending are profoundly disturbing,"" Sandalow said. The consequence is that as the much-anticipated Paris agreement goes into effect Friday, the world faces a sort of race between politics and physics. The central question that will hover over the international meeting in Morocco next week is whether humans can wean themselves from fossil fuels and halt carbon emissions in time to stave off the worst effects of a changing climate. Can nations move quickly enough to combat a problem that for so long has seemed distant and intangible to many citizens? ""There's so much that needs to be done,"" said Heidi Cullen, chief scientist for the nonprofit environmental organization Climate Central. ""The easy part is over. Friday, in many ways, marks the beginning of the rubber hitting the road. All of us see how much will be resting on every country's commitment. We're all going to be in this together, and we all have to hold each other accountable."" William K. Reilly, who led the Environmental Protection Agency under President George H.W. Bush and has served as president of the World Wildlife Fund, said one key challenge for countries will be to identify precisely how they plan to meet -- and eventually exceed -- their commitments in coming years. Another is figuring out how to fund the kind of energy transformations that will be necessary to stay ""well below"" the 2-degree Celsius temperature red line laid out under the Paris agreement. ""One has to hope that the engines are gearing up to ensure that those financings, which are absolutely necessary to the success of the Paris agreement, are forthcoming,"" he said. Cullen agreed that finding funding for the projects that countries must undertake to slash their emissions and transform their energy sectors will be key. ""We're going to really need to develop these green financing mechanisms,"" she said, adding that it will require a mixture of public and private investment. Even then, the reality of effectively ending fossil fuel emissions in coming decades will be a difficult proposition. ""It's going to take actors from every level, from every sector,"" she said. ""It's far from where we are now. But we've managed to make tremendous progress.""   [A key part of Obama's climate legacy gets its day in court]   The Paris climate agreement, in effect, pools together individual commitments by countries to lower their emissions, channeling that collective energy in an effort to bend the planet's current climate trajectory. The trouble, though, is that while the current commitments help avoid a worst-case scenario of very extreme warming by 2100, they fail to put the planet on a ""safe"" path that would prevent serious climate impacts, such as rising seas, melting polar ice caps and more intense floods and droughts. Meanwhile, in the scientific world, the evidence has grown ever clearer that each incremental increase in temperature, if sustained over a considerable period, corresponds to a notably different planet. In particular, researchers today are drawing more and more on analogies with warm periods in the Earth's past, which allow them to make connections between key parameters such as planetary temperatures, carbon dioxide levels and sea levels. And the news isn't good: For instance, there were past eras not much warmer than our own, or with comparable levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, that had far higher seas than we have now. Compared with those daunting possibilities, the to-do list for Marrakesh next week appears relatively mundane. ""The parties are going to roll up their sleeves and lay out the key issues in the fine print of the agreement that need to be ironed out so the architecture has meaning,"" said Mariana Panuncio-Feldman, who is co-leading the World Wildlife Fund's delegation to Marrakesh. Only in 2018, at the earliest, will a future meeting actually focus on ramping up pressure on countries to put forward more ambitious commitments that alter the trajectory further, Panuncio-Feldman said. That's cutting it uncomfortably close, in light of a United Nations Environment Programme report released Thursday suggesting that if the planet's overall emissions don't peak by the year 2020, it may no longer be possible to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the more ambitious and aspirational target contained in the Paris agreement and a goal particularly desired by developing countries and vulnerable small island nations. None of this factors in the potential fallout from the upcoming U.S. election. While Hillary Clinton has vowed to honor the Paris agreement and make sure the United States continues to play a leading role in combating climate change, Donald Trump has pledged to ""cancel"" the accord. That might technically be difficult to do, given that the agreement will already be in force in January, but a Trump administration undoubtedly could slam the brakes on the political momentum for cutting carbon emissions, at least in the United States. And such a move would reverberate in the global community that has rallied, as never before, behind the Paris process. ""This is a binary choice,"" said Reilly, the former EPA administrator, noting that Clinton has vowed to live up to the country's commitments under the Paris agreement, while Trump has promised to ""disavow"" them. ""We have a choice between a strong leader on climate action and a climate denier,"" Sandalow added. ""The choice between Secretary Clinton and Donald Trump will make an enormous difference for the future of the planet."" That might be true. But if Paris has revealed anything, it's that on a global scale, Trump is an outlier. Far from questioning the reality of climate change, other world leaders have shown remarkable swiftness in the past year in trying to take the steps necessary to slow global warming. And that action isn't limited to governments. ""This is the first year in history where investments in renewable energy have outpaced those in fossil fuels. So the market is moving ahead much, much faster than most people understand,"" John Morton, the White House's senior director for energy and climate change, said Thursday in a call with reporters. He added that ""what we have seen in recent months, and in fact in recent years, is [the] inevitability of the transition to a low-carbon economy.  And so the international community -- the international business community, the international policy community -- is moving forward and will continue to move forward, and there's no questioning anymore about the commitment at both the government and policy levels.""
