Jack Dalrymple has asked the Army Corps of Engineers to speed up its decision on whether to allow a company to proceed with laying a section of the Dakota Access pipeline under a Missouri River reservoir. Dalrymple said at a news conference Friday that increasingly frequent protests against the pipeline in and around the state capital, Bismarck, have created ""a tremendously challenging, tremendously difficult situation."" Demonstrators have protested in several locations this week, including at the state Capitol building and the state-owned Bank of North Dakota, among others. Bismarck Mayor Mike Seminary credited residents for being patient with protesters and thanked residents for displaying ""North Dakota nice."" Protesters say the pipeline would threaten the drinking water on a Standing Rock Sioux reservation. ___ 1:40 p.m. Several celebrities, including the actors Shailene Woodley and Ezra Miller, are meeting with Standing Rock Sioux officials and youth in North Dakota to discuss efforts to halt construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Woodley, who starred in ""The Fault in our Stars"" and the ""Divergent"" series, has been to the protest site before. She was arrested last month on charges of trespassing and engaging in a riot. On Friday, she suggested that people should consider pulling their money out of the banks funding the pipeline and putting it instead in federal credit unions. Protester Kendrick Eagle says he was part of a group that met with President Barack Obama when the president visited the reservation in June 2014. He says the president promised to stand with the tribe and that he is needed ""more than ever"" to help in the pipeline fight. ___ 12 p.m. The head of the company building the Dakota Access oil pipeline says the company won't consider rerouting it to address American Indian concerns. The $3.8 billion pipeline to carry North Dakota oil to Illinois is largely complete except for a stretch under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. The Standing Rock Sioux fears a leak could contaminate drinking water on its nearby reservation. President Barack Obama has raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline. Kelcy Warren, the CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press on Friday that the company won't change the route. The Army Corps of Engineers has delayed approving the river crossing, calling for more tribal input. ETP has asked a federal judge to declare that it has the right to drill under the river.

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) delivers a speech for Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July. (Mike Segar/Reuters)  Sen. Jeff Sessions had called to talk about international trade, but the conversation had wandered to workers, to politics, to why Republicans had lost the presidency twice in a row. He had a theory that wrapped them all together. It reflected an evolution in the Alabama senator's thinking on a crucial policy issue, and it would loom presciently over the election to come. It was last spring, months before Donald Trump had sewn up the Republican nomination, won the White House and offered Sessions the job as attorney general in his new administration. In an extended phone interview, Sessions was explaining how he had come to oppose new free-trade agreements after a long career of supporting them. His reasoning echoed the America-first, populist message that would carry Trump to victory.   [Jeff Sessions is expected to bring sweeping changes to the Justice Department]   At a time when Trump was winning primaries and hopes for the Trans-Pacific Partnership were fading in Congress, Sessions said, renegotiating trade deals, as Trump promised, suddenly seemed like a winning strategy. ""The intellectual case for, 'any trade agreement is a good trade agreement' is bankrupt and cannot be sustained,"" Sessions said. ""It's just a religion, that all trade deals are good, and anyone who opposes them is a liberal, or something. But I think it's a good, conservative principle to say that trade should serve our interests."" At several points, Sessions linked trade to immigration, an issue that would be far more in his wheelhouse as attorney general than would trade agreements. And then he linked both back to the elections.   [rump chooses Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director, people close to the transition say]   ""In addition to the fact that Americans have to compete against immigrant labor, they have to compete against imports, they also have to compete against robots and computers,"" Sessions said. ""We're not going to stop that, hell. But somebody who wants to be a government leader, one of the first things on their mind has to be, how am I going to get jobs for people already in the country?"" After Mitt Romney lost to President Obama in 2012, Sessions said, Republican leaders ""declared we need to be more moderate, and we have to have amnesty [for immigrants in the country illegally]. I thought that was wrong. We need to listen to the American people for a change. The American people want us to fix immigration."" ""People are upset about trade,"" he said, ""and these trade agreements aren't going so well. Why don't we promise to fix these trade agreements? That's why we're losing these elections. And, no, no, no, the geniuses had made up their minds."""

An internal organizational chart for the Trump transition team lists more than 30 names, some well-known within the GOP establishment. They are tasked with helping to select and vet Trump's Cabinet, as well as map out the key policy initiatives the new administration will pursue. Their areas of experience and policy expertise on the chart hint at future efforts to restrict abortion, strip away consumer protections, boost defense spending and dismantle environmental regulations. Key members of Trump's team are also advocates for sweeping privatization of government programs, including Social Security.  ""Personnel is policy,"" said Republican operative Ron Kaufman, who also served in George W. Bush's White House. The team will not necessarily carry over into the Trump administration -- though members of past transition teams often have. Instead, they are in charge of putting together hiring recommendations, working with outgoing appointees and laying the groundwork for administration's opening months.  ""For people who voted for him thinking that he'd shake things up, I don't think they thought he was going to privatize everything,"" said Dean Baker, a progressive economist and founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""He runs this populist, anti-Wall Street campaign, and he turns to Wall Street and lobbying guys."" The behind-the-scenes transition operation is being run by Ron Nichol, a senior partner at The Boston Group, a management consulting firm where 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney launched his business career. A former nuclear submarine officer, Nichol oversees five teams targeted at ""Agency Transformation and Innovation."" Overseeing the transition for domestic issues is Ken Blackwell, the former Ohio secretary of state, state treasurer and Cincinnati mayor. He is a senior fellow at the Family Research Council, which opposes same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Veteran agribusiness lobbyist Michael Torrey is tasked with transforming the Agriculture Department. Energy industry lobbyist Mike McKenna, who represents electricity and chemical companies, is leading the Energy Department transition team. For the Interior Department there is David Bernhardt, a top lawyer at the agency under President George W. Bush who represents mining companies seeking to use resources on federal lands and Indian reservations. Lobbyist Steven Hart, who focuses on tax and employee benefits, is leading the transition team for the Labor Department. Cindy Hayden, a former congressional staffer who is now the top lobbyist for Altria, the parent company of cigarette-maker Philip Morris, is overseeing the transition for the Homeland Security Department. Jeff Eisenach, a consultant and former lobbyist who has called for deregulation of the telecommunications industry, is overseeing the transition for the Federal Communications Commission. The man put in charge of staffing for the Social Security Administration, Michael Korbey, is a former lobbyist who led President George W. Bush's effort to privatize America's retirement system. Trump campaigned on keeping Social Security within the federal government. One of Trump's campaign pledges was to spending up to $1 trillion over 10 years on infrastructure projects. But his selection to oversee the transition for the Transportation Department, Shirley Ybarra, has been a champion of ""public-private partnerships"" to build toll roads and bridges. A former Virginia state transportation secretary, Ybarra now works as a policy analyst with the libertarian-leaning Reason Foundation, which has received support from conservative billionaires David and Charles Koch. Trump has also pledged to renegotiate the Paris climate treaty signed in December, saying efforts to restrict the carbon emissions are harming American industries such as coal mining. Trump's pick to oversee the transition for the Environmental Protection Agency is Myron Ebell from the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has voiced the false view that man-made global warming is a hoax. Ebell has called for dismantling environmental protections and assigning international carbon-cutting agreements to the ""dustbin of history."" Trump has pledged to transform a national economy he said was hobbled by bad trade deals and rigged against American workers by Wall Street and the big banks. His list of advisers indicates an interest in rolling back many of the reforms made in the wake of the 2008 recession and appears to signal an interest in deregulating the financial sector. David Malpass, who is overseeing the Treasury Department transition, was Bear Stearns' chief economist in the years before the firm's 2008 collapse. A few months before the recession began, Malpass wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled ""Don't Panic About the Credit Market.""  ""Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the U.S. economy, or of job creation,"" Malpass said in August 2007, predicting continued economic growth. He has complained about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the brainchild of progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Dan DiMicco, who is overseeing the transition of the U.S. trade representative's office, fits in well with Trump's avowed hard line on tariffs. The former chief executive of steel company NUCOR and a board member at Duke Energy, he's likely to steer the U.S. toward far more aggressive trade policy. In his 2015 book, DiMicco declared that the United States is already in a trade war with China -- and that it's losing. Former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., is taking the lead on crafting Trump's national security team. The former chairman of the House intelligence committee, Rogers serves on boards for consulting firms IronNet Cybersecurity and Next Century Corp. At the Justice Department, Kevin O'Connor, a former U.S. attorney for Connecticut, is overseeing the transition. He briefly served as chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, a George W. Bush appointee who resigned from the Justice Department in 2007 amid a scandal over the firing of U.S. attorneys. He was also a partner at the law firm of close Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani. Jim Carafano is the Heritage Foundation's vice president for Foreign and Defense Policy Studies and is leading the transition at the State Department. A 25-year Army veteran, Carafano has been advising Trump on terrorism and border security. In a recent radio interview, Carafano said he told Trump that the next administration must pay more attention to transnational criminal cartels, toughen border security and fight al-Qaida globally. Trump has tapped retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who is close to Trump military adviser Michael Flynn, to oversee the transition for the Defense Department. Kellogg was chief operating officer for Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, which governed the country after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Working with Kellogg is Mira Ricardel, a former acting assistant defense secretary during the George W. Bush administration who more recently served as vice president of business development for Boeing Strategic Missile & Defense Systems, a major military contractor. ___ Associated Press writers Joan Lowy, Marcy Gordon, Eric Tucker, Matthew Daly, Deb Riechmann, Robert Burns, Julie Pace and Steve Peoples contributed to this report. ___ Follow Biesecker at Twitter.com/mbieseck; Horwitz at Twitter.com/JeffHorwitz; and Salama at Twitter.com/vmsalama Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
