As national security adviser to Trump, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn would be responsible for helping a president with no national security experience navigate complicated global issues including the unfinished campaign against the Islamic State, the expansionist agenda of China and rising aggression from Russia. Flynn's selection for the post was confirmed Thursday night by a person close to the Trump transition team who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations.   [How Flynn went from intel officer to leading 'lock her up' chants]   As a decorated military intelligence officer and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn has deep experience to draw upon as he serves as Trump's principal point of contact with the State Department, the Pentagon and a collection of U.S. intelligence agencies that have surged in power and influence since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. ""This is a guy who has the president's trust, has credentials with the military, credentials with the intelligence community and credibility with Congress,"" said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Ca.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team. ""He's a very serious person. He takes his job very seriously.""         1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Flynn stunned former colleagues when he traveled to Moscow last year to appear alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a lavish gala for the Kremlin-run propaganda channel RT, a trip Flynn admitted he was paid to make and defended by saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels such as CNN. Flynn said he used the trip to press Putin's government to behave more responsibly in international affairs. Former U.S. officials said Flynn, seen dining next to Putin in photos published by Russian propaganda outlets, was used as a prop by the autocratic leader.  [Transcript: Michael T. Flynn on his dinner with Putin and supporting Trump]  Flynn was forced out of his job as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 over concerns about his leadership style. After the ouster, he frequently lashed out in public against President Obama and blamed his removal on the administration's discomfort with his hard-line views on radical Islam. Spurning the decorum traditionally expected of retired U.S. flag officers, Flynn became a fervent campaigner for Trump and was given a high-profile role speaking before the GOP convention, an appearance in which he led the crowd in ""lock her up"" chants against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Flynn's behavior drew the ire of former colleagues and superiors, including retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who made Flynn his top intelligence officer during critical stretches of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.     Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn called for Hillary Clinton to drop out of the presidential race during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. (Republican National Convention)   McChrystal and retired Adm. Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, contacted Flynn and urged him to show more restraint, with Mullen warning that Flynn's behavior could jeopardize White House trust in the military. Flynn dismissed those concerns in an interview with The Washington Post earlier this year, saying efforts to quiet him impinged on his free speech rights. ""When someone says, 'You're a general, so you have to shut up,' "" he said, ""I say, 'Do I have to stop being an American?' "" Flynn continued to campaign for Trump and has said he has admired the mogul since their initial meeting. ""I was very impressed,"" Flynn said in the interview with The Post. ""Very serious guy. Good listener. Asked really good questions . . . I found him to be very attuned to what was going on around the world."" Civil rights groups denounced the Flynn selection, saying he has refused to reject Trump's repeated statements supporting the use of waterboarding and other brutal interrogation measures on terrorism suspects. Trump has also advocated killing or capturing innocent relatives of terrorism suspects.  Asked about such proposals, Flynn said in an interview with Al Jazeera this year that he is a ""believer in leaving as many options on the table right up until the last possible minute."" ""Michael Flynn has exhibited basic contempt for international law, including the Geneva Conventions and laws prohibiting torture,"" said John Sifton, deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch. ""By offering the post to Flynn, President-elect Trump will be cementing a dark return to the illegalities of the Bush administration and further undermining the foundation of the international human rights system."" A longtime Democrat and native of Rhode Island who grew up in a military family, Flynn has articulated an increasingly dark vision of the direction of the United States, saying that it has fallen into a struggle between ""centrist nationalists"" and ""socialists."" He has also warned that the United States is failing to adequately address the threat posed by what he calls a ""diseased component"" of Islam. ""There's something going on in the Muslim world,"" he said. ""Why do we have heightened security at our airports? It's not because the Catholic Church is falling apart."" That view, and his willingness to voice it publicly, put him in close alignment with Trump, who has called for Muslims in the United States to be registered, subjected to loyalty tests and in some cases deported. In February, Flynn tweeted a link to a YouTube video with the message: ""Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: Please forward a link to this video so that people may learn the BASICS of Islam."" As national security adviser, Flynn would be a White House insider in a unique position to influence Trump on almost all aspects of foreign policy. Trump has shown scant respect for the intelligence and institutions that shaped Flynn, dismissing an intelligence community assessment that Russia was interfering in the presidential election as ""public relations."" Trump has also said he probably knows more than American generals about how to succeed in conflict zones such as Syria, encouraged Russia to hack Clinton's email accounts and called for the CIA to resume its harsh interrogation methods. Flynn publicly opposed such ideas before his association with Trump, and it is not clear whether he would help the president-elect advance an agenda built around such positions and policies. Flynn most recently raised eyebrows in Washington with the publication of an opinion article in which he called for wholesale changes in U.S. policy toward Turkey and the extradition of exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, who resides in Pennsylvania and has been accused by the Turkish government of fomenting a coup attempt earlier this year. Gulen's ""vast global network has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network,"" Flynn wrote in the piece, which was published in the Hill. Officials with ties to the Trump transition team said that Flynn did not clear that article with the campaign before it was published or disclose that his consulting firm had been hired for lobbying work by a group with ties to the Turkish government.

The (Belleville) News-Democrat reports (http://bit.ly/2f9xXND ) that Audrey Cook appeared Thursday in Madison County Circuit Court. Cook, of Alton, told The Associated Press this month that she filled out the ballot for her husband after he died in September because she knew he would want Donald Trump to be president. She was charged a few days before the Nov. 8 election with two felony counts of election fraud. Madison County State's Attorney Tom Gibbons has said the ballot was never even opened because a clerk found it had been submitted in the name of a deceased person. Gibbons also said Cook would be removed as an election judge. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

The Russian military meanwhile said airstrikes in the rebel-held province of Idlib earlier this week killed at least 30 members of an al-Qaida-linked group, including three commanders. The strikes are part of a major Syrian and Russian offensive launched earlier this week on opposition-held areas that has killed dozens of people. In one area, volunteer first responders dug through the rubble for four hours before pulling out a six-year-old child who was still alive. The child's mother was killed in the strikes, said Ibrahim al-Haj, a spokesman for the rescuers, known as the Syrian Civil Defense. The activist-run Public Services Authority said the Bab al-Nairab water plant was struck with a barrel bomb. Spokesman Ahmad al-Shami said the plant was damaged but is still operating.  ""This regime uses any means to add pressure to civilians. It has bombed bakeries and hospitals and has not made an exception for water and electricity,"" he told The Associated Press. Airstrikes on Wednesday struck the city's central blood bank and a children's hospital. Medical facilities have repeatedly come under attack during the Syrian conflict, with 126 such incidents this year alone, according to the World Health Organization. Doctors Without Borders said the children's hospital and a specialized surgical hospital were hit by Wednesday's strikes.  ""Hospital staff managed to move children_including prematurely born babies_from cots and incubators to the basement of the building in order to shelter them from the bombing,"" said the aid group, which sponsors both hospitals. The Oxfam aid group said the more than 250,000 residents of eastern Aleppo have limited food and clean water as winter approaches, and are at risk of disease outbreaks. No U.N. aid has reached eastern Aleppo since July, and the U.N. has warned that supplies will run out this week. Oxfam said it helped move a generator to the besieged area on Wednesday to improve the water supply.  ""Clean water is vital, but it won't stop starvation, never mind protect people from indiscriminate aerial attacks,"" said Andy Baker, who is leading Oxfam's Syria response. The Syrian Civil Defense said 28 people were killed in and around Aleppo on Thursday. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of local activists, put the death toll at 25. At least 70 people were killed in northern Syria on Tuesday and Wednesday. Russia says it is not bombing Aleppo as part of the offensive announced this week, but is instead targeting insurgents in Idlib and the central Homs province. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to reporters at an economic summit in Lima, Peru portrayed Russia's airstrikes as limited and only targeting Islamic State fighters fleeing the Iraqi city of Mosul and attempting to cross into Syria. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the strikes targeting al-Qaida took place in Idlib on Tuesday, and were launched from Russia's only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, which recently deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. He said three leading members of the al-Qaida-linked Fatah al-Sham Front -- Muhammad Helala, Abu Jaber Harmuja and Abul Baha al-Asfari -- were among those killed. He said al-Asfari had overseen the group's attempts to break the siege of Aleppo. Al-Asfari had led a moderate rebel group in 2013, and it was not clear if or when he joined the al-Qaida-linked group. An opposition media group known as All4Syria reported that the two other named militants were killed Tuesday in an airstrike in the village of Kfar Jalis, in the Idlib countryside, that also killed six civilians. The Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said the airstrike on the jihadi stronghold killed six leading militants, without identifying them. The same village was struck Thursday, the Observatory said, killing six civilians from the same family. The Russian Defense Ministry said long-range bombers dispatched from Russia fired cruise missiles at Islamic State and al-Qaida targets in Syria during a 7,000-mile (11,000-kilometer) flight. It said fighter jets from the carrier and an air base in Syria also took part in the strikes. It did not say where the strikes took place, but said they destroyed command facilities, ammunition depots and weapons factories. Months of negotiations between the U.S. and Russia failed to cement a long-term cease-fire in Aleppo, which has become the focus of the war between Syrian President Bashar Assad and rebels fighting to topple him. Al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate is fighting alongside the rebels, but the Islamic State group has no presence in Aleppo. ___ Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov and Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed.

The Democratic Party should be so lucky.  There is much unpleasant reality for Democrats to deal with right now, starting with this: The GOP controls virtually everything. The two-party system is, at best, one and a half. Republicans won the presidency. They retained control of both houses of Congress. Soon, when Donald Trump appoints a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, they will re-establish a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. As far as the federal government is concerned, that's the whole trifecta. But there's much more: After making significant gains last week, Republicans control both legislative chambers in 32 states -- and hold the governorships in 33. Some of the nation's most diverse and populous states, including Texas and Florida, are living under one-party Republican rule. Democrats should reject the urge to take comfort in favorable demographic trends. It is true that within a generation, minorities will be in the majority -- and that minorities tend to vote for Democrats. But what would the country be like after 20 or 30 years of near-total Republican control? I'm sure most progressives would join me in not wanting to run that dangerous experiment.     President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it's ""healthy"" for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. ""When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,"" Obama said. (The Washington Post)   Did Democrats lose the White House because their presidential candidate had baggage and was not perfect in every way? Come on, the Republicans nominated Trump, for heaven's sake, a man who bragged about grabbing women by the genitals. I don't have nearly enough space to list all the ways in which he disqualified himself. Yet he won. The Republican Party is so splintered -- the establishment, the tea party wing, the fiscal tightwads, the defense hawks, the social conservatives, the libertarians and now the Trumpistas -- that sometimes I think of it as Afghanistan: with each faction having its own warlords and grievances and goals. Many of the demands they make upon Trump, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) will be uncompromisingly extreme and mutually exclusive. There will be blood (metaphorically, of course). Yet if Democrats expect to sit back and watch the GOP self-destruct, I fear they will be disappointed. Consider this fact: The Republican Party not only survived the Trump candidacy, but also prospered. Why would the same not be true of a Trump presidency? One of the biggest lessons I draw from the election is that the GOP basically came together behind its candidate. Despite all the Never Trump noise, most prominent Republican officials eventually fell in line. Some voiced strong reservations but said they would vote for him anyway, which amounted to an endorsement. Others, such as the Bush family, declined to publicly proclaim their opposition in a way that perhaps might have made a difference. Maybe they thought he was bound to lose anyway; if so, they miscalculated. Another lesson, perhaps the most important one, is that the Democratic Party cannot hope to succeed by relying solely on its ability to win the popular vote in presidential elections.  Democrats have won the popular vote in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012 and now 2016. That's six out of the past seven presidential contests. Yet the Republican Party is running the country, or at least most of it. The Democratic Party cannot just wait for the next Barack Obama to come along. The president is a unique political talent of the kind that appears only once in a great while, when the stars magically align. Instead, Democrats need to do what Republicans did, which is to build from the ground up and start winning state and local elections. A Democratic rebound has to begin with the basics: getting people who agree with you to vote. Less than 60 percent of those eligible to cast ballots in last week's election bothered to do so. Conservatives who say this is ""a center-right nation"" may be right in terms of who votes, but they're wrong in terms of who could vote. Polls show that the country favors Democratic over Republican positions on most issues. The Democratic Party should put its energy and money into connecting with potential voters at the grass-roots level. Trump made a bunch of pie-in-the-sky promises he can never keep. Democrats need a hopeful but realistic message recognizing that while most big cities prosper in today's globalized economy, much of the rest of the country suffers. Democrats will win when theirs is the ""big tent"" party. Right now, though, the GOP circus is in town.

One new citizen still sees America as the land of hope.	" NEW YORK Much of the political commentary over this past week has been bleak and despairing for the future of our fragile republic. It has assumed the worst about Americans' true character, our dedication to inclusiveness and diversity, and our ability to rein in our ugliest instincts. America has abandoned its values, we pundits fret in unison. Iraqi-born immigrant Omar al-Khattab doesn't buy it. On Tuesday night, with a full heart and an open mind, al-Khattab recited the oath of allegiance to the United States. He became a newly minted U.S. citizen exactly one week to the day after Americans elected a president who said Muslim immigrants like himself don't belong here. Al-Khattab was joined by 14 other immigrants at a naturalization ceremony at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum . The museum, dedicated to telling the stories of generations of American immigrants, hosts this event every year; this year's proceedings, though, took on a new sense of urgency and hopefulness.  As despondent native-born Americans muse about ditching their country for greener, Donald Trump-free pastures in Canada or New Zealand, these 15 immigrants instead pledged their commitment to stay and fight for the nation's most fundamental values.  These emigres swore -- as no native-born American is ever legally required to do as a condition of their own citizenship -- to ""support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic."" Al-Khattab, 37, may have recited this oath aloud for the first time on Tuesday. But he has been walking the walk for years.  As a child, he was enamored of American culture. He taught himself English by watching Robert De Niro films and listening to Michael Jackson songs.  And as an adult, he repeatedly risked his life for Americans.  Al-Khattab is a surgeon by training. While working in an Iraqi hospital, he began liaising with local American hospitals and eventually became an interpreter for the U.S. Air Force.  ""Yes, I worked several missions in the field,"" he says. ""They were very, very risky, and exposed me to almost assassination."" Six years ago, he came to the United States on a special immigrant visa for Iraqi and Afghan interpreters. (The United States has pledged to help the 50,000 interpreters who heroically aided U.S. forces, but we have actually brought over shamefully small numbers of them.) He says his parents remain in Iraq and have been seeking refugee status.  Today al-Khattab works as a patient coordinator at New York-Presbyterian hospital while he studies for his medical licensure exams. He ultimately plans to redo his residency and practice as a doctor once again. His new citizenship status offers him some additional legal protections, of course (well, maybe). More generally, though, he mostly shrugged off concerns about recent displays of anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment. Including those from our new president-elect.   What matters are America's enduring institutions and legacies, al-Khattab says. ""The fear we are seeing is basically fear of the unknown,"" he says, arguing that everyone has been unfairly ""prejudging"" Trump. If given the chance, al-Khattab says, he would have voted for Hillary Clinton, but he trusts that the candidate who won instead will take his new responsibilities seriously. ""The guy has not even been in the White House yet. He speaks strongly. He has. But remember his job entitles him to be the protector of the U.S. Constitution, no matter what,"" al-Khattab says. He notes that the United States has always been ""a temple of immigrants"": ""It's the Constitution and the values you look at. It's the values of the country as a whole, not what a person says or not."" But what of Trump's proposed Muslim immigrant ban, or the outbreak of anti-Muslim hate crimes? ""If you survive Iraq, you will survive anything,"" he says with a smile. He believes that journalists have been irresponsible in our portrayals both of Muslims and those who might fear Muslims. (Although a brand-new citizen, al-Khattab has already adopted Americans' favorite pastime: media criticism.) Everyone he has come into contact with here in the United States has been kind and good to him, he says.  ""I come from a country where fear from the other is tearing it apart right now,"" he says, suggesting that Americans must engage with fellow citizens motivated by fear as well. ""When somebody tries to impose that on me, I have to please understand where is he coming from. He probably doesn't know who I am as a person, but once he knows who I am, I'm sure his attitude will definitely change."" Welcome (more permanently) to the United States of America, Dr. al-Khattab. For your sake, and all of ours, may your countrymen be everything you believe us to be.   Read more here:   Fred Hiatt: Here's the America Trump doesn't get   The Post's View: America the punitive?

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced the hiring of Art Acevedo, who had headed Austin's police force for nearly a decade, at a news conference Thursday afternoon. He fills a post vacated by the February retirement of Charles McClelland. Martha Montalvo had served as interim chief since then. Acevedo said his priorities as new chief will include meeting with members of his department along with local residents and community leaders to get their ideas on how to improve the agency.  ""I am very happy to be here in the city of Houston. The only person who needs to fear the police is the criminal,"" Acevedo said, briefly speaking in Spanish. Turner said he chose Acevedo for the job in part because the police chief values balancing law enforcement along with maintaining good community relations. Acevedo's tenure in Austin was marked by efforts to strengthen ties with community groups. He has been an active user of Twitter, tweeting about community events and his support of police officers.  ""Folks are quick to critique when officers fall short and they should, but we also need to lift up and acknowledge good policing,"" Acevedo tweeted on Nov. 12. But Acevedo has also faced recent criticism from some community leaders and police commanders over several use-of-force incidents, including the 2015 arrest of a black teacher who was thrown to the ground by a white officer and the February fatal shooting of an unarmed, naked 17-year-old. After the February fatal shooting, Acevedo was criticized by the police union after speaking about the shooting at a news conference while standing with groups such as Black Lives Matter. In a survey released earlier this year by the Austin Police Association , 52 percent of officers thought morale within the department was poor and 42 percent of officers said they didn't think Acevedo could effectively lead the department in the future. Acevedo will take over a police department -- with about 5,000 officers -- that has been criticized by some Houston community leaders and activists over the agency's recurring issues with use of deadly force. Nearly every officer-involved shooting in Houston for more than a decade has been deemed justified by the law enforcement agency.  ""We feel that the police department needs to be reviewed very carefully. We look forward to meeting the new chief and seeing what inroads we can make,"" said Johnny Mata, a longtime activist with the Greater Houston Coalition for Justice. Turner also announced on Thursday that Samuel Pena, the fire chief in El Paso, has been hired to lead the Houston Fire Department. ___ Follow Juan A.

He never left.	"   Shaun Alexander tapes a podcast in Washington this week. (By Dan Steinberg / The Washington Post)  Shaun Alexander's revelation came in a suburban Virginia supermarket. It was the winter of 2008. The veteran running back's four-game, 11-carry stint with the Redskins had fizzled out without much fanfare. His growing family had  relocated from Seattle to the D.C. area, and was now waiting to see whether Alexander's pro football career would resume. On this day, out-of-town relatives stayed home with the kids, while Alexander and his wife went out shopping for groceries. And as they filled their cart, something remarkable happened: nothing. No stares. No conversations. No autograph requests. ""This is kind of weird, you know?"" Alexander told his wife. ""Do you like this feeling?"" ""Oh, you already know I do,"" Valerie responded. This area is littered with ex-Redskins, men who stayed in Washington to trade on their continued popularity, their name recognition and local fame. Alexander's case is the opposite: He stayed here despite amassing almost no on-field capital, and he stayed precisely because no one much cared who he was. He's still a folk hero at Alabama, a celebrity in Seattle, where he won an NFL MVP award and earned the biggest running back contract in league history to that point. In Washington, he gained 24 yards -- a fraction of what undrafted rookie Rob Kelley recorded in his recent starting debut. And then he never left. ""What am I doing in D.C.?"" Alexander, 39, asked with long laugh this week. ""It doesn't quite make sense for me not to be in Seattle, where I'm so loved; or to be in Alabama, where I'm so loved; or to be in my hometown of Florence, Kentucky; or to be in Cincinnati, where I'm so loved. That doesn't make sense. But I felt like when I got here, that in a weird kind of way, I was supposed to be here.""    Shaun Alexander gets a carry against the Lions in 2008. (Washington Post file photo)  To understand that feeling, you'd have to understand what came before it. When Alexander was setting high school records in Florence -- where he had the 10th-best rushing season in national prep history and scored 110 career touchdowns -- he was followed around by ESPN cameras, offered free meals at mom-and-pop restaurants and honored with a jersey retirement ceremony the day he committed to Alabama. In Tuscaloosa, he wanted to get ""BAMA 37'' on his license plate, until a DMV employee warned him that fans would start following him home. As a sophomore, a senior citizen told him that if the Tide beat Auburn that season, ""I'll die a happy woman."" ""I'm 19 years old, you know what I mean?"" Alexander said. ""Why does your life depend on what a 19-year-old does?"" Seattle became just as crazy. He made three Pro Bowls, became the team's career leading rusher, and had that bananas 2005 campaign, when he scored an NFL-record 28 touchdowns, ran for a franchise-record 1,880 yards, and led the Seahawks to their first Super Bowl. He saw kids in tears if he didn't give them an autograph. He saw strangers follow him and his wife to their house. ""I mean, my face was on billboards,"" he said. ""I remember walking through crowds and seeing kids overwhelmingly just crying out of control. And so for me, I was like 'Oh my goodness, that's a little much.' That kind of passion, I'm thankful for. But it's a lot."" Then, after years of being underpaid, he signed that blockbuster eight-year contract: $62 million, with more than $15 million guaranteed. Right away, the injuries started, and the fallout began. There was a broken foot at the beginning of 2006. A broken wrist the next year that had to be realigned after every game, leading to complications in his back and his hips: ""the worst pain I ever had,"" he called it. His production dipped. The home fans booed him. The Seahawks released him before the 2008 season, and he left feeling bitter about the end. Midway through the next season, the Redskins -- whose offense then was run by a couple ex-Seattle men in Jim Zorn and Stump Mitchell -- signed Alexander to be their third back, behind Clinton Portis and Ladell Betts. He was barely used, and in Washington's late-November trip to Seattle, he never touched the ball. When the Redskins needed a roster spot later that week, they let Alexander go, telling him they might eventually want him back. The Redskins were 7-4 at the time, and Alexander figured ""they'll let me rip this thing up in the playoffs; they ain't silly,  you know?"" But the Redskins didn't make the playoffs, and they didn't ask him back. With his career over, Alexander turned introspective. At that point, he figured, he had been a celebrity for more than half of his 31 years. He also had seen the statistics about how many NFL players wind up broke, or divorced, or depressed after they leave the league. And he was unsure what his identity was, if it wasn't Star Football Player. ""You're like, 'Why am I talking about myself so much,' and then you realize 'Oh, it's because everybody always wants to talk about me.' They always say you talk about what you love the most, and then you're like 'Wait a minute, do I really just love me that much?' "" Alexander remembered thinking. ""I needed to sit still and kind of really reflect: Who am I and what am I doing? So thank God I made enough money to be able to do that.""    Shaun Alexander moved to Washington in 2008, and never left. (By Dan Steinberg / The Washington Post)  Over the next few years, Alexander traveled around the country with some younger players he had mentored. He spoke to men's groups and churches. He wrote a book about his faith. He slipped into Washington culture and the political scene, becoming friendly with leaders from both parties: Republicans such as Rick Santorum and Ben Carson, Obama Administration officials such as Eugene Schneeberg and Joshua DuBois. He became involved with the National Prayer Breakfast and the National Day of Prayer. He also put down roots in the area. His family moved from its Ashburn rental, buying a home in Great Falls. He and his wife got involved in the active Northern Virginia home schooling movement. Their family kept growing -- they now have eight kids, ages 1 through 13 -- and Alexander spent much of his time teaching the older children. Eventually they bought a farmhouse near Leesburg. Alexander now wakes up to horses in his backyard. He hears stories from his kids about the chickens they've fed. He continued to mentor younger NFL players such as Alfred Morris, the former Redskins back, who stored his belongings in Alexander's house after he signed with Dallas. He reconciled with the Seahawks and now is a regular at both Seahawks and Alabama games, but his  faith told him not to wonder what he was doing in Northern Virginia; that life has seasons. One season you're a superstar in Seattle. The next season you're living on a farm in Loudoun County, slapping hands with the occasional fan who wants to relive your fantasy football exploits, but who doesn't need anything from you in order to die happy. ""Home is where you want it to be, you know what I mean, and so I've made it home,"" Alexander said. ""There's just good stuff I like about it here,  and this is where I want to be. And so does it feel like home [where] I can go down the street and get mom's cooking? No, she's in Kentucky. Can I run down and see some college buddies that moved to Birmingham? No, they're in Birmingham. Can I walk out there to the Seahawks facility and go watch them practice because I just want to take my boys to go watch the Seahawks? I can't do that; they're in Seattle. But home is home."" In recent years, Alexander has gotten more interested in venturing out into the public. He's speaking to church and men's groups more frequently, and he recently started a podcast about football and faith, called Finish the Game. (He's had conversations with the Christian group Focus on the Family about partnering on the show.) The latest episode, taped at WFED's studio in Northwest D.C., veered from the Alabama-LSU game to the problems of sex trafficking to the panicked reaction some of his friends were having after Donald Trump's election. ""This is still America; we're the greatest country in the world,"" Alexander said. ""America, I just challenge you all: Whether you voted for Hillary Clinton or whether you voted for Donald Trump, we can all disagree inside the house, but the rest of the world needs to know that we are fully together, all of us. ... And our job now is to actually make America great again."" After the episode, we sat around and talked: about football, about his health, about politics, about our families, about how he could have grappled with his post-football identity in Boise, or Omaha, or Scranton, but how he he figured he might as well just do it here. Then he zipped up his backpack and headed back to Loudoun County. His family has big news to announce this weekend. A ninth child is on the way."

Keith Ellison. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)  Late Tuesday night, Democrats had one name to explain their defeat: James B. Comey. By Thursday, many had another to describe their comeback strategy: Keith Ellison. Ellison is a five-term congressman from Minnesota, and for a growing number of influential progressives, he's the answer to Democrats' failure to beat Donald Trump. Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) have all floated Ellison's name to be chair of the Democratic National Committee -- a normally behind-the-scenes strategic position they want him to make more public. (More on that below.) So let's learn more about Ellison and why some Democrats think this relatively obscure congressman is their best answer to Trump. The basics: Ellison was elected a decade ago to Minnesota's 5th District, which includes heavily Democratic Minneapolis. Since coming to Congress, he's been a reliably liberal Democratic vote -- he's campaigned on his opposition to the Iraq War and his support for universal health care, and he's been a vocal opponent of voter ID laws. He's no Donald Trump: Ellison's biography could not be more of a stark contrast to the most controversial elements of Trump's message. He's the first Muslim to be elected to Congress and one of only two serving in the House. When Ellison was sworn in for the first time in 2007, he made national news for taking his ceremonial oath with a Koran -- one once owned by Thomas Jefferson, which he borrowed from the Library of Congress. Since then, he's been frequently called on to be a spokesman for his faith. (Ellison was raised Catholic, but converted to Islam in college.)    A Koran and prayer beads lay in a prominent spot on Ellison's desk. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)  He was also the first black person to be elected to Minnesota's congressional delegation. And he's from the Midwest, a region where Tump snuck up on Hillary Clinton. (Minnesota voted for Clinton, but for a state that hasn't voted for a Republican since 1972, it was surprisingly close: President Obama won the state in 2012 by nearly 8 percentage points. Clinton won it by 1.5 points.) He's got progressive cred: Ellison is co-chair of the Progressive Caucus in the House, and he backed Sanders during the primary. The Sanders and Warren wing is currently the loudest liberal voice speaking out after the election. Both are having an ""I-told-you-so"" moment with the Democratic Party, saying it should have focused on a more populist message if it wanted to reach the white working class voters that broke for Trump in higher-than-expected numbers.      Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered an emotional speech to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations on Nov. 10, promising to fight against a Republican-controlled Congress. (AFL-CIO)   Ellison, say liberals, is someone they trust to make the progressive wing of the party more mainstream. ""There's a big challenge that people feeling really jilted by a party that tried to stop the nomination process before it began,"" said Neil Sroka with the progressive Democracy for America. ""He would be really helpful for that."" But some moderates are skeptical that turning the party to the left will solve the Democrats' problems. ""It didn't matter what type of Democrat you were on Tuesday,"" said Jim Kessler with the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way. ""You were defeated. ... every element of the party has to look in the mirror and reassess, and say 'What can we do better?' "" He can handle the cable news circuit: Ellison has a reputation as a level-headed politician who won't shy away from a political fight or controversy. Perhaps the most famous example of this came right after his 2006 election. Conservative commentator Glenn Beck, then at CNN, asked Ellison if he could be politically incorrect for a second, then demanded to know: ""Sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies?"" Ellison, without getting flustered, replied: ""Well, let me tell you, the people of the 5th Congressional District know that I have a deep love and affection for my country. There's no one who is more patriotic than I am. And so, you know, I don't need to -- need to prove my patriotic stripes."" The media coverage from that conversation was largely favorable to Ellison. Beck later said it was ""quite possibly the poorest-worded question of all time."" As the Huntington Post pointed out, doing battle with conservatives on TV could be one of the most effective ways for Democrats to reach voters and reshape their party, since there are fewer of them in office to do it the traditional way. Democrats have the fewest seats at every level of governance since the Reconstruction Era. Which brings me to my next point: He could shake up what the DNC does.  At the heart of Ellison's sudden popularity among progressives is the opportunity to fundamentally reshape the role of the DNC. Think of the office of DNC chair as it exists right now as like the chief operating officer of a company -- someone focused on logistics like fundraising and coordination to help the party, while the top Democrat in power is like the chief executive -- the person providing the vision. But the current formula, progressive Democrats say, is largely broken. Democrats were so badly decimated on Tuesday they are a leaderless party. So why not let this official position become the visionary leader of the party. The chair could focus less on fundraising -- if people are excited about the party they'll donate anyway, Sanders argued -- and more about giving the nation a solution to its economic anxiety. Ellison's colleague in the progressive committee endorsed that idea in an interview with The Post's John Wagner: ""They have to be advocates, and not just conduits,"" said Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.). ""The DNC should be both an organizing tool and an advocacy tool."" Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the percentage Obama won Minnesota by in 2012. He won it by nearly 8 points. "

A statement Friday said the eight were detained in three cities with help from the European Union police agency Europol and law enforcement agencies in Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia and Italy. Kosovo police allege the gang smuggled 35 ethnic Albanian minors mostly to Italy. The statement says smugglers were paid 3,000-3,500 Euros ($3,370-3,930) per person. In recent years, Kosovo has been among the main countries of origin for migrants to western European countries, especially Germany. ___ 3:45 p.m. Spanish police say more than 100 people have been arrested in a pan-European operation against a criminal organization suspected of trying to smuggle some 6,000 Ukrainians into Britain and Ireland. A statement Friday said 56 Ukrainians with false identity documents were among those arrested at more than a dozen Spanish airports. Police could not say when the arrests took place. Police in France, Belgium, Ukraine and Poland also arrested some 50 people, including several alleged gang leaders. Spanish police arrested one leader in March in Barcelona and seized more than 100 ID cards and Polish passports. European Union police agency Europol, which helped coordinate the operations, says migrants were offered complete packages, including ID documents, plane tickets and accommodation. They entered Poland first and then traveled on to other countries. ___ 2:50 p.m. More than 100 migrants have staged a protest in Serbia to demand access to European Union countries that have closed their doors to them. The demonstrators gathered Friday in a Belgrade park carrying banners reading, ""Open Borders"" and ""No More War."" Thousands of migrants have been stuck in Serbia for months after the Balkan country's EU neighbors beefed up border controls to keep migrants out. While most migrants in Serbia are staying in asylum centers, hundreds of men have been camping in parks or abandoned warehouses in Belgrade seeking ways to cross illegally into Hungary or Croatia. Serbian authorities recently instructed aid groups to stop delivering food outside migrant centers in hopes of getting the men off the streets. ___ Lithuanian officials say 35 Syrian refugees, relocated in the Baltic nation under a European Union plan to distribute 160,000 refugees across the bloc, have left in search of a better life elsewhere in Europe. Robertas Mikulenas, head of Rukla refugee reception center in Lithuania, says a group of 16 adults and 19 children left Monday, likely for Germany. Mikulenas said Friday they are ""free to leave,"" adding they could lose benefits in Lithuania if they do not come back within a month. Syrian Mohammed Ali Abdula earlier told the LNK channel they thought Lithuania was ""like Germany and Sweden"" but after discovering that wasn't the case, ""it became obvious we do not want to stay."" Abdula cited ""the size of relief and integration process"" for his family's departure. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Colin E. Braley)  COLUMBUS, Ohio -- At the end of a week in which United States men's national soccer team players have skilfully sidestepped daily questions on the presidential election and its possible impact on Friday night's game with Mexico, midfielder Alejandro Bedoya decided to say something of substance. Throughout their days of preparation in Columbus, the American players had avoided saying anything which might make headlines. Captain Michael Bradley had spoken like a true leader with his message to the fans in Columbus to bring their passion to the rivalry game but to show respect to the Mexican fans. I intend no criticism of the players who chose to state their lack of interest in talking about politics. It is not their job to talk about the election if they don't wish, and because games against Mexico are always heated affairs, there was some common sense in avoiding potentially sensational headlines, further stirring up emotions in the wake of Donald Trump's victory. But Bedoya, who was born in Florida and has Colombian heritage, thinks about politics and discusses issues in an articulate fashion, and it wasn't a surprise when he was the player who decided to open up a little more on his thoughts. ""This Columbus crowd has always been a good pro-American crowd and is the reason why we play these games here,"" he said. ""The atmosphere is awesome and one of kind, and that is what people will bring here and hopefully nothing else. There is no need for negative chants from either side. People want to politicize this game, but I don't think there is a need for that. ""But the one thing that I am very proud about is to be part of the U.S. national team and the diversity that you see on this team. This a true representation of what America is all about. The diversity on this team is a truly awesome thing"".   [The heart of the U.S. vs. Mexico soccer rivalry beats in the American heartland]   Coached by a German Juergen Klinsmann, the U.S. men's national team features players from a multitude of ethnic backgrounds. Defenders Omar Gonzalez and Michael Orozco are both Californians from Mexican-American families, who play for clubs in the Mexican league. Backup goalkeeper William Yarbrough was born in Mexico to American missionary parents. Jermaine Jones, Fabian Johnson, John Brooks, Julian Green and Timothy Chandler are all from mixed German and African-American parentage and grew up in Germany.  Starting forward Jozy Altidore is from a Haitian-American family, and his strike partner Bobby Wood was born in Hawaii of Japanese-American and African-American heritage. DeAndre Yedlin plays in England and is probably the most diverse individual player being of Latvian-Jewish, African-American, Native American and Dominican descent. Striker Aron Johannsson has perhaps the most unusual combination: He was born in Alabama to Icelandic parents. Young defender Cameron Carter-Vickers was born in raised in England but has an American father, a former NBA player. Lyndon Gooch was born in California to a British father and Irish mother. Talented midfielder Christian Pulisic has a Croatian background while Californian Sacha Kljestan's father is a Bosnian-Serb and goalkeeper Tim Howard's mother is Hungarian. Surely no team in any sport in the U.S. is more diverse, and likely no national soccer team anywhere in the world has a greater mix of backgrounds. And the impressive thing? No one cares. It is almost never an issue.  Apart from the comments from former women's team striker Abby Wambach about ""foreign guys"" on the team and whether they have the ""killer instinct"" and former national team coach Bruce Arena saying national team players should be ""Americans"" rather than foreign-born, the diversity of the team is rarely discussed. Of course, Arena misses the point that all those players are Americans; the rules of the international game wouldn't allow them to play for the U.S unless they were. Some had the opportunity to play for other countries, but all chose the United States. As far as Klinsmann, his players and the overwhelming majority of soccer fans, that is all that counts. They chose to be Americans and one of the beautiful things about this country, as opposed to some ethnic-national states, is that you can become an American.   [Viewing guide for this weekend's World Cup qualifiers]   Soccer has always been a sport with a strong connection to immigrants in this country. From the early days of German, Hungarian, Italian and Polish clubs in New Jersey and New York, to the Copa Latina tournament in South Florida and the Mexican-American teams in Texas, the game's grassroots have often been connected to the immigrant experience. For decades, soccer was a way that immigrants kept a connection to the cultures of their birth countries while becoming Americans. Now soccer has become a way that Americans can be part of a global community, a worldwide obsession, sharing the interest and passion of soccer fans worldwide. Bedoya's comment, though, surely had a more pointed aim than just acknowledging this history. Like Americans in diverse workplaces, ethnically mixed families, and multicultural communities across this country -- the U.S national team players get along, get on with the job, get on with life, share the joy and the pain of sport without their or their parents' background being an issue. It is a refreshing reminder from Bedoya after a week in which we have heard so much about division, tensions and fears.  Ohio was one of the rust-belt states that swung behind Trump in Tuesday's vote, and given his inflammatory rhetoric about illegal immigrants from Mexico, some have wondered if the atmosphere tonight in Mapfre Stadium will have a hostility that goes beyond sporting rivalry. The American players have made it clear they want none of that and expect only sporting passion. Given the culture of the majority of soccer fans in this country, unpleasant incidents seem unlikely even if they cannot be ruled out. But surely, as Bedoya suggests, soccer in this country is better than that."
