Anmarie Calgaro is also suing the 17-year-old's doctors and public health and school officials in the lawsuit filed in Minneapolis federal court Wednesday. Calgaro says in the lawsuit that her child has been treated at a Minneapolis health clinic and given medication for transgender issues without her consent. Calgaro says the St. Louis County school district, where the teen is a student, has taken away her parental rights and refused to release records to her. The lawsuit includes a copy of a letter of emancipation the teen obtained from a lawyer, but notes that the letter doesn't constitute a court order. Calgaro is asking the court to halt all medical services. Both the clinic and the school district declined comment. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Putin, speaking to top military leaders at his residence in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, said that Russia, like other nations, is working on state-of-the art arms technologies, including laser, hypersonic and robotic weapons. Special attention is given to the development of so-called weapons on new physical principles that allow selective, pinpoint impact on critically important elements of the enemy weapons and infrastructure facilities,"" Putin said at a meeting, which wrapped up a weeklong series of consultations on military modernization and arms industries. He didn't mention specific weapons programs, but military officials have said Russia is developing new warheads for its ballistic missiles, which would be capable of making sharp maneuvers on their way to the target to dodge enemy defenses. The military also has been working on air-based laser weapons. The Kremlin continued a sweeping military modernization drive even as Russia's economy entered a recession.  ""We will do all necessary to ensure a strategic balance,"" Putin said. ""We believe that attempts to upset it are extremely dangerous. The strategic balance, which took shape in the late 1940s and the 1950s, has allowed the world to avoid large-scale military conflicts."" Russia's relations with the United States and its allies have plunged to their lowest point since Cold War times amid the Ukrainian crisis and tensions over Syria. Without naming the United States, Putin vowed to fend off threats posed by NATO's U.S.-led missile defense system and the U.S. efforts to develop Prompt Global Strike -- prospective weapons systems that would be capable of delivering a precision strike anywhere in the world within one hour.  ""Our task is to efficiently neutralize any military threats to Russia, including those connected to the strategic missile defense, the implementation of the global strike concept and information wars,"" Putin said.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/18e4a0fe-a634-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	Long lines, machine snags — but major voting problems scant	" WASHINGTON -- Election Day came and went with no obvious signs of the catastrophic problems some had feared, including large-scale fraud, intimidation or hacking. Voters across the country instead encountered the types of glitches that arise in every election -- long lines, occasional broken machines, discrepancies in voting rolls and some hot tempers. The scattered problems included malfunctioning voting systems at polling stations in Texas, computer trouble in North Carolina that forced officials to rely on a paper check-in process and triggered long lines, and arguments and skirmishes between supporters of Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, including one reported to have involved pepper spray. There were reports in some states of voters waiting in line for hours to cast a ballot. Among them was Heather Merrick, who waited for hours to vote at a firehouse in Jersey City, New Jersey. She lamented that she didn't bring snacks.  ""I think that the energy and general vibe was really upbeat,"" said Merrick, 33, who was voting in New Jersey for the first time after moving from New York. ""I started to sense a little frustration once we got close enough to see the machines stuck in the line and it was moving so slowly."" Yet there were no immediate indications of any snags large enough to alter the vote count in any meaningful way.  ""The biggest surprise is how uneventful things have been with this large a turnout,"" said Illinois State Board of Elections spokesman Jim Tenuto. ""Everyone was expecting more problems than this -- and nothing."" The voting unfolded amid repeated but unsubstantiated claims from Trump that the election would somehow be rigged. His exhortations to followers to watch for fraud at the polls gave rise to fears of vigilantism and harassment. He continued to raise the specter of election fraud on Tuesday, telling Fox News, ""It's largely a rigged system."" He would not say whether he would accept the outcome of the election.  ""We're going to see how things play out today and hopefully they will play out well and hopefully we won't have to worry about it,"" he said. In Philadelphia, one of the places Trump had suggested were ripe for fraud, District Attorney Seth Williams said that as of the afternoon, there were no substantiated reports of voter fraud or intimidation, and ""no walking apocalypse of zombies voting around town."" State officials, meanwhile, had been working for weeks against any attempt by hackers to breach their computer systems. It was a particular concern given the U.S. intelligence community's assertion last month that the Russians had attempted through hacking to interfere with the electoral process. But there were no major reported problems. The federal government offered help to states looking to patch their networks to prevent intrusions. Cybersecurity experts said because of the nation's decentralized voting system, with people casting ballots in 9,000 jurisdictions and more than 185,000 precincts, it would be difficult for a hacker to have any sizable effect on the vote. ___ Associated Press writers Diana Heidgerd in Dallas; Ron Todt in Philadelphia; Michael Tarm in Chicago; and Desmond O.

But it's not clear whether the ire runs deep enough to affect local governments in our region. Answers will come Tuesday with results of ballot questions in each of the Washington area's three largest suburban counties. As voters decide whether to raise taxes (Fairfax), expand the County Council (Prince George's) or enact term limits (Montgomery), they will signal how much trust they retain in their elected officials. Robin Ficker, a well-known Montgomery anti-tax activist, said the sour mood was a big help in his latest attempt to force council members and the county executive to step down after three four-year terms (or two full terms and part of a third). ""People just realize that it's the same old, same old"" in government, Ficker said. ""They want some fresh ideas. They want something new. That's why I think term limits is going to pass this time."" Thomas E. Dernoga, a former Prince George's council member, made a similar point about his work against expanding the body from nine to 11 seats. He said he has personally spoken to ""at least"" 2,000 voters while canvassing and has heard lots of ""anti-incumbent, anti-establishment"" views. ""These are unhappy people,"" Dernoga said.  [Government-loving Montgomery seems poised to adopt term limits.]  Across the Potomac River, voicing the establishment perspective, Fairfax Board of Supervisors Chairman Sharon Bulova (D) worried that antigovernment sentiment would block adoption of a tax that is intended to bring in revenue to be used to raise teachers' salaries. ""This is probably the unhappiest, angriest presidential election that I ever remember,"" Bulova said. ""I hope that doesn't rub off when people are looking at [local] bond referendums and the question of a meals tax."" Here's a look at how public attitudes about government are playing out in each contest. Fairfax meals tax If Fairfax voters decide to add a 4 percent tax on restaurant meals and prepared foods, it would be the first time in memory that they endorsed a higher tax by direct, popular vote. They rejected a similar meals tax proposal in 1992. They also voted ""no"" in a 2002 referendum on increasing taxes to improve transportation. But supporters think residents might break with history because they care so much about protecting the county's renowned public schools. The measure is projected to raise nearly $100 million a year, with 70 percent legally required to go to education. If the outcome is ""yes,"" then the vote would mark another step in Fairfax's gradual shift to the left -- a change that has converted the former Republican stronghold to a Democratic bastion. ""I'm pleased to say that Virginia has become more blue,"" said Gloria Rubin, first vice president of the Fairfax County Federation of Teachers. ""People are willing to . . . vote for the meals tax to support the schools."" Opponents express confidence that voters are too sore about tax increases and wasteful spending to go along. A restaurant executive who has attended four community meetings to discuss the proposal said many people expressed resentment about it. ""In general, they're upset with the way the county spends money,"" said Claude Andersen, a vice president of Clyde's Restaurant Group, which owns two restaurants in Fairfax. ""They look at [the tax] as just another money grab that will go into a big hole somewhere.""  [In wealthy Northern Virginia, intense fight to sway voters on meals tax.]  Supervisor Pat Herrity (R-Springfield) faulted the Democratic-dominated board for seeking to raise taxes so soon after adopting a $100 million real estate tax increase, which took effect this year. ""It's really going to be a test of how many common-sense, fiscally conservative people are left in Fairfax,"" Herrity said. Prince George's council expansion (Question D) In Prince George's, most of the political establishment is supporting the proposal to add two at-large seats to the County Council. They say it would improve accountability, by pushing the body to focus more on what's best for the county as a whole. The current nine members are often faulted for concerning themselves only with the narrow interests of their own geographic districts. But opponents of expansion fear it's a devious effort to do away with term limits, which bar council members from serving more than two four-year terms. A ""yes"" vote on Question D would mean that current council members could run for the at-large seats when their eight years were up. The liberal group Progressive Maryland opposes ""the self-serving nature of what they're trying to do, trying to sneak things past the voters,"" said Executive Director Larry Stafford, a Prince George's resident. Critics also complained that it would cost about $1 million a year to pay for the salaries, staff and offices of two new council members. These objections disappoint supporters of expansion, who view themselves as reformers trying to improve the quality of Prince George's government.  [Prince George's revives old debate about adding at-large council seats.]  They think the council needs a mix of at-large and district representatives, similar to the model used in Montgomery and the District. They said the lack of at-large members gives Prince George's less clout than its neighbors on regional bodies such as the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. Former state delegate Justin Ross, a supporter, said: ""If Question D were to fail, it's because people are frustrated with county government. The irony is, that's the same reason people support it."" Montgomery term limits (Question B) While Prince George's is considering what many see as a way to weaken term limits, Montgomery will vote for the third time since 2000 on a Ficker-inspired proposal on whether to adopt them. Opponents say term limits are bad public policy, because they prevent voters from retaining effective legislators with institutional memory. ""They strip legislative bodies of their expertise and experience, which end up residing in the staff and lobbyists instead."" said Tom Moore, a former Rockville city council member who chairs the ""No on B"" committee. Critics are also trying to taint the bid by linking it to Ficker's reputation for repeatedly backing highly visible but unsuccessful anti-spending or anti-incumbent measures. They are highlighting Ficker's support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who is unpopular in Montgomery. ""The message we've taken is, we want to keep Trump-Ficker politics out of Montgomery county,"" Moore said. Ficker responded that term limits ""has nothing to do"" with Trump. He continued: ""Term limits is not about me. This is about the 18,000 people that signed our petition"" to put it on the ballot. Ficker said the public has turned against the council because of a nearly 9 percent property-tax increase the past spring, and a vote to raise council members' salaries to more than $130,000 by the end of 2017. He accused council members of taking steps to protect incumbents, such as setting primary election dates at inconvenient times to ensure low turnout. Noting that four of the nine current council members have served three full terms, he joked, ""The only turnover I've seen in Montgomery County is sold by Pepperidge Farm."" "
