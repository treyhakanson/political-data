And it should be. Throughout the election, Facebook's behavior has exposed what seems to be a great contradiction at its heart. As the social network has pushed hard to dominate new forms of media, it's also bent over backward to deny that it is a media company -- and denying that responsibility that comes with that label. The truth is that Facebook has already taken on one of the functions of a media company: to act as a gatekeeper. It has labeled satire. It takes down ""clickbait"" articles which, in its own words, have headlines that ""intentionally leave out crucial information, or mislead people."" Its algorithms clearly have some standards for content quality. But Facebook won't apply those standards to its fake news problem. In fact, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took to his own profile to explain why and to reject the much-discussed idea that false news articles on the network could have affected the election. (Zuckerberg said the same thing at a conference last week. But the idea has persisted so strongly that he decided to address it again.)   [Mark Zuckerberg denies that fake news on Facebook influenced the elections]   I don't know if we can lay credit or blame for this election's outcome at social media's doorstep. Finding that out would take a lot of research, an army of sociologists and access to a lot of to Facebook data I don't have. But what is troubling about Zuckerberg's post is his explanation for why Facebook isn't tagging or penalizing false news: ""Identifying the 'truth' is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves."" I agree it's not easy for Facebook to tackle this problem. Worries of a politicized Facebook have dogged its steps before. Those accusations are still haunting the network; Facebook in a statement Monday denied a Gizmodo article claiming it had a solution to its fake news problem but quashed it, fearing backlash from the right. It's true that Facebook alone shouldn't define what is the truth. But its prominence as a source of news gives it the responsibility to flag what is false.   [The truth about Facebook's 'war on click-bait']   In his post, Zuckerberg essentially falls back on an old excuse when the fake news issue comes up: that Facebook is just technology firm and a platform . . . an aggregator not up to the task of policing its users. That excuse started out thin, and is only getting thinner. Sure, social media companies may want to deny that they are in the content business. But they are in it -- and only getting deeper. Look at where these companies are investing: more photo-sharing, video, virtual reality. Those are all new media products that they say they need to survive. Yet Zuckerberg is sticking to his tech company script, denying responsibility for what is posted on Facebook -- even when it doesn't make sense. For example, to prove his point that fake news has little influence on Facebook, Zuckerberg pointed out that there isn't that much of it on the network. ""Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,"" Zuckerberg said in his post. ""Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other."" That may be true, but doesn't reflect how Facebook works. A piece of writing crafted to generate clicks, likes and shares, by design, gets outsized attention. Zuckerberg himself said in his post's comments that specific users may see more false content on their feeds depending on how they and their friends use the site. He also refuted the idea that slanted news could have on individual voters by citing Facebook's own research, which shows the network exposes people to a broader set of ideas. Here, again, the issue is more nuanced. Yes, a recent Pew Research Center study showed social media posts have changed some people's minds. But the same study showed that people often mute, block or otherwise filter out social media opinions they don't want to hear. ""We see people engaging in a broader range of viewpoints while simultaneously taking steps to avoid content that is against their views,"" said Aaron Smith, associate research director at Pew. ""If there's one consistency, it's that you can really see both sides of that coin depending on how you ask things."" And, Smith added, individuals don't control everything they see on Facebook -- Facebook's algorithms do. So, again, Facebook is the only one with the power to control what's on its site. And for a company that crows over its abilities to convince people to buy products, play games and even convince people to vote, it rings false for Facebook to reject the idea that its algorithms pick couldn't possibly influence those votes.   [Your political posts on social media are actually changing minds -- sometimes]   Facebook is not alone in wrestling with this problem. On Monday, the first Google result that appeared when searching for popular vote tallies linked to a false news report. That prompted both Google and Facebook to say they won't accept advertisements from fake news sites anymore -- a small step that won't address the larger problem, but at least makes an attempt. In my mind, killing fake news online is a shared responsibility. Social media users should, of course, be critical of the things they read. But Facebook and other social media sites aren't picking up their share of the work. Otherwise such obviously false information wouldn't score so well with those so-called neutral algorithms. And if these companies continue to push their media efforts, they can't then shy away from the responsibilities that come with the business. If quality and truth are what matter when it comes to content, that has to matter all of the time -- not just when it's uncontroversial."

As a media outlet interested in accuracy, The Washington Post has a version of the county-by-county map that is based on actual data. In reality, the county split in last week's election looked like this:     Still a lot of red, but you will notice on our map that large U.S. cities that always vote Democratic are clearly demarcated by their county boundaries. You will also notice that the counties are not all little blue squares as they are in Breitbart's map, because our map is a map of actual American counties and not a red map that someone took into Microsoft Paint to dapple with little squares to have a fake map for a completely made-up story about the results of the election. The ""someone"" who made Breitbart's map appears to be Michael Patrick Leahy, according to its caption. Leahy is also the author of the article, which is titled ""Donald Trump Won 7.5 Million Popular Vote Landslide in Heartland.""          1 of 8       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                       Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.    Caption   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.  Nov. 11, 2016  ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl interviews President-elect Donald Trump at his home in New York in his first post-election TV interview. Chris Albert/for CBS News/""60 Minutes"" via AP  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        For fun, let's evaluate Leahy's analysis of the election results. Donald Trump won an overwhelming 7.5 million popular vote victory in 3,084 of the country's 3,141 counties or county equivalents in America's heartland. There are a lot of weird qualifiers there. The Census Bureau tallies the number of counties and equivalents in the country at 3,142. I looked at data from 3,110 of them earlier today (lacking data from some counties). Hillary Clinton won 487 of them; Donald Trump won 2,623. But Clinton won a lot more counties with cities (as above) and so the current national vote total compiled by Cook Political's Dave Wasserman has Clinton leading by 1 million votes. (He estimates that lead will double.) That was the first sentence of Leahy's ""report."" Here's sentence two. Fifty-five point seven million out of the 109.3 million Americans who cast their ballots in those counties voted for Trump, while only 48.1 million voted for Hillary Clinton, according to the latest county by county election results reported at Politico. This suggests that Leahy is using some definition of ""heartland"" that both incorporates most of the country but also excludes places Clinton won. If you look only at counties that Trump won, Trump leads -- as you'd expect -- by over 17 million votes. But in counties she won, Clinton leads by more. Clinton gets 42.2 million votes in states that she lost and trails Trump by 1.9 million there. But in states she won she gets 19.7 million votes, leading Trump by 3 million. As it turns out, what Leahy's doing is simply taking 52 counties where Clinton did well and eliminating them from the equation. Those 52 ""elite"" counties are mostly those that clumsily dot their way across his map above. All of this is totally arbitrary, of course. Everything that isn't one of those ""elite"" counties is the ""heartland,"" an area that Leahy figures includes Long Island, Maine, Detroit and Charleston, S.C. You know. The heartland. But you will agree with me when I say that those aren't the elite counties. The elite counties in America are places like Tulsa County, Okla., Denton County, Texas and Cherokee County, Ga. In the 50 actual elite counties, Donald Trump won by 2.5 million votes. But in the heartland -- everywhere else -- Clinton won easily. And that's what really counts. The funniest line of Leahy's piece is this: It is worth noting that virtually all members of the mainstream media reside within this narrow band of elite coastal counties. His ""elite coastal communities"" include New York, Los Angeles, San Jose, Seattle, Washington, Baltimore, Boston and the coastal paradises of Sacramento and Chicago. In other words: Large cities where lots of people live. You know where else is a big city? Nashville, the 25th-largest city in the country, county seat of Davidson County, Tenn., which backed Clinton by 26 percentage points. Ugh! Elites! This is where Leahy lives, according to his Twitter profile. Mainstream media elite. You can slice and dice the numbers however you want. You can say Clinton won the popular vote if you want, which she did. You can say Trump won the electoral vote, which he did. You can say that Clinton won the all important counties-that-contain-the-letters-""folk"" vote, 812,000 to 535,000. (This is true.) Or, if you want, you can say that, save for the largest state in the country, which is home to one out of every eight people, Trump won the popular vote!   The ""excellent"" Electoral College: California alone accounts for Clinton's lead in the popular vote. https://t.co/TNT6htXpkj -- WSJ Editorial Page (@WSJopinion) November 15, 2016   Wow. Simply set aside millions of votes, and the outcome changes. And here people are saying Clinton won the popular vote! Shaking my head at those elite media folks in their coastal mansions. Leahy's map is bad. His argument is bad. The article is bad. Incidentally, Breitbart is a website that until August was led by Stephen K. Bannon, the man who will be one of the two most senior advisers to president-elect Donald Trump.      Here's what you need to know about the man who went from Breitbart News chairman to Donald Trump's campaign CEO before his appointment as chief White House strategist and senior counselor.

Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners and a subsidiary asked the court to let them lay pipe under a Missouri River reservoir, a plan the Standing Rock Sioux says threatens its drinking water and cultural sites. The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday it needs more time to study the impact of the plan. While President-elect Donald Trump, a pipeline supporter, likely would greenlight the project when he takes office in January, the company is trying to win federal approval -- or a court order -- to allow it to go forward now. The delay has already cost nearly $100 million, the company said in court documents, ""and further delay in the consideration of this case would add millions of dollars more each month in costs which cannot be recovered."" In a statement Tuesday, the company blamed the Obama administration for ""political interference"" in the pipeline review process. The Army Corps referred a request for comment to the Justice Department, which declined comment. Protests were being held Tuesday across the country, from California to Vermont. Activists called for demonstrations at Army Corps of Engineers offices and at banks financing the pipeline construction. Twenty-eight protesters were arrested near Mandan, North Dakota, after a group of about 400 protesters put a truck and tree branches on BNSF Railway tracks near a pipeline work staging area and tried to set it on fire, Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller said.  ""They had a rope soaked with kerosene,"" he said. ""A (Highway Patrol) trooper with an extinguisher doused it so it wouldn't light."" Trains were delayed three hours, railroad spokeswoman Amy McBeth said. Officers in riot gear used pepper spray and in one instance a stun gun against protesters who refused to leave. Mandan is about 50 miles north of a camp where hundreds of protesters have gathered in recent months to oppose the pipeline. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental attorney and president of the New York-based Waterkeeper Alliance, which seeks to protect watersheds worldwide, visited the camp Tuesday, speaking out against the arrests of protesters and a project he says will benefit billionaires and not the American people.  ""What they are doing here is a crime, an environmental crime, and there are real victims,"" he said. In Columbus, Ohio, police reported an activist blocked traffic by handcuffing himself under a vehicle at a downtown intersection. In Montpelier, Vermont, more than 100 people gathered outside a bank, chanting, singing songs and holding signs saying ""Water is Life"" and ""Standing With Standing Rock.""  ""It may seem hopeless, like David against Goliath, but we believe that if we're persistent and we recruit, that this movement will grow and hopefully these kinds of projects will stop,"" said protester Lee Shen of Thetford Center, Vermont. The Corps on Monday called for more study and input from the Standing Rock Sioux before it decides whether to allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The 1,200-mile pipeline that's to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois is largely complete except for that stretch, which will skirt the tribe's reservation. Gov. Jack Dalrymple said Tuesday that an additional delay ""does nothing but prolong and intensify the public safety issues imposed on Morton County and the state of North Dakota since the beginning of August,"" when protests against the pipeline broke out. In his statement, Dalrymple said a decision on the project easement ""is long overdue"" and that the pipeline would be safe. The Corps in July granted Energy Transfer Partners the permits needed for the project, but it said in September that further analysis was warranted, given the tribe's concerns. Its announcement Monday came amid speculation that federal officials were on the brink of approving the crossing. ETP last week began preparing equipment to bore under the river. ETP disputes that the pipeline would endanger the tribe, and CEO Kelcy Warren noted earlier that Army Assistant Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy had informed company officials and Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault that the Corps' previous permit decisions ""comported with legal requirements."" ETP contends that the Corps has no legal justification for the delay. ___ Associated Press writer Dave Kolpack contributed to this story from Fargo, North Dakota.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/205795c2-a610-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	Senate control up for grabs as Democrats seek majority	" WASHINGTON -- Republicans held onto their slim Senate majority, a stinging blow to Democrats in a night full of them. Democrats had been nearly certain of retaking control but saw their hopes fizzle as endangered GOP incumbents won in Missouri, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and even Democrat-friendly Wisconsin. GOP-held New Hampshire remained too close to call on Wednesday morning, but even if Democrats eked out a win there it would not make a difference. Republicans started the night with a 54-46 majority in the Senate and were on track to end up with at least 52 seats, presuming they win a December runoff in Louisiana, as expected. The outcome added to a debacle of a night for Democrats, who lost the presidency and faced being consigned to minority status on Capitol Hill for years to come. Republicans celebrated their wins, already looking ahead to midterms in 2018 when Democrats could see their numbers reduced even further with a group of red-state Senate Democrats on the ballot. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who will serve in that role next year under a President Trump, issued a statement congratulating the president-elect.  ""After eight years of the Obama administration, the American people have chosen a new direction for our nation. President-elect Trump has a significant opportunity to bring our nation together,"" McConnell said. ""It is my hope and intent that we succeed in the years ahead by working together with our colleagues across the aisle to strengthen our national and economic security."" As the night wore on, Democratic operatives struggled to explain why their optimistic assessments of retaking Senate control were so mistaken. Some blamed unexpected turnout by certain segments of white voters, or FBI Director James Comey's bombshell announcement that he was reviewing a new batch of emails connected with Democrat Hillary Clinton. In Pennsylvania, GOP Sen. Pat Toomey won a narrow victory for his second term over Democratic challenger Katie McGinty. It was a race Democrats expected to win going into the night -- and one that many Republicans felt nearly as sure they'd lose. The story was the same in Wisconsin, where GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, written off for months by his own party, won re-election against former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold in a rematch. In Missouri and North Carolina, where entrenched GOP incumbents Roy Blunt and Richard Burr faced unexpectedly strong challenges from Democrats, both prevailed in the end. Democrats did grab a Republican-held seat in Illinois, where GOP Sen. Mark Kirk lost to Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a double-amputee Iraq war vet. That stood as the one Democratic pickup. The other bright spot for Democrats was in Nevada, where Minority Leader Harry Reid's retirement after five terms created a vacancy and the one Democratic-held seat that was closely contested. Reid maneuvered to fill it with his hand-picked successor, Catherine Cortez Masto, Nevada's former attorney general who spoke often of her family's immigrant roots in a state with heavy Latino turnout. Cortez Masto will become the first Latina U.S. senator. She beat Republican Rep. Joe Heck, who struggled with sharing the ticket with Donald Trump, first endorsing and then un-endorsing Trump to the disgust of some GOP voters. Indeed the Senate races were shadowed every step of the way by the polarizing presidential race between Clinton and Trump. Yet in the end, Trump was apparently not the drag on GOP candidates widely anticipated. Republicans like Johnson who endorsed him and stuck with him won re-election, as did others like Pennsylvania's Toomey who never backed Trump until the very end. And so did a few like GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona who un-endorsed Trump after audio emerged of him boasting of groping women. McCain, at age 80, won his sixth term in quite possibly his final campaign. The 2008 GOP presidential nominee was re-elected without much difficulty despite early predictions of a competitive race, and struck a reflective note ahead of the outcome.  ""While as Yogi Berra said, 'I hate to make predictions, especially about the future,' I'm not sure how many more I have in me,"" McCain said. In Indiana, GOP Rep. Todd Young beat former Democratic senator and governor Evan Bayh, who mounted a much-ballyhooed comeback bid, but wilted under scrutiny. And in Florida, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio beat Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, giving Rubio a platform from which he could mount another bid for president in 2020. In New York, Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' leader-in-waiting for a new Congress, easily won re-election. But the results elsewhere meant he would be leading a Senate minority when he replaces Reid in the leader's role. Even though the GOP's renewed control of the Senate will be narrow, the advantages of being in the majority are significant. The controlling party holds the committee chairmanships, sets the legislative agenda and runs investigations. First up is likely to be a nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. ___ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Clinton appeared to have more paths to the prize as she sought to become the first woman elected president; Trump appeared to tighten the race in the campaign's final days. Both left multitudes of Americans dissatisfied with their choices. The struggle over whom to support was voiced by two voters in Independence, Missouri, after casting their ballots.  ""I had such a hard time, harder than I've ever had,"" said Joyce Dayhill, 59, a school bus driver who ""reluctantly"" voted for Trump. ""I just prayed on it as hard as I could and felt this was the right decision."" Said Clinton voter Richard Clevenger, 58: ""I think Trump's not stable. But I can't say there was really anything Hillary's shown me that made me feel like voting for her. But Trump just doesn't know what the hell he's doing, and he's surrounded by the Mickey Mouse Club."" Control of the Senate also hung in the balance on a night that was reshaping the political calculus in Washington, a dozen governors' offices and statehouses. VOTERS SAY... In preliminary surveys of voters leaving polling places, about 4 in 10 said the top quality they're looking for in a candidate is change. That outranks good judgment, the right experience and caring about people like you as the preferred qualities in a president. Just over half approve of the job President Barack Obama is doing. But a majority is still upset with the way the government is working. ___ CLINTON vs. TRUMP The two New Yorkers pounded each other relentlessly, each preaching that the other is wholly unqualified, as the race tightened in the final days after a persistent if elastic lead for Clinton, the Democrat, in preference polling. Those who dreamed of Bernie Sanders for the Democratic ticket or anyone but Trump for Republicans face their time of reckoning. Will they come home to their party or just stay home? Clinton, inheritor of Obama's vaunted campaign apparatus and a skillful (and well-financed) organizer in her own right, fielded an impressive professional and volunteer operation. She had big names on the stage, loads of people tracking down supporters and getting them to early-voting places, committed and well-heeled interest groups behind her and lots of money for sustained advertising. Trump's effort paled in comparison, seeming as unpolished and improvised as the candidate himself. What he had that she didn't were the pulse and the passion of huge crowds, day after day. To those in Trump country, no boastful, stomach-turning video about women, no ""lock-her-up"" insult from the stage, no toxic tweet in the wee hours, could peel them away from the man whose crudities only made him more authentic in their eyes. To many of the Republicans who didn't come to the rallies -- and to some of the lawmakers who faced the prospect of working with him in Washington -- he was a disaster, a Republican Titanic sailing alongside Clinton's Democratic Lusitania. To the country at large, and much of the world, he polarized, repelled, entertained, shocked and fascinated. Did that make Clinton less of a divisive figure? Not to the Republicans who are already itching to impeach her if she wins. __ WHAT TO WATCH Virginia could be a harbinger for the night. An early win for Clinton in that state bodes well for her; a contest that drags on until 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. EST could mean a good night for Trump. Results begin to come out when polls close at 7 p.m. in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. More waves come just after 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., when polls will have closed in 30 states and the District of Columbia. Trump and Clinton fought fiercely over Florida, a big prize. Trump also made an audacious play for Minnesota and scared Clinton in Michigan, which drew both the Democratic nominee and Obama on the campaign's final day. Republicans fretted about Utah, normally as GOP-friendly as can be. The state was courted by an independent who tapped anti-Trump sentiment among the state's many Mormons. ___ SENATE SUSPENSE The night's second big mystery is which party will control the Senate, now Republican-dominated. Democrats need to gain five seats to take an outright majority. If they gain only four -- and if Clinton is elected -- her vice president will be able to break 50-50 Senate ties. Indiana could give an early hint of where the night is going. Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Missouri and North Carolina could tip either way. Republican incumbents were in particular danger in Illinois and probably Wisconsin. The math made it tough for the GOP: Republicans had to defend 24 seats compared with only 10 for the Democrats. Some were in a tough spot -- risking rejection from anti-Trump Republican voters if they were too close to him and rejection from his core supporters if they pushed him away. Squirmy rhetoric ensued. ___ HOUSE HUNTING Barring a shocker, Republicans will keep control of the House. They populate that chamber in numbers not seen since the 1930s. The breakdown is 247-188 for the GOP, with three vacancies. GOP losses of 10 to 15 seats have been predicted by people in both parties. Notable names: Republican Liz Cheney is expected to win the Wyoming seat once held by her father, Dick Cheney. GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California, investigator of the Benghazi, Libya, episode and other Obama administration actions, could be upended. ___ SHE-NANIGANS/HE-NANIGANS? Trump pronounced in advance that the election is rigged, in what sounded like a hedge should he lose. He warned without evidence that Clinton partisans would commit fraud and prodded his supporters to watch for misdeeds at polling stations. The prospect of vigilante election monitoring and the anger seething behind that impulse raised concerns about confrontations Tuesday, especially if the result is close. ___ BALLOT BONANZA Voters in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada are deciding whether to legalize recreational marijuana use; Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota are weighing whether to do so for medical marijuana. Arizona, Colorado and Maine are deciding whether to raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020; Washington state is considering $13.50. The federal minimum is $7.25. Voters in several states may tighten controls on guns and ammunition. ___ SOME POLITICS IS LOCAL Of a dozen races for governor, at least seven appear competitive and most of those have Democrats on the hook. Republicans went into the campaign with 31 governorships, just one short of their historic high. And Republicans control more than two-thirds of statehouse chambers.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif's remarks came during the second day of his visit to Lebanon. On Monday, he met Lebanon's newly appointed President Michel Aoun, underscoring the ties between Iran and Aoun's Hezbollah-backed presidency. The Shiite militant group and predominantly Shiite Iran are close allies. Zarif said regional powers should help the Yemenis and the Syrians to reach an immediate cease-fire that would be followed by the start of a dialogue to end the catastrophes underway in both countries. Iran is a strong backer of Yemen's Shiite rebels known as Houthis and also Syrian President Bashar Assad. Saudi Arabia -- Iran's main regional rival -- backs the Yemeni government fighting the Houthis and insurgents trying to remove Assad from power.  ""We should admit that there is no military solution, neither for the Yemeni crisis nor for the Syrian crisis,"" Zarif said. ""We believe that continuing to use military methods in order to win the Yemeni and Syrian crises will only lead to more fighting and bloodshed."" Zarif also met on Tuesday with outgoing Prime Minister Tammam Salam, Saudi-backed Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Earlier, Zarif met with Hezbollah's leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. On Monday, Zarif said recent political developments in Lebanon can be the key to breaking the deadlock in wars in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Aoun's appointment by Lebanon's parliament broke a 29-month impasse that saw the country's two main political blocs, one backed by Saudi Arabia and the other by Iran, sabotaging 45 successive attempts to select a president.
