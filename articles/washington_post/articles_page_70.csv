(Toru Yamanaka/AFP via Getty Images)  TOKYO -- President-elect Donald Trump's surprise victory has left government officials around the world -- including here in Japan -- scrambling to make sense of the most uncertain moment in U.S. political history since the election of Ronald Reagan, if not before. They have been hanging on every tweet. The emerging view -- or, more likely, hope -- among many top Japanese officials is that Trump is a pragmatist willing to reverse himself. ""In one of his Twitter entries,"" noted Tomohiko Taniguchi, a close adviser to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a few days after the election, ""he denied what he said during the election campaign about how South Korea and Japan should go nuclear."" The alternative -- that Trump actually meant many of the things he said in the presidential race -- seems unthinkable. Earlier that day, I sat down with another senior Japanese government official. His tone suggested optimism -- or was it disbelief? ""The strong point of President Trump is that people do not expect a kind of consistency,"" he said. ""The president is decided, but they can change the policy any time."" Nowhere is sizing up Trump a higher priority than in Japan, a country with strong strategic and economic ties with the United States that the president-elect, if some of his campaign rhetoric is taken literally, might erode. Abe will meet Trump in New York Thursday, which will be among the first face-to-face meetings the president-elect will have with a foreign leader. ""The president in office is the one that the Japanese government must work with,"" Taniguchi said, explaining why he and other officials have been clinging to ""encouraging"" early indications that Trump would not act on much of his campaign rhetoric, sparse though they are. ""He appears to be a person who is very much flexible after winning the election,"" Taniguchi said. He predicted that Trump, when offered the facts, would see the importance of the large U.S. military base in Okinawa. Taniguchi and other Japanese officials have begun casting their message in terms Trump may appreciate. ""It is almost like a real estate business -- what matters here is location, location and location,"" he said, arguing that the Japanese archipelago is an ideal place to forward deploy the U.S. troops that have for decades secured a region vital to American prosperity. ""He is a businessman,"" official after official has said to me, suggesting Japanese elites see his experience in the private sector as a sign he will listen to reason. Trump condemned trade deals during the campaign, yet Japanese government operatives have gamely expressed optimism about what the president-elect will do with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, pointing out that the benefits to the United States are obvious and that Trump's past criticisms of the deal were overblown -- though these facts have not seemed to matter so far in the warped debate over the proposed pact. ""We have a year-and-a-half window of opportunity,"" Taniguchi said, referring to the timeline for approving the TPP. ""So Mr. Trump can take time and ponder seriously."" Part of Japanese officials' thinking seems to be that Trump could not possibly intend to act on his promises, because they would be ruinous to the country and to him politically. ""If he can get along for the first four years, the chances of him getting reelected are much higher,"" one senior official told me. ""If he carries out the policy he already stated during the campaign, I think the chances will be lower."" Trump knows that -- doesn't he? He didn't really mean all those things he said -- did he? Not everyone is optimistic on this side of the Pacific. Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, a decades-long veteran of the Japanese government and diplomat, warned of ""autarky"" -- that is, closing the country's economy from the rest of the world -- ""that will bring your great country down."" ""I am 76 years old, an old guy who is reading your paper and the New York Times and watching American TV here . . . because I am so concerned,"" he said. ""Heartbroken."" Apparently he has not yet progressed -- regressed? -- to stalking Twitter for the president-elect's official word on how the world will change. Credibility of the kind the United States has in Japan takes decades to earn. We may soon see how quickly it can be replaced by disillusionment."

Grueling hours, demanding customers and knife's-edge profit margins all take a toll on employees' mental, physical and fiscal health. Further complicating matters is the long-controversial tipped-wage system, which allows employers to pay certain workers as little as $2.13 per hour so long as those workers can earn enough in tips to reach the minimum-wage threshold.  In an attempt to resolve pay inequities, and in response to minimum-wage hikes in some areas, a few restaurant owners have tried raising prices and abolishing tips -- with mixed results. As debate continues, so will issues such as the following:   Reader 1: My daughter recently took a waitressing job at a major chain. Here are a few of their policies: 1. Waitstaff pay for any kitchen mistakes. If a burger is cooked too long and the customer rejects it, it comes out of the server's pay.  2. No breaks are allowed for any shifts, including doubles. 3. Tip pooling includes untipped employees, such as hostesses, who make at least minimum wage. These policies seem questionable at best.    Karla: Here's what the Labor Department and the Fair Labor Standards Act say: 1. Though it seems unfair to punish the server for a diner's beef with the kitchen, federal law allows such deductions, as long as they don't reduce average hourly pay below minimum wage for the workweek.  2. With a few exceptions for certain industries and underage workers, federal law lets employees be worked nonstop. State and local laws, however, may mandate breaks. Encourage your daughter to check. 3. When a restaurant requires workers to pool tips, the pool must include only workers who are ""customarily and regularly"" tipped; courts and states seem to differ on whether hostesses meet that definition. To determine whether this pooling arrangement is legitimate, individual workers' duties would have to be examined on a case-by-case basis.   Reader 2: Our restaurant is closing for a week so the floors can be refinished. The owner is renting ""pods"" to store the furniture and tableware. She is hiring a couple of movers to help pack everything into storage after the last meal. The problem is that she is expecting servers working that meal to stay and help load the pods -- for the $2.13 minimum wage.   Karla: According to DOL Fact Sheet 15, tipped workers can be asked to spend 20 percent of their workweek doing non-tipped work, such as sorting silverware. But if the non-tipped work exceeds 20 percent of working hours, the employer must pay straight minimum wage for time above 20 percent.   Thanks to Paula Brantner of Workplace Fairness.

Murtha (D-Pa.) served as one of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's closest allies.  Some of the biggest dissidents in Nancy Pelosi's Democratic caucus can be found in the same spot during almost every set of House votes: ""Pennsylvania Corner."" During Tuesday's roll call the group --  a collection of mostly male Democrats from the Midwest or Northeast -- huddled and gossiped, many whispering to Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), who sat in the third seat in from the chamber's farthest corner. Ryan has emerged literally from the Democratic back-bench to float a potential challenge to Pelosi, who is seeking an eighth term leading House Democrats, after last week's elections disappointed her party, which now has no clear path to ever recapturing the House majority. It's unclear whether the 43-year-old Democrat will truly challenge Pelosi, but Ryan and his friends have upended what was expected to be a seamless re-election of the entire slate of top Democratic leaders. Instead, Pelosi delayed elections for two weeks when ""Pennsylvania Corner"" joined forces with other disaffected lawmakers. Ryan, first elected in 2002, summed up the group's angst by pointing to the disappointing results in three of the last four elections: ""I mean, here we are in the worst shape we have been in since I first got here. This is not fun anymore. This is not fun to wallow in the minority.""   [Generational divide fuels nascent House Democratic revolt]   It's a stunning reversal. Pelosi once counted this group as part of the backbone of her support. Their name, ""Pennsylvania Corner"", comes from the spot where for several decades the state's Democrats regularly gathered and plotted how to use their clout to deliver for their state and influence fellow Democrats. Their heyday came during the reign of the late John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), a longtime dean of the state's delegation whose firm grip on the Pentagon's budget made him an extraordinary power broker in Washington. It also made Murtha someone whose support Pelosi sought out early. Starting on the House Appropriations Committee, they formed a strong bond that would last beyond Murtha's death in 2010 from an infection. Just last month, Pelosi traveled to Philadelphia for the christening for the USS John P. Murtha, a warship that can carry up to 800 sailors. ""We will never see his like again,"" Pelosi said at the Penn's Landing ceremony. Murtha, who was elected in 1974, occupied that far corner seat in the chamber every day, back when committee and subcommittee chairmen wielded almost equal power to the speaker. He gathered acolytes from his defense spending subcommittee, the Pennsylvania delegation and others that just flocked to his side. He threw his support behind Pelosi's early leadership bids. This, along with her backing from California's massive delegation and the growing crop of female lawmakers, made her impossible to beat. In 2006 Pelosi broke the House glass ceiling as Democrats claimed the majority, making her the first woman to wield the speaker's gavel -- and she immediately threw her support to Murtha in a sneak-attack to defeat Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) for majority leader. The tip of the spear in Murtha's campaign, doing Pelosi's bidding, were his corner men: Reps. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.), Bob Brady (D-Pa.), John Larson (D-Conn.) and Mike Capuano (D-Mass.), among others. Hoyer won easily, having built strong alliances throughout the caucus. That's rendered him incapable of being toppled, but also without enough support in the increasingly liberal caucus to defeat Pelosi. In four years as speaker, Pelosi tapped Murtha's understudies for tough tasks. Larson served as the No. 4 member of leadership. Capuano had the delicate task of overhauling the House ethics process after a slew of scandals last decade. Then came 2010. Murtha died. So did the Democratic majority. Among the net loss of 63 seats came a devastating amount of political bloodshed among Murtha's old allies. Pennsylvania went from a 12-to-7 edge for Democrats to what is now 13 Republicans and five Democrats; Ohio went from a 10-to-8 edge for Democrats to its current balance of 12 Republicans and four Democrats. Without their direct line from Murtha to Pelosi, ""Pennsylvania Corner"" lost its influence and its ability to try to shape leadership decisions. After those 2010 midterms, Rep. Bill Pascrell (N.J.) and Capuano tried to delay leadership elections for a deeper soul-searching mission -- they were dismissed. Flash forward six years, and Tuesday's bid to delay elections had surprising support. In a raucous meeting in the Capitol Visitor's Center basement, complaints grew from each ideological nook of the Democratic caucus. ""We need to be sure we give everybody the chance to have input,"" Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus,summarizing his comments.   [House Dems delay leadership votes]   A younger generation joined the movement, including a pair of Marines who fought in Iraq, Reps. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) and Seth Moulton (D-Mass.). They drafted a letter calling for deeper analysis of what went wrong in the elections. That combination, from ""Pennsylvania Corner"" to the CBC to ambitious younger Democrats, is a formidable group but probably not enough to topple Pelosi. Frankly, it's unclear they all even want to oust Pelosi. Younger lawmakers are upset Pelosi never convinced the caucus to impose term limits on top committee posts -- most ranking members of key committees are over 70-years-old -- and still allows seniority to be used as the top criterion for selecting the panel leaders. But CBC members are upset that Pelosi has even considered imposing such restrictions, saying that if political measures like fundraising dictate those assignments, members from low-income districts will never get the fruits of victory. Meanwhile, across the Rust Belt, Democrats are furious the party leadership is almost entirely coastal, leading to an agenda that focused on liberal cultural positions as President-elect Donald Trump won their states with an economic message. So by late Tuesday, as votes began, ""Pennsylvania Corner"" was alive again. One Democrat described it as a ""bee hive,"" buzzing about what to do next. They huddled, they talked, then they fanned out across the floor talking to others. When votes ended, Hoyer wandered over to the seat where his rival, Murtha, sat for years. He huddled with Doyle and others, smiling and laughing. One Democrat, still supportive of Pelosi but seeking a better examination of the elections, couldn't believe his eyes: ""We're a long way from Jack Murtha.""  "

The choking report came at San Jose State University, not San Diego State University. In a separate incident at San Diego State, a woman in a hijab reported being confronted by men who commented about Trump and grabbed her backpack and car keys; but she was not hurt. A corrected version of the story is below: Trump's election leaves American Muslims reeling and scared American Muslims say they are numb and frightened by the election of Donald Trump as president By RACHEL ZOLL AND DEEPTI HAJELA Associated Press On the morning after the election, Alia Ali had a sickening feeling as she headed to her job as a secretary at a New York City public school, her hijab in place as usual. Ali is a Muslim who lives and works in one of the most diverse places in the U.S., and yet the ascension of Donald Trump to the White House left her wondering how other Americans really viewed her.  ""Half of America voted one way and half of America voted the other, and you're like, 'Which half am I looking at?'"" she said. ""You become almost like strangers to the people you've worked with. Is this person racist? Do they like me? Do they not like me? Because that's what this election has done."" American Muslims are reeling following the election of Trump, whose campaign was rife with anti-Muslim rhetoric and proposals that included banning Muslims from entering the country and heightened surveillance of mosques across the nation. Now, among many of the 3.3 million Muslims living in the U.S., there is significant fear, along with some reports of harassment; one hijab-wearing student at San Jose State University said her headscarf was grabbed and she was briefly choked by an assailant after Trump's election victory.  ""There are lots and lots of people who aren't going out of the house,"" said Eboo Patel, a Muslim who heads the Interfaith Youth Core, a Chicago-based organization that works with colleges and government officials to build interreligious relationships. At New York University late last week, hundreds of people sat shoulder-to-shoulder on a grand staircase of a student center to express solidarity after the word ""Trump!"" was scrawled on the door of a Muslim prayer space at the school. Students spoke of friends who wore headscarves or other traditional clothing and were afraid to take public transportation home for fear of being harassed. Sana Mayat, a 21-year-old senior who wears the hijab, said the election made her realize ""there was a large part of this country that didn't want me here.""  ""There is an intense state of anxiety about the future,"" said Rami Nashashibi, a parent of three and executive director of Chicago's Inner-City Muslim Action Network, which has been inundated with calls seeking support since Election Day. ""I grappled with the conversation I had to have with my children."" The outcome was especially bitter following an unprecedented voter registration drive by American Muslims, including get-out-the-vote sermons at mosques and the creation of a political action committee, Emerge USA, to mobilize Arabs and Muslims. Enas Almadhwahi, a 28-year-old Yemeni immigrant who has been in the U.S. since 2008, became a citizen this year and voted for the first time. To mark the occasion, she brought her 7-year-old daughter, along with some co-workers.  ""At that moment, I was so happy,"" said Almadhwahi, who lives in Brooklyn, New York, and works at an Arab-American community organization. The next day, when she told her daughter Trump had won, the girl cried. A friend had told the little girl that if Trump won, it would mean they couldn't talk anymore.  ""Everything feels like it's upside down,"" Almadhwahi said. ""I still like to hope Trump will change his words about Muslims."" Trump's policy plans remain a mystery, but his administration could radically reshape the Justice Department, which has been an ally under President Barack Obama in protecting Muslim civil rights. Trump could also repeal a key Obama program that prevents the deportation of some immigrants, including Muslims, living in the country illegally. Muslims had far from a perfect relationship with the Obama administration. For years, the president kept the community largely at arms-length, sending surrogates to meet with them amid a stubborn misapprehension, fueled in part by his critics, that Obama, a Christian, was secretly Muslim. Many U.S. Muslim leaders were uncomfortable with his foreign policy in Iraq and elsewhere, and objected to his program to fight extremism at home, saying the focus on Muslims ignored other threats from right-wing, anti-government extremists. Still, Muslim leaders had built solid ties with many government officials. Now, they face not only the loss of those connections, but potentially a closed door to their concerns.  ""The friends we have are going to be fewer,"" said Farhana Khera, president of the California-based civil rights group Muslim Advocates, which has represented clients suing over the New York Police Department's surveillance of American Muslims. ""I think we'll be very much in a defensive posture."" Since the election, mosques and Muslim groups have organized community meetings and conference calls focused on how to move forward. The Indiana-based Islamic Society of North America, the largest communal Muslim group in the U.S., issued a statement inviting Trump to engage with the community, saying ""many American Muslims are traumatized by the result of the election and the fear of what is to come."" The group said there was no immediate response from Trump's office. Sheik Omar Suleiman, resident scholar at the Valley Ranch Islamic Center in Irving, Texas, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an anti-defamation group, distributed suggested sermons for juma, or Friday prayers at mosques, stressing Quranic verses about remaining strong in the face of hardships.  ""Have hope in the people because Allah may turn their hearts toward you,"" was among the verses they cited. Faisal R. Khan, founder of a youth advocacy and peace organization near Chapel Hill, North Carolina, attended four Trump campaign rallies over the last year, in part to protest but also to speak with the Republican's supporters. Khan lived years ago in the Midwest, where he knew people who had grown resentful over losing Rust Belt jobs, and said he understands what drew so many working-class whites to the president-elect. Khan has created a Facebook page called ""Talk To Me America,"" hoping to start a conversation that can combat anti-Muslim bias.  ""Peaceful protest is good, but at a certain point, we have to sit down and talk,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, we're all human beings. We're all Americans."" ____ Zoll is the AP religion reporter. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

In his first postelection interview, Trump said he will focus on deporting criminal immigrants and not everyone living in the United States illegally. Two million or 3 million people could be immediate targets for deportation under this approach, Trump said, providing a likely inflated figure. And that ""big, beautiful wall"" at the Mexican border? Trump said he may be amenable to a fence along some parts of the roughly 2,000-mile border. The softened stance contrasts sharply with Trump's campaign rhetoric. As a candidate, he called for everyone living in the country illegally to return to their home countries and for Mexico to pay billions of dollars for the wall. A look at Trump's shifting immigration stance: FOCUS ON CRIMINALS Trump said in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" broadcast Sunday that immigration enforcement will concentrate on criminals.  ""What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,"" he said. ""We have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million; we are getting them out of our country or we're going to incarcerate."" Trump added: ""We're getting them out of our country; they're here illegally."" Obama's Homeland Security Department has operated similarly. Since 2010, criminals comprised more than half of those deported from the U.S. Over his presidency, Obama has overseen the deportation of more than 2.5 million people. Trump didn't say Sunday how he will target criminals. He previously has spoken about reviving programs that gave immigration agents access to jails so they could identify people living in the country illegally. But if Trump does so, local jurisdictions likely will object. Local laws in some places bar cooperation with immigration authorities. And some federal court rulings make it difficult for local jails to hold immigrants beyond their criminal sentences or strictly for immigration violations. It is even harder to deport criminal immigrants who aren't incarcerated. Many live in the shadows. Tracking them down would take a lot of time and government money. Deportation costs average about $12,500 per person, according to a 2011 government estimate. ___ 2 MILLION OR 3 MILLION CRIMINAL IMMIGRANTS Trump's estimate of criminals who are in the country illegally is probably much too high. In 2012, Homeland Security officials estimated some 1.9 million criminal immigrants in the United States who could be deported. But the government didn't break down how many of those people were in the country legally and how many were here illegally. A subsequent analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, concluded that only about 820,000 of those people were in the country illegally. The other million or so people had some sort of legal status, including green cards or visas. Deporting green card holders is possible, though the process can involve lengthy court proceedings. ___ FENCE vs. WALL  ""I will build a great, great wall on our southern border,"" Trump said as he launched his presidential campaign in June 2015. ""And I will have Mexico pay for that wall."" He repeated the pledge at almost every rally. But in his weekend interview, Trump took a more nuanced approach. In certain areas, Trump said, ""it could be some fencing."" Elsewhere, he added, the border wall was still appropriate. The president-elect didn't outline where a fence or a wall might fit better. But his willingness to consider fencing marked a considerable concession from his campaign stance. Border fencing is nothing new. There is fencing along about 650 miles in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, encompassing almost a third of the border. Under President George W. Bush, Congress authorized $1.2 billion to build hundreds of miles of double-layered fencing. The Congressional Research Service and the Army Corps of Engineers have estimated that the fencing already in place cost the United States about $7 billion. Any new construction along the border would be a costly and complicated endeavor. Cost estimates of a wall have ranged from $10 billion to $20 billion. Trump would also face myriad environmental regulations, objections from private land owners and a legally binding 1970 treaty with Mexico that governs structures along the Rio Grande and Colorado River at the Mexican border. __ Follow Alicia A.

The Army announced late Monday it had finished reviewing its process for approving the pipeline's route on land owned by the Army Corps of Engineers. But it said it needs more study and wants input from the Standing Rock Sioux before it allows the pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir. The MAIN Coalition -- made of agriculture, business and labor entities that benefit from Midwest infrastructure projects -- called it a political decision. Spokesman Craig Stevens said it's an example of why voters rejected Democrats in last week's election. And he said he hopes it's not the final word on the pipeline with Donald Trump set to take office. The pipeline developer, Energy Transfer Partners, didn't immediately comment on the Army announcement. ___ 5 p.m.: An attorney for an environmental group says he believes President Barack Obama's administration will make a decision on the Dakota Access pipeline before the president leaves office. Attorney Jan Hasselman with environmental group Earthjustice, who filed the lawsuit in July on behalf of the tribe, says he expects the decision before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in Jan. 20. The Army Corps of Engineers announced Monday that it finished a review of the disputed Dakota Access pipeline but says it wants more study and tribal input before it allows it to cross under the Missouri River in North Dakota. The corps had given permission to pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners permission, but in September it said more analysis was warranted in the wake of American Indian concerns. ___ 4:15 p.m. The Army Corps of Engineers has finished a review of the disputed Dakota Access pipeline but says it wants more study and tribal input before it allows it to cross under the Missouri River in North Dakota. The corps had given permission to pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners permission, but in September it said more analysis was warranted in the wake of American Indian concerns. The Standing Rock Sioux says the $3.8 billion, four-state pipeline threatens its drinking water and cultural sites. ETP disputes that and says it's preparing to bore under the river. Army Assistant Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy says in a letter to company officials and tribal Chairman Dave Archambault that ""additional discussion with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and analysis are warranted."" Darcy says the Army will work with the tribe on a timeline. ___ 3 p.m. A spokesman for a group supporting construction of an oil pipeline through the Midwest says the rule of law must be respected and the project should not retroactively be stopped. The MAIN Coalition's Craig Stevens says ""it's past time for the president to lift the hold on the Dakota Access Pipeline and issue the final, already approved easement."" Groups opposing the $3.8 billion pipeline plan to hold more than 200 protest actions across the country Tuesday. They seek to draw the attention of President Barack Obama by rallying at U.S. Army Corps of Engineers offices, federal buildings and offices of banks that have helped finance the project. They want Obama to permanently stop the project which is to run beneath a lake that provides drinking water to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which says the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. The groups, including the Indigenous Environmental Network, Honor the Earth and Greenpeace USA. ___ 12:30 p.m. Groups protesting the construction of an oil pipeline through the Midwest are planning more than 200 protest actions across the country Tuesday seeking to draw the attention of President Barack Obama. Rallies are to include events at U.S. Army Corps of Engineers offices in many states while other locations include federal buildings and offices of banks that have helped finance the project. Protests are planned in every state but Rhode Island and Mississippi, but organizers say they're working on getting events in every state. The groups, including the Indigenous Environmental Network, Honor the Earth and Greenpeace USA want Obama to permanently halt the construction of the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline, the focus of confrontations between police and protesters in North Dakota. The pipeline is to run beneath a lake that provides drinking water to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which says the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. The project also crosses South Dakota, Iowa and enters into Illinois. ___ 12:20 p.m. A United Nations group that represents indigenous people around the world says the U.S. government appears to be ignoring the treaty rights and human rights of American Indians opposing the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline. The statement is from the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. It came after forum member Edward John spent three days at a camp in North Dakota that's drawn hundreds of protesters against the 1,200-mile pipeline to carry North Dakota oil to Illinois. Nearly 470 protesters have been arrested supporting the Standing Rock Sioux, which believes the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. John says he met with both protesters and law officers. He says he found a ""war zone"" atmosphere. President Barack Obama said earlier this month his administration is monitoring the situation. ___ 12:05 p.m. The North Dakota Highway Patrol says a large group of Dakota Access protesters has caused the state Capitol in Bismarck to be locked down. Highway Patrol Lt. Tom Iverson says a ""large number of protesters"" had gathered outside the building Monday morning. He says the Capitol was locked to avoid them gathering inside the building. The patrol is in charge of Capitol security. Several troopers were patrolling the Capitol and the grounds. Earlier this month, more than a dozen protesters were arrested in the judicial wing of the Capitol in Bismarck. Highway Patrol Lt. Tom Iverson said the protesters were sitting, chanting and singing and refused orders to leave.

Candidates have been lining up for weeks -- and, in some cases, since Maryland's primary last April -- in anticipation of the departures of Sens. Jamie Raskin (D-Montgomery), who was elected to Congress last week; Catherine Pugh (D-Baltimore City), who won the race to be mayor of Baltimore; and Sen. Ulysses Currie (D-Prince George's), who is stepping down because his health is declining.  Each vacancy will be filled by the affected jurisdiction's Democratic Central Committee, which often holds a public forum featuring potential candidates before making a recommendation to Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on whom to appoint. ""We were getting calls right after the primary"" about Raskin's seat, said Darryl Anderson, chair of the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee. ""I think that list is going to change daily. It's going to be a very tough decision because there are some great candidates."" Democratic Dels. David Moon and William C. Smith Jr., who were elected in 2014 and who both served in District 20 with Raskin, are considered the front-runners. Community activist Debbie Spielberg and Howard University business professor Darian Unger also have expressed interest. Anderson said he has heard the names of three other possible candidates as well: former county council member Valerie Ervin; Will Jawando, who competed with Raskin and others in the congressional primary; and former delegate Bill Bronrott. Those interested in the seat can appear at a forum Thursday night at the Silver Spring Civic Center. The county Central Committee will make its decision on Dec. 7. If either Moon or Smith are selected, the committee will then have to decide who should fill that open delegate seat. In January, the central committee tapped Del. Craig J. Zucker (D-Montgomery), to fill a seat vacated by retiring Sen. Karen S. Montgomery. Former delegate Herman Taylor, who had also expressed interest, accused the committee of lining up behind Zucker, who had the backing of party leaders, and not fully considering him as a candidate. In an email to Democratic officials this weekend, Anderson said that in filling the Raskin vacancy, the committee would give priority to someone who would not run for a full term in 2018. The message, he said, was intended to show people that the committee wanted to keep the 2018 contest as wide open as possible. ""The Central Committee has been getting a lot of heat in the last couple of years about, sort of moving people from within the system, rather than hearing from outside people,"" he said. ""We're trying to get over that perception that a determination has been made.""  But other Democratic leaders in the county pushed back against that position -- and Anderson sent a revised email on Sunday removing the language.  ""It should have said 'some members' count that as a priority,"" he said in an interview. Raskin, Currie and Pugh held key roles in the 47-member Senate, where Democrats hold a large majority. Pugh was majority leader and a member of the Finance Committee; Raskin was chair of the Executive Nominations Committee and Currie served on the Budget and Taxation Committee. In Prince George's, a current delegate and a former delegate are mounting aggressive campaigns for the District 25 seat Currie has held for the past 30 years. Melony G. Griffith, who spent 16 years in the House of Delegates but gave up her seat to challenge Currie in 2014, said she plans to formally submit her name to the Prince George's County Democratic Central Committee on Dec. 1. Griffith won 40 percent of the vote two years ago. Del. Darryl Barnes (D-Prince George's), who was elected to his House seat in 2014, also wants the seat, and Currie's wife, Shirley, has been mentioned as a potential replacement as well. In District 40 in Baltimore, first-term lawmaker Del. Antonio L. Hayes (D-Baltimore City) has been mentioned as a potential candidate to fill Pugh's seat. Pugh, who served as the Senate majority leader, spent 11 years in Annapolis. A former member of the Baltimore City Council, she was appointed in 2005 to fill a vacant seat in the House of Delegates, then ran successfully for Senate in 2006. "

The 83-year-old justice said the most immediate impact on the court of Trump's election would be to fill the seat that Justice Antonin Scalia occupied until his death in February. ""President Trump will fill it,"" Ginsburg said in a question-and-answer session at a meeting of the Jewish Federations of North America in a Washington ballroom. Ginsburg had criticized Trump in interviews last summer with The Associated Press and other news organizations, saying she did not want to consider the possibility that Trump could be elected. She apologized for her remarks soon thereafter. President Barack Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland for Scalia's seat, but Senate Republicans took no action. Ginsburg had several times said a full bench of nine justices is better for the court to avoid inconclusive tie votes. Questioned by attorney Kenneth Feinberg, Ginsburg also said the court has had a lighter workload in recent years because Congress has not passed much significant legislation. The court often is called on to interpret new laws and decide whether they pass constitutional muster.  ""Perhaps Congress will do some work,"" she said. The friendly audience laughed at her recollection of Jewish life in Brooklyn during her childhood in the 1930s and '40s when Ginsburg said her family belonged to Reform and Orthodox congregations before they ""got it right"" by joining a synagogue affiliated with Conservative Judaism. Ginsburg is one of three justices in their late 70s or 80s, and if she or Justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy retire, Trump would have the chance to move the court significantly to the right. There was no talk of retirement Monday, but Feinberg got the loudest cheer when he ended the session by saying, ""May she continue in good health."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

A look at immigration by the numbers: ___ Immigrants in the country illegally: about 11 million. Criminal immigrants: As of 2012, the government estimated that 1.9 million immigrants were convicted criminals and could face deportation. Criminal immigrants in the country illegally: The Migration Policy Institute in Washington estimates that about 820,000 of the criminal immigrants are here illegally. Deportations under President Barack Obama: More than 2.5 million. Deportation costs: Each deportation costs an average of about $12,500, according to a 2011 government estimate. Immigration court backlog: More than 521,000 cases are pending in federal immigration court, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Immigrants with pending deportation orders: 88,128 as of 2015, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the Justice Department. Young immigrants protected from deportation by Obama administration: More than 741,000 people have been approved for deferred action, which shields them from deportation and authorizes them to legally work. Border Fence: About 650 miles of fencing is already in place along the Mexican border in parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. Length of Mexican border: Roughly 2,000 miles. Border Patrol agents: 18,321 agents patrol the U.S. border with Mexico.

Trump has vowed to rescind ""all job-destroying Obama executive actions"" and pledges to sharply increase oil and gas drilling on federal lands while opening up offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean and other areas where it is blocked. Topping Trump's to-do list is repealing the Clean Power Plan, Obama's signature effort to limit carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. The plan -- the linchpin of Obama's strategy to fight climate change -- is currently on hold awaiting a court ruling. Trump also is targeting recent Obama administration efforts to reduce air and water pollution that have been opposed by Republicans and industries that profit from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, including a rule to protect small streams and wetlands and ozone regulations designed to cut down on smog. Those under consideration for energy secretary include Harold Hamm, an Oklahoma oil tycoon and leading proponent of fracking, and North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer, an early Trump supporter from a major oil drilling state, according to transition planning documents obtained by The Associated Press. Venture capitalist Robert Grady, who worked in President George H.W. Bush's administration, is listed as a contender to lead both the Energy and Interior departments. Cramer told reporters Monday he is happy to stay in Congress, especially ""with a friend in the White House. And if another good friend like Harold Hamm would become secretary of energy, I'd feel like I won the lottery."" A coalition of conservative states has challenged both the Clean Power Plan and the water rule, which expanded the definition of waters protected under the Clean Water Act to smaller non-navigable waters and seasonal tributaries. The administration says the rule would safeguard drinking water for 117 million people, but Republicans and some Democrats representing rural areas say the regulations are costly, confusing and amount to a government power grab. Federal courts have put the rules on hold as judges review lawsuits. Trump also is likely to move quickly to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada, which Obama rejected last year. Trump highlighted the project at a campaign stop in Florida last month and listed it among his top priorities for the first 100 days of his administration. Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for 21st Century Energy, said Trump can and will move quickly to overturn Obama's executive orders. From there, he will likely move to approve a new five-year plan that vastly expands offshore drilling and lift a moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands.  ""If you have a good offense and a good defense you will win,"" Harbert said. Whoever Trump picks for key jobs will share his goals of ""moving fast, changing the process which is not working now and getting things done,"" she said. Obama said Monday that Trump should be in no hurry to make changes, citing U.S. progress on reducing carbon emissions even as the price of gasoline hovers nears $2 a gallon. Trump and his team ""may want to take the country in a significantly different direction, but they've got time to consider what exactly they want to achieve,"" Obama said at a news conference. Environmental groups don't plan to make Trump's job easy.  ""We intend to fight like mad, both in the courts and in the streets, to resist any rollbacks by the Trump administration,"" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Some of those protests have already begun. Groups opposing the construction of an oil pipeline through the Midwest are planning more than 200 protest actions across the country Tuesday. The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday it wants more study and tribal input before approving the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux says the pipeline threatens its drinking water and cultural sites. Even as they gear up to oppose Trump, Brune said environmentalists may find some common ground with the president-elect. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power not only help fight climate change but are creating thousands of new jobs across the country, he said.  ""If President-elect Trump is looking for a stimulus in energy he will find it in the solar and wind industries,"" Brune said. Trump has said tax credits and other subsidies for wind and solar power ""distort"" the market, but says the U.S. should ""encourage all facets of the energy industry,"" including wind and solar power, as a way to achieve energy independence.
