A Trump surrogate defended the idea on Fox News, saying the treatment of Japanese Americans during WWII was ""precedent."" (The Washington Post)   A former spokesman for a major super PAC backing Donald Trump said Wednesday that the mass internment of Japanese Americans during World War II was a ""precedent"" for the president-elect's plans to create a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries. During an appearance on Megyn Kelly's Fox News show, Carl Higbie said a registry proposal being discussed by Trump's immigration advisers would be legal and would ""hold constitutional muster."" ""We've done it with Iran back awhile ago. We did it during World War II with the Japanese,"" said Higbie, a former Navy SEAL and until Nov. 9, the spokesman for the pro-Trump Great America PAC. Kelly seemed taken aback by the idea. ""Come on, you're not proposing we go back to the days of internment camps, I hope,"" she said. ""I'm not proposing that at all,"" Higbie told her. ""But I'm just saying there is precedent for it.""   Trump surrogates are already citing Japanese internment camps from WW II as ""precedent"" for Muslim registry pic.twitter.com/DVnjtom0mc -- Brendan Karet (@bad_takes) November 17, 2016   Higbie's remarks came a day after a key member of Trump's transition team, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, said Trump's policy advisers were weighing whether to send him a formal proposal for a national registry of immigrants and visitors from Muslim countries. Kobach, a possible candidate for attorney general, told Reuters that the team was considering a reinstatement of a similar program he helped design after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks while serving in the Justice Department under President George W. Bush. Known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS,) the program required people from ""higher risk"" countries to submit to fingerprinting, interrogations and, in some cases, parole-like check-ins with authorities. The program was suspended in 2011 after criticism from civil rights groups who said it targeted Muslims. When an NBC News reporter asked Trump last year whether he would require Muslims to register in a database, he said he ""would certainly implement that -- absolutely."" In his appearance on Kelly's show, Higbie, a frequent political commentator, said noncitizens were not protected by the same constitutional rights as citizens. He said he believed most Muslims were ""perfectly good people"" but argued that a small percentage of them adhered to an ""extreme ideology."" ""And they're doing harm,"" he said. ""So we would like to keep tabs on it until we can figure out what's going on."" When Higbie invoked Japanese internment camps, Kelly pushed back, at one point cutting him off mid-sentence and raising her voice. ""You can't be citing Japanese internment camps as precedent for anything the president-elect is going to do,"" she told him. Higbie responded: ""Look, the president needs to protect America first, and if that means having people that are not protected under our Constitution have some sort of registry so we can understand -- until we can identify the true threat and where it's coming from, I support it."" ""You get the protections,"" Kelly said, ""once you come here.""   .@CarlHigbie: ""The president needs to protect America first."" #KellyFile -- Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 17, 2016     .@CarlHigbie: ""People outside of this country are not protected under the same constitutional rights as we are in America."" #KellyFile -- Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) November 17, 2016   Beginning in 1942 and ending in 1946, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government incarcerated as many as 120,000 people of Japanese descent in internment camps throughout the United States. The majority were U.S. citizens. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed a law paying $20,000 in reparations to each surviving detainee. He apologized for the mass internment, calling it ""a great injustice"" in American history. A 1944 Supreme Court decision upholding the internment is widely considered one of the court's darkest moments, along with the court's ruling in the Dred Scott case. Great America PAC was among the first super PACs created to support Trump's campaign. Formed in February, it has since established itself as one of the president-elect's biggest allies, spending $30 million on political ads, phone calls, mailers and ground support, as The Washington Post's Matea Gold reported last week. Now that Trump has been elected president, the group is looking to help the new administration, tapping its network of a quarter-million donors to provide financial backing for Trump's legislative agenda, The Post reported.          1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

John Lewis win National Book Awards	" NEW YORK -- On a night of nervous laughter and cathartic tears and applause, Colson Whitehead's ""The Underground Railroad"" won the National Book Award for fiction and Democratic U.S. Rep. John Lewis, of Georgia, shared the prize for young people's literature for a graphic novel about his civil rights activism. The awards were presented Wednesday during an emotional dinner ceremony at Cipriani Wall Street in Manhattan, with Larry Wilmore serving as host and President-elect Donald Trump the running theme and arch-villain. From Wilmore's opening monologue through virtually every award announcement, speakers in the deep-blue literary community addressed Trump's stunning upset of Democrat Hillary Clinton and how authors should respond.  ""Outside is the blasted hellhole wasteland of Trumpland, which we're going to inhabit,"" said Whitehead, whose Oprah Winfrey-endorsed narrative about an escaped slave already was the year's most talked about literary work. ""I hit upon something that made me feel better: be kind to everybody, make art and fight the power."" Daniel Borzutzky's ""The Performance of Becoming Human"" won for poetry and historian Robert Caro was presented an honorary medal for lifetime achievement. No speaker moved the crowd more than Lewis, who collaborated with Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell on a trilogy of illustrated works titled ""March."" Cited Wednesday for the finale, ""March: Book Three,"" the 76-year-old Lewis became tearful as he remembered a librarian in his native Alabama who refused to let him borrow books because of his skin color. He then remembered an elementary school teacher who told him ""Read, my child, read!""  ""And I tried to read everything,"" he said. Lewis' win marked two rarities for the National Book Awards, now in their 67th year: a prize for a graphic novel and for a member of Congress. In 2004, the government-drafted ""9-11 Commission Report"" was a nonfiction finalist. Wilmore, whose rueful jokes about Trump at the beginning of the night seemed to depress rather than amuse the gathering of writers, publishers, editors and others, got a good laugh at the end when he called the evening the BET (Black Entertainment Television) production of the National Book Awards. The awards are presented by the National Book Foundation and the ceremony was the first under executive director Lisa Lucas, the first black and first woman to have the job. Ibram X. Kendi's ""Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America"" won for nonfiction and an honorary award was given to the founders of Cave Canem, a Brooklyn-based foundation for black poets.  ""I spent years looking at the absolute worst of America, its horrible history of racism, but in the end I never lost faith,"" Kendi said. ""In the midst of the human ugliness of racism, there is the human beauty of the resistance to racism."" Each of the winners in the four competitive categories received $10,000. Choices are made by panels of judges that include writers, critics, journalists and scholars. Many of the nominated books seemed to take on added relevance and even urgency over the past week. ""The Underground Railroad"" is a deep look into the culture of this country during the Civil War, and Arlie Russell Hochschild's nonfiction ""Strangers In Their Own Land"" a modern journey to a conservative Louisiana community. Fiction nominee Jacqueline Woodson, whose ""Another Brooklyn"" is a coming of age story about a black girl in the 1970s, said she was feeling a ""a mixture of sobriety and hope"" and ""gratitude for what is both a distraction and a call to work."" Nonfiction nominee Andres Resendez said we were living in a ""new era"" and needed more than ever to study the past.  ""We still have much to learn and discover about this shameful part of our history, and thus the exploration will surely continue and intensify,"" said Resendez, a finalist for ""The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America."" Every speech seemed to touch upon the present even when Trump wasn't named. Caro spoke of his books about Lyndon Johnson and municipal builder Robert Moses and how his aim was to show how political power really operated. A co-founder of Cave Canem, Cornelius Eady, referred to a certain building (Trump Tower) further north in Manhattan and how he feared that the President-elect and his aides were ""trying to write a narrative about who we are and who we are supposed to be and what they intend to do about it.""  ""It's our duty to make sure we get to write our story ..."" he said, ""the fullness of who we are, the contradictions of who we are, in our own language, in our own way.""

Chief Inspector Scott Small says the unmanned aircraft was first spotted around 6 p.m. Wednesday in an area where roughly 300 demonstrators were engaging in an anti-Donald Trump protest. The police helicopter was monitoring the protest below when the drone came within several feet of it. Police tracked the drone to a nearby building that houses students from multiple local colleges and arrested its operator. He was charged with reckless endangerment. The case has been passed along to the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office. Additional charges for the unnamed suspect are possible. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In the full count, Igor Dodon won 52.2 percent of the vote. Maia Sandu, who ran on an anti-corruption ticket, had 47.8 percent. Russian President Vladimir Putin invited Dodon to visit Moscow and said he looked forward to developing bilateral relations. In her first comments after the final results, Sandu said the elections were neither free nor fair and accused opponents of using ""dirty methods"" including the media and administrative resources, against her. She called for the resignation of authorities responsible for organizing the elections. International election observers said Monday ""fundamental freedoms (were) respected, but polarized media coverage, harsh rhetoric detracted from the process."" On Monday, up to 3,000 mostly young Moldovans marched to the offices of the Central Election Committee in Chisinau shouting ""Down with the Mafia!"" Anger had also flared on Sunday after Moldovans voting in Britain, Ireland, France, Italy and elsewhere lined up for hours and ballot papers ran out. Sandu said the elections had been badly organized. Dodon's victory was celebrated with fireworks early Monday in the semi-autonomous Gagauzia region, home of many ethnic Russians. Dodon, leader of the Socialists' Party, announced himself the victor at midnight Sunday and called for calm, vowing to be a president for all Moldovans, regardless of their political views. He said he seeks good relations with the nation's neighbors, Romania and Ukraine. Putin congratulated Dodon and said the outcome of the elections demonstrates Moldovans want to have a balanced foreign policy."" The statement said the Russian leader is willing to develop bilateral relations within an existing friendship agreement. Romania's president, Klaus Iohannis, was cooler and more reserved in his remarks, saying the new president should fulfil his mandate ""with wisdom and balance,"" and respect ""the constitutional attributes"" of the post. Iohannis added that the only way to offer Moldovans a prosperous future was to have internal political stability and a commitment from state institutes and politicians to ""consolidate the process of reforms"" that will modernize the country and ""support the European path which directly benefits all Moldovans."" Moldova's president represents the country abroad, sets foreign policy and appoints judges, but needs parliamentary approval for major decisions. However, the office is expected to gain authority because Dodon is the first president in 20 years to be directly elected rather than being chosen by Parliament. The 41-year-old Dodon, who painted himself as a traditional Moldovan with conservative values, tapped into popular anger over the approximately $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks before the 2014 parliamentary elections. Dodon says he will move to rescind a law which obliges taxpayers to reimburse the $1 billion, but Parliament would have to agree. He hasn't called for a thorough investigation or to find those responsible for the heist. He wants to restore ties with Russia, which placed a trade embargo on Moldovan wine, fruit and vegetables in 2014 after Moldova signed an association agreement with the European Union. However, the president cannot cancel the association agreement, which was ratified by Parliament.  ""The new president will continue to pursue an active pro-Russia policy,"" said Nicolae Reutoi, senior analyst at Alaco, a London-based intelligence consultancy. ""However, in practice, he will have to work in tandem with the ruling coalition, which declares itself pro-European."" Another analyst called Dodon ""an authoritarian populist.""  ""He promised everything to everyone,"" said Dan Brett, a commentator on Moldova and an associate professor at the Open University. Brett said the result suits the pro-European government in power since 2009 because ""he is cut from the same cloth as them and they share the same self-interests."" Sandu, a former education minister who heads the Action and Solidarity Party, said the former Soviet republic would have a more prosperous future in the EU. Sandu needed a high turnout to hope to win, but the final turnout of 53.3 percent was less than she had hoped. ___ Alison Mutler in Bucharest, Romania contributed to this report.

At talks in Brussels, the ministers struggled to forge a common stance that would balance their desperate need for Ankara's help to stop hundreds of thousands of refugees heading to Europe with deep concerns about rights abuses in Turkey in the wake of the thwarted military coup in July.  ""We see constant news there confirming our worries,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told reporters after the meeting. Earlier, Turkish media reported that police had detained a group of students who protested Erdogan's move to appoint a president to head Istanbul's prestigious Bogazici University. A government decree last month abolished elections of university presidents, allowing Turkey's increasingly powerful head of state to appoint them directly. Turkey and the EU have been locked in a war of words over Ankara's commitment to democracy and rule of law. EU officials say it's time for Turkey to say whether it really wants to join, but patience is running out in Turkey after more than a decade of troubled membership talks. Addressing a group of farmers on Monday, Erdogan said: ""Let's wait in patience until the end of the year and then go to the people."" He was responding to reports that the European Parliament's president has said that Turkey could face economic sanctions over the crackdown. Erdogan also accused the EU of breaking its promises and supporting outlawed Kurdish militants. Mogherini said Turkey's membership talks were not on the agenda Monday. Despite the tensions, she said, it was important to keep open lines of communication between European capitals and Ankara. Many EU nations are happy to keep the accession negotiations going, even though some -- notably Germany, France and Cyprus -- would prefer a special partnership with Turkey rather than full membership.  ""We are very concerned about the way things are evolving today in Turkey. When you see the number of arrests of journalists, arrests of members of parliament... I think we really have to dare to thrash this out with the Turkish authorities,"" said Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders. But after years of foot-dragging by some countries, the EU has promised faster membership talks, visa-free travel for Turkish citizens and billions of euros in aid for Syrian refugees living in Turkey if Ankara stops migrants setting off for Greece and agrees to take back thousands of others. In recent months, top Turkish officials have ratcheted up pressure on the EU by warning that the refugee deal will fall apart if Europe does not respect its promises. ___ Fraser reported from Ankara.

The new Congress includes the first Latina senator, three House members moving across the Capitol to the Senate and a few former lawmakers who seized their old jobs back. While the 115th Congress will include a record number of minority women, Congress will remain overwhelmingly white, male and middle-aged. At the first day of orientation, Republicans expressed excitement about winning the White House while Democrats struck a conciliatory tone. Vicente Gonzalez, a Democrat who will represent a South Texas district, said freshmen members of his party will start the new session in January ""having a clear view of the reality we're dealing with and trying to reach across the aisle and finding common ground."" A look at the new Congress: MINORITY WOMEN In the Senate, Democrats Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Kamala Harris of California and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois are among a record 21 women, up from 20 out of 100 senators. Cortez Masto will be the first Latina senator, while Harris and Duckworth will join Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono to form the Senate's largest ever Asian-American contingent. Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, is just the second black woman elected to the Senate and the first with South Asian roots. The House will welcome its first Vietnamese-American and Indian-American women: Democrats Stephanie Murphy of Florida and Pramila Jayapal of Washington state. Overall, the number of minority women in Congress will increase to 33 in the House from 27 and stand at four in the Senate. ___ NEW SENATORS Six new senators join the ranks -- a seventh will be chosen next month in Louisiana's runoff. Orientation for new senators starts Tuesday. Harris, 52, a former prosecutor, currently serves as California's attorney general. Duckworth, a two-term House member, is a veteran of the Iraq War, where as an Army pilot, she lost both legs when her helicopter was hit by a grenade. Duckworth, 48, was born in Thailand, to an American father and Thai-Chinese mother. A former two-term Nevada attorney general, Cortez Masto, 52, also has worked as a prosecutor and chief of staff to former Nevada Gov. Bob Miller. Her father is of Mexican descent and her mother is of Italian descent. Republican Rep. Todd Young of Indiana is a three-term congressman and former Capitol Hill aide. Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland will replace Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring after 30 years in the Senate. A key lieutenant to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Van Hollen, 57, has focused on budget issues and foreign policy. New Hampshire's Maggie Hassan, a two-term governor, defeated freshman Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte in the nation's closest Senate race. ___ WOMEN ASCEND IN SENATE, DECLINE IN HOUSE A total of 104 women will serve in the next Congress, the same as in the current Congress and 19.4 percent of the total number of lawmakers. Twenty-one women will serve in the Senate while 83 women will serve in the House, a drop of one from the current 84. In addition to Hillary Clinton's defeat in the presidential race, women saw setbacks in Congress. Maryland's 10-member congressional delegation reverted to all-male, while Pennsylvania voters rejected Democrat Katie McGinty's bid to become the first woman in the state elected to the Senate. Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester will be Delaware's first woman and first African-American in Congress. Only Mississippi and Vermont have never sent a woman to either chamber of Congress. ___ AFRICAN-AMERICANS GAIN A record 48 African-Americans will serve in Congress, including 46 in the House, an overall increase of two. Eighteen black women serve in Congress, including Republican Rep. Mia Love of Utah. Love is one of three black Republicans, along with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Texas Rep. Will Hurd. ___ HISPANICS, ASIAN AMERICANS GAIN A record 39 Hispanics will serve in Congress, including 35 in the House. Seven Hispanic freshmen were elected to the House, all Democrats. Ruben Kihuen will be the first Latino to represent Nevada in the House, while New York's Adriano Espaillat will be the first Dominican-American. Fifteen Asian Americans will serve in Congress, including 12 in the House. That's up from 10 in the current Congress. __ WELCOME BACK Three former House Democrats won their old seats back: Colleen Hanabusa of Hawaii, Brad Schneider of Illinois and Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire. Attending her first day of orientation Monday, Hanabusa said her experience will help her as Democrats try to wield influence in the minority.  ""Like everything else, it's whether we're going to be able to maintain relationships more than anything,"" she said. ___ Follow Matthew Daly: http://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The symbolic juxtaposition of the two countries underscores the balance Obama hopes to strike on his last trip to Europe as president. While he plans to buttress Greek efforts to cope with migrants fleeing the battlefields of the Middle East, he must contend with other European Union members' desire to keep more refugees out of their countries.  That task became more complicated after Donald Trump won the White House, in part by campaigning to severely restrict asylum seekers from entering the United States. ""The trip to Greece is about trying to address not just the refugee crisis, but to speak to the broader challenges Europe faces moving forward and to recognize that Greece is a front-line state when it comes to both irregular migration and economic recovery,"" said Charles Kupchan, the National Security Council's senior director for European affairs. In Greece, the primary entry point for Middle Eastern migrants, roughly 50,000 asylum seekers remain corralled in refugee camps and U.N.-sponsored accommodations, most of them waiting for E.U. countries to make good on pledges to resettle tens of thousands of refugees in countries across the wealthy bloc. Germany, meanwhile, was the destination of choice for the majority of arriving asylum seekers, and it is still dealing with a backlog of hundreds of thousands of applications for sanctuary.   Refugees warm themselves by a fire near Idomeni, in northern Greece. (Valdrin Xhemaj/EPA)  Greek Migration Minister Ioannis Mouzalas said in an interview Friday that his country expects Obama to emphasize ""how important it is to manage the crisis and not close your eyes to such a crisis"" during his stops in Athens and Berlin this week. ""It's not a Greek problem, it's a European problem,"" Mouzalas said.  ['We're never getting out of here': How refugees got stranded in Greece]  In Athens, the president will use the city's history as the cradle of democracy as the backdrop to talk about the importance of European unity, but it is unclear how his message will resonate at home after an election that suggests Americans are prepared to turn inward.  Obama also will advocate additional debt relief for Greece, even as he prods Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to undertake more institutional reforms. But George Papaconstantinou, who served as Greece's finance minister from October 2009 to June 2011, said that with just two months left in Obama's term, his words will have limited influence, especially given Trump's victory. ""The reality is that this is post-election, so while it is welcome, it does carry less weight than before,"" Papaconstantinou said. ""This is not 2010, when he was calling [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel to get involved. This is not the same. I don't think this is going to change anything much in Berlin."" Ben Rhodes, the White House deputy national security adviser, said the president's speech will show ""the need to recognize the challenges presented by globalization, which are manifested in many recent elections including our own,"" but will still advocate policies to ""invest in democratic governance, open markets . . . and combat inequality."" A fragile E.U. deal with Turkey and moves by Balkan nations to seal their borders to migrants have reduced last year's flood of arrivals to a steady trickle. The number of migrants arriving in Greece each day has fallen from an average of 7,000 a day in October 2015 to 100 now. But the region is still coping with major fallout.  The continent remains divided on how to deal with the historic wave of asylum seekers, and some national leaders are arguing that Europe should turn away most of them. Merkel, who last year famously welcomed refugees to Germany, has in recent months faced steep political losses and a growing public backlash. In fact, the rhetoric in Europe today echoes the debate over immigration in the United States, with opponents decrying cultural invasion and security risks from the arriving newcomers.  Obama will be retracing the steps (though in far greater comfort) of nearly 900,000 migrants who transited last year from Greece to Germany.  Pro-refugee and rights groups called Obama's visit an opportunity to highlight the plight of migrants, particularly the tens of thousands stranded in dire conditions in Greece. ""We think it's a great move. We hope Obama will be bold,"" said Eva Cosse, Greece specialist for Human Rights Watch. ""He needs to be blunt about the situation in Greece and the lack of European Union solidarity to help these people."" According to a recent report from Amnesty International, many migrants trapped in Greece are living in appalling conditions in unheated camps. An additional 16,000 people are stuck on Greek islands in severely overcrowded camps. The rights group's report said there was no effective system to identify vulnerable individuals, such as pregnant women, elderly people, victims of torture, people with disabilities or unaccompanied children, and many are not being provided with the specialized services they need, putting them at heightened risk.  One of the biggest problems is roughly 2,500 unaccompanied minors, some of whom are initially kept in detention by Greek authorities. Roughly half of them, Cosse said, are unaccounted for. Mouzalas said the conditions in the centers ""are not very good, but we make them better every day."" He noted that 400 of the unaccompanied minors have the right to be reunified with family members elsewhere in Europe, but these countries have accepted only 90 of them. ""That's a very big focus,"" he said, referring to unaccompanied minors, adding that younger children are now attending local schools with Greek children.  ""If we had not created these camps, these people would have been in the middle of fields in mud, their children would not be integrated in schools, and their sick would not be in hospitals,"" Mouzalas added. Still, Yonous Muhammadi, president of the Greek Forum of Refugees, said the global community must act soon or these refugees could be permanently marginalized. ""If we continue this absurdity like this, it means there is no way for the integration of these people into Greek society,"" Muhammadi said. While Mouzalas acknowledged that the Greek government was still struggling to handle the influx of migrants, he said E.U. authorities have failed to deliver critical assistance on several fronts. Three years ago, Greece did not have an asylum service; it now has one of Europe's largest. But while it has asked other E.U. countries to send more than 400 asylum specialists to Greece, they have dispatched just 30.  [Germany used to be the promised land for migrants, but no longer]  Karl Kopp, spokesman for the Germany-based refugee activist group Pro Asyl, said he hoped Obama would focus on the plight of migrants as a counterpoint to rising right-wing sentiment against them. He urged Obama to pledge that the United States will take in more refugees -- but said he recognizes the limits on an outgoing president.  ""Obama won't be able to write the check he would like to write, because he won't be in power for much longer,"" Kopp said.  Faiola reported from Berlin. "

Voters chose a 48-year-old, urbane, liberal black man, then a 70-year-old, unrepentantly coarse white man who is conservative, or something. Ain't that America? Change comes in all forms and with wrenching lurches in a nation founded by bloody revolt and enervated through the generations by political and cultural revolution, sometimes to the edge of bloodshed or over. There's no getting a grip on this country. The U.S. serves up in-your-face cowboy culture, in-your-face counterculture, aggressively faith-based political movements, electric Bernie Sanders socialism and lots more chances to smoke pot legally, as well as workaday lives and pinstriped suits. Americans vote for shake-up artists, not every time but enough times to set the country apart from democracies where the ship of state turns more slowly and majestically.  ""The path that this country has taken has never been a straight line,"" Obama said Wednesday. ""We zig and we zag."" Obama, the zig, was a guy so cool in the eyes of much of the world that he got a Nobel Peace Prize before he'd had a chance to do much. (At the time, in his first year, the U.S. was fighting two wars.) Trump, the zag, is a hurler of insults, a raw orator you can't turn away from if you can bring yourself to tune in, a boor with women, a peddler of falsehoods that made millions of eyes roll but spoke to a larger truth in the eyes of supporters. Foreigners shake their heads at a country that over the years defines cool, then represents what crazy looks like. Trump won with the backing of a long-prized, but declining, segment of white voters, especially men, especially less educated ones. They were on top of the political world for ages, part of Richard Nixon's Silent Majority, Reagan's haul of blue-collar Democrats and Bill Clinton's bubbas. Now they fade in an increasingly diverse country. But Tuesday, everything old was new again and they said: Yes, we still can. Obama came to national attention with a speech of poetry and power that dreamed of red states and blue states joined spiritually as united states. It took the breath away of some Republicans as well as many Democrats. It was a pipe dream, he admitted years later. Divisions of red and blue, white and black, young and old, coastal and heartland, are epic now -- tribal. Though polar opposites in character, politics and experience, Obama and Trump have some commonality. They both seized on dissatisfaction and rode the revolutionary impulse to success. Though not a neophyte like Trump, Obama had to claw against the establishment -- personified in 2008 by primary rival Hillary Clinton -- and benefited from that underdog posture. This time Democrats served up the establishment, in Clinton, the candidate who told snickering donors about the ""irredeemable"" ''deplorables"" backing Trump, and woke up Wednesday to devastation, if they ever slept. Obama and Trump tapped their different political tribes on the way to the White House, but with some overlap. In Ohio's Belmont County, which Obama won in 2008, Trump swept almost 70 percent of the votes. In nearby Mahoning County, which Obama won by 28 points in 2012, Clinton edged Trump by only three points. In other words, some people in working-class America who voted for Obama before turned to Trump this time. So, now, a nation that is pretty upbeat about the job the cool black president is doing hands the reins to a man who spun conspiracy theories about Obama's country of birth. They will be together on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, peacefully handing over power. It is usually a moment of grace and probably, somehow, will be that once more. Then it's on with the zigzag, a time to be certain of nothing except that revolution, from some quarter at some point, will come again. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Michael Nelson/European Pressphoto Agency)  The Sunday brunch was packed as the sounds of Beyonce and Drake blared from the sound system set up in the corner, as attendees nibbled chicken and waffles and downed mimosas. Those gathered last weekend in a third-floor workspace in downtown Washington set their plates in front of open laptop screens. Forks in one hand, they sent flurries of text messages to voters with the other. Every few minutes -- ding ding ding -- a ringing bell signaled that another 1,000 voters had been contacted. In recent weeks, the Color of Change PAC, the political arm of the decade-old civil rights group, has held nearly 90 such text-a-thons across the country, during which volunteers send scripted text messages to black voters in key electoral battlegrounds. Those messages (3.5 million sent, reaching at least 1.5 million voters) aim to both educate and engage black voters in crucial presidential swing states, contested Senate races and a smattering of local district attorney races that activists believe crucial to advancing criminal justice reform. The efforts are among the largest underway by any of the groups associated with the Black Lives Matter protest movement aimed at swaying today's elections -- a concerted voter education and get-out-the-vote apparatus embedded within a movement whose figureheads have been at times reluctant to engage in electoral politics. ""We are not here to ride for any individual candidate, we're not here to ride for any political party,"" said Rashad Robinson, spokesman for the PAC and executive director of Color of Change, after he paused the music and addressed the crowd. ""We're here to build independent black political power. The type of power that holds whoever is in office accountable, that translates our presence in our world into the power to change the rules.""   [Why Hillary Clinton and her rivals are struggling to grasp Black Lives Matter]   In a method similar to that employed by Bernie Sanders's primary campaign, volunteers are each given 500 names and numbers at a time and, using a custom computer interface, type personalized text messages to voters. In early voting states if they had cast their ballots, and others if they knew who they planned to support in the presidential and Senate races. Even more specifically, the outreach has focused on black voters in four local district attorneys races, where the civil rights group hopes it can amplify on the ground work by local organizations to oust tough-on-crime prosecutors and see them replaced with reformers, which for years has been a major focus of protest groups. ""They are the most powerful actors in the criminal justice space,"" said Robinson, who noted that of the more than 2,300 elected prosecutors, nearly 95 percent are white and about 85 percent of them run for reelection unopposed. ""They will determine whether someone gets a misdemeanor or a felony, whether a police officer is held accountable, whether or not someone in your family or someone you love and care about is given the benefit of the doubt."" Hoping to build on Democratic primary wins in prosecutor's races in Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis and Orlando -- in which local and national activists helped topple incumbents -- the Color of Change campaign has targeted prosecutor's races in Columbus, Ohio; Cincinnati; Tampa, and Houston. While Robinson says he doesn't expect his group's preferred candidates to be victorious in every race, he stresses that by engaging voters on criminal justice issues as they pertain to specific races, activists are empowering themselves to better hold local prosecutors accountable no matter who wins. ""The district attorney is one of the most powerful positions in local government,"" said Tasha Jackson, an organizer with the Texas Organizing Project, which has released a platform of criminal justice reforms and is campaigning on behalf of Kim Ogg, a Democrat who is challenging Republican incumbent Devon Anderson in the county that includes Houston. Jackson, who has been an organizer for criminal and juvenile justice reform for 15 years, says that it was only in recent years -- as high-profile deaths of black men and women at the hands of the police turned attention to how rarely officers are charged or convicted -- did she realize how vital it was that political pressure be applied to prosecutors' races. ""We've been fighting these fights for so long, but for too long the district attorneys races have been overlooked,"" she said. Activists in Harris County and elsewhere are hoping to emulate victories in Cook County, Ill.; Orlando; St. Louis, and Cleveland, where prosecutors with tough on crime reputations and central roles in the prosecutions, or lack thereof, in high-profile, racially charged cases have been booted from office in recent months.   [Black Lives Matter won on Tuesday. Prosecutors Lost.]   Many are quick to reference the primary defeat of Anita Alvarez in Cook County, which came not long after the release of the video showing the police shooting death of Laquan McDonald, which she and other local officials had withheld from the public for more than a year. Amid outrage at the handling of the case, Alvarez received just 29 percent of the vote, losing the March primary to challenger Kim Foxx. In a similar effort, activist groups in Cleveland worked to turn out voters to oust Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty, who was criticized for his handling of the shooting death in 2014 of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old who was playing with a toy gun when a police officer shot him to death. With Foxx expected to win today's general election, activists nationwide view the Chicago race as a model of how rage in the streets can be siphoned into direct power at the ballot box that drives reform. ""We were seeing a ton of direct actions and people taking to the street but we know that doesn't necessarily always translate to people at the polls,"" said D'Angelo Bester, executive director of the Chicago Worker's Center for Racial Justice, who said a coalition of local activist groups contacted about 100,000 black and Latino voters in Cook County in advance of the primary. ""So we contacted voters we contacted voters, asked them who were they supporting, and if they would be willing to vote for Kim Foxx."" There was much discussion at the beginning of the presidential race about what, if any, role the national protest movement around policing and criminal justice would play in the contest. Democratic candidates, including the eventual nominees Hillary Clinton, eagerly sought audience with many of the young activists. Candidates of both parties found their rallies interrupted by protesters waving signs and screaming chants. The #BlackLivesMatter network, a collective of dozens of BLM chapters as well as allied organizations, said early in the cycle that they were not planning to endorse any candidate in the presidential race. Exit polls following the Democratic primaries showed that, despite two years of vocal black political activism, young black voters were not voting at rates higher than they did in 2008, when Barack Obama first appeared on the presidential ballot.   [Despite Black Lives Matter, young black Americans aren't voting in higher numbers]   ""Many young black voters are not as engaged as maybe they have been in years past,"" said the Rev. Cassandra Gould, who has been mobilizing voters in Missouri to vote against Amendment Six, a ballot measure that would allow the state to institute new voter ID laws. ""But it's our belief that local issues matter and that it's those local issues that will help keep people engaged."" Concerned, at least in part, that the young black men and women whose protests seized the nation's attention for the past several years may be disillusioned and sit out today's presidential election, several prominent activists such as Deray Mckesson and Brittany Packnett publicly declared their personal support for Clinton.   [DeRay Mckesson: Why I'm voting for Hillary Clinton]   Bester, 40, like many of the organizers associated with the broader protest movement, says he is disillusioned by the choices in the presidential contest. The fact that Hillary Clinton defeated Bernie Sanders in the primary, partly because of black voters, makes him ""sick to my stomach."" But, he notes, his organization's and his own personal get-out-the-vote efforts have continued. ""We've been telling folks that, you may not like Hillary, but there are other races in this state that you need to turn out for,"" he said. ""The key is going to be building political power around these issues that we can turn into momentum during off-year elections, too."" That aim -- building political power -- has been at the center of Color of Change's mission since its founding after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. At the time, activists found themselves dismayed by the poor government response, which Robinson describes as no one in the government ""being afraid to disappoint black people."" In the years since, the group has formed powerful membership campaigns, launching and executing efforts aimed at voter mobilization, fundraising and pressuring corporations to both improve their diversity practices and withhold funding, advertising and partnerships from media companies whose coverage has been racially insensitive or inflammatory. Earlier this year, the group's PAC pressured sponsors to pull out of the Republican National Convention, and in recent years has been involved in the national push for police and criminal justice reform -- arguing that by engaging voters on criminal justice issues, they will be able to force otherwise reluctant prosecutors to adopt reforms or face political ouster. ""I think the movement has influenced the conversation and the broader presidential election in how it has raised the visibility of the issue of state violence and mass incarceration,"" said Arisha Hatch, executive director of the Color of Change Political Action Committee. ""It seems to me that there is a clear choice at the top of the ticket, but it's the local races that can have more of an impact on the daily lives of black people."""
