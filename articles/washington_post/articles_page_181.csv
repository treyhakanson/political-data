The victory of President-elect Donald Trump has startled European allies because of campaign pledges that seem to pull back from the traditional U.S. commitment to transatlantic security. Obama urged the leaders of Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain to continue seeking solutions with the incoming administration ""on the basis of the core values that define the United States and Europe as open democracies,"" according to a White House statement. Obama joined with his European counterparts in strongly supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as the cornerstone of Western security, while backing their calls to uphold sanctions against Vladimir Putin's Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 and is seen as aiding pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine. Also on the agenda was the Iraqi-led offensive to retake the northern city of Mosul from the Islamic State, as well as the resumption of attacks in Aleppo and other parts of Syria by government forces and their ally Russia.     President Barack Obama arrived at a meeting with European leaders in Germany on Nov. 18 in his last planned foreign visit as president. (Reuters)   ""The president emphasized that de-escalation and a diplomatic solution to the ongoing conflict are the only viable ways to end the suffering, prevent another migration crisis, and move toward a political transition,"" according to the White House statement.  [Obama bids bittersweet farewell to closest partner on world stage]  Although Obama's visit here had the usual trappings, including a group photo with the five European leaders who had converged in Berlin to meet with him, it had a more subdued tone than past visits. By midday, he had left the German Chancellery under a drizzle for Air Force One to head to his trip's final stop, Peru. The summit took shape as Europe is awash in its own tensions, over Britain's vote to leave the European Union, differences on a defense strategy, and a rise of populist nationalism that is challenging the fortunes of several leaders across the continent. Maintaining European and U.S. sanctions on Russia in particular remains a top concern amid signs of a possible thaw between Washington and Moscow under Trump. This week, Trump and Putin agreed in a telephone conversation that U.S.-Russian relations were ""unsatisfactory,"" and they vowed to work together to improve them, the Kremlin said. But Obama has said that the president-elect, in their one-on-one meeting after the election, ""expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,"" including with NATO.   U.S. President Barack Obama boards Air Force One as he departs Berlin. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)  During Friday's talks in Berlin, Obama and European leaders ""unanimously agreed"" on the need to press Russia to stand by promises to help calm the conflict in Ukraine, and said that ""Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia"" must remain in place until it does. In a joint news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after the summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed impatience that peace in Ukraine is still far from reach. ""Not enough progress can be seen,"" she said. Rajoy described thriving populism as one of the most important issues confronting the European Union, acknowledging that 2017 would be a difficult election year, with nationalist forces vying for power in France, Germany and the Netherlands. Merkel, commenting on her growing influence in the European Union and globally, said: ""One person alone can never solve everything, we're only strong together. . . . I will do what is my duty as the German chancellor, namely on the one hand to serve the people in Germany, but that includes for me to work for European unity and European success."" Even among European powers, positions vary on Russia. Some urge warmer ties, while others are warning against cozying up to Putin because of the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and the rebel clashes in Ukraine. Speaking beside Merkel on Thursday to the media, Obama urged Trump to ""stand up to Russia"" at the right times. ""My hope is he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest if we just cut some deals with Russia -- even if it hurts people or violates international norms or leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in countries like Syria -- that we just do what is convenient at the time,"" he said.  [Europe ponders: How to deal with Trump?]  Obama, in talks with Merkel, conceded Thursday that it would be ""naive"" of him to expect a breakthrough in the Syrian conflict before he leaves office. Earlier this week, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, speaking to Portuguese TV, opened the door to a change under Trump, whom he described as a ""natural ally."" Merkel cautioned against any bargains with Assad. ""He has brought untold suffering on his people, if you look at Aleppo and other places,"" she said. ""When you talk to the many Syrian refugees who have fled here to Germany, they will be able to tell you their own personal story, and the majority of them -- the great majority of them -- fled from Assad, and most of them not even fled the Islamic State. So I don't see him as an ally."" The wild-card nature of Trump's presidency is amplified in Europe by the continent's own internal pressures. Nowhere are those tensions more on display than in the talks over Britain's departure from the European Union. British Prime Minister Theresa May will hold a one-on-one meeting with Merkel as the Germans call for stiff penalties as the price of Britain's exit. Wolfgang Schauble, Germany's finance minister, laid out a tough bargaining position with Britain in an interview with the Financial Times. He insisted that any deal would mean that London must still pay billions into the E.U. budget beyond its exit date, perhaps stretching to 2030. He also said Britain should be prepared to see financial services industries flee London in favor of cities such as Frankfurt so that they can more easily work with the European Union. Particularly after Trump's election, European leaders are calling for the region to take more responsibility for its own security. This week, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen singled out Britain for being obstructionist as other member states moved to forge a deeper defense alliance, including forming a possible European army. ""The biggest resistance is coming from the British,"" von der Leyen told the German weekly Die Zeit. ""The USA will always be our most important and closest partner, but we Europeans cannot derive our strength from America's. . . . Europe must decide whether it wants to shape events or be a pawn."" Underscoring the heightened concern, European officials are speaking in increasingly stark terms. Manuel Valls, France's prime minister, issued a dire warning in the German capital on Thursday, calling for Berlin and Paris to quickly forge deals to improve economic growth and generate jobs amid strong challenges from anti-establishment nationalists. ""Europe is in danger of falling apart,"" Valls said. ""So Germany and France have a huge responsibility.""

The U.S. Marshals Service said 53-year-old Patrick Carothers, deputy commander of the agency's Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force, died after being shot twice as a team of officers tried to serve a warrant at a mobile home in rural Long County. The slain suspect was identified as Dontrell Montese Carter. He was wanted in Sumter County, South Carolina, since September on charges of attempted murder of police officers, domestic violence and illegally discharging a weapon, the Marshals Service said in a news release. The agency said Carothers and his team had tracked Carter to a mobile home just outside Ludowici, about 55 miles southeast of Savannah. Carothers was shot as they were entering the home. Law officers returned fire and shot Carter multiple times, the Marshals Service said. Both men were taken to area hospitals, where they were pronounced dead.  ""The fugitive who killed Deputy Commander Carothers was extremely dangerous, wanted for trying to kill law enforcement officers and deliberately evading authorities,"" David Harlow, deputy director of the Marshals Service, said in a statement. ""Pat is a hero and our thoughts and prayers are with his wife and five children."" Carothers served 26 years with the Marshals Service and had been deputy commander of the fugitive task force for more than a year. Carter, 25, had been wanted in South Carolina since Sept. 18. The Sumter County Sheriff's Office said at the time that officers tried to arrest Carter after receiving calls that he had assaulted his girlfriend and fired gunshots into the home of a relative who tried to intervene. Carter ended up leading officers on a car chase, the sheriff's office said, and fired shots at the officers as he left his vehicle and escaped on foot. Sumter County Sheriff Anthony Dennis offered condolences to the slain marshal's family in a statement Friday. His office declined further comment. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The World Health Organization was quick to note that the move does not mean the agency is downgrading the threat of the virus that has spread across Latin America, the Caribbean and elsewhere. Nearly 30 countries have reported birth defects linked to Zika, with over 2,100 cases of nervous-system malformations reported in Brazil alone. The officials also emphasized that the now-lifted ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" was declared in February, when Zika clusters were appearing and a sharp increase in research was needed -- with the looming Rio Olympics in mind. WHO said the emergency measures had led the world to an ""urgent and coordinated response."" But the virus has continued to spread. The agency acknowledged ""many aspects of this disease and associated consequences still remain to be understood, but this can best be done through sustained research.""  ""It is a significant and enduring public health challenge, but it no longer represents an emergency,"" Dr. David Heymann, who heads the WHO emergency committee on Zika, said after the panel met for the fifth time this year. ""There was no downgrading of this."" Heymann said recommendations made in recent months were now being ""internalized"" at the Geneva-based agency.  ""If anything, this has been escalated in importance by becoming activities that will be continued in the long-term in the World Health Organization,"" he said. Traditionally, WHO's emergency declarations are designed to motivate governments to take steps to curb epidemics.  ""But Zika has traveled quite far by now. It's not quite clear to me what the impact"" of continuing the declaration would be, Stephen Morse, an infectious disease expert at New York City's Columbia University, said. Containing the spread of the virus was one reason for the February declaration, Heymann said. But its real purpose was to stimulate more study on the alarming link between Zika and devastating birth defects. Zika, which first was observed as a more minor health threat in 1947, is mainly spread by mosquitoes, but also can be spread through sex. Most infected people don't get sick. It can cause a mild illness, with fever, rash and joint pain. But the recent outbreak shows it can also cause microcephaly, or abnormally small heads, and brain damage in newborn children whose mothers were infected, leading to severe developmental problems and sowing grave concerns of would-be parents in countries hit by the virus. Zika has been linked as well to a temporary paralysis condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome. Since the last emergency committee meeting on Sept. 1, two countries in southeast Asia and six other countries have reported microcephaly potentially linked to Zika virus, WHO said. Responding to the WHO announcement, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control called the move ""technical"" and reiterated its position that pregnant women should avoid traveling to areas with local transmission of Zika. Dr. Peter Salama, WHO's director of emergencies, said the new phase of fighting the virus requires development donors ""to step up to the plate and see this for what it is, which is a long-term problem that the world will have to deal with for many years to come.""  ""We are sending the message that Zika is here to stay, and WHO's response is here to stay in a very robust manner,"" Salama said. The WHO's decision is understandable, given that the pace of new Zika infections has dropped off considerably in recent months, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the infectious disease chief for the U.S. National Institutes of Health. But he also noted that Brazil -- which for a long time was the focus of the international epidemic -- is heading into its hottest months, when mosquito activity peaks. And it's possible that the outbreak could re-intensify, he said.  ""I'm not going to agree or disagree"" with the WHO decision, Fauci said. ""But if we have another resurgence as we enter into the summer months in the southern hemisphere, they should be ready to re-install it."" ___ Stobbe contributed from New York.

The long-running saga of the fate of the 74-year-old Ramsey Homes ended peacefully with council members approving a special-use permit that will allow the development of a four-story, E-shaped building facing Patrick at Wythe streets. ""It has been a long road, but the positive benefits include a process that has involved the broader community. I think we ended up with a much better architectural expression,"" said Roy Priest, chief executive of the Alexandria Redevelopment and Housing Authority (ARHA).  [Angry Alexandria council meeting exposes rift over preservation, density]  Ramsey Homes, built in 1941 as segregated housing for federal defense workers, has long been considered out of date. There is no central air-conditioning, the heat is inadequate, bathrooms are not accessible to the disabled, and laundry water backs up into neighboring units. The housing authority has periodically replaced windows and repaired roofs, but because of how the four buildings were constructed, it was not possible to improve plumbing and electrical connections. The structures no longer meet standards for federally subsidized affordable housing. The proposal early this year to replace the four two-story structures triggered an epic local battle between those who wanted to preserve some of them for historical purposes, those who sought more open space in a dense urban environment and those who said the initial proposal would overcrowd the immediate area, where a block of two- and three-story private homes faces the project. The city has lost more than 12,000 low or moderately priced apartments since 2000, and with rents continuing to increase each year, advocates of affordable housing said the chance to preserve very-low-income public housing as well as add more affordable housing should take precedence. After an acrimonious, six-hour hearing in February that exposed both the unhappiness of residents and the fault lines between the council and the housing authority, the council killed the proposal, only to reverse itself three days later. The following month, the city agreed to work more closely with the housing authority to figure out how to rezone and allow the redevelopment. At the end of June, the council agreed to allow a modified redevelopment to go forward but offered few details. Saturday's vote filled in those blanks.  [Ramsey Homes to be torn down, replaced by mixed-income housing]  The $17.5 million project will provide 15 very-low-income units as well as 37 moderate- and low-income units in the single 45-foot-tall brick-facade building. The building will also include 31 underground parking spaces -- a response to neighbors' concerns -- and 35 percent of the half-block property will be open space that will have two courtyards as well as a small park at the corner of Patrick and Pendleton streets. Some type of recognition of the site's historical importance will be designed and erected separately. The city is giving the housing authority a $1.1 million loan for infrastructure -- such as putting utilities underground, reducing stormwater runoff and moving fire hydrants -- that cannot be covered by a tax credit equity. The city has also granted ARHA $200,000 for consultant costs. On Saturday, ARHA repaid a $481,000 loan to the city for its Quaker Hill development and will repay $5.8 million for Glebe Park redevelopment before the end of 2016, Priest said. Before the Ramsey Homes project moves forward, ARHA will have to win a federal tax-credit competition next spring, complete a federal historical review and get federal approval to ""dispose"" of the buildings. If those hurdles are cleared, construction would begin in early 2018 and be completed by the end of 2019. "
4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/09/winners-and-losers-from-the-2016-election/	Winners and losers from the 2016 election	"      Early on the morning of Nov. 9, Republican President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York, declaring victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   Let me sum up the 2016 election in two words: holy crap. This election is one for the ages, an epic upset that 100 years from now, we will all be discussing on our apparats. As always after big news events, I picked some of the best and worst of the just-concluded elections. My winners and losers are below. (And, no, this won't likely be my final word on the winners and the losers. Think of this as a first of a several part series.) Winners * President-elect Donald Trump: He was right. We -- or at least most of us -- were wrong. (More on that below.) Trump, from almost the second he entered the Republican primary race last June, had an intuitive sense of the state of the electorate. Trump understood their anger, their anxiety, their sense of alienation. He understood that what he said mattered less than how he said it. That his celebrity gave him both access to communities where other Republicans feared to tread and a different bar of what was acceptable from voters. He understood that his many controversial statements and, at times, outlandish policy proposals weren't really held against him by voters -- they simply liked that he was willing to say stuff, even if they didn't agree with what that stuff was. He understood that there were a lot of ""forgotten"" people who were ignored not only by the elites and the establishment but also by polls. You can like Trump or you can hate him. But it is indisputable that he got this election exactly right. Period.      The Fix's Chris Cillizza explains how Donald Trump beat expectations in rural areas and among Latino and black voters, propelling him to a surprising election win. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   * Reince Priebus: The Republican National Committee chairman took massive amounts of incoming -- from Democrats and Republicans -- for his unwavering support of Trump's candidacy. I wrote a few months ago that Priebus was being unfairly maligned, given that he really had no other options other than to steadfastly back Trump. But there were lots of members of his own party who were waiting with their knives out for Priebus, expecting that a Trump blowout loss would be the death knell of his chairmanship. Those knives are sheathed now. And Trump -- to his credit -- understood what Priebus had done for him, bringing the chairman onstage and asking him to say a few words to the adoring crowd. The cherry on top for Priebus? His home state of Wisconsin went for the Republican presidential nominee for the first time since Ronald Reagan in 1984.    Reince Priebus (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)  * Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.)/Ward Baker: Wicker was one of the lowest-profile chairmen of the Republican Senate campaign arm in modern memory. And Baker, the executive director of that committee, matched that low profile. The duo kept their heads down and worked like hell to keep expectations in check. After all, Republicans had to defend 24 of their own seats, including in Democratic-leaning states like Illinois, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And it was a presidential year -- with an expected boost in Democratic turnout. All of that makes what Wicker and Baker accomplished Tuesday night all the more amazing. Republicans lost just one seat -- that of Sen. Mark Kirk (Ill.) -- amid all that uncertainty and volatility. (A second seat in New Hampshire is teetering on the edge as of publishing this.) Reelecting Sens. Patrick J. Toomey in Pennsylvania and Ron Johnson in Wisconsin are remarkable feats; finding ways to get Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri and Richard Burr of North Carolina over the finish line are equally amazing. And Wicker and Baker undoubtedly would also share the credit for their triumph with Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida, whose strong campaigns saved the committee millions of dollars.    (The Washington Post)  * Kellyanne Conway: Conway was a known commodity in the polling world before this race. But now she's a known commodity across the country and the world. Conway did what neither Corey Lewandowski nor Paul Manafort could; she managed to manage Donald Trump. She did so by using her own public megaphone -- a near-constant TV presence and an active Twitter account -- to encourage Trump's better angels, always pushing him to stay focused on issues and away from personal attacks. If you watched the campaign and the candidate, you know Conway didn't succeed all the time -- or even most of the time. But she rode the wave and stuck the landing. She can write her own ticket for what she wants to do next -- whether that's inside or outside the Trump White House. * Allan Lichtman: There are very few people who can say, unimpeachably, that they called this election. Lichtman, a distinguished professor of history at American University, is one of them. Lichtman first came to our attention in May when he told The Fix's Peter Stevenson that his model -- based on a set of 13 true/false statements -- predicted a Trump victory. It was a model that had successfully predicted the winner of the presidential race in every election since 1984. We went back to Lichtman in October -- amid dire poll numbers for Trump everywhere -- to see whether he wanted to hedge his bet. He didn't. He doubled down, insisting that he trusted in the model. And, holy hell, he was right.      Professor Allan Lichtman, author of ""The Keys to the White House,"" explains why his keys still point to a Democratic loss in the 2016 presidential election - and a Donald Trump victory. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   * Michelle Obama: The soon-to-be-former first lady may be the only Democrat who emerges from this dumpster fire of an election in good shape. She was the unquestioned star of the 2016 campaign, delivering the two best speeches (her convention speech and her speech condemning Trump's behavior toward women) anyone gave in the race. And now Michelle Obama will be the first name on the lips of many Democrats already preparing for the 2020 presidential race against Trump.     Losers    Hillary Clinton with her husband, former president Bill Clinton, during her speech after the election. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)  * Hillary Clinton: Twenty months ago, Clinton looked for all the world like a president-in-waiting. By dint of her polling numbers, her resume, her fundraising capacity and her lack of a serious Democratic primary opponent, Clinton was rightly described as the biggest non-incumbent front-runner in modern political history. But the idea of Clinton the candidate never matched the reality of Clinton on the campaign trail. She underwhelmed repeatedly, running a too-cautious primary campaign that allowed a little-known Sen. Bernie Sanders to emerge as exactly what Clinton's campaign had hoped to avoid: a viable liberal challenger. Support for Clinton -- even after she won the primary campaign -- seemed obligatory rather than excited. The campaign she ran was ruthlessly efficient and organized. But what it never seemed to be was joyful or exuberant. It felt, to put a fine point on it, dutiful. Clinton's message was in keeping with that duty-bound sensibility. The main reason she gave for people to vote for her was that, well, she was ready for it and the other guy wasn't. Clinton was never -- in this campaign or in the 2008 race -- able to show that she was something more than the hyper-prepared, supersmart, best student in the class. Remarkably, Clinton did show more of herself in her concession speech Wednesday morning, the latest example of politicians doing their best when they've lost something they wanted so badly. But make no mistake: This was a colossal swing and miss for Clinton in a race that was widely seen as a hanging curveball for her and her party.      Hillary Clinton spoke to supporters, Nov. 9, offering a message of thanks, apology and hope. Here are the key moments from that fervent address. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   * President Obama: The outgoing president left no doubt that he saw his own legacy on the line in the 2016 election. He was an active and aggressive advocate for Clinton on the campaign trail, insisting that the progress he had made over these past eight years could be lost if Trump was elected. But for the third election in the past four, Obama was unable to transfer his popularity to his party. (Democrats suffered massive losses in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections and now, this.) It remains to be seen whether Trump will make good on his promises to undo a number of Obama's signature accomplishments -- the Iran nuclear deal, the Affordable Care Act, etc. That Trump was elected on a promise to, essentially, erase the record of the Obama administration speaks to how a majority of Americans may like Obama, but they're not too keen on his policies. * Organization/Money/TV ads: By every traditional measure of campaign success, Clinton should have rolled to victory. She had a carefully built and well-staffed organization nationally. She raised more than $1 billion, dwarfing the amount Trump raked in. She used that financial edge to flood the TV airwaves in swing states with ads, many of which, again judged by traditional standards, were quite effective. This ad, in particular, should have been a showstopper for Clinton:      Hillary Clinton's campaign released this attack ad against Donald Trump July 11, featuring some of his most controversial statements as seen through the eyes of children. (Hillary Clinton)   But Trump still won. And in winning he proved that his seemingly outlandish focus on his Twitter feed and his large-scale rallies was the right move for him. And that Clinton's focus on organization and money was, generally speaking, a waste of time. It remains to be seen whether Trump, thanks to his celebrity, is a one-off when it comes to ignoring the traditional measures of winning campaigns or whether things have been fundamentally altered on that front. * The media: Look, there's just no way to sugarcoat it: Everyone -- and I mean everyone -- in the political press and punditry expected Clinton to win. She did not win. That is a failure on our part to properly understand what the electorate was telling us. What it is not is evidence of some sort of inherent liberal bias. As I noted above, every measure that history suggests is an effective indicator of how candidates win pointed to Clinton. As did the vast majority of national and swing state polling. As journalists, we rely on the past to teach us about the present (and the future). That approach normally works -- until the past is no longer predictive of the present. The time has come to throw out all of our assumptions about how the American public sees itself and what it wants in its leaders. It's time to start anew. * Evan Bayh/Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.): The former Indiana senator, who was recruited into the race by Schumer, was seen as a shoo-in when he decided, at the last minute, to get into the open-seat race left behind by retiring Sen. Daniel Coats (R). After all, he had served two terms in the Senate (he retired in 2010) had a golden last name (his father, Birch, is a political legend in the state) and had oodles of cash ($10 million) sitting in a campaign account just waiting to be spent. Turns out that Bayh was an opposition researcher's dream, most notably because he barely ever visited Indiana after he stopped representing the state in the Senate. Bayh's defeat, announced early Tuesday evening, was a sign of things to come for Schumer, who had hoped to become Senate majority leader when the new Congress convenes in January. That dream will now have to wait for at least two years and maybe quite a bit longer; Democrats have to defend 25 seats, including five that sit in ruby-red states, in 2018."
5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/11/09/so-about-last-night/	So, about last night …	"I was wrong about literally everything last night. But you probably were, too! We're all idiots today. So what can we, the incorrect many, take away from last night? There's something to be said for the idea that Trump rode a wave of white resentment into the White House. But this is, at best, a half-truth. I'll discuss the demographics in a moment; for now, let's focus on the resentment. ""Family Guy""'s Seth MacFarlane made the totally reasonable point that ""the Left expended so much energy over the last several years being outraged over verbal missteps, accidental innuendo, 'tasteless tweets' ... in the name of clickbait, that when the REAL threat to equality emerged, we'd cried wolf too many times to be heard."" This is a variation on the ""But he fights!"" defense/critique of Donald Trump. He gives voice to people who have spent the social media age watching viral outrage after viral outrage consume news cycles and destroy lives, to people who look at the silliness on college campuses and recoil at the thought of giving such institutions tens of thousands of dollars to fill their children's heads with nonsense ideas. As Robby Soave noted at Reason, ""Trump won because he convinced a great number of Americans that he would destroy political correctness."" But angry white dudes wouldn't be enough to get Trump over the top. It's not particularly surprising that black voters supported Trump slightly more strongly than they did Romney--after all, Obama wasn't on the ballot and SNL's ""How's He Doing"" skit rather perfectly captures the black community's unwavering support for the first black president. Nor is it particularly surprising that African Americans were a lower percentage of the electorate than they were in 2008 and 2012. That missing black vote helped sink Hillary's campaign, however, proving basically every pollster wrong in the process. One can't help but look at the data and wonder if the Democratic Party can win a national campaign without nominating a minority candidate going forward. It's worth considering for a moment just how little impact big stars had on the race. Endorsements from King James did not translate into support from the Beyhive. Clinton couldn't ride a wave of Broad City GIFs and Lena Dunham tweets into the White House. A late concert from Chris Christie favorites, Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi, weren't enough to swing the white working class of Pennsylvania. Indeed, one wonders if the meddling of such big names only reinforced the resentment that helped fuel Trump's ultimate victory. Professor Jonathan Haidt's piece of advice for Democratic partisans on Twitter is, I think, wise: ""Do not respond by doubling down on identity politics. That is poison in a multi-ethnic democracy."" I wonder if it will be heeded. Most of what I've seen on the social media service today suggests it will not be. But that brings me to my final takeaway from the election, and it's a rather banal one: Twitter created a series of impenetrable bubbles this cycle, and bubbles of this sort are not healthy for members of the media. They're not healthy for anyone, really, but they're doubly unhealthy for those of us who would dare to think they can or should shape the national narrative. If Democrats' takeaway from last night is ""the people of this country are filled with hatred,"" as my own bubble suggests it might be, they will learn no lessons and gain no weapons with which to combat Trump and his successors going forward."

In court, Charles Pugh apologized to the victim, who was under 16 when they illegally engaged in sex acts in 2003 and 2004. He worked at WJBK-TV at the time.  ""I was 31 years old. In many ways I was young and stupid,"" Pugh told Wayne County Judge Thomas Cameron. He said he had returned to his hometown and was enjoying ""making all that money"" and ""having tens of thousands of people who believed in me."" Pugh will be eligible for parole after 51/2 years. His maximum time in prison is 15 years. Pugh was elected city council president in 2009 as Detroit's top vote-getter. He suddenly quit in 2013 and mysteriously left for New York as allegations surfaced about sexual misconduct.

(The Washington Post)   Donald Trump was critical of the federal workforce during his campaign for the presidency, with top advisers making a point of saying as president he should push to make it easier to fire government employees. Now that's he won the White House, what does that mean for federal employees? What follows is a look at some of the top issues for the government workforce under a Trump administration. Trump said he wants to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington. What does that mean for federal employees here? A campaign statement said that Trump would institute ""a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health)."" That reflects language that has been in budget plans that have passed the Republican-controlled House several times in recent years but that never have been enacted, since President Obama almost certainly would have vetoed them. Those plans further set a goal of reducing the workforce by 10 percent, although the Trump position paper set no numeric goal. A separate campaign statement said the workforce has ""many great and committed people"" and ""in the long term, a smaller federal workforce will mean a more honest and effective government, in which it is harder to hide corruption.""   [Trump links federal hiring freeze to fighting corruption]   Also, remember that only about 15 percent of the federal workforce is based in the Washington area, so reductions would fall not just here but nationwide. Meanwhile, another statement called for increasing the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. And a stronger emphasis on border security probably would translate into adding Border Patrol agents. By exempting some categories from cuts and allowing growth elsewhere, the cuts would fall even harder on other programs and agencies. One result could be greater reliance on contractors to get the work done. Other elements of Trump's plan include a five-year ban on White House and congressional officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave government service and a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. Those generally would not affect career federal workers. Trump is famous for saying, ""You're fired!"" Can he just go around doing that to federal workers? A distinction must be made here between political appointees and career federal employees -- he certainly can, and will, say that to the former group, but things are more complex regarding the latter group. There are about 4,000 political appointees in the executive branch who serve at the pleasure of the president. Of those, about 1,100 require Senate confirmation and hold senior jobs at the various departments and smaller agencies. The other roughly 2,900 fill various roles, including as assistants to those higher officials and as the layer between them and the career workforce. [Newt Gingrich tells Trump: Make it easier to fire government workers] With few exceptions, they will be gone by the inauguration or soon afterward and the Trump administration will replace them with its own people. The career federal workforce is much larger -- some 1.8 million permanent, full-time, nonseasonal employees, plus several hundred thousand temporary, part-time or seasonal workers, excluding the self-funding U.S. Postal Service. They receive various protections under civil-service law, including the rights to appeal personnel actions, including firing for merely political reasons. Most cuts to federal employment are the result of budget decisions affecting entire programs rather than individuals. Instead of conducting layoffs, a complex and costly process in the government, it's more common for agencies to offer incentives to leave, such as loosening retirement eligibility rules and offering buyout payments that can be up to $25,000, pretax. Will there be an erosion of federal employees' job rights? The level of accountability in the federal workforce is another issue Republicans in Congress have been pushing in recent years, citing scandals at agencies including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs. They have had some success and could well have more with the White House and Congress in their control. In 2014, a bipartisan law was enacted to limit disciplinary appeal rights of senior executives at VA, but the Obama administration made little use of that authority and this year stopped using it in the face of a court challenge alleging the restrictions violated due-process rights. That effectively put the brakes on several separate attempts to extend those restrictions to executives government-wide and to limit the rights of all VA employees. Those bids were widely seen as setting a precedent, if successful, for similar restrictions government-wide. However, a law enacted in late September with Obama's consent strengthened protections for VA employees who blow the whistle and required discipline up to and including firing for managers who retaliate against them.   [Stronger protections for VA whistleblowers included in bill to keep government open]   A campaign statement said Trump would ""use the powers of the presidency to remove and discipline the federal employees and managers who have violated the public's trust and failed to carry out the duties on behalf of our veterans""; ""ask that Congress pass legislation that empowers the Secretary of the VA to discipline or terminate any employee who has jeopardized the health, safety or well-being of a veteran""; ""create a commission to investigate all the fraud, coverups, and wrong-doing that has taken place in the VA, and present these findings to Congress to spur legislative reform""; and ""protect and promote honest employees at the VA who highlight wrongdoing, and guarantee their jobs will be protected."" While that statement addressed only VA, such moves also could set a precedent for similar policies elsewhere. Other ideas whose chances of enactment probably would improve include extending from one year to two the probation period in which newly hired employees have few job rights, and limiting the practice of putting employees under investigation for disciplinary action on paid leave, which sometimes extends many months or even years. Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). What would that mean for federal employees' health benefits? Maybe not much. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program has been in existence for many decades and operates under a separate set of laws. That program already had included some features made national policy as part of the ACA, such as a ban on denying coverage because of a preexisting condition. One change in that law that did directly impact the FEHBP was to allow coverage of children to continue until they reach age 26; the previous cutoff was 22. That is one provision of the ACA that might be salvaged even in a general repeal. Another provision of direct impact required members of Congress and certain staff members to leave the FEHBP program. One result has been years of wrangling over how the administration interpreted that provision by allowing them to keep the employer contribution toward health care under certain circumstances. Whether they would simply be returned to the FEHBP is an open question. Will retirement and other benefits be on the chopping block? This requires speculation. While the campaign statements did not directly address those benefits, those same Republican budget plans whose chances for enactment have now improved have targeted benefits in various ways. Several of those plans have advocated increasing the required employee contribution toward retirement. Some have specified that the employer and employee shares should be made equal, which for most employees would require they pay in about 6 percent more of their salary; several smaller increases have been enacted in recent years affecting only employees hired after their effective dates. Other recommendations have included eliminating a retirement supplement paid to many who retire relatively early and reducing the interest the government pays in the most popular investment fund in the Thrift Savings Plan, the 401(k)-style program for federal workers. Another common theme has been to make the government contribution toward the FEHBP less generous. Currently, the government pays about 70 percent of the total premium as the employer. Several plans have recommended that it pay a fixed dollar amount instead and increase that amount by less than the overall cost growth in the program. That could spur many enrollees to shift to lower-cost plans, while those who don't could end up paying a greater share toward their health insurance."

Obama praised Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and vowed to work towards a peaceful transition of power to President-elect Trump. (The White House)   President Obama on Wednesday spoke from the White House on the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Here is a full transcript of his remarks.  Good afternoon, everybody. Yesterday, before votes were tallied, I shot a video that some of you may have seen in which I said to the American people, regardless of which side you were on in the election, regardless of whether your candidate won or lost, the sun would come up in the morning.  And that is one bit of prognosticating that actually came true. The sun is up. And I know everybody had a long night. I did as well. I had a chance to talk to President-elect Trump last night about 3:30 in the morning, I think it was, to congratulate him on winning the election and I had a chance to invite him to come to the White House tomorrow to talk about making sure that there is a successful transition between our presidencies. Now, it is no secret that the president-elect and I have some pretty significant differences. But remember, eight years ago President Bush and I had some pretty significant differences. But President Bush's team could not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition so that we could hit the ground running. And one thing you realize quickly in this job is that the presidency and the vice presidency is bigger than any of us. So I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago, and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the president-elect. Because we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world. I also had a chance last night to speak with Secretary Clinton and I just had the chance to hear her remarks. I could not be prouder of her. She has lived an extraordinary life of public service. She was a great first lady. She was an outstanding senator for the state of New York. And she could not have been a better secretary of state. I'm proud of her. A lot of Americans look up to her. Her candidacy and nomination was historic and sends a message to our daughters all across the country that they can achieve at the highest levels of politics. And I'm absolutely confident that she and President Clinton will continue to do great work for people here in the United States and all around the world. Now, everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we're actually all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage. We're not Democrats first. We're not Republicans first. We are Americans first. We're patriots first.  We all want what's best for this country. That's what I heard in Mr. Trump's remarks last night. That's what I heard when I spoke to him directly. And I was heartened by that. That's what the country needs -- a sense of unity, a sense of inclusion, a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law, and respect for each other. I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition. And I certainly hope that's how his presidency has a chance to begin. I also told my team today to keep their heads up, because the remarkable work that they have done day in, day out, often without a lot of fanfare, often with (ph) a lot of -- a lot of attention -- work in agencies, work in obscure areas of policy that make government run better and make it more responsive and make it more efficient, and make it more service-friendly so that it's actually helping more people. That remarkable work has left the next president with a stronger, better country than the one that existed eight years ago. So win or lose in this election, that was always our mission. That was our mission from day one. And everyone on my team should be extraordinarily proud of everything that they have done and so should all of the Americans that I've had a chance to meet all across this country who do the hard work of building on that progress every single day. Teachers in schools, doctors in E.R. clinic, small businesses putting their all into starting something up, making sure they're treating their employees well, all the important work that's done by moms and dads and families and congregations in every state, the work of perfecting this union.  So this was a long and hard fought campaign. A lot of our fellow Americans are exalted today, a lot of Americans are less so, but that's the nature of campaigns, that's the nature of democracy. It is hard and sometimes contentious and noisy and it's not always inspiring.  But to the young people who got into politics for the first time and may be disappointed by the results, I just want you to know, you have to stay encouraged. Don't get cynical, don't ever think you can't make a difference. As Secretary Clinton said this morning, fighting for what is right is worth it. Sometimes you lose an argument, sometimes you lose an election.  You know, the path that this country has taken has never been a straight line. We zig and zag and sometimes we move in ways that some people think is forward and others think is moving back, and that's OK. I've lost elections before. Joe hasn't, but... (LAUGHTER) You know. So I've been sort of sure... BIDEN: But (ph) you beat me badly. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA: That's the way politics works sometimes. We try really hard to persuade people that we're right and then people vote. And then if we lose, we learn from our mistakes, we do some reflection, we lick our wounds, we brush ourselves off, we get back in the arena, we go at it. We try even harder the next time.  The point though is is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens, because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy. That's how this country has moved forward for 240 years. It's how we've pushed boundaries and promoted freedom around the world. That's how we've expanded the rights of our founding to reach all of our citizens. It's how we have come this far. And that's why I'm confident that this incredible journey that we're on, as Americans, will go on. And I'm looking forward to doing everything that I can to make sure that the next president is successful in that. I've said before, I think of this job as being a relay runner. You take the baton, you run your best race and hopefully by the time you hand it off, you're a little further ahead, you've made a little progress. And I can say that we've done that and I want to make sure that handoff is well executed because ultimately we're all on the same team.  All right. Thank you very much, everybody.
