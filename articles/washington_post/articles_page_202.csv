The 53-year-old Magdy Maken, a fish cart vendor, was arrested on Sunday at midnight after an altercation with a policeman, his family's lawyer Ali al-Halawani told The Associated Press. After beating him in the street, the lawyer said, the Coptic Christian Maken was taken to a police station in Cairo's middle-class neighborhood of el-Ameriyah. Hours later, his lifeless body was brought to a nearby hospital with ""torture marks,"" according to al-Halawani. Videos of the vendor's bloodied body later surfaced on social media. In one of the videos, a hospital worker de-shrouded Maken's corpse to reveal a bleeding backside and bruises on his face. A judicial official told The AP that ""unusual circumstances"" surrounded the death. He said police reported arresting Maken for possession of tramadol -- a cheap and thus commonly abused painkiller -- and that Maken later died of diabetes-related complications. He said surveillance cameras inside the police station showed Maken arriving alongside police with the seized drugs.  ""If there was beating and torture, it wouldn't have been caught on camera anyway,"" he said, adding that the two friends who were arrested with Maken gave contradicting testimonies, with one alleging police torture and the other denying it. The official said that while the arresting officer and witnesses were questioned, the forensics report, which he said will be issued within two weeks, will be key in determining the cause of death. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the press. Maken's son, the 30-year-old Malak, told the AP that the last time he saw his father was late Sunday when Maken was heading out to buy food for his horse. On the way, his father got into a quarrel with another driver and a policeman intervened by insulting both parties, said Malak, a.  ""My father responded to the policeman's insults by saying 'and you too' and that was it!"" he said. ""People told me that then it was as if the police were playing football with my father's body. They beat him in a barbaric way and dragged his body across the asphalt,"" he said. When Malak inspected the body, he said he saw ""bruises, and one of his testes smashed.""  ""It was a horrible scene. I can't describe,"" he said. Malak said his father supports a family of 12 and his only source of income is selling fish from his cart. In an attempted naming-and-shaming exercise, some local activists posted pictures online of the officer who allegedly beat Maken to death. The authenticity of the photos could not be immediately verified. Anger at police brutality was a main grievance and driving force behind the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Egypt witnessed a significant rise in cases of police torture, deaths in detention, and forced disappearances. Activists accuse el-Sissi's government of allowing police too much free rein, which authorities have justified as needed to clamp down on political opponents, mostly the Muslim Brotherhood. El-Sissi's predecessor, the ousted President Mohammed Morsi, belongs to the Islamist group. In February, an Italian student's body was found by the side of a Cairo road, marked with cigarette burns and other signs of torture. Italy has demanded that those responsible be brought to justice. Egypt has dismissed suggestions its security services may have been involved. In September, following series of controversial incidents, el-Sissi called for a new law, or amending existing legislation to hold police accountable for abuses. One incident involved police officers allegedly assaulting two emergency room doctors at a Cairo hospital, sparking large protests by doctors. Days later, a policeman shot and killed a driver, sparking spontaneous protests where demonstrators blocked roads and surrounded a security headquarters in Cairo. Just three days following Maken's death, another police officer received life imprisonment for killing another street vendor earlier this year, in an argument over the price of a cup of tea. The episode also ignited demonstrations. The interior ministry has justified the incidents as isolated. While often initially receiving heavy sentences for abuses, Egypt's policemen typically get acquitted on appeal. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Donald Trump will come to wish it were so easy.	"   President-elect Donald Trump smiles as he arrives to speak at an election-night rally in New York on Nov. 9. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)  Before I was a critic, I spent three years reporting on the federal workforce for Government Executive, the outstanding magazine about the business of government. I covered pay raises, the returns from the Thrift Savings Plan and proposals for a pay-for-performance system. But I also reported on understaffing in the air traffic control system, visited the National Security Agency to learn about its use of adaptive technologies for employees with disabilities and the coalescing workplace culture of the Department of Homeland Security. Federal personnel is no longer my beat, though it did leave me with a certain lingering grouchiness about how the government is depicted in pop culture. But that experience taught me to think about the business of government in two different ways as the United States begins an experiment with one of the most persistent canards in modern American politics: the idea that someone with no experience in government, but a career in business, would do better as president than someone with a career in public service. First, it's true that the federal government as a whole shares many broad functions in common with businesses and nonprofit organizations. Employees are hired, fired, evaluated and promoted. Their health-care and retirement systems must be administered. Departments bid out all sorts of contracts. In these areas, practical business experience may certainly be of some value, though federal employees are unionized at much higher rates than workers in the private sector, and federal contracting rules are highly complicated and specific. Even if a president wants to throw out these constraints entirely, he or she must still understand them and why they exist if the president is to have any hope of proposing, passing and implementing replacements for them. The National Security Personnel System, an alternative to the General Schedule system for Defense Department employees, which was repealed in 2009, is a useful cautionary tale for just how difficult sweeping reforms in federal business systems can be. But the second way to think about the business of government introduces even more complexity. The federal government isn't one business, but many of them, and they do an astonishing array of things. Intelligence agencies gather and analyze information. The Agriculture Department does everything from measure agricultural productivity to provide loans to expand rural access to broadband Internet. Air traffic controllers manage the nation's skies. From department to department, agency to agency and program to program, the imperatives and outputs differ. Very few of them involve anything so basic as maximizing profit. To guide these functions of government well, a president must be able to grasp not just a nebulous, ill-defined concept such as ""business,"" but many kinds of organizations, and many kinds of desirable outcomes. Synthesizing intelligence briefings and making decisions on the basis of that information, as well as knowledge about our military capabilities, or balancing the needs of oil companies and Louisiana workers in a variety of industries, requires very different skills than refusing to pay a piano salesman. Certainly, if government were much smaller and did many fewer things, managing it would be a simpler proposition. Even under those circumstances, though, collecting taxes from hundreds of millions of Americans and staffing, equipping and deploying a hugely complex modern military system would remain formidable tasks. But the idea that putting a ""businessman"" in the Oval Office would automatically cause the federal government to function more smoothly and efficiently often seems to rest on the idea that the substance of the presidency is in managing federal contracting and personnel systems. Unfortunately for Donald Trump, even if he were the genius at negotiation he claims to be, the job is rather more complicated, and rather more subtle, than that."

The Opinion Studies Center poll released Friday said 45.1 percent of those quizzed oppose independence while 44.9 percent favored it. The remainder did not know or did not answer. The center's last poll in July showed pro-independents ahead by 47.7 percent against 42.4 percent. Catalonia, whose capital is Barcelona, represents a fifth of Spain's EUR1.1-trillion-euro ($1.2 trillion) GDP. Its pro-independence regional government says it will begin breaking away from Spain in 2017, although the national government rules this out.

The proposal would defer sentencing or punishment for sexual assault in cases where there was no force and where the victim and perpetrator were married. Opposition legislators, rights groups and other critics warned that the proposal facilitates child marriage. The proposal was introduced late Thursday by the ruling Justice and Development Party, rooted in Turkey's Islamic movement, which says it is meant to protect those who were too young to marry legally. The proposal will be brought up again for consideration on Tuesday. An earlier law said there is no sexual assault if the couple marry. It was replaced by the current law in 2005, which set a minimum prison sentence of eight years, extended to 16 years in 2014.  ""Those aren't rapists, they aren't people who committed sexual assault by force. Those are acts done with the consent of families and the young ones,"" Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Friday, adding that the later law had ignored the matter of consent. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said: ""In the past there were people who were not aware of the law. The fathers have ended up in prison. This is a one-time measure to correct an unjust situation. It is an important problem."" The government's proposal would apply to cases between 2005 and Nov. 16 of this year, which would affect an estimated 3,000 families. Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency reported several opposition legislators slamming the proposal. Republican People's Party Deputy Chair Tekin Bingol said they ""strongly rejected"" it, saying it amounted to a pardon for rapists. Mehmet Onur Yilmaz of Gundem Cocuk, a children's rights organization whose operations were halted by the government last week, told The Associated Press the issue stemmed from not taking child marriage seriously.  ""If there was an understanding that child marriage constituted sexual assault such a proposal would not even be brought up,"" said Yilmaz. ""This comes from looking at the matter with a focus on marriage, a conservative understanding which sees marriage as a solution to the problem of abuse."" Under current law, Yilmaz said, a person between the ages of 16-18 can get a special exemption allowing marriage by a court, and that is almost always granted. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Voters across the country instead encountered the types of glitches that arise in every election -- long lines, occasional broken machines, discrepancies in voting rolls and some hot tempers. The scattered problems included malfunctioning voting systems at polling stations in Texas, computer trouble in North Carolina that forced officials to rely on a paper check-in process and triggered long lines, and arguments and skirmishes between supporters of Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, including one reported to have involved pepper spray. There were reports in some states of voters waiting in line for hours to cast a ballot. Among them was Heather Merrick, who waited for hours to vote at a firehouse in Jersey City, New Jersey. She lamented that she didn't bring snacks.  ""I think that the energy and general vibe was really upbeat,"" said Merrick, 33, who was voting in New Jersey for the first time after moving from New York. ""I started to sense a little frustration once we got close enough to see the machines stuck in the line and it was moving so slowly."" Yet there were no immediate indications of any snags large enough to alter the vote count in any meaningful way.  ""The biggest surprise is how uneventful things have been with this large a turnout,"" said Illinois State Board of Elections spokesman Jim Tenuto. ""Everyone was expecting more problems than this -- and nothing."" The voting unfolded amid repeated but unsubstantiated claims from Trump that the election would somehow be rigged. His exhortations to followers to watch for fraud at the polls gave rise to fears of vigilantism and harassment. He continued to raise the specter of election fraud on Tuesday, telling Fox News, ""It's largely a rigged system."" He would not say whether he would accept the outcome of the election.  ""We're going to see how things play out today and hopefully they will play out well and hopefully we won't have to worry about it,"" he said. In Philadelphia, one of the places Trump had suggested were ripe for fraud, District Attorney Seth Williams said that as of the afternoon, there were no substantiated reports of voter fraud or intimidation, and ""no walking apocalypse of zombies voting around town."" State officials, meanwhile, had been working for weeks against any attempt by hackers to breach their computer systems. It was a particular concern given the U.S. intelligence community's assertion last month that the Russians had attempted through hacking to interfere with the electoral process. But there were no major reported problems. The federal government offered help to states looking to patch their networks to prevent intrusions. Cybersecurity experts said because of the nation's decentralized voting system, with people casting ballots in 9,000 jurisdictions and more than 185,000 precincts, it would be difficult for a hacker to have any sizable effect on the vote. ___ Associated Press writers Diana Heidgerd in Dallas; Ron Todt in Philadelphia; Michael Tarm in Chicago; and Desmond O.

The Trump International Hotel, just blocks from the White House, served as a bastion for a legion of his supporters, whose ardor only intensified as his momentum built through the night. When televisions flashed Trump's lead in Ohio and Wisconsin, the room erupted. People pointed at the TVs and yelled ""Call it!"" and chanted ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" A thickset man with a red beard and a tattoo sleeve wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat high-fived his smaller friend in a white ""Make America Great Again"" hat. Nearby, a blond woman in a leopard-print dress tried not to spill her on-the-rocks cocktail as people bumped around her.  News soon followed that the Dow Jones futures had dropped 700 points. ""That's just because Wall Street bet on Clinton to win,"" a muscular man with close- cropped hair and a white button-down shirt said to a woman standing beside him. ""After Day One, that's going to skyrocket up."" For much of the night, the ornate atrium of the $212 million, 263-room hotel felt more like a sports bar devoted to an out-of-town team: a Washington Redskins pub in downtown Dallas. While 93 percent of voters in the nation's capital backed Hillary Clinton, Trump supporters could wear their favorite color -- bright red -- and join in familiar cheers -- ""Lock her up!"" -- and watch their preferred TV channel -- Fox News -- free from fear of opposition or judgment. ""It's nice to hang out here and not look over your shoulder,"" said a District psychotherapist in a T-shirt that showed a cartoon Trump in a Superman outfit. ""I would be fearful wearing this on the street."" The psychotherapist, who is gay, had come to the hotel with his partner, a senior manager at a left-leaning D.C. nonprofit group. Fearing both a personal and professional backlash, both men declined to give their names. They had initially planned to attend a friend's party but were, essentially, uninvited because of their political views. ""We have had more vitriol from gays than anyone,"" the nonprofit manager said.  Both men, who support Trump because of his stance on immigration and fiscal conservatism, said they avoid divulging their political leanings at work. ""Advertising it is not worth it,"" the psychotherapist said. Just two weeks ago, Trump himself attended the hotel's grand opening celebration amid his campaign for an even grander property in the nation's capital. ""With the notable exception of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, this is the most coveted piece of real estate in Washington D.C., the best location,"" he said, standing behind a gold and dark-wood lectern adorned with ""Trump hotel."" (In the days since, tourists in jeans and baseball caps have posed for cellphone pictures behind an identical lectern in the atrium as they repeat Trumpisms like ""bigly"" and ""Gina."") Protesters angered by what they see as the Republican nominee's racism and misogyny have demonstrated outside the hotel repeatedly in recent weeks. On Saturday, the building was defaced for at least the second time in a month. On Tuesday, hours before the polls closed, two tall, square-shouldered men in dark suits and Republican-red ties wandered the lounge, asking visitors if they had any questions about the hotel. But the pair seemed less like concierges and more like polite, well-dressed security guards. What did they expect would happen at the hotel Tuesday night? ""Preparing for the worst,"" said one, who had two fading blacks eyes. ""Hoping for the best."" The night was free from unwanted disruptions, but Trump employees ordered out any journalists they spotted interviewing guests, including one of two Washington Post reporters. Trump's unlikely election night success -- driven in large part by a populist message to middle-class Americans -- felt surreal in a room where people in velvet chairs can order rare Hungarian wine for $140 per crystal spoonful. On Tuesday, the hotel's website advertised a special ""Inauguration Rate,"" though Inauguration Day isn't until January. ""It is our pleasure to welcome you to Trump Washington DC on this historic night,"" the site said of the $705 single-day price tag, which was the cheapest room offered to anyone other than AAA members ($680) and military veterans ($604). The 6,300-square-foot ""Trump Townhouse"" was listed at $28,625, including taxes. That's about $2,500 more than the annual per capita income in Michigan, where at Trump's final rally of the campaign, he railed against elites and vowed, ""The American working class is going to strike back."" On Tuesday night, the people at his D.C. hotel reveled in his surging electoral count. After he won North Carolina, they chanted ""Lock her up!"" After Florida, they exploded in cheers, high-fives and pumped fists. ""We're going to build a wall so big,"" a collection of seemingly drunk supporters said to each other after Trump took the lead in the key state of Wisconsin. ""Who's going to pay for it? Mexico!"" Slowly, the people packed into the atrium acted less and less like they needed a refuge as their candidate's chances soared.  And in that moment, no one could have explained election night 2016 better than the hotel's own online slogan. ""Washington,"" it declares, ""will never be the same."" "

Terry Jones knows, they were his ideas first. ""We are asking for the immediate halting of all Muslim immigration and the removal of all illegal aliens from the United States,"" the controversial Florida pastor told a Detroit radio station back in 2011. ""We are asking for the monitoring of all the mosques in America."" At the time, Jones's demands were dismissed as crazy, part of a set of radical beliefs and xenophobia that impelled Jones to publicly burn Qurans and air mocking videos that provoked violent attacks on embassies and consulates in Egypt, Afghanistan and Libya. Four and a half years later, those policy prescriptives are a core element of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign. The party's standard-bearer has borrowed heavily both in message and in membership from far-right conservative activists whose pronouncements on Islam have long been denounced as dangerous zealotry by mainstream conservative and liberal policymakers alike.      In an election that has put American Muslims under the spotlight, three voters from different parts of the country reflect on how the political rhetoric has affected them. (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Leaming,Alice Li/The Washington Post)   Former president George W. Bush and GOP candidates Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Mitt Romney all repudiated anti-Islam rhetoric as un-American. Trump has become the first and only major-party presidential candidate to adopt these ideas as his own. With his calls for a complete ban on Muslim immigrants or ""extreme vetting"" on people entering the country, policy prescriptives once relegated to the fringe have become mainstream. The migration of anti-Islam extremist views to major-party acceptance is, like much in American politics, a fusion of opportunism and ideology. It often has been highly profitable for its practitioners as well.  In 2007, Brigitte Gabriel, a former reporter for Pat Robertson's evangelical television channel and author of a book on the dangers of Islam, founded Act! for America, an organization that touted as its ""first accomplishment"" its 2008 campaign to shut down a Minnesota Islamic school. That same year, former newspaper executive Pamela Geller used her increasingly popular libertarian blog AtlasShrugs.com to spread the falsehood during the 2008 presidential campaign that President Obama was born in Kenya and was a secret Muslim. So did former Reagan administration aide Frank Gaffney Jr., whose neoconservative think tank argued that the country was at risk of falling victim to ""civilization jihad"" at the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood.  The Egypt-based Islamist movement, Gaffney alleged, harbored a sinister bid to destroy American society and implement Islamic law. With the Obama rumors, Gaffney, Geller, Gabriel and others found a more direct way to advance a broader opposition to Islam -- and a right-wing audience to embrace it. Along the way, Kellyanne Conway, now Trump's campaign manager, contributed polling to sharpen the message. By 2010, anti-Muslim activists had launched a nationwide media campaign against what they dubbed ""the Ground Zero mosque,"" a proposal to build a mosque and Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan. Act! for America convened its first ""National Conference and Legislative Briefing"" in Washington, which brought advocates together with lawmakers, including Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) and then-Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.). Both went on to hold congressional hearings to examine militants infiltrating the country. While most mainstream politicians continued to malign the activists -- the Conservative Political Action Conference barred Gaffney from speaking in 2010 after he accused two of its members of working with the Muslim Brotherhood -- they spread their ideas through a network of small conferences, tea party groups, conservative churches and Jewish groups, and right-wing news outlets such as Breitbart. Former Breitbart chief executive Stephen Bannon is now chief executive of the Trump campaign.   [Trump's campaign chief faces scrutiny over voter registration, anti-Semitism]  They told their audiences that Islam isn't a religion but a political ideology that is inherently violent and opposed to Judeo-Christian values. They warned that mosques and Muslims should be watched. And they argued that practicing Islam means belief in the oppression of women and the murder of infidels, and that the religion is therefore unconstitutional. Most important of all, they said, was to stop the advance of what they labeled ""creeping sharia,"" an alleged Muslim plot to impose Islamic law across American institutions. Sharia is not a codified document like the U.S. Constitution, say religious and legal scholars, but rather a broad and variably interpreted set of ideas and principles for how to live life as a Muslim. It offers an array of guidance, including on prayer practices, marriage, diet and finances. It also draws on tens of thousands of texts and scholarly interpretations, meaning that there is no universally approved body of Islamic law, said Intisar A. Rabb, an Islamic legal scholar at Harvard University.   In the summer of 2010, former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) offered a darker vision. In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, he said sharia is ""a mortal threat to the survival of freedom in the United States and the world as we know it."" It was ""the pre-eminent totalitarian threat of our time,"" said Gaffney's Center for Security Policy's report, ""Shariah -- The Threat to America."" Among its authors were former CIA director James R. Woolsey and Joseph E. Schmitz, both of whom are now national security advisers for Trump. The center's general counsel, David Yerushalmi, drafted a law to ban sharia, and with the help of Act! for America began shopping the draft to lawmakers in Southern states. Bills to ban sharia now have been introduced in all but 16 states. To date, Tennessee, Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana and South Dakota all have passed some form of legislation to ban ""foreign law""-- wording adopted in most cases to avoid an explicit violation of the Constitution, which prohibits the favoring or targeting of one religion. Alabama's bill failed, but its voters banned sharia by ratifying a constitutional amendment. Faiza Patel, the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University Law School's Brennan Center for Justice, said ""the idea that sharia law poses a threat to the United States is just laughable."" But it makes sense that sharia has worked as a focal point for the anti-Muslim movement. For many Americans, the definition offered by the activists was also their first introduction to the concept. ""The theory that 'the Muslims are coming' "" has helped anti-Muslim activists to ""malign Muslim individuals and groups, and suggest that they have some sort of terrorist ties,"" Patel said. ""We've seen this with [longtime Hillary Clinton aide] Huma Abedin. And we've seen a concerted campaign against [Muslim lobbyist group] the Council on American-Islamic Relations for some time.""   The business of speaking out against Muslims also has been lucrative. Seven charitable groups provided $42.6 million to ""Islamophobia think tanks"" such as those run by Gaffney and Gabriel between 2001 and 2009, researchers at the Center for American Progress found. In 2014, Gaffney was paid more than $308,000, and Gabriel earned at least $240,000, according to the IRS Form 990 filed by their organizations. The 2014 rise of the Islamic State, with its gruesome beheading videos, created new fears and gave the movement new energy. The Islamic State was practicing Islamic law when it executed journalists and religious minorities, the anti-Islam activists told their audiences, and so were the gunmen who carried out the 2015 and 2016 terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando. When the 2016 election cycle rolled around, not everyone in the movement rallied immediately around Trump. Some, including Gaffney, initially joined the campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), and Ben Carson also won support with references to ""civilization jihad."" But Trump ultimately incorporated the message into his presidential platform like no other major-party candidate had before. In previous presidential campaigns, the Republican candidates ""beat back"" the movement's conspiracy theories, said Ken Gude, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, who co-authored an updated report on the movement last year. ""Now we have a campaign that not only isn't pushing back against them, but is also pushing and advocating those kinds of views.""     Walid Phares, one of Trump's foreign policy advisers, was part of a Lebanese Christian militia that took part in massacres during the Lebanese civil war and has previously accused the U.S. government of being beholden to an Islamist agenda. And another top adviser, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, joined the board of Act! for America shortly after joining the Trump campaign. Gingrich and Bachmann are also advisers.   [Michelle Bachmann under fire for Muslim Brotherhood claims]  But the ""top expert with influence on these issues is Frank Gaffney, who advised Cruz, then provided research to Trump,"" Phares wrote in an email. He also named Schmitz, Flynn, Gingrich and former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as key sources on developing policy ideas on Islam. ""A number of these folks are friends of mine,"" Gaffney said in an interview about Trump's inner circle. ""I've had conversations with them, [and] the opportunity to provide input [to the campaign], at least informally."" When Trump in December first called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" he cited a widely debunked poll , conducted by Conway for Gaffney's Center for Security Policy, that claims that 25 percent of Muslims surveyed supported violence against Americans and that 51 percent think Muslims should have the choice of being governed by sharia in America.   [The Fix: The very bad poll at the center of Trump's proposed Muslim ban]   A large number of Americans have long recognized ""the jihad threat,"" and Trump is giving voice to those sentiments, Geller said. It's only the mainstream media, ""a Soros-funded propaganda arm for the far-Left and its Islamic supremacist allies,"" she said, that has stood in the way of broader acceptance.
