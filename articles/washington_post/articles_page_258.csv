"Going into the 2016 election, Senate Republicans' hopes to keep their tenuous majority were pinned on persuading voters to do something they're less and less inclined to do at the ballot box: Split their ticket by voting for the Democrat for president, Republican for Senate. Turns out, Senate Republicans didn't need split-ticket voters to keep the Senate. Quite the opposite, actually: The 2016 election saw the highest percentage of STRAIGHT-ticket voters in more than a century -- literally 100 percent of states holding Senate elections voted for the same party for Senate as for president. And Republicans kept control of the Senate and won the presidency.   [Republicans are poised to grasp the holy grail of governance]   As a team of nonpartisan political analysts under professor Larry Sabato at the University of Virginia pointed out Thursday, we haven't seen partisan numbers like this since the 17th Amendment was ratified in 1913, allowing senators to be elected by popular vote (as opposed to being elected by state legislatures). In 1920, more than 95 percent of states voted for the same party for president as Senate. In 2016, of 34 states with Senate races, all 34 states voted for the same party for president and U.S. Senate.    (Sabato's Crystal Ball, University of Virginia)  This data will undoubtedly serve the narrative that split-ticket voting is dying (or perhaps already dead). It's yet one more example for people to point to of how partisan the United States has become. As The Fix's Chris Cillizza lamented in September about the decline of split-ticket voting: ""[I]t suggests we have become increasingly tribal in the way we think about elections. You are either with 'us' (whoever that 'us' may be) or against us. There's no room for a candidate-by-candidate assessment up and down the ballot."" If we fit the 2016 results into what we know about split-ticket voting, that may be the case. Even before 2016, split-ticket voting was at its lowest point in decades. The Fix's Philip Bump calculated that in the 1990 presidential election, 63 percent of states with Senate races voted for the same candidate for president as for Senate. In 2014, 91 percent of states did.    (Philip Bump / The Washington Post)  In 2016, that metric was 100 percent. A straight-ticket vote was supposed to be terrible news for Senate Republicans. Most analysts figured Hillary Clinton was going to get more votes than Donald Trump in states with competitive races, and if those same voters marked the ballot for all Democrats, well, Senate Republicans' majority was doomed. That clearly didn't happen. Republicans lost two seats in the Senate, but they'll hang onto their majority. It's possible Trump's strength with the Republican base brought out staunch Republican voters, stemming the tide of any split-ticket voters. As House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said the day after the election: ""Donald Trump provided the kind of coattails that got a lot of people over the finish line so the we could maintain our strong House and Senate majorities."" Or, maybe it was the opposite. Trump actually underperformed Republican Senate candidates in most of the competitive Senate races. The day after the election, Bump compared Trump's performance in 12 states to the Senate Republicans' performance in those states. He found that in all but three, the Senate Republican won a higher percentage of the vote than Trump did.    (Philip Bump / The Washington Post)  In other words, Trump's coattails were too short for most Senate Republicans to grab on to. It also suggests there are still some split-ticket voters out there, although not nearly as many as we had thought there were. In New Hampshire, for example, Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) outperformed Trump by .4 to .5 percentage points, but an average of polls in the week before the election suggested she could outperform him by as much as 8 points. (Ayotte ended up narrowly losing the election to Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) anyway.) Many things about this election turned out to be the opposite of what was predicted. Sabato's team also pointed out that every one of the major analysts' predictions about who would win the presidency (The Fix included) got it wrong. Which brings us back to the central question of this piece: Is the death of split-ticket voting an anomaly, or the new normal? The data suggest that crossing party lines at the ballot box is a trend that is on its way out, if not gone already. But honestly, nobody knows for sure what's going to happen one election to the next. Certainly no one was predicting that one week after the election, we'd be noting the near-absence of split-ticket voting and that Senate Republicans had held their majority. And yet here we are. It's a strange, unpredictable -- and partisan -- world out there."

Federal prosecutors say the man, identified only as Ibrahim Al F., in line with German privacy laws, was a commander in the group Ghurabaa al-Sham. The group was part of the Free Syrian Army, which took up arms against the army of Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2012. Prosecutors said in a statement that the suspect led a unit of 150 militiamen that carried out lootings in Aleppo. He is alleged to have imprisoned and tortured several residents of the city who attempted to stop the lootings. Prosecutors say one of the prisoners died following torture.

The billionaire technology entrepreneur declined Wednesday to elaborate on the decision, telling The Associated Press it ""was made months ago. Not recently."" Cuban was a frequent critic of Trump during the campaign and supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who lost to the Republican president-elect. ESPN, citing anonymous sources, reported that Dallas, Memphis and Milwaukee were among the teams that moved away from Trump-branded hotels in New York and Chicago. The network reported that the decision was made in part to avoid any implied association with Trump. The Grizzlies aren't staying at Trump properties.  ""It had nothing to do with the election. We made those decisions months ago,"" Memphis coach David Fizdale said Wednesday night before a game against the Clippers. ""We didn't stay in Trump hotels when I was in Miami either, so when I came here I wanted to stay in places I was familiar with. It had nothing to do with him."" Several NBA coaches have been critical of Trump since the election, including Golden State's Steve Kerr and San Antonio's Gregg Popovich. Milwaukee Bucks coach Jason Kidd declined to comment as a team spokesman pointed to a statement earlier in the day that the team would not go on the record about its season travel plans. But star forward Jabari Parker said he supports the team's decision not to stay in Trump properties.  ""It targets most of the guys on the team, the controversy that Donald Trump stands for,"" Parker told The Associated Press. ""I'm damn near Mexican because my mom is from Hawaii. We have a Muslim on the team (Mirza Teletovic) and all our guys are black, so when you despise our culture, we can't support that."" Parker added that he's proud of the Bucks' decision.  ""Yeah, because those are tensions that he stands for, and it targets guys on the team,"" Parker told The AP. ""They (Bucks front office) don't want to put them in uncomfortable situations just like in the '60s when they said, 'Whites only.'

3	https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/17/how-a-trump-administration-could-lead-to-trade-and-capital-controls/	How a Trump administration could lead to trade and capital controls	"   Steven Mnuchin, national finance chairman of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign, waves after speaking to media at Trump Tower on Nov. 16 in New York. (Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press)  Despite a presidential campaign in which Donald Trump blasted his opponent for ties to Wall Street, financial markets seem pretty giddy about the incoming Trump administration. And in the short term, they're not wrong for feeling that way. The prospect of far-reaching financial deregulation seems at play. President-elect Trump's tax plan would slash rates for those working on Wall Street. His proposed infrastructure plan, although somewhat dodgy in the details, seems like an additional Keynesian fiscal stimulus (along with any increase in defense spending). And it appears that Trump will be sprinkling his administration with plenty of Goldman Sachs alums. As Politico's Ben White concludes, ""Christmas has arrived early for Wall Street in the early days of the Donald Trump era."" No wonder the stock market and the dollar have surged in value over the past week.   [How America decided, at the last moment, to elect Donald Trump]   Far be it from me to throw water on any of this, but if Wall Street's expectations do indeed come to pass, there's a scenario that has been playing out in my head that I want to share with you. I'm a little worried that by 2018, we will see Trump announce the imposition of mass protectionism. Eventually, he would impose capital controls on the American economy -- i.e., impose barriers on the movement of money in and out of the United States. Let me stress that this is not a prediction -- 2016 has taught me the folly of doing that. This is a low-probability scenario. Of course, a year ago, both Brexit and a President-elect Trump were low-probability scenarios, so maybe we should think about these contingencies more often. Hear me out: As I noted last month, the very existence of a protectionist Trump in office will cause the dollar to appreciate against the currencies of trading partners he bashed, such as the Mexican peso. After a few months, that probably will worsen the trade deficit. So that's not good for a president who has claimed that the trade deficit ails the American economy. The other thing that is likely to happen over the next year -- if Wall Street is correct -- is that interest rates are going to go up. Indeed, Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen hinted as much the very second I was typing this sentence. The reasons for this are pretty clear. You may not have guessed from the campaign rhetoric, but the U.S. economy has had a pretty good run as of late. Growth has ticked up, the unemployment rate is below 5 percent, and real wages and incomes are starting to rise at a rapid clip. If the Trump administration implements its planned tax cuts and fiscal expenditures, the pump will be primed even more. Inflation hawks already want to raise rates to ward off inflation. One look at Trump's plans will cause them to redouble their efforts, and Yellen might come around to their way of thinking. If you combine an expansionary fiscal policy with a contractionary monetary policy, two things will shoot up dramatically: interest rates and the value of the dollar. Capital will rush into the United States because of higher interest rates. And a surging dollar will significantly worsen the trade deficit, particularly as any fiscal stimulus works its way through the U.S. economy. Now this has happened before: see the first terms of George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Whopping trade deficits combined with lackluster economic growth increase protectionist pressures on the president. Bush and Reagan responded with myriad forms of ticky-tack protectionism without doing anything sweeping. Eventually both presidents engaged in efforts to try to coordinate a weakening of the dollar. Trump is going to be a different president. He really believes in a global zero-sum economy. He will no doubt impose ticky-tack protectionism and then some when he is sworn into office. The dirty secret of protectionism, however, is that most forms of it won't affect the trade deficit. That's mostly a function of macroeconomic factors like domestic demand for goods, foreign demand for goods and services, and interest rates. And I'm extremely dubious of Trump's ability to get other countries to agree to moves that would ease upward pressure on the dollar. My concern is that there is going to come a moment when Trump's voters will be demanding that he bring jobs back to the industrial heartland even though those jobs are gone for good. And faced with those political pressures, Trump would simply decide to impose more radical measures to lower the trade deficit and stop capital from rushing into the United States. The result would faintly echo what Richard Nixon did in 1971 when he ended the Bretton Woods system. Will this actually happen? I have my doubts. Trump's fiscal plans might not come to fruition. Yellen might resign and be replaced with a more pliant, Trump-friendly acolyte. Markets might correct if they think that Trump is not ready for prime time. And if I can envision this scenario, so can investors; maybe they'll be reluctant to invest too heavily in the United States. If this happens, however, then Wall Street is going to look back at the past week and feel very, very foolish."
4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/11/17/trumps-secretary-of-state-debacle-in-the-making/	Trump’s secretary-of-state debacle in the making	"      Reports say former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has emerged as a leading candidate to serve as secretary of state under President-elect Donald Trump. (Reuters)   President-elect Donald Trump's selection for secretary of state, following the firestorm of criticism leveled at his selection of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist, could either quiet critics of the chaotic transition process (Trump insists his operation is not chaotic!) or underscore the incoming team's lack of political acumen and readiness. Many Trump critics would prefer the latter; we, however, are not rooting for failure, especially when it comes to foreign relations. Let's say his widely discussed first choice Rudy Giuliani's name goes up to the Senate. Off the bat he will have 48 solid Democrat ""no"" votes. They need not say anything about ideology. Giuliani's temperament, his hyper-partisan threats during the campaign (he led the ""lock her up!"" chants), his cesspool of shady foreign clients, his alleged misuse of funds as mayor, his rotten judgment of character and his lack of actual national-security experience would be more than enough grounds to oppose him. Meanwhile, you can bet some Republicans are going to be awfully nervous about confirming Giuliani. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has already said he would be a no vote. Other wary senators might include everyone from libertarian-ish Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) to pro-life, principled conservatives such as Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who would take issue with Giuliani's formulation that in war ""anything's legal,"" a frightful fallacy that would play into concerns about Trump. Giuliani's volatile personality and tendency to blather on would make him a difficult nominee to prepare for a confirmation hearing.   [Intraparty fratricide looms over the GOP]   The hearing would easily turn into the first must-see TV clash between the White House and Senate. Hours of an aggressive, long-winded Giuliani duking it out over whether he billed New York taxpayers for security for his visits with his mistress and debating just how shady were his list of clients (including Russian oligarchs) would be irresistible. And worst of all from Trump's perspective, it would divert attention from him and risk an early defeat.      Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) is a big fan of Donald Trump - and he said some strange things while campaigning for the Republican nominee. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Trump reportedly told Giuliani that he could have his pick of jobs. That's not how presidents should operate. Unlike his business empire, Trump is not the only decision-maker and if the choice proves faulty, the exec is not hurried out of the office with a reminder he signed a nondisclosure agreement. The Senate gets to vote, and the  prospect that his nominee -- a blustering, white New York millionaire who is ethically compromised and short on actual experience -- would go down in flames might strike a little too close to home. And, that, by the way brings us to another concern. The people already announced and under serious contention for other top jobs (secretary of state, attorney general, defense secretary, national security adviser) are almost all older, white men. If that's the final result, Trump would wind up underscoring how insulated and non-inclusive his operation is.   [I told conservatives to work for Trump. One talk with his team changed my mind.]   When you consider the diverse picks for senior-level jobs in the past two administrations (e.g. Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Alberto Gonzales, Hillary Clinton, Susan Rice, Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch), it would be stunning to think that Trump could wind up with no minorities or women in top slots. When the people whom he is considering are not even expert, knowledgeable or temperamentally sound, Trump looks even worse, as though he's bent on replanting his good-old-boy network from Manhattan. Perhaps that is why talk started about South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for secretary of state (?!), despite a lack of national-security experience. Maybe Trump feels comfortable only with under-qualified, older, male cronies -- people just like him! (But doesn't he keep saying he has hired so many women in business?) If so, he better get over it and start finding some competent people who better reflect American diversity. I mean, is just one woman or minority above the rank of education secretary too much to expect?          1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Last year, 70,000 reindeer starved to death when ice and deep snow sealed off the Arctic tundra where they graze. This summer, the region's first outbreak of anthrax in 75 years -- an epidemic thought to be linked to climate change -- sickened humans and animals alike. Now, the nomadic herders who cover the same icy ground their ancestors roamed for centuries are facing a man-made threat as officials push ahead with an unprecedented culling that calls for at least one in seven of the Yamal's reindeer to be slaughtered. The cull that started this month is championed by local officials and scientists who say a record reindeer population is leading to over-grazing and more frequent epidemics. But environmental activists and some herders allege that energy interests pressed for the forced killings, which they say could destroy the endangered culture of the Nenets people.  ""Every herder should decide the fate of their own reindeer,"" Eiko Serotetto, the owner of a 200-head herd who has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the expanded cull, said in an interview. The rare tradition of nomadic reindeer herding the Nenets people practice sees them complete annual migrations of hundreds of miles as they drive their flocks from winter grazing lands below the Arctic Circle to the tundra near Yamal's northern coast. Since during the Soviet era, the government has organized an annual cull in which up to 70,000 reindeer are usually killed off. This year, officials announced that 100,000 of the animals would be slaughtered by the end of December. The final number could end up being higher since the slaughtering season also has been extended until the end of January, a month longer than usual. One of the most heavily affected areas is the Yamal Peninsula, a 435-mile-long promontory of wind-blasted land made up of permafrost and serpentine rivers jutting into the icy Kara Sea and home to about 280,000 of the Yamal Region's estimated 700,000 reindeer. Shrinking the number of reindeer on the peninsula is necessary for their continued survival, according to Lyudmilla Morozova, a researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences. The population has grown by 50 percent over the last two decades, Morozova said, and large tracts of reindeer moss, a slow-growing staple of the species' herbivore diet, have been lost due to over-grazing.  ""It is essential to urgently reduce reindeer numbers,"" she said. ""The reindeer have eaten all the stores (of food) they shouldn't have eaten, and we are on the edge of a cliff."" Slaughter house workers, many of them former herders, are given kill quotas by the regional government that they levy on herd owners, who in turn receive a fixed price of 190 rubles ($3) per kilogram of meat. During the cull, herders bring their reindeer to one of six regional slaughter houses, each of which can process up to 260 animals a day. The meat is then sold commercially. Although the Nenets relied on their herds for food and clothing before the Russian Revolution, the yearly cull has become an integral part of their lives and livelihoods, providing one of their primary sources of income. Andrey Rubashin, the deputy head of Yamal's agriculture, trade and provision department, said the bigger cull will mean more money for herders. Ten more slaughter houses partly financed by donations from oil and gas companies will be built by 2020, according to Rubashin.  ""The aim is to push our reindeer herders toward a more intensive use of their reindeer,"" he said in an interview in the regional capital of Salekhard. Opponents of the culling plan say traditional pasture lands are disappearing due the growth of the oil and gas industry in resource-rich Yamal, not the reindeer population. The industry's rapid expansion over the last 15 years has curtailed the access herders have to pasture and their freedom to move across the tundra. Reindeer migration routes are restricted by pipelines, railways, roads and large zones around drilling sites, where herders are prohibited from camping.  ""It is an unequivocal tragedy for both people and animals,"" Yelena Sakirko, the Arctic coordinator for Greenpeace in Russia, said of the bigger cull. ""It will end up with nomadic reindeer herders turning into settled reindeer farmers. This is a completely different form of husbandry, and means the loss of a culture."" Reindeer numbers are not unusually high at the moment, according to Moscow-based anthropologist Olga Murashko, who said they were at similar levels in pre-revolutionary Russia and during the 1980s and have remained static for nearly a decade. In 2010, there were 290,000 animals on the peninsula -- 10,000 more than today, according to the Russian State Statistics Service. Regional government spokeswoman Olesya Litovskikh denied the oil and gas industry lobbied for increased culling. Energy companies spend ""billions of rubles"" developing far-flung areas and supporting Nenets culture, Litovskikh said. The Yamal Region already has one of the biggest natural gas fields in Russia, the Bovanenkovskoye field, which is operated by state-owned Gazprom. Rising temperatures and melting Arctic sea ice mean the Yamal Peninsula also looks set to become an energy export hub. Greenpeace estimates there are 1,100 kilometers (684 miles) of pipelines and 2,095 kilometers (1,302 miles) of railways on the Yamal Peninsula, where 15 percent of the land is licensed for exploration and drilling. In the short-term, herders fear they are being made to slaughter reindeer they would not normally sell for meat and money, and for reasons that remain unclear. Serotetto says the terrain where he spent his childhood is now inaccessible because of a natural gas compressor station. The 25-year old herder said he usually sends 10 percent of his herd for slaughter, but he does not yet know if he will be forced to sacrifice more this year. He created an online petition to Putin in October that has gotten 962 signatures.  ""Our president should know we are also humans, and it is not just the gas industry that can work here,"" he said. __ Amos reported from Moscow. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

That could soon change as Taiwan appears set to become the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.  ""Now, if something happens to the child, the other partner is nothing but a stranger,"" said Su, a 35-year-old software engineer in Taipei. By contrast, either partner in a legally recognized marriage could make legal, medical and educational decisions, she says. Taiwanese lawmakers are currently working on three bills in support of marriage equality, one of which is already listed for review and could be passed within months. Same-sex marriage also has the prominent support of President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's first female head of state. About 80 percent of Taiwanese between ages 20 and 29 support same-sex marriage, said Tseng Yen-jung, spokeswoman for the group Taiwan LGBT Family Rights Advocacy , citing local university studies. Taiwan's United Daily News found in a survey taken four years ago that 55 percent of the public supported same-sex marriage, with 37 percent opposed. That's seen as a reflection of Taiwan's ready acceptance of multi-party democracy and other inclusive attitudes, as well as the fact that Taiwan's 23 million people largely follow Buddhism and traditional Chinese religions that take no strong positions on sexual orientation or gay marriage. Gay and lesbian relationships began to find wide acceptance in the 1990s, aided by the already well-established feminist movement, said Jens Damm, associate Professor in the Graduate Institute of Taiwan Studies at Chang Jung University in Taiwan.  ""The elite became in favor of a kind of gender equality,"" Damm said. Still, same-sex marriage still had to overcome traditional perceptions of gender roles and the strong pressure on children to marry and have kids. The self-ruled island also lacks many openly gay and lesbian celebrities to lead the way; the writer and television talk show host Kevin Tsai is among the few exceptions. Taiwan would join Canada, Colombia, Ireland, the United States and 16 other countries that have legalized same-sex marriage over the past 15 years, according to the Washington, D.C.-based LGBT rights advocacy group Human Rights Campaign . But it would be a notable exception among Asian and Middle Eastern countries, at least 20 of which continue to ban same-sex intercourse.  ""It's a big step forward for the history of human rights,"" said Yu Mei-nu, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker who is sponsoring the same-sex marriage bill now in line for parliamentary debate. ""If Taiwan can get this passed ... it will give other Asian countries a model."" Taiwan's Justice Ministry has not backed a specific bill, but pledged on its website last month to maintain an ""attitude of openness"" toward same-sex marriage. President Tsai said as recently as October that she supports same-sex marriage. Domestic gays and lesbians have also formed an effective lobby in recent years. An annual Gay Pride march in Taipei last month drew tens of thousands of people, many pushing for gay marriage. About 100 people have separately formed a group pushing for the cause. For Log Chen, a Tarot card fortune teller in Taipei, legalized marriage would mean she and her partner of three years could make future plans with more confidence.  ""In case something happens to my partner, I will not be left with nothing,"" Chen, 32, said. While practical issues such as sharing assets and medical benefits are motivating factors, simple love and respect are also a strong impetus, said Jay Lin, founder and director of the Taiwan International Queer Film Festival.  ""There are lots of people who have been loving and committed to each other for decades and they'd like to put a ring around their finger,"" said the father of 4-month-old twin boys, who said he would consider marrying his partner. Still, as legalization grows closer, opposition to same-sex marriage is hardening among a small minority of fundamentalist churches and conservative politicians. That includes some members of the main opposition Nationalist Party's Central Standing Committee, party spokesman Hu Wen-chi said. During their time in power, the Nationalists stopped earlier efforts to pass same-sex marriage bills, including one introduced in 2013 that met opposition from Christian groups that gathered signatures from about 400,000 naysayers. Legalizing same-sex marriages would burden Taiwan's welfare system and be tough on children, said Chen Chih-hung, chairman of the year-old political party Faith And Hope League, which has no seats in parliament. The death of a same-sex spouse would leave the survivor dependent on government support as many couples would not have children to support them in old age, Chen said. Children of such couples would find it difficult to socialize with children from more mainstream families, he said, although that argument has been refuted by many social scientists. Su, the software engineer, said she and her partner, also 35, find little sign of such concerns among the people they meet. Most Taiwanese are highly accepting of their relationship and their right to raise children, she says.  ""We go to the market with our kids and people say 'how cute,'"" she said. ""When they find there are two mamas, they feel intrigued. Maybe they have seen news about this type of family but don't have friends near them who are doing it.""

The forecasters slashed the state's previous projections for tax collections through June 2017 by 5.9 percent, or $355 million. They also issued the first projections for the two fiscal years beginning in July 2017 and kept their estimates for revenue growth conservative. Legislative researchers projected budget shortfalls totaling $1.1 billion through June 2019, based on current legal requirements for spending. The state's annual spending is $15.5 billion. The state's fiscal woes come amid a national debate over taxes. President-elect Donald Trump promised big income tax cuts while campaigning. Kansas has struggled to balance its budget after slashing personal income taxes in 2012 and 2013 in hopes of stimulating its economy, and Republican Gov. Sam Brownback touted the experiment as a national model. Brownback blames the state's ongoing budget woes on slumps in agriculture and energy production that have also affected other states. The new fiscal forecast -- replacing one issued in April -- assumes that the sluggishness continues for the next two years.  ""I don't think with some of the struggles that we've seen, that we're going to see much of anything turn around in a year or two,"" Shawn Sullivan, Brownback's budget director, said during a news conference. The new forecast also assumes that unemployment rises over the next three years, Kansans' income growth remains below normal, farmers collectively will have a negative net income this year and the gross state product doesn't grow at all this year. Forecasters reduced current-year estimates for sales and corporate and individual income tax collections.  ""The economy, generally, is not robust,"" said Raney Gilliland, director of the Legislature's research staff. The state's monthly tax collections have fallen short of expectations in 33 of the 46 months since the first tax cuts championed by Brownback took effect in January 2013. Its twice-a-year fiscal forecasts have been more pessimistic than their predecessors for the past two years. Kansas slashed its top income tax rate and reduced its number of tax brackets. Trump has proposed doing both with the federal income tax while also reducing corporate income taxes.  ""Some of the Trump tax package is things that we've done here,"" Brownback said during an Associated Press interview Wednesday. But while the federal government can run annual deficits, the Kansas Constitution prohibits them for the state. Brownback has said he'll wait until the Legislature convenes its next annual session in January to outline proposals for closing any gap the state faces. While lawmakers and legislative candidates in both parties have talked about rethinking income tax cuts championed by Brownback, the conservative governor hasn't given an indication of what he might accept. Any tax increase would not generate revenue quickly enough to patch holes in the current budget. The state in the past has diverted funds for highway projects and delayed aid payments to schools or contributions to public pensions to help balance its budget. Former Budget Director Duane Goossen, who served both Democratic and Republican governors, said the budget has been ""structurally out of balance"" since the first tax cuts.  ""If tax policy had been left alone, Kansas would have had no problem weathering the ups and downs that have occurred in the oil and ag economy,"" said Goossen, now a senior fellow with a think tank that's regularly criticized Brownback's tax policies. The state's ongoing budget problems also sparked a political backlash against the term-limited governor's allies. The GOP-dominated Legislature will be less conservative next year. ___ Follow John Hanna on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjdhanna Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It was the hottest September on record, nearly a degree Celsius warmer than the average from 1951 to 1980. It also was the first September where the Mauna Loa Observatory -- ""the gold standard for carbon dioxide monitoring"" -- measured the monthly average of carbon dioxide at more than 400 parts per million (ppm). Because September is almost always the annual low point for CO2 readings, that means the world has permanently crossed the 400 ppm threshold. That also means what today we call the hottest September ever will soon be a normal, or even cool, September. Scientists have long forecast that if we could cut emissions enough to limit warming to two degrees Celsius, we could avoid the effects of climate change -- including sea rise, crop failure, increased extreme weather -- spinning out of control. We've already crossed the one-degree threshold and are projected to reach around four degrees. That's about seven degrees Fahrenheit -- imagine how different your state's weather would be if temperatures averaged seven degrees warmer every day. Is there any hope for the future? President Obama has made progress in cutting emissions and moving the country to cleaner energy. Facing a fanatically anti-environment GOP Congress, however, he has had to depend largely on executive branch powers. The next president will need to not only preserve those policies -- among them limits on power-plant emissions, raised fuel standards and measures to reduce methane emissions -- but also expand them.  Only one of the two presidential candidates has a climate policy; luckily, it's the one holding a commanding lead. Hillary Clinton's plan isn't perfect: Her softness on the dangers of fracking and her embrace of the ethanol-boosting Renewable Fuel Standard program -- which has done more to help the corn industry than the environment -- are troubling. But she would also build on the president's strengthening of fuel-economy and efficiency standards, include green energy projects in her national infrastructure plan, implement the landmark Paris climate deal and Obama's Clean Power Plan and spend $60 billion to fund states and cities that want to go beyond White House goals for lower emissions. If climate change is, in Clinton's words, ""a defining challenge of our time,"" it's disappointing to offer a strategy that can be summed up as ""the status quo, but a little more so."" But as long as the Republican Party controls even half of Congress, executive actions will be the only weapons in the armory to fight climate change. More expansive ideas such as a carbon tax will never make it to the president's desk. Progressively stronger executive actions may be enough, but nobody's sure -- and when the alternative is catastrophe, you'd like to be sure.     During the first Clinton-Trump presidential debate on Sept. 26, Hillary Clinton accused Trump of believing that ""climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese,"" and Trump interrupted to object. (The Washington Post)   Democrats face steep odds in retaking both houses of Congress; under a Clinton presidency then, environmentalists likely would get more results if they focused on changing the climate debate rather than retaking Capitol Hill. Poll numbers offer some reason for optimism. Gallup reported in March that 64 percent of Americans worry about global warming, the highest percentage in eight years, and a record 65 percent now believe global warming is caused by ""human activities."" The public is as receptive as it has been in nearly a decade. But work remains: Only 41 percent believe climate change is a serious threat, and another recent Gallup poll found that independents are split over whether 2015's record temperatures were the result of ""human-caused climate change"" or ""natural changes."" Shifting the discussion is one area where, surprisingly, the 2016 campaign could change the climate debate for the better, even though climate change has been absent from the discussion. The contest has altered political journalism in a important way: As CNN's Dylan Byers writes, ""The traditional model of 'he said, she said' journalism . . . was thrown out the window in favor of a more aggressive journalism that sought to prioritize accuracy over balance."" More journalists have seen that the sky won't fall if they treat falsehoods as falsehoods, and climate change is an obvious area to apply this new model. Senators should not be able to bring snowballs onto the Senate floor to ""disprove"" climate change without every headline fact-checking them. The realities of climate change are as much objective truth as the murder or unemployment rates. Regarding them as such will be an early test of whether political journalism has rededicated itself to the facts. The debate over climate change is changing, but not as rapidly as it can or should. We have largely squandered decades that could have been spent heading off the danger, and now the consequences are no longer abstract. Climate change is a perilous threat to the country and the world; we must finally treat it that way.

Fresh election data suggest that the Democratic nominee appears to be benefiting from upticks in participation by Latinos, who historically vote in lower numbers than the electorate overall. The trend, say advocates seeking to expand the Hispanic vote, is largely motivated by distaste for Trump, who has proposed hardline immigration policies and stirred emotions from the outset of his campaign with a series of controversial statements about Mexicans and other Latinos. ""The Trump candidacy and the climate it's created has really heightened the importance and the personal nature of this election for Latinos,"" said Yvanna Cancela, political director of Culinary Workers Union 226, which represents casino workers in Nevada. According to the data firm Catalist, one of the largest increases of early voting by Latinos is taking place in Arizona, a traditionally Republican state that Clinton visited for the first time during the general election on Wednesday. Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, delivered a speech there in Thursday entirely in Spanish. Significant upticks are also taking place in Nevada and Florida, two other states where a burgeoning Hispanic vote could prove key in determining the outcome.         1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           What Donald Trump is doing on the campaign trail      View Photos   The GOP presidential nominee is out on the trail ahead of the general election in November.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        With Latinos accounting for about half of its 57,000 members, the culinary union in Nevada has launched an unprecedented door-knocking and phoning effort to urge members and their neighbors to cast their votes early. In Florida, more Latinos had voted early as of Wednesday than did so during the entire early voting period in 2012, according to the Clinton campaign. Some of the biggest registration gains there have come along the Interstate 4 corridor, which has witnessed a big influx of Puerto Ricans since in the wake of the island's economic difficulties. More modest increases in Latino participation, meanwhile, are being seen in battleground states including Colorado and Virginia, where most polls show Clinton with a shrinking lead over Trump. Manassas Park, a suburb in the fast-growing Washington region with the highest concentration of Latino voters in Virginia, has seen an uptick in absentee voting, as has surrounding Prince William County, according to the state elections board. In Texas, a red state where Trump maintains a lead in polling, counties with the highest shares of Latino voters, all located along the Mexican border, have also seen surges in early voting, according to the office of the secretary of state. Among Hispanics, Clinton maintained roughly a 50 percentage point lead in a new Washington Post-Univision News poll released Thursday, with Trump's deep unpopularity raising questions about how much his candidacy has hampered Republicans' long-term chances to win back support from the nation's largest minority-group voting bloc.   [Poll: Trump deeply unpopular among Latinos, who favor Clinton by more than 3 to 1]     At the same time, early voting among African Americans -- another key part of the constituency Clinton is counting upon to prevail -- until recent days had been lagging voter participation from four years ago. Clinton sought to shore up support among black voters during a pair of appearances in North Carolina on Thursday in which she argued that Trump's vision for his presidency would leave them behind.  ""He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters,"" Clinton told a crowd of about 1,800 on the grounds of Pitt Community College. ""He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories."" Clinton noted that Trump has been repeatedly accused of housing discrimination at his real estate properties -- and that he repeatedly proclaimed the guilt of five black and Hispanic men, known as the Central Park Five, on assault and rape accusations, even after DNA evidence exonerated them. ""Do any of us have a place in Trump's America?"" Clinton asked. Republicans pointed to some favorable trends in absentee and early voting numbers for their standard-bearer, including upticks in GOP participation in counties in Ohio that Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee, carried. Ohio, which has a large white, working-class population, is among the swing states where Trump has shown the most appeal. As the race has tightened nationally, Trump has sought to put several Democratic-leaning states in play that share similar demographics, including Wisconsin and Michigan, which figure in his ticket in the race's closing days. His campaign has also been buoyed by tightening poll numbers in New Hampshire, a largely white state that Clinton until recently appeared to have locked down. On Thursday, Trump also appeared in North Carolina, a state key to his political fortunes.  In Concord, N.C., Trump cast Clinton as a ""candidate of yesterday"" and complained that he is held to a different standard than his Democratic rival.  At his rally, Trump continued to draw attention to the FBI's renewed inquiry into Clinton's email practices while she was secretary of state, when she used a private server.  ""Now she's got bigger problems. If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis that would cripple the operations of our government,"" Trump said.  The GOP nominee also criticized now-interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile, after an email released by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks indicated that she had provided debate questions in advance to the Clinton campaign. Trump said that if he had done something similar, he would have faced a bigger backlash. ""Headlines: 'Trump to leave race,' "" Trump said, opining about what the media reaction would have been had that happened.  Clinton's oft-changing travel schedule provides clues to the day-by-day, hour-by-hour evaluation of the campaign map.   [As race tightens, Clinton campaign is counting on minority support]   Her campaign is balancing a need to solidify support in Colorado, New Hampshire and Michigan with efforts to counter Trump's momentum in Florida and North Carolina. Bill Clinton made a sudden detour to Detroit on Thursday for outreach aimed at black voters, also a sign of where the campaign sees potential signs of trouble. Hillary Clinton will be there Friday. Clinton has several ways to assemble the needed 270 electoral votes that do not depend on winning all three of the closest, biggest contests now -- Florida, Ohio and North Carolina. But all depend on holding a bedrock of states such as Michigan that have seemed out of play for months. Both campaigns announced new television ad buys for Michigan for the final week of the campaign. Trump was already advertising there, but Clinton hadn't aired ads in the state since the Democratic primaries. Trump's slim path to victory most likely depends on peeling off a Democratic-leaning state such as Michigan or Wisconsin atop run-the-table victories in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa. Clinton's effort to pick up Arizona -- or at least force Trump to spend time and money there -- reflects confidence in her current standing, aides say, as well as a belief that the Latino voting numbers give her a fighting chance.  Kaine delivered an entire campaign speech in Spanish on Thursday evening in Phoenix, where he stressed his belief in a brand of inclusive politics that celebrates diversity. He criticized Trump's controversial rhetoric about immigrants, calling the GOP nominee a ""payaso,"" a clown, and specifically criticized his attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel and former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. ""For the first time in a long time Arizona is competitive,"" Kaine said in Spanish, urging voters to vote early -- and immediately after the rally. ""The power of the Latino vote can make a big difference in many states, in a historic way."" In Arizona, Latinos represented 13.2 percent of all early voters as of Tuesday, up from 11 percent at the same point in 2012 and 8.1 percent in 2008, according to Catalist, a firm that works with Democrats and progressive groups. In Nevada, Latinos make up 11.8 percent of early voters so far, compared with 10.5 percent in 2012 and 9.1 percent in 2008. And in Florida, they accounted for 14.1 percent of all returned ballots as of Tuesday, up from 9.6 percent at the same point in 2008.   Among the groups seeking to bolster Latino participation this cycle is the Center for Community Change Action, which has targeted the battleground states of Florida, Nevada and Colorado. Jeff Parcher, the group's communications director, said the aim is to get voters to the polls who haven't been participating in elections. ""These low-propensity voters are never targeted by the campaigns,"" he said, suggesting that if the drive is successful, it could be a ""game changer"" in states where the margin is close. Xochitl Hinojosa, a Clinton spokeswoman, said the uptick in Latino early voting includes states with smaller Hispanic populations as well, such as North Carolina and Ohio. ""From the start of the campaign, we have made it a priority to have a strong Latino vote program that reaches voters where they are because we understand how critical this voting bloc is to winning on Tuesday,"" she said. ""Over the next few days, you'll only see our efforts intensify in an effort to expand participation.""  Jenna Johnson in Florida and North Carolina, Abby Phillip in North Carolina, and Scott Clement, Ed O'Keefe, Sean Sullivan and Karen Tumulty in Washington contributed to this report.  "
