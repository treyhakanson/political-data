So does China.	"   In this photo taken Feb. 24, 2016, Chinese students pass above their heads a 90-meter-wide flag of the Chinese Communist Party at the semester commencement ceremony of a middle school in southwestern China's Chongqing Municipality. (Chinatopix Via AP)  WUZHEN, China -- Outraged Americans are calling on tech companies to crack down on ""fake news"" -- a call that is echoing a world away at a Chinese Communist Party-backed conference on the future of the Internet. In the week since Donald Trump triumphed in the U.S. presidential race, Internet companies including Facebook, Google and Twitter have been accused by some of bolstering his rise by giving people a platform to spread fabrications packaged as valid news reporting. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg initially brushed off the criticism, saying that ""99 percent of what people see is authentic."" He soon changed course, deciding, alongside Google, to stop some of the worst offenders from making money off ads. The debate about social media's role in Trump's rise and the question of policing online content resonated at this week's World Internet Summit, a bizarre event where Chinese censors mixed with Cambodia's prime minister and a smattering of American tech executives at a resort outside Shanghai. The summit, now in its third year, is an expensive effort to spread an alternate vision for the Internet. California-types talk about ""connectivity"" and imagine a borderless world. President Xi Jinping prefers to talk about ""cyber sovereignty,"" an Internet where each country controls a slice of the web. As the architects of the Great Firewall, the system of censorship that controls what the country's 700 million Internet users read and see, China's leaders are longtime advocates of a web where the state provides ""security,"" vetting what content is and is not safe.    Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers opening remarks at the 3rd World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, China, on Nov. 16, 2016. (EPA/CHLOE ZHANG)  It is not ""safe"" for people in China to use Google's search engine, for instance. Nor can they download the Facebook app. Searching for information about the wealth of certain Chinese political figures -- and hundreds of other things -- is also out of bounds. And it's not just blocking sites and search terms. The Chinese Communist Party sees social media as a threat to social stability and worries that citizens connecting online could lead to ""color revolutions"" or mass unrest. Chinese Internet companies are asked to hire in-house censors to vet posts on mirco-blogging platforms such as Weibo and chat services such as Weixin. On these and other platforms, there are periodic crackdowns on ""fake news"" and ""rumor-mongering"" -- all in the name of protecting the public good. ""It is forbidden to use hearsay to create news or use conjecture and imagination to distort the facts,"" read a July 2016 missive from the Cyberspace Administration of China. American officials and companies have been vocal critics of China's paternalistic web policing, calling the Great Firewall a barrier to trade and a violation of human rights. On the eve of the conference in Wuzhen, Amnesty International urged U.S. companies such as Facebook to ""resist China's Orwellian vision of the Internet."" To be clear, the United States is far from adopting China's vision of the Internet -- or anything close. Blocking purveyors of ""fake news"" is different than blocking entire websites and search terms, or criminalizing dissent. But it was striking to see how what's happening in America became a focus at the Wuzhen conference. Over two days of speeches, several people referenced Trump's rise as evidence of why the Internet must be more tightly controlled. On day one, Robin Li, founder of Baidu, shared his thoughts on Trump. He was not, like many Americans, surprised by Trump's victory, Li said. The nature of the Internet, particularly social media, made his rise ""inevitable."" Li said Trump, unlike Clinton, understood that ""conspiracy"" and ""extreme emotional expression"" thrive online. Now U.S. tech and media have learned they need to step in, he said. Fear of an unbridled Internet ran deep in Wuzhen. While Facebook VP Vaughan Smith delivered a peppy talk on artificial intelligence in one room, another group gathered to discuss ""cyberterrorism,"" blaming social media for the 2014 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Kam Chow Wong, a former Hong Kong police officer who now teaches criminal justice at Cincinnati's Xavier University, used words like ""extremism"" to describe student activism in the Chinese Special Administrative Region. He said authorities need to do more to control social media. ""If you regulate in an appropriate manner, it will make it more useful, then it will be more free."" ""I don't think anybody knows why Trump won, but it's a good move that the U.S. is trying to regulate social media; it's overdue."" Congcong Zhang contributed to this report.

(Courtesy of Sara Powers)  Several weeks before the presidential election, Sara Powers put the finishing touches on a free community pantry. The wooden structure she calls ""The Giving Tree"" stands in a public park, and allows neighbors in her small Midwest town to fill the shelves with food and toiletries. Then, those who need it can come any time to take from it without stipulations or limitations. In the short time it has been there, it has been working as planned. As soon as its contents are depleted, someone comes along and anonymously restocks it. But Powers, a 33-year-old mother of four, did not know what to expect when she went to check on it the day after the election. In the Missouri county where she lives, nearly 80 percent voted for Donald Trump, making Powers a minority in her support for Hillary Clinton. Everything post-election felt fraught. With everyone so bitterly divided, would they still prioritize kindness? What she found, and has continued to find every day since, is that yes, despite the tensions over the election, the people in her town of West Plains continued to refill the pantry. For Powers, that small action was a reminder that the ugliness of the election was not a reflection of America. On the Facebook page she created for the pantry she wrote: This week has been hard. Hard to see friends arguing, people divided. But to the people that gave to the pantry today, none of that mattered. They don't know if the people that take what they gave are Republican or Democrat. Conservative or Liberal. Religious or not. Pro-life or Pro-choice. They don't care.  I think that's how the vast majority of us are, we've just gotten distracted. We think that our neighbors are against us. And that's just not true. I'm ready for us all to see the good in each other again. Thank you to whoever it was that donated today. I know you thought all you gave was bottles of water and some food, but you gave much more than that today. You gave me a heart full of faith in my fellow people. She also shared similar thoughts with the 3.6 million members of the Pantsuit Nation Facebook page, the not-so-secret pro-Clinton group created in the weeks before the election. She has been inundated with positive comments there, many from people who are interested in starting a free pantry in their communities. Powers acknowledges that the pantry alone is not a long-term solution to solve hunger or poverty, but said it is a way for people to give and receive in an actionable way. No one is vetted or questioned about what they're taking. There's an understanding and a trust that the people who take from the pantry need it. The donations come from strangers who will not be recognized for their altruism or likely ever know who the recipients of it are, and that has renewed Powers' belief that people, despite their politics, are fundamentally good.      Speaking in Washington, Hillary Clinton was honored by the Children's Defense Fund and made her first public appearance since the presidential election, where she lost to Republican Donald Trump. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)   This election, she said, made us lose sight of that. ""There are so many different ways people can put kindness back out into the world,"" she said in an interview. ""If we all responded this way I feel like the world would be in such a better place in four years. If everybody who was disappointed put that energy into good things, a lot of good things could happen."" There are a lot of people feeling hurt and angered by Trump's win. But instead of demonizing Trump voters as all bad people, she said it is imperative to find ways like this to work together for the betterment of everybody. ""You have to practice what you preach,"" she said. ""I know it sounds like a Pollyanna world, but I want that.""

The forecasters slashed the state's previous projections for tax collections through June 2017 by 5.9 percent, or $355 million. They also issued the first projections for the two fiscal years beginning in July 2017 and kept their estimates for revenue growth conservative. Legislative researchers projected budget shortfalls totaling $1.1 billion through June 2019, based on current legal requirements for spending. The state's annual spending is $15.5 billion. The state's fiscal woes come amid a national debate over taxes. President-elect Donald Trump promised big income tax cuts while campaigning. Kansas has struggled to balance its budget after slashing personal income taxes in 2012 and 2013 in hopes of stimulating its economy, and Republican Gov. Sam Brownback touted the experiment as a national model. Brownback blames the state's ongoing budget woes on slumps in agriculture and energy production that have also affected other states. The new fiscal forecast -- replacing one issued in April -- assumes that the sluggishness continues for the next two years.  ""I don't think with some of the struggles that we've seen, that we're going to see much of anything turn around in a year or two,"" Shawn Sullivan, Brownback's budget director, said during a news conference. The state's monthly tax collections have fallen short of expectations in 33 of the 46 months since the first tax cuts championed by Brownback took effect in January 2013. Its twice-a-year fiscal forecasts have been more pessimistic than their predecessors for the past two years. Kansas slashed its top income tax rate and reduced its number of tax brackets. Trump has proposed doing both with the federal income tax while also reducing corporate income taxes.  ""Some of the Trump tax package is things that we've done here,"" Brownback said during an Associated Press interview Wednesday. But while the federal government can run annual deficits, the Kansas Constitution prohibits them for the state. Brownback has said he'll wait until the Legislature convenes its next annual session in January to outline proposals for closing any gap the state faces. While lawmakers and legislative candidates in both parties have talked about rethinking income tax cuts championed by Brownback, the conservative governor hasn't given an indication of what he might accept. Any tax increase would not generate revenue quickly enough to patch holes in the current budget. The state in the past has diverted funds for highway projects and delayed aid payments to schools or contributions to public pensions to help balance its budget. Former Budget Director Duane Goossen, who served both Democratic and Republican governors, said the budget has been ""structurally out of balance"" since the first tax cuts.  ""If tax policy had been left alone, Kansas would have had no problem weathering the ups and downs that have occurred in the oil and ag economy,"" said Goossen, now a senior fellow with a think tank that's regularly criticized Brownback's tax policies. The state's ongoing budget problems also sparked a political backlash against the term-limited governor's allies. The GOP-dominated Legislature will be less conservative next year. ___ Follow John Hanna on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjdhanna Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Board chairman’s proposal triggers debate but has some support	" Metro Board Chairman Jack Evans urged a federal takeover of the transit system Wednesday, instantly triggering a regionwide debate over what would be a drastic step to solve the agency's financial and management problems.  Evans's call for a federal control board with ""extraordinary powers"" to run Metro drew a surprisingly positive response from several leading elected officials and former Metro board members. Virginia's transportation chief and the chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors were open to the idea.  D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) renewed her call for a regional sales tax or other reliable funding for Metro while leaving open the possibility of supporting a takeover.  But such a move would face major political obstacles. Many in Congress would resist using taxpayer funds to support the transit agency.  ""I would be surprised if there's any appetite in Congress to take on the responsibilities of a contemporary urban transit system,"" said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who is a strong supporter of Metro.      At a congressional hearing on April 13, after Metro shut down for a day to make emergency repairs, Metro Board Chairman Jack Evans asked for federal funding to help with maintenance. (Subcommittee on Transportation and Public Assets)   But Connolly didn't completely shut the door to the possibility, either. He said he might consider it if Congress agreed to pick up a share of Metro's operating costs, as the District, Maryland and Virginia do.  Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Oversight subcommittee on transportation and public assets, said he was lukewarm about a federal takeover but would consider one ""if we don't see continued progress."" He emphasized, however, that Metro would not be getting any operating funds from Congress.  ""Absolutely not,"" said Mica, who has been a critic of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. ""It's a very prosperous region. The local governments can certainly help.""   Supporters said that Congress might come around if a takeover were the only way to salvage a system that carries hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors each day. Critics of the proposal said it was premature and unrealistic, or both.  ""I don't think the federal government is very good at running a business,"" said Metro board member Michael Goldman, citing the challenges faced by Amtrak and the U.S. Postal Service.  He also expressed doubt that a federal takeover would come with an influx of cash.     Washington's Metro came into the world 40 years ago full of promise. It was a rail system of the future. Then, reality set in. (Lee Powell/The Washington Post)   ""That's just a pipe dream,"" said Goldman, who represents Maryland. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) issued a brief comment that avoided taking an explicit stand. ""As the governor has made extremely clear, making Metro as safe as possible and returning fiscal stability to the system have to be top priorities,"" spokesman Doug Mayer said.  Evans's proposal sparked interest because it appears to offer a simple -- albeit radical -- way to break up budgetary and administrative logjams that have left Metro in a dire state. The system has been losing riders and revenue as it struggles with chronic safety lapses, service disruptions and neglect of basic maintenance.  Evans, who also is a D.C. Council member, spoke in response to an editorial in The Washington Post on Wednesday saying it's time to consider a federal takeover.   [Post editorial: It has come to this: It's time to consider a federal takeover of Metro]  Evans said he supports the idea because the agency's problems can be solved only by a body strong enough to raise money, dismiss employees, cancel union contracts and streamline management.  His recommendation is based in part on his experience with the federal control board that succeeded in rescuing the District from financial crisis in the 1990s. ""You have to have extraordinary powers -- that's the key,"" he said. ""You have to be able to negate contracts, fire people and restructure without outside interference."" A control board also is necessary, he said, as a condition to tap federal funds to help cover Metro's operating deficits, estimated at $290 million in the next fiscal year, and long-term investment needs, which run in the billions of dollars. He noted that the District's chief financial officer, Jeffrey S. DeWitt, estimates that Metro needs $12 billion to $18 billion in additional capital funds over the next 10 years to pay for system maintenance and upgrades. ""You bring in the federal infusion of money to fix this"" with federal control, Evans said. In particular, he hopes that the federal government would assume responsibility for Metro's unfunded pension liability of $2.8 billion. ""When the feds took over the city, they took over the entire $10 billion unfunded pension liability,"" Evans said. ""That's something the feds could do for Metro."" In addition, he said, a control board could ""change the entire personnel structure at Metro.""  It also could eliminate the system of binding arbitration of labor contracts. That could be a selling point for Republican lawmakers, who have objected to the practice. ""We have 13,000 employees who take up 70 percent of our budget,"" Evans said. A control board would look at such issues as ""Do we have too many people? Are the pensions and retirements too generous? You change all that, you get out of the binding-arbitration situation.""  [Budget proposal paints grim portrait of Metro's future ]  Those comments drew a scathing response from Jackie Jeter, president of Metro's largest union, who said Evans was engaging in ""crazy talk."" Suggesting that federal intervention could allow for firings and for contracts to be negated was ""terribly irresponsible,"" Jeter said.  Evans said a control board might be a non-starter because of legal obstacles related to the WMATA Compact, the agency's founding document that spells out how it is governed and funded. But several experts said the compact would not prevent a takeover if the federal government, and all the compact signatories, agreed to support a control board.  A Metro spokeswoman said that General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld would not comment on the proposal. He is, instead, ""focused on delivering safe and reliable service,"" she said.   Tom Davis (R), the former U.S. House member from Virginia who wrote the legislation two decades ago that put a control board in charge of the District's finances, said it would be possible to do the same for Metro. One way it could be accomplished: The federal government could offer Metro an infusion of cash in exchange for the establishment of an oversight board. Evans, who has been board chairman for nine months, says it's impossible to lead the 16-member board effectively for two reasons: It's too large and members have split loyalties between the interests of the jurisdictions that selected them and Metro's best interest. ""Most of the loyalties [of board members], I have found, are not to Metro but to the jurisdictions that chose them,"" Evans said. Political leaders and others open to a federal takeover also see it as a way to get around the cumbersome governing structure. Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairman Sharon Bulova (D), in supporting federal intervention, cited the jurisdictional discord that has already come to light in Metro's budget discussions for the next fiscal year. ""You can have local governments veto a budget or hold a budget hostage for parochial interest,"" she said. ""I agree that something urgently needs to be done on the governance side,"" she said.  Virginia Transportation Secretary Aubrey Layne said the state would be ""open to the idea"" of a control board but that it's ""probably premature."" ""Certainly, governance is a big issue with all the different political pressures in every [jurisdiction] being different,"" he said.   [Metro chairman Evans: Board is so unwieldy that we ought to scrap it altogether]  Metro board member Corbett Price, who represents the District, supported the proposal and praised Evans as ""the only board chair I've seen to really show political courage and speak out as an advocate for the system."" But former Metro board chairman Tom Downs said, ""The answer has to be political accountability at the very top of the political food chain"" -- the governors of Maryland and Virginia and the mayor. ""The control board thing is such a dud of an idea, not because there's a slim possibility that you could pull this off, but because it relieves the pressure about everything else,"" Downs said. ""The one-cent regional sales tax is the necessary thing to fix the dilemma about the predictable future of Metro, and the three people who can shepherd that through are the three executives.""  James C. Dinegar, president of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, said that Evans's call was premature because there's a plan in place to deal with Metro's immediate problems.  ""There's a proposal to reduce the workforce further,"" he said. ""There are proposed, but not enacted, service cuts. There are proposed, but not enacted, fare increases. There are systemwide improvements being put in place . . . and now, we tell the federal government we can't handle this? Now?  ""I'm not sure that every time the region has a problem they get to run to Uncle Sam,"" Dinegar said.  Christian Dorsey, a Metro board member representing Virginia, called the idea ""half-baked."" ""The idea of a federal takeover sounds like it could solve all our problems, but I think there are plenty of details hidden in that simple phrase that would have to be unpacked before that becomes a solution,"" Dorsey said.  Evans initially expressed pessimism that the control board proposal would get much backing. Asked who supports the idea, besides him and The Post's editorial page, he said: ""Probably nobody. The region is resistant to change of any kind. Nobody wants to change anything, even as the house is burning down.""  Faiz Siddiqui contributed to this report. "
