The attack took place in the early hours of Monday. Police said in a statement that a witness reported seeing three men smash the glass front of a tanning studio, followed by an explosion and a fire. Officers found a freshly painted swastika and the word ""Out"" painted on a wall. There has been a rise in attacks against foreigners in Germany in recent years, particularly targeting asylum-seekers. More than 1.1 million people applied for asylum in German since the start of 2015. It wasn't immediately clear whether the business owner was an asylum-seeker. Magdeburg Police said they were investigating the attack as suspected political extremism. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Courtesy of the author.  As I watched the election coverage Tuesday night, the only thing I was thinking was ""what am I going to tell my students tomorrow?"" I teach government at a high school for recent immigrants. Some of my students are here legally, many as refugees, others are undocumented, and some came without documents and have since been granted asylum. I decided to write them a letter to explain how I was feeling. I invited them to respond. Here is an excerpt of the note I gave my class on Wednesday, along with the reflections they shared in response: ""I know that many, if not all of you, came to this country with hope that our government would protect you from many of the problems in your countries. I feel like my country has let you down. We tell the rest of the world that we are this great place and I feel like many of the lies we tell others are becoming clear. I know that many of you are scared right now. I want you to know that I am scared too. I know that Oakland, California is still a good place to be an immigrant. It's not as good today as it was yesterday, but the people here will try to protect you and your families from whatever Trump and the Republican Congress try to do about immigration. I also know that America has a bad history of racism that is still happening today. I also know that that racism exists to help rich white people keep power. Because I am white, I also have never personally felt the pain, the frustration, the anger, the sadness that happens inside of people who experience racism every day. I want you to know that your teachers love and care about each and every one of you and that the fact that we cannot protect you from these things and this election makes me feel devastated and weak. I also know that ordinary people have changed many things in America and have helped this country to improve. This gives me hope. I believe that you are the future of America. Immigrants have always been the hardest workers in America and we have hella hard work ahead of us. Now is more important than ever to know your constitutional rights and to be active politically. The rights you have in the constitution still exist. Learn them and use them to protect you! Take the citizenship test! Study, pass it and vote! I want you to know that you have power when you vote, but also when you join together with other people to fight for what you believe in. Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez called it ""People Power,"" and it is a very powerful thing, but it only exists if you choose to use it. This country is changing to be more diverse. This can change the results of elections in this country if people use their People Power. In two years there will be another election for senators and members of the House of Representatives. The way to change this country to be better for you, your families, your little brothers, sisters, and cousins is to care about the country and to do your best to change it for the better. Learn English so that you can talk to other people, explain your ideas and tell them your story. Get a degree from college so that you can influence more people with your ideas and your money. Keep studying and learning how things work in this country so that you can use them to help you. Join political organizations that reflect your beliefs. Fighting with People Power is stronger than fighting with weapons. Fighting with People Power takes work and time, it takes many people, and most importantly it takes the ability to not give up when things get difficult. Out of everyone I know, you are the people who I believe will never give up. You have faced many challenges already to make it here. Please don't give up on this country and please keep fighting with us to make it a better place for everyone. Here are some of my students' responses. I have identified each student only by their home country and age to protect their identities: ""I'm feeling hopeless and destroyed. I'm saying this because I have lots of dreams and hope for my future. When I heard Donald Trump won, my first question was 'why did people vote for him?' He is racist and stupid. He doesn't understand how hard it is to be an immigrant in this country and how we achieve our goals. There is no need to blame immigrants. We are here today because of our knowledge and hard work. I have no life in my country. I know that nobody can send me back anywhere but I'm still worried for the immigrants without papers who came here full of goals and dreams"" -- Female, 18, Sri Lanka ""I can't believe how racist America is. Is American so racist that they chose an ignorant president just because they agree with his thinking about Latinos and Muslims? Most of my friends are Latinos and Muslims and I think that they are great people ... Immigrants are not bad people. Immigrants are trabajadores."" - Female, 18, Guatemala ""I wish I had a country, because I was afraid [in Thailand], and I'm afraid here."" - Female, 18, Burma ""I'm worried that this country is not going to be any better than my country. Nobody listens to women in my country, and now the president will do the same here?"" - Female, 18, Afghanistan ""It is a very disturbing sad day. When we go from an evening of joy to a morning of sadness we have flipped history. No one ever thought this day would come when our president would be a person who doesn't want the best for our future. It doesn't matter because we will fight against anything that takes away our hope. Everyday I go to school to learn with my friends for a better future and today I hear our president wants to take away the hope from my peers who are immigrants and undocumented. It doesn't matter where my peers are from, from Mexico or Guatemala or from Burma or from Yemen, we fight together. In the end it doesn't make a difference. We are all human and I will fight for them all ... Today we fight a new battle for democracy and the right to live free in our America."" - Male, 17, Yemen ""All my dreams can fall down because of a decision that people made last night. I don't understand how a person who says bad things, that hurt people, is the head of a country ... I have faced many troubles in order to come here. I don't know how but I have to continue."" - Male, 18, El Salvador ""I am worried because I am an immigrant who is black, a woman and queer and this country just elected a man who is against everything I am."" - Female, 17, Rwanda ""I still feel angry and sad for the people who came here for the American dream. And I hate how Donald Trump wants to change the American dream to an American nightmare. I just want to keep thinking and express how I feel and I want to change people's minds about immigrants. -- Male, 18, Mexico  "

This was really a game-theory exercise as, at the time, it appeared that Hillary Clinton was going to win the electoral college easily. At least, that's how it looked before FBI Director James Comey's October email surprise. I lost the bet. Pundits will discuss the political ramifications of this upset endlessly. I want to talk about the economic and market implications of complex events. I have good news and bad news for you. Let's cut to the chase and say that on balance, this election is far less significant to your assets and portfolios than most people imagine, especially when they are in a political state of mind. However, there are still surprises to come, along with increased volatility. You can expect a bumpy ride for a few weeks.  With that in mind, the bad news: The simple truth is we have no idea what sort of policies a Trump administration will adopt. Trump has been all over the map on nearly every issue, so there is not a lot to guide us. The word ""uncertainty"" is an overused, lazy crutch among analysts, but in this case, it really is a blank slate. Were his harshest statements (building a wall, banning Muslims, deporting 11 million immigrants, etc.) policy prescriptions or overheated campaign rhetoric? Trump received fewer votes than Mitt Romney did in 2012, and fewer than Hillary Clinton did on Tuesday. He actually lost the popular vote. Can he claim a mandate on that basis? How much will tea party Republicans in Congress act as a check on his more expensive legislative goals?  We do not know. There is also a high degree of uncertainty about changes that may be coming in the new government involving immigration, trade, the Federal Reserve, fiscal stimulus, military spending, the Supreme Court, health care, deregulation, international relations and climate change. Given these unknowns, as results began to trickle in early Tuesday evening and Clinton's blue ""firewall"" began to crumble, overseas markets turned deeply negative. Asia sold off by 5 percent, U.S. futures were down by 800 points and gold surged. It was a knee-jerk response. After Trump's victory speech -- the most coherent and inclusive speech of the campaign -- markets calmed a bit. And even though U.S. stocks opened down, they reversed and rallied all day. (Thursday, too). That was President-elect Trump's first lesson: What he says affects the markets in a bigly way, and we should have no doubt that market volatility may increase significantly (at least a short-term) as he figures this out.  With one party controlling all three branches of government, three significant investment-related Trump policies are likely to be implemented with lasting effects for your portfolios: * Significant tax cuts for corporations and individuals.  * Infrastructure build-out.  * Higher deficit spending.  The tax cuts and deficits that have been discussed sound similar to the George W. Bush economic plan. Note that they are being introduced at a very different phase of the market cycle. Bush took office as the dot-com collapse was occurring; Trump will be sworn in eight years after the financial crisis. The effects are likely to be very different. Expect the initial market reaction to be temporary. Markets will soon shake off the news and go about doing what they do best: discounting future earnings and cash flows to determine the value of corporations.   [The do's and don'ts of a market crash]  When we look at other unexpected historical geopolitical events -- genuine shocks such as the attack on Pearl Harbor, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the resignation of Richard M. Nixon, the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Standard & Poor's downgrading of America's debt rating in 2011 -- there is a pattern that plays out over and over. Markets wobble as traders react emotionally. Often, there is a panicked sell-off that goes too far. This is followed by a rally to a level not quite as high as where the sell-off began, with attendant minor feints and parries. Eventually cooler heads prevail, and the market returns to whatever it was doing before the surprise event. Technically, we describe these stages as reaction, counter-reaction and resumption of prior trend.  Markets were already selling off before 9/11; after the wobble, they resumed that downward trend. The pattern held true after the Pearl Harbor attack -- it came in the midst of a sell-off, with stocks down 30 percent from their 1938 highs. They fell an additional 20 percent before hitting bottom the next year. Markets were in a clear uptrend before the Kennedy assassination; they wobbled, then went back to rally mode. Nixon's resignation too: Markets had peaked in early 1973 and were off 31 percent from the highs by the time Nixon resigned; they then fell an additional 22 percent before hitting a post-crash low.  [Know your investment plan and stick to it]  Here's the truth: Economies and markets are just so much bigger than elected officials and campaigns. The United States has a $17 trillion economy. The day after the election, every person in America -- whether thrilled or disappointed by the election -- got up and went through their usual morning routine: They brushed their teeth, went for a jog, showered, had coffee, ate breakfast, read the paper or Twitter or Facebook, got the kids dressed and sent them off to school, and then went to work. They lived their lives. And every single thing I just mentioned costs money. People spent money on goods and services provided by other people doing their jobs. Those mundane routines of daily life amount to that $17 trillion a year.  That is why the economy has always been larger than any of those huge geopolitical events. Massive media events take up huge mindshare, but economically they are not very significant.  Which leads to the good news. We have been in a long bull market, which, depending on your theory of markets, dates to either the March 2009 lows or the breakout above 2007 levels in 2013. The economy is expanding, wages are finally rising, unemployment is under 5 percent and corporate earnings are still going up.  But I would be remiss if I didn't mention possible setbacks ahead to the social progress made in the past eight years. I have noticed the concerns many of you express on Twitter and Facebook and in emails. My suggestion is this: Consider how you might use a Trump tax cut to follow your conscience and promote social issues you care deeply about. Just because your side lost doesn't mean the country has to go backward. As to your investments, remember this: It is a staple of every presentation I give, and it was the subject of the very first column I wrote for the Washington Post: ""Politics and investing don't mix."" That was never truer than it is today.  Ritholtz is chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management. On Twitter: @Ritholtz. "
3	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/11/11/is-paul-ryan-already-eyeing-medicare-cuts/	Is Paul Ryan already eyeing Medicare cuts?	"      President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 10 pledged to accomplish ""spectacular things for the American people"" as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) sat by his side. (Reuters)   House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Thursday that Medicare has ""serious problems"" that would need to be addressed when Congress moves to repeal and replace President Obama's health-care reform law -- a signal that he is willing to immediately enter the treacherous politics of entitlement reform and perhaps break with President-elect Donald Trump. ""When Obamacare became Obamacare, Obamacare rewrote Medicare, rewrote Medicaid, so if you're going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you have to address those issues as well,"" he said in a Fox News Channel interview. ""What people don't realize is that Medicare is going broke, that Medicare is going to have price controls. Because of Obamacare, Medicaid is in fiscal straits. So you have to deal with those issues if you're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Medicare has got some serious problems because of Obamacare. Those things are part of our plan to replace Obamacare."" Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong declined to comment further on Ryan's plans for Medicare and Medicaid, but he has long advocated major changes to both programs that could reduce their costs -- and their benefits for poor and elderly Americans. Ryan (R-Wis.) specifically cited the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a body created under the Affordable Care Act that has the power to recommend cuts in the level of government's payments to providers who participate in Medicare. It is set to start wielding its powers next year, and while Obamacare's backers say the board is an important tool for reining in health-care costs, conservatives see it as an infringement on the free market that could lead to the rationing of care. The ""Better Way"" policy package that Ryan drafted earlier this year with the aid of his fellow House Republicans proposed a broad package of proposed Medicare reforms, ranging from the repeal of the IPAB to expanding the privately managed Medicare Advantage program to a full-blown overhaul of the Medicare system into a ""premium support"" model. That would involve transforming Medicare from a largely single-payer federal program to a private model where seniors would be federal subsidies to buy private insurance -- similar to the subsidies available to younger Americans who can now buy insurance on the ACA-mandated state marketplaces. ""This reform ensures affordability by fixing the currently broken subsidy system and letting market competition work as a real check on widespread waste and skyrocketing health-care costs,"" the GOP plan says. Ryan has included a premium support model as part of the budget proposals he put forth as chairman of the House Budget Committee, calling them necessary to stabilize the nation's long-term fiscal outlook. But any radical changes to Medicare have historically been deeply unpopular. Trump, by and large, stayed far away from proposing Medicare cuts during the campaign. His health policy platform, for instance, does not make any mention of Medicare amid its promises to repeal Obamacare. It does, however, support ""block-granting"" Medicaid -- that is, changing the federal health program for the poor from an open-ended, formula-based system with strict rules on benefits to a lump-sum model in which states would have great leeway to reduce or supplement benefits.      Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)   Last year, Trump briefly said he would consider a plan supported by GOP rival Ben Carson that would have seniors rely on health savings accounts to finance their care before reversing course and saying he was wary of Medicare changes. ""Abolishing Medicare, I don't think you'll get away with that one,"" he said. ""It's actually a program that's worked. It's a program that some people love, actually."" In a 2013 speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump said, ""As Republicans, if you think you are going to change very substantially for the worse Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in any substantial way, and at the same time you think you are going to win elections, it just really is not going to happen."" But his new transition website includes a revised health policy agenda that could encompass the sorts of changes that Ryan has proposed. ""Modernize Medicare, so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation -- and beyond,"" the document reads. ""Maximize flexibility for States in administering Medicaid, to enable States to experiment with innovative methods to deliver healthcare to our low-income citizens."" As for whether Medicare is ""going broke,"" the program's trustees say that the ""Part A"" trust fund -- the costliest component of Medicare, covering hospital visits -- is set to become insolvent in 2028. In 2009, before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, however, the trustees projected that fund would be insolvent in 2017. The latest projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office show that Medicare spending is set to rise from the current level of about 3 percent of gross domestic product to more than 5 percent of GDP in 2040. But that is considerably less growth than the CBO projected before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which showed Medicare spending in the realm of 7 percent around 2040. In the next 10 years alone, the difference between those projections could amount to $2 trillion, according to an analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress. ""Both in the aggregate and on a per capita basis, Medicare spending growth has slowed in recent years,"" the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation said in a July report. ""While spending is expected to continue to grow more slowly in the future compared to historical trends, there are signs that spending growth could increase at a faster rate than in recent years, in part due to rising prescription drug spending, growing enrollment in Medicare, increases in provider payments, and higher growth in input prices for medical care."" Fox anchor Bret Baier asked Ryan about ""entitlement reform"" generally Thursday, and while he readily proposed reforms to Medicare and Medicaid, he appeared much less eager to propose changes to Social Security. ""Fiscal pressures are mounting faster on health care than they are on Social Security,"" he said."

Key battleground states Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin had voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election for a generation. Ohio, Minnesota and Iowa have been part of winning Democratic maps, as well. Trump outperformed expectations in all of them, moving most into the Republican column after President Barack Obama twice swept the region. Exit polls and unofficial returns reflected deep racial, gender, economic and cultural divides nationally and across the Midwest and Great Lakes region, helping drive Trump's success. His soaring popularity among white voters without a college degree was essential to his capturing the Rust Belt and holding off Clinton in battlegrounds elsewhere, with voters describing themselves as ""fed up"" and ready for a different, even if unpredictable, direction.  ""The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,"" Trump said in his acceptance speech, alluding to his economic populist message that helped him shift much of the old industrial territory. Trump's support Tuesday skewed older, more male and overwhelmingly white. His supporters said they were deeply dissatisfied with the federal government and eager for change, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for national media outlets. Nationally, he won almost 7 out of 10 whites without college degrees.  ""It's just shocking that it took a billionaire to connect with the working-class folks that controlled this election,"" said Byron Dopkins, a 59-year-old accountant and Trump voter in River Falls, Wisconsin. ""It wasn't the elite, it wasn't the white collar ... it was the working-class people."" Trump's surge in working-class regions was evident in places such as Mahoning County, Ohio. Obama won Mahoning, where organized labor still acts as a political force, by a 28-point margin in 2012. On Tuesday, Clinton won it by just 3 percentage points and fell short of Obama's vote total by more than 20,000. Obama won nearby Belmont County, in the coal country along the Ohio River, in his first election. It shifted to Romney in 2012, and on Tuesday Trump won almost 70 percent of the vote. Across Ohio, nearly half of all voters said international trade hurts the country's jobs situation, and two-thirds of them backed Trump. Two-thirds of the state's voters said the job situation in Ohio had deteriorated or remained static over the past four years, and three-quarters of them voted for Trump. John Osborn is a lifelong Democrat who owns a barber shop in Waverly, Ohio. He voted for Barack Obama twice, but the 44-year-old disabled veteran said people in surrounding Pike County have suffered too much.  ""We are hurting with industry, we're hurting with jobs and morale is low. So for me, I had to take the chance"" and vote for Trump, he said. ""I'm a Trump supporter. I'm not racist. I'm not uneducated. I'm not deplorable. But I'm fed up."" It was a pattern that repeated across the region. Clinton did refashion an alliance similar to Obama's -- women, young voters and nonwhites -- but it wasn't large enough. In Michigan, she lost Flor Penner, a 60-year-old massage therapist who voted for Trump after having twice voting for Obama. Penner lives in the Detroit suburbs of Macomb County, which twice sided with Obama only to see Trump win by almost 12 points. Penner said Trump will bring needed change to Washington, compared to ""something wrong and corrupt"" about Clinton. A Filipino immigrant-turned-American citizen, Penner dismissed Trump's harsh rhetoric on immigration as ""just campaigning."" Clinton's support was concentrated in large cities, the Northeast and along the West Coast. But even in some key urban areas, Clinton fell short of Obama's benchmark. The president won 420,000 votes in Cleveland and surrounding Cuyahoga County in 2012; Clinton won just 383,000. The urban drop-off was a critical blow to Clinton, as Trump ran up resounding margins in small towns and rural areas, while adding victories in many suburbs. While Trump clearly struck a chord among white voters, it's less clear what the electorate that chose him actually wants out of government. The same group of voters gave Obama a 53 percent approval rating and returned Republican majorities to Congress, where GOP leaders already have clashed with Trump on personality and policy. ___ Senior fellow at The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research Marjorie Connelly in Washington and Associated Press writers Amy Forliti in River Falls, Wisconsin, Mike Householder in Waverly, Ohio, and Jeff Karoub in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

In a high-stakes game of political chicken, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the E.U. would not be able to reach the ""final point"" and end its ties with Turkey out of fears of jeopardizing a deal to curb the flow of migrants from Africa and the Middle East to Europe. Hours later, in Brussels, E.U. Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn bluntly said that ""it is time Ankara tells us what they really want,"" in the wake of a report assessing Turkey's status as a candidate for membership in the bloc. The report highlighted what the E.U. saw as backsliding by the Turkish government on essential human rights and rule-of-law standards. The report, issued Wednesday, came after Turkey's recent clampdown on media freedoms and the arrests of 10 pro-Kurdish legislators. ""These various actions, including considerations of reintroducing the death penalty, seem to be increasingly incompatible with Turkey's official desire to become a member of the European Union,"" Hahn said.  ""In its own interest, Turkey urgently needs to stop moving away from the E.U.,"" Hahn said. In the escalating standoff on Turkey's protracted membership bid, Erdogan rose to the challenge. ""They say unabashedly and shamelessly that the E.U. should review its negotiations with Turkey,"" Erdogan told a business group in Istanbul. ""You are late, go and review them as soon as you can. But don't just review them -- go and make your final decision."" The Turkish leader added: ""You know those 3 million refugees in Turkey? They say there is a problem. What if the negotiations end and they open the gates, where would we put those 3 million refugees? That is their worry. That is why they cannot come to the end point."" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the E.U. had to stop its ""threatening"" attitude. ""Make a decision, brother!"" Cavusoglu said. ""If you want the negotiations to stop, then stop them. If you want them to continue, we are ready. But you have to treat us as equal partners. We cannot advance as long as you see us as a second-rate country."" Omer Celik, the minister in charge of Turkey's E.U. negotiations, criticized the union's report. He called it ""far from being constructive or providing guidance"" and said E.U. leaders lacked ""vision and the ability to produce projects."" In March, Turkey and the E.U. reached an agreement in which Turkey would stem the flow of migrants to Greece in return for incentives such as fast-track membership talks, billions of euros in aid for Syrian refugees in Turkey and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens. On the deal on visa-free travel, Celik said Turkey was determined not to alter its anti-terrorism laws. He said E.U. Vice President Frans Timmermans would arrive in Turkey for discussions on the issue. ""If we can reach progress during talks with Timmermans, this will be recorded. If we cannot, then this process will have died toward the end of the year,"" Celik said. The visa deal has hit a hurdle over Turkey's reluctance to change its anti-terrorism laws -- one of the conditions for the lifting of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens traveling to Europe. On Tuesday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, warned Turkey that its crackdown on political opponents and the media goes against E.U. values. Juncker also called on Erdogan to immediately say ""whether Turkey really wants to be -- yes or no -- a member of the European Union."" He added that the Turkish leader would have only himself to blame if the E.U. does not grant visa-free travel in Europe to Turkish citizens soon. Turkey has been in talks to join the European Union since October 2005, but progress has been held up, often by political opposition and particularly because of resistance from Cyprus, an E.U. member. The Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974, when Turkish troops occupied its northern third after a coup by supporters of a union with Greece.  -- Associated Press   Casert reported from Brussels.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/09/the-remarkably-thin-democratic-bench-just-got-badly-exposed/	The remarkably thin Democratic bench just got badly exposed	"   From left, former president Bill Clinton, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and his wife, Anne Holton, the former Virginia secretary of education. Hillary Clinton delivered her concession speech Wednesday after losing the presidential election to Donald Trump. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)  When she dropped out of the Democratic presidential race in 2008, Hillary Clinton uttered these now-famous words: ""Although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time."" It's hard to imagine that on that day Clinton thought she would be the one treading the path the ""next time."" After all, she was 60 years old and had watched her front-running campaign collapse when faced with the natural political talent of Barack Obama. But six years later, as Obama's term entered its final turn and Democrats began seriously thinking about the 2016 election, there was Clinton. Again. At the time, Clinton's status as the lone serious Democratic candidate in the 2016 field was touted as a virtue by party insiders. No primary! And she's by far our best candidate anyway, they argued. The truth -- as exposed by Clinton's stunning loss to Donald Trump on Tuesday night -- was that the Democratic bench was (and is) remarkably thin, a sign of both the relative ill health of the party downballot and the isolated appeal of Obama. Think about it: Why was Clinton essentially handed the nomination in early 2015? After all, she had failed once already as a front-runner in 2008. And, she represented a political theory -- Clintonism -- that was clearly running out of gas in an increasingly tribal and polarized political world. Not to mention that she would be 68 on Election Day 2016, not exactly the next generation of leadership for the party. The reason for the ""Clinton or bust"" strategy was simple: There simply wasn't anyone else. Vice President Biden was a possibility, but the death of his oldest son, Beau, in May 2015 effectively sidelined him. (And at 73, Biden isn't exactly a spring chicken.) Beyond Biden and Clinton, name someone else who looked ready to make a serious run at a national nomination. There isn't anyone. (Trust me, I have thought about virtually every possibility.) Contrast that to what the Republican field looked like as the 2016 election shaped up: A dozen and a half candidates including a handful of 40-something rising stars (Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, Bobby Jindal, Ted Cruz) as well as a number of other prominent voices (Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, John Kasich) within the national party who had deep and impressive resumes. And a true outsider who was making his first run for president. That Donald Trump beat all of them is the lasting takeaway for most people. But in retrospect, the size of the GOP field -- for which the party was relentlessly mocked -- was also a sign of the party's health up and down the ballot. Democrats heading into 2016 simply didn't have the depth of political talent to put 10 or 12 serious candidates forward. And so they lined up behind Clinton. Clinton's loss exposes the thinness of the Democratic bench. But it doesn't solve the problem.      Hillary Clinton spoke to supporters, Nov. 9, offering a message of thanks, apology and hope. Here are the key moments from that fervent address. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   As it became increasingly clear Clinton would lose on Tuesday night, names began to bubble up as potential 2020 Democratic candidates. Michelle Obama, who has never held or run for office, was the name I heard most. Kamala Harris, the Californian who won a Senate seat last night(!), was also mentioned. So, too, was Cory Booker, who's been in the Senate for just three years. The other names -- Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- are intriguing candidates, but they almost entirely unknown nationally, even among Democrats. One of the untold stories of the Obama presidency is how singular his victory was. Yes, Obama won more than 330 electoral votes, twice. But his success at the ballot box was never transferable. Democrats lost badly in the Senate and House in 2010 and 2014. And the damage done even further down the ballot was more grave; Democrats lost more than 900 state legislative seats in those two elections.     The result of Obama's lonely victories -- coupled with a VP pick in Biden, who was not an obvious successor given his age -- was defaulting to Clinton in 2016. And in the wake of her stunning loss Tuesday night, there's a remarkable paucity of obvious 2020 candidates waiting on the Democratic bench. That's a major problem for the party, which now finds itself out of the White House for the next four years.          1 of 57       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                         Skip Ad   x           Hillary Clinton's campaign comes to an end      View Photos   Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

His opening campaign salvos -- describing Mexican immigrants as criminals or rapists -- seemed almost tame by the time he clinched victory, after so many threats to cut off jobs going to Mexico, deport millions of unauthorized immigrants and build a wall on the border. His victory stunned, saddened and worried Mexicans, forcing the country's highest government officials Wednesday morning to call for calm and pledge to work with the United States. The wave of national anxiety sent financial markets here into turmoil as a new, uncertain era in relations with the United States began. ""We will have for the next four years, at least, a president of the United States who actively campaigned and centrally campaigned against Mexico's interests. Full stop. Period,"" said Jorge Castaneda, a former Mexican foreign minister. ""It's an unmitigated disaster for Mexico."" Mexicans are unnerved about the lasting economic damage that a Trump presidency might bring. Those concerns are focused most on his promises to rewrite the trade deal that has undergirded Mexico's economic progress over the past two decades. Mexico's top economic officials, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade and Central Bank governor Agustin Carstens, tried to calm fears here. In a morning news conference, Meade said the U.S. election increased uncertainty in world financial markets and heightened the volatility of Mexico's currency. But he added that Mexico was in a strong economic position.     Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto said on Nov. 9 that he spoke to President-Elect Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election win and the two agreed to meet before he takes office. (Reuters)   ""It's important to remember that the functioning of markets has remained orderly,"" Meade said. ""The result of the election doesn't imply an immediate impact in the norms that regulate the commerce of goods and services, financial flows or the capacity of people to travel between both countries.""   [Markets staggered by Trump's shock victory but stage partial recovery]   Mexico's Central Bank has regularly raised interest rates over the past year in an attempt to contain the peso's losses and tamp down inflation. The peso, which was trading around 18 to the dollar on Tuesday, dropped to more than 20 to the dollar after Trump's win appeared imminent.  President Enrique Pena Nieto tweeted his congratulations to the United States on its electoral process Wednesday and expressed to Trump ""the will to work together in favor of bilateral relations."" For many Mexicans, Trump was something of a joke when he became a presidential candidate last year. They built pinatas out of his image and fashioned his face into Halloween masks. Only after he won the Republican nomination did a sense of urgency set in among the business and political elite.         1 of 26       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                           Skip Ad   x           How the world is reacting to results of the U.S. election      View Photos   People around the globe watched as Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States.

Edgard Garrido/Reuters  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        Fears of a Trump victory and possible damage to the Mexican economy prompted Pena Nieto to invite the candidate to Mexico City in September to improve ties. That meeting caused a huge backlash as Mexicans protested their leader's welcoming treatment of the Republican candidate. As the results of the presidential election came in Tuesday night, Mexicans watched with growing horror as Trump captured state after state. Mexico's foreign minister, Claudia Ruiz Massieu, rushed to the presidential palace, Los Pinos, to discuss the results with Pena Nieto. The headline of an editorial Wednesday in one of Mexico's leading newspapers, El Universal, simply read: ""A dark future."" ""The American people chose yesterday the path of racism, hate and intolerance,"" it began. The most urgent questions here centered on the potential gap between Trump's words and his actions as president. Andres Rozental, a former Mexican ambassador to Britain, said that promises Trump made to energize working-class and rural white voters who feel they have suffered from international trade might soften once he takes office.  ""It's clear that much of what happened yesterday, and much of what brought Mr. Trump to the White House, relates to deep-seated anger and deep-seated fear of the outside -- the outside includes, very immediately, Mexico,"" Rozental said. ""I think the most important thing right now in Mexico, for the government and all of us, is to find the ways we can deal with this reality."" ""We are neighbors; we need to have a relationship; we need to make it as constructive as we can,"" he added. Others found no reason to be optimistic. ""The new mistake that people here are going to be making, along with many of their American friends in Washington, is a not-to-worry attitude,"" said Castaneda, the former foreign minister. He added that Trump ""will deliver on some of his promises some of the time, like all politicians.""   [After Trump's victory, the world is left to wonder: What happened to America?]   Beyond the short-term market volatility, some Mexican economists predict a recession if Trump pursues the plans he has outlined. Trump has regularly disparaged the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect in 1994 and has helped Mexican exports grow while attracting far more foreign investment into the country. More than $1 billion worth of exports and imports cross the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border every day. ""I think there will be some tinkering with the U.S. approach to international trade, but I don't see wholesale reversal of U.S. trade policies. There's too much at stake here, and any change on that scale would take years and years,"" said Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. ""I think we're looking at the beginnings of a conversation about where we want to be as a country in our international trade relationships. So we're moving away from a model of free trade and back to a paradigm of managed trade."" Mexicans are also worried about Trump's threats to deport millions of illegal immigrants from the United States.  ""This is a very difficult situation; we have to prepare ourselves,"" said Jeffrey Weldon, a political scientist at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.   Raul Benitez Manaut, a professor at Mexico's National Autonomous University, noted that the Trump victory followed the British vote to leave the European Union and the Colombian vote to scrap a peace plan with left-wing guerrillas. ""The traditional parties don't respond to the needs of the people,"" he said.  The election also reshuffled the deck on Mexico's domestic politics. The country's parties are just getting into campaign mode with a presidential election two years out. Many observers speculated that a nationalist backlash could be expressed in that vote.  ""Politically, this will energize politicians tapping into a traditional strain of anti-Washington feelings in Mexico, as leaders are compelled to stand for the dignity of Mexicans in both countries,"" said Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas and the Americas Society, who was an adviser to the Clinton administration in the late 1990s.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/11/08/the-2016-election-discoveries-we-shouldnt-forget/	The 2016 election discoveries we shouldn’t forget	"   Hillary Clinton speaks during a church service at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn in April. (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)  Not unlike a graduation day or other rite of passage, Election Day comes as a relief to many. You've survived a dreadful campaign, endured cringe-worthy debates, listened to disingenuous spinners, marveled at Republicans' political stupidity and longed for the end (you hope) of this alarming episode in American politics. No one would begrudge the desire to forget it all, move beyond it and get on with life. That would be a shame, because there's plenty worth preserving and nurturing in the months and years ahead: Media maturity: Many conservatives have realized how the right-wing media bubble dangerously distorts reality, perpetrates urban myths and dumbs down the political debate. They've found solid reporting, helpful analysis and fine interviewers outside fake right-wing news (e.g. Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Breitbart, talk radio) -- which they now realize is a shoddy substitute for real news. Conservatives should continue to diversify their news consumption, appreciate the resources of legacy media and try to escape confirmation bias. Democrats see that all Republicans are not alike: More than a few Democrats have acknowledged that there are principled Republicans who do put country above party. Democratic pundits, authors and pols find themselves following #NeverTrump commentary and nodding in agreement with #NeverTrumpers' critiques. Democrats are forging new professional relationships based on a more nuanced appraisal of Republicans. No less a figure than Bill Maher has confessed that liberals were wrong to demonize decent Republicans (e.g. Mitt Romney) with whom they had policy differences. In seeing that not all Republicans sound like Rush Limbaugh or think like Trump, Democrats might find future allies or sympathetic ears on some topics. Common understandings and shared values (e.g., opposition to international thugs, defense of a free press, admiration for our military, repudiation of bigotry) too often get lost in the daily partisan tug-of-war. These foundational beliefs far outweigh specific policy tiffs. As policy differences reemerge -- and they will -- perhaps the arguments will be more civil and agreement easier to come by. Foreign-policy consensus: Center-left and center-right foreign-policy gurus have found more points of consensus on more issues (e.g., international leadership, trade, burnishing of alliances, opposing Iranian aggression) than many dreamed possible. Foreign policy just might recapture the bipartisan footing absent since the immediate aftermath of 9/11. A Hillary Clinton administration would be wise to attempt to sustain this phenomenon with some creative personnel choices, more extensive consultation with Congress and greater openness to input from some of those foreign-policy experts who crossed party lines to support Clinton. Realism about the right: Anti-Trump Republicans' eyes have been opened. Some of those liberal critiques about the right that they resisted actually turn out to be accurate. Bret Stephens identifies a few ""big reveals"" for #NeverTrumpers: That conservatives who once took umbrage at being called racist or anti-Semitic are now happy to flirt with white nationalism. That a party of self-described strict constructionists sees nothing amiss in Mr. [Donald] Trump's call to rewrite the 14th Amendment. That the ability of Mr. Trump and his supporters to hurl insults at their critics is only exceeded by their exquisite sensitivity when they are insulted back. That a reset with Russia is a fiasco when executed by Hillary Clinton but evidence of fresh foreign-policy thinking when proposed by Mr. Trump. #NeverTrump Republicans have been shocked, saddened and repulsed by moral spinelessness and intellectual hackery on their own side. They now more fully appreciate the need for wholesale change on the right, perhaps even a new party. Eradicating knee-jerk obstructionism, nativism, misogyny and hysteria is mandatory before the center-right can recover as a viable political force. Some familiar figures have vividly revealed their rank hypocrisy and moral failings; they should no longer command respect or deference. Republicans who have gone through a political-life-changing interlude won't look at their ""own side"" quite the same. Many will decide that they currently don't have a side that they can embrace enthusiastically. Clinton was right to emphasize that we are going to sink or swim together as a country. One party is not going to dominate all branches of government. Given all that, some heightened self-awareness and eye-opening discoveries won't be forgotten, we hope, after the votes are all counted today.  "
