Forensics video analyst Grant Fredericks testified Thursday that he enhanced the cellphone video taken by a passerby that recorded Slager's shooting of Scott in April 2015 during a traffic stop. Fredericks said the enhancement was intended to clarify and stabilize the images. Although the video is shaky and blurry in spots, Fredericks said it shows Scott on his side with his arm around Slager's upper body. Fredericks also said Slager's left hand can be seen holding Scott's wrist, and Taser wires tangled around Slager before the shooting. Slager is on trial for murder in the death of 50-year-old Scott. ___ 10:15 p.m. A defense witness says that enhanced video in the Michael Slager murder trial has testified that a prosecution animation of Slager shooting Walter Scott is inaccurate. Slager is the former South Carolina patrolman charged with murder in the shooting death of an unarmed black motorist after an April 2015 traffic stop. The shooting of 50-year-old Scott was captured on cellphone video that stunned the nation. Forensics video analyst Grant Fredericks testified Thursday that frames in the prosecution animation shown Wednesday were stretched, making it appear Scott was farther away from Slager than he was at the time of the shooting. He also testified that dashcam video taken from Slager's cruise in the animation did not include all the video frames available from the camera. ___ 3:40 a.m. The defense has opened its case in the murder trial of Michael Slager, the white former South Carolina patrolman charged in the shooting death of an unarmed black motorist. Slager is charged in the April 2015 shooting of 50-year-old Walter Scott as he ran from a traffic stop. Cellphone video recorded by a bystander shows Scott being shot five times in the back. The defense contends the two men struggled and Scott got hold of the officer's Taser before the shooting. The prosecution rested late Wednesday after calling 32 witnesses over nine days. The first defense witness was an audio expert who played enhanced audio from Slager's uniform microphone in which the officer warns Scott he is firing his stun gun.

Political people in the United States are watching the chaos in Washington in the moment. But some people in the science community are watching the chaos somewhere else -- the Arctic. It's polar night there now -- the sun isn't rising in much of the Arctic. That's when the Arctic is supposed to get super-cold, when the sea ice that covers the vast Arctic Ocean is supposed to grow and thicken. But in fall of 2016 -- which has been a zany year for the region, with multiple records set for low levels of monthly sea ice -- something is totally off. The Arctic is super-hot, even as a vast area of cold polar air has been displaced over Siberia.    Image obtained using a climate reanalyzer. (Climate Change Institute/University of Maine)  At the same time, one of the key indicators of the state of the Arctic -- the extent of sea ice covering the polar ocean -- is at a record low. The ice is freezing up again, as it always does this time of year after reaching its September low, but it isn't doing so as rapidly as usual. In fact, the ice's area is even lower than it was during the record-low 2012:    (National Snow and Ice Data Center)  Twitter's expert Arctic watchers also are stunned. Zack Labe, a PhD student at the University of California at Irvine who studies the Arctic, tweeted out an image on Wednesday from the Danish Meteorological Institute showing Arctic temperatures about 20 degrees Celsius higher than normal above 80 degrees North Latitude. ""Today's latest #Arctic mean temperature continues to move the wrong direction . . . up. Quite an anomalous spike!,"" Labe wrote. Here's the figure:    Daily mean temperatures for the Arctic area north of the 80th northern parallel. (Danish Meteorological Institute)  As you can see, temperatures north of 80 latitude were around -5 degrees Celsius -- still below freezing, but not by that much -- instead of the normal of around -25 degrees C.   ""Despite onset of #PolarNight, temperatures near #NorthPole increasing. Extraordinary situation right now in #Arctic, w/record low #seaice,"" added Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. This is the second year in a row that temperatures near the North Pole have risen to freakishly warm levels. During 2015's final days, the temperature near the Pole spiked to the melting point thanks to a massive storm that pumped warm air into the region. So what's going on here? ""It's about 20C [36 degrees Fahrenheit] warmer than normal over most of the Arctic Ocean, along with cold anomalies of about the same magnitude over north-central Asia,"" Jennifer Francis, an Arctic specialist at Rutgers University, said by email Wednesday. ""The Arctic warmth is the result of a combination of record-low sea-ice extent for this time of year, probably very thin ice, and plenty of warm/moist air from lower latitudes being driven northward by a very wavy jet stream."" Francis has published research suggesting that the jet stream, which travels from west to east across the Northern Hemisphere in the mid-latitudes, is becoming more wavy and elongated as the Arctic warms faster than the equator does. ""It will be fascinating to see if the stratospheric polar vortex continues to be as weak as it is now, which favors a negative Arctic Oscillation and probably a cold mid/late winter to continue over central and eastern Asia and eastern North America. The extreme behavior of the Arctic in 2016 seems to be in no hurry to quit,"" Francis continued. Francis cited the work of Judah Cohen, a forecaster with Atmospheric and Environmental Research, who has linked odd jet stream behavior with cold air over Siberia. Indeed, another Arctic expert, James Overland with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that the jet stream at the moment is well configured to transport warmth northward into the Arctic. ""There is strong warm advection into the Arctic, especially northern-central Canada, in through the Atlantic,  and east Siberian/Chukchi Sea,"" Overland said. The whole situation is pretty extreme, several experts agreed. ""Both the persistence and magnitude of these temperature anomalies are quite unusual,"" Labe added by email. ""Large variability in temperatures is common in the Arctic (especially during the cold season), but the duration of this warm Arctic -- cold Siberia pattern is unusual and quite an impressive crysophere/sea ice feedback."" (The ""cryosphere"" refers to that part of the Earth's system that is made up of ice.) Abnormally warm air has flooded the Arctic since October. Richard James, a meteorologist who pens a blog on Alaska weather, analyzed 19 weather stations surrounding the Arctic Ocean and found that the average temperature was about 4 degrees (2 Celsius) above the record set in 1998. Since November, temperatures have risen even higher. ""It is amazing to see that the warmth has become even more pronounced since the end of October,"" James wrote on his blog. Mark Serreze, who heads the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., agrees that something odd is going on. Not only are air temperatures unusually warm, but water temperatures are as well.  ""There are some areas in the Arctic Ocean that are as much as 25 degrees Fahrenheit above average now,"" Serreze said. ""It's pretty crazy."" What's happening, he explains, is sort of a ""double whammy."" On the one hand, there is a ""very warm underlying ocean"" due to the lack of sea ice forming above it. But, at the same time, kinks in the jet stream have allowed warm air to flow northward and frigid Arctic air to descend over Siberia. ""The sea ice is at a record low right now, for this time of year, that's one thing,"" Serreze said. ""And why it's so low -- again, there's so much heat in the upper ocean in these ice-free areas, the ice just can't form right now. The ocean's just got to get rid of this heat somehow, and it's having a hard time doing so.""    (NOAA)  The situation this winter could set the Arctic's ice up for very thin conditions and a possible record low next year, Serreze said, although it's too soon to say. The weather in the Arctic can change swiftly. Temperatures could cool and the ice could rebound. But the record-low sea ice extent and unprecedented warmth in the region fit in well with recent trends and portend even more profound changes in the coming years.

Brendan Dassey was convicted in 2007 of raping and killing Teresa Halbach and sentenced to life in prison. A federal judge in August overturned his conviction, saying investigators coerced him into confessing. State attorneys have appealed that ruling. The judge this week ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday. But a three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the release Thursday, saying Dassey must remain behind bars pending the resolution of his appeal. Dassey's attorneys posted a statement online saying they were ""disappointed more than words can say"" with the appellate decision. ___ 12 p.m. A federal appeals court has ruled that a Wisconsin inmate featured in the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer"" must remain behind bars even though his conviction has been overturned. Brendan Dassey was convicted in 2007 of raping and killing Teresa Halbach and sentenced to life in prison. A federal judge in August overturned his conviction, saying investigators coerced him into confessing. State attorneys have appealed that ruling. The judge on Wednesday ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday. The state Justice Department asked the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in an emergency motion to block the release.

A federal judge in August overturned Brendan Dassey's conviction in the 2005 death of photographer Teresa Halbach. The state Justice Department has appealed that ruling. Still, the judge on Wednesday ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday. The Justice Department filed an emergency motion with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday asking it to block the release, arguing Dassey's confession was voluntary and that the 27-year-old inmate poses a danger to society. Dassey's attorneys filed a reply brief late Wednesday arguing that Dassey has behaved well in prison and that the state hasn't identified any harm that might come from his release.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed alarm at ""the weakening taboo"" against using chemical weapons in Syria where the international watchdog said it is studying several recent cases of alleged use of the banned agents, according to a letter circulated Monday. The U.N. chief said in a letter to the Security Council transmitting the monthly report from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that he is gravely concerned that the use of chemical weapons could become ""normalized in this or any conflict, present or future.""  ""It is imperative that those responsible for the use of chemical weapons should be held accountable,"" Ban told the council in the letter. The OPCW said in its report covering the period from Sept. 23 to Oct. 22 that its fact-finding mission is studying four widely reported allegations of chemical weapons use, and is investigating the alleged use of a chemical agent in Aleppo on Aug. 2 at the request of the Syrian government. OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said the organization's fact-finding mission continues studying all available information of alleged chemical weapons use ""with a particular focus on widely reported incidents"" in the Saraqib in Idlib governorate, and three incidents in the Aleppo governorate -- in Aleppo city, Zubdiya, and Al Sukkari. He did not provide details but said ""the intensity of the ongoing conflict in Aleppo is a major challenge"" to the mission's work. Uzumcu said an OPCW team was sent to Damascus from Oct. 12-19 in response to the Syrian government's request to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons on Aug. 2 in the area of Al-Awamid in Aleppo. He said it will continue to work with Syrian authorities to gather more information. The OPCW has a mandate to carry out fact-finding missions to determine whether chemical attacks occurred in Syria, but not to determine responsibility. In September 2014, the Security Council established an international body to assign blame for chemical attacks. That body, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, or JIM, has already determined that the Syrian government was behind three attacks involving chlorine gas and the Islamic State extremist group was responsible for one involving mustard gas. Syria's government has been repeatedly accused by the United States and other Western countries of using chemical weapons on its own people, even after the Security Council in 2013 ordered the elimination of its chemical weapons program following an attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds of civilians. The council last year also condemned the use of toxic chemicals like chlorine after growing reports of barrel bombs filled with chlorine gas being dropped on opposition-held areas. Chlorine is widely available and not officially considered a warfare agent, but its use as a weapon is illegal. Uzumcu said poor security has prevented the destruction of Syria's remaining declared chemical weapons production facilities. He said questions also remain over its initial declaration of its chemical holdings. Ban retierated the need for the Syrian government and the OPCW ""to work together to resolve all identified gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies"" in the declaration.

Kelly Ayotte and her Democratic challenger, Gov. Maggie Hassan, made their final appeal for votes. A Kelly even sat across from a Maggie in a booth at the Four Aces Diner in Lebanon -- Kelly Allison and her 4-year-old daughter, Maggie Allison. When Ayotte stopped by and introduced herself, the girl peppered her with questions and gave her a special rock for good luck.  ""Someday, can you come to play at our house?"" she asked. Ayotte, a former attorney general seeking a second U.S. Senate term, and Hassan, who has served two terms as governor, are in a tight race that will help determine control of the Senate, where Republicans hold a slight edge. A WMUR-TV Granite State Poll released Sunday showed Hassan slightly ahead, 48 percent to 43 percent, with 8 percent of likely voters undecided. Hassan stopped by Brewbakers coffee shop in Keene, where she picked up a cappuccino with the message ""VOTE"" spelled out in the foam.  ""A number of people have asked me a question or two and then said, 'OK, I'll vote for you now,'"" Hassan said. ""Sometimes it's a piece of information they're missing. Sometimes the decision seems to be more about the top of the ticket and less about our race."" Ayotte has argued Hassan would be a rubber stamp for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should she win the White House, and Hassan has frequently criticized Ayotte's evolving relationship with Republican nominee Donald Trump. For months, Ayotte supported but didn't endorse Trump, even calling him a role model for children, a statement she later took back. After the release of a 2005 recording in which Trump bragged about forcing himself on women, kissing them and groping them, Ayotte dropped her support altogether. Sandy Swinburne, of Marlborough, told Hassan her top issue is campaign finance reform ""because all other issues depend on that."" Swinburne, an independent, said she disagrees with Ayotte's support for the death penalty. While she's not particularly happy with Democrats, she said, she'll be voting for Hassan. The Lebanon diner was Ayotte's sixth stop of the day, putting her a quarter of the way through the 24 locations she planned to visit in the 24 hours before casting her vote in Nashua on Tuesday morning. She said she has come across numerous undecided voters in the last several days.  ""I think one-on-one conversations are important, and also there's so much on TV that it's really helpful to be able to talk to someone about issues and answer any questions they have,"" she said. ""That's really what this process is all about."" Brian Allison, whose daughter grilled Ayotte at the diner, said his family recently moved to Grantham from Colorado but he's been impressed with Ayotte and will vote for her on Tuesday.  ""She's pro-life, she's pro-Second Amendment,"" said Allison, a Republican. ""Those are two good reasons right there."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

That's especially true when it comes to governors' mansions: The GOP holds 31 out of 50 seats. And if they pick up just one more Tuesday, Republicans will tie a modern-day record for the most seats controlled by their party, set in 1998. Democrats aren't going to let that happen without a fight. Despite a challenging election cycle in which they are defending five open seats, Democrats are in a position to hold on to most of those and even knock off a Republican governor. Still, even the worst-case scenario for Republicans on Tuesday has them with a solid, 29-seat majority. With 12 seats up for this cycle -- only six of those competitive -- there's not a lot of opportunity for Democrats to change the GOP-heavy map, said Louis Jacobson, who handicaps gubernatorial and other state races for Governing magazine. ""At the end of the day, it's not going to be a dramatic difference,"" Jacobson said. ""The GOP is going to be far ahead in terms of governors' seats."" But there will likely be some shuffling of which party controls which state. Here's a rundown of the top six governors' races, in order of least to most likely to flip parties.    Justice speaks during a gubernatorial debate in Charleston, W.V.a, on Oct. 4. (Tyler Evert/AP)   West Virginia: The race to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin is all about the Crocs-wearing, coal-loving, Hillary Clinton-critical, Democratic billionaire Jim Justice. Justice would be a Republican in any other state, and he's a favorite to win this open seat. He's up by double digits in every quality poll in the past month. Republican Bill Cole, president of the state Senate, hasn't been able to nudge his way into the conversation with such a colorful character. But with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump up from 20 to 25 points in this state, it's still an open question how many Republicans will vote for Trump and cross the ballot for Justice. If Republicans can turn this mansion red, they could hold on to it , they could hold on to it for a long time.    Van Ostern, left, and Sununu debate at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, N.H., on Tuesday. (Thomas Roy/AP)   New Hampshire: Even though Republican Chris Sununu, an executive councilor and the son of a former popular governor, has the name recognition, Republicans acknowledge that he hasn't run a pitch-perfect campaign in this open race to replace Gov. Maggie Hassan (D), who is running for Senate. For one, if you're a Republican trying to win the governor's seat in a state that has had mostly Democratic governors since 1997, suggesting the election is rigged might not be the best campaignstrategy. Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern (D) isn't nearly as well known, but he has a solid progressive grass-roots network and will probably benefit from Clinton's turnout machine. Polls are all over the place, suggesting the result could be unpredictable.    Gregg and Holcomb participate in a debate for Indiana governor at the University of Southern Indiana in Evansville on Oct. 25. (Alex Slitz/AP)   Indiana: The decision by Gov. Mike Pence (R) to leave his seat to run as Trump's vice president was both a blessing and a curse to Indiana Republicans. Republicans concede that they probably would be down if Pence were in the race, but they also had just 100 days or so to introduce voters to his less-tarred replacement, Lt. Gov. Eric Holcomb. Most polls show former state House speaker John Gregg (D) leading, but this is a state Trump is expected to win by as much as 10 points. Republicans are hopeful that undecided voters will vote Republican further down the ballot, too, despite not really knowing who Holcomb is.     Koster speaks during a debate in the race for Missouri governor in Branson on Sept. 30. (Jeff Roberson/AP)     Greitens speaks during a debate in the race for Missouri governor in Branson on Sept. 30. (Jeff Roberson/AP)     Missouri: Both sides say this race to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon is basically tied. Since Missouri is a red-leaning state, a tie would generally favor Republicans and, thus, hand the race to former Navy SEAL Eric Greitens. (This is another state Trump is expected to win, by six to 10 points.) That means Missouri is one of Republicans' best pickup opportunities. But Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster is doing what he needs to in his bid to keep this out of reach for Republicans. The former Republican got an endorsement from the National Rifle Association, and he has consistently led in polls as the percentage of undecided voters dropped from 8 percent in October to 5 percent in November.  Vermont: The surprise of the cycle may be Vermont, which is Republicans' best pickup opportunity. After the September primary, the state rocketed to the top of our most-likely-to-flip list. Vermont likes to switch up which party holds the governor's mansion, and, unfortunately for state Transportation Secretary Sue Minter (D), she's running in the shadow of Gov. Peter Shumlin (D), who is retiring after three terms amid a struggling economy and anemic approval ratings. Lt. Gov. Phil Scott (R) was up seven points in a WCAZ-Burlington poll out Monday.    Cooper, left, and RPat McCrory debate at WRAL studios in Raleigh, N.C. on Oct. 18. (Chris Seward/AP)   North Carolina:  One of the hardest things to do in politics is unseat a sitting governor. But Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper looks poised to do it. Cooper is leading or tying Gov. Pat McCrory (R) in almost every public poll. He got help from the governor himself: Polls show that the transgender ""bathroom bill"" McCrory signed into law in the spring is still hurting him. And Cooper will get a boost from the presidential race and Clinton's aggressive turnout machine in the state.  Democrats may pick up one or two seats Tuesday, but so could Republicans. That means Republicans will continue their dominance of governors' mansions -- at least until 2018, when 36 seats are up and the GOP is playing defense.  "

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)  One of the longest-running streaks on Capitol Hill seems poised to keep going strong when all the ballots are counted after Tuesday's elections. Not since 1952, when Dwight D. ""Ike"" Eisenhower swept into the presidency and brought with him a Republican-controlled House, has the majority changed hands when Americans also elect a president. Instead, ever since, the House majority has only changed parties during midterm elections, beginning two years after Eisenhower's victory, with the Democrats' wave in 1954 that gave them a majority until the historic 1994 Republican wave during Bill Clinton's first midterm election. The other party-changing moments, 2006 and 2010, also came in midterms. And despite the most volatile presidential election in decades, the outcome in the House increasingly looks as if it will leave House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) with a slightly more narrow majority to navigate. The two most trusted, independent analysts -- the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report -- have estimated that more than enough Republican-held seats are in play to give Democrats a chance at the majority. Cook's analysis, overseen by David Wasserman, rates 40 Republican seats as competitive. Nathan Gonzales, running the Rothenberg analysis, puts about 35 Republican seats in play. [House wave still looking like a ripple for Democrats] Democrats need a 30-seat gain for the majority, and if this were truly a wave election year, it wouldn't be a stretch for them to win nearly every competitive race along with a few unexpected seats and claim the majority -- that's what happens in political waves. But Wasserman and Gonzales conclude that the political undertow of Donald Trump's candidacy is mostly unique to his own brand. ""The presidential race may be inducing whiplash, but the House battleground remains relatively stable in the final week,"" Wasserman wrote. He gives Democrats a top level of netting 20 additional seats -- but also an equal chance of just single-digit gains. Gonzalez's last report gave Democrats a chance at gaining 15 seats, but also suggested single-digit gains were just as likely. (Gonzalez's former partner, Stuart Rothenberg, founded that report and now writes for The Washington Post.) If these predictions hold up, House Republicans will end up in roughly the same shape as four years ago, when their 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, presented a much more appealing figure in key swing districts than Trump does today. Back then, the GOP ended up with 234 seats. There are plenty of factors behind the Republican resiliency in these House races, but the biggest factor might just be an odd quirk among swing voters: They only tend to break sharply against one party's congressional incumbents if the lawmakers are directly tied to an unpopular president. That's why midterm elections, over the last 25 years, have produced the biggest swings from one party to the other, like the 30 seats Democrats gained in the ""six-year itch"" midterm of George W. Bush's presidency. [The House is not actually up for grabs, for the moment] President Obama's first election in 2008 produced a large Democratic gain, of 21 seats, but his party already held majority and was just running up the score. The more normal result is the eight-seat gain Democrats made in 2012, which still left them 17 seats shy of the majority. In both 1996 and 2000 the minority leader, Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), thought he had a chance at claiming the speaker's gavel, but in each instance Democrats picked up fewer than five seats. Most agonizing of all was 2000, when Gephardt needed to win just six more Democratic seats to win. His party gained just two more districts, leaving the Republicans with a 221-seat majority, the smallest majority since the mid-1950s. The most likely scenario for the House majority to switch hands during a presidential cycle seems to be when the party holding the White House also runs Capitol Hill, and that party loses the top-of-the-ticket race and craters down-ballot races. That's what happened in 1952 when Eisenhower's Republicans took charge after 20 years of Roosevelt-Truman run in the Oval Office. The Senate majority is only slightly less stable than the House, having changed hands once, in 1980, during a presidential year since the Eisenhower days. Trump would seem to be the perfect presidential nominee for House Democrats. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) often calls him the ""gift that keeps on giving"" because of his intemperate remarks toward women and minorities as well as policy proposals that traditional Republicans consider dangerous. Yet there seem to be limits to the gifts that Trump can give. Strategists in both parties privately say Democrats lack that dynamic today and that Trump's sometimes outlandish statements make him so unique that it makes it more difficult to connect his views to others. Many Republican seats are also safe due to recent redistricting decisions regardless of who is at the top of the ticket. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made a concerted push to field as many candidates as possible in suburban districts with high education levels, because those voters have been the most offended by Trump's candidacy. Strategists believe that the declining amount of ticket-splitting would give Democrats a chance to win in places that seemed previously out of reach. It has worked in limited fashion. The DCCC has put longtime GOP incumbents, such as Reps. Darrell Issa (Calif.) and John Mica (R), on the defensive like never before, in suburban districts that have turned away from Trump. Meanwhile, younger Republicans in districts breaking heavily against Trump are still in the fight, such as Rep. Bob Dold (R), who represents the suburbs north of Chicago. Clinton is poised to win the district by more than 20 percentage points, according to both party estimates, maybe even 30 percentage points, but the DCCC has not put this race away and is spending feverishly down the stretch to win it. The problem seems to be many of those well educated suburban voters don't believe their representatives, such as Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) and Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), are the same as Trump. Democrats have run relentless ads linking those two Republicans to Trump, and some Democrats believe that Trump has been a gateway to get voters to pay attention to positions taken by these Republicans that are more conservative than these swing districts would normally support. Republicans privately concede those Trump attacks have done some damage to their candidates, but it's mostly just energized liberal voters there. The independent-minded voter working in the Dulles Corridor IT sector, or in the eastern suburbs of Denver, has yet to be convinced that voting for Comstock and Coffman is a vote for Trump. This could be bad news for House Democrats. A Hillary Clinton presidency might mean a bad 2018 midterm for them, digging the party deeper into the minority. And, as history shows, the presidential year of 2020 isn't likely to produce a new House majority either, making it possible that their next real shot at the majority could be six years away -- if Republicans hold the Oval Office by then."

College spokeswoman says no security cameras in area where razor-laced Trump sign was placed @FOX4 5 pic.twitter.com/jrS5RSqBmM -- Alex Boyer (@AlexBoyerFox4) November 2, 2016   Let's just come out and say it: 2016 has been a slow-burning dumpster fire, and the presidential election is largely responsible. But in the weeks leading up to Nov. 8, the doomsday aura surrounding American politics seems to have most overwhelmed one state in particular -- Texas. Some counties there are using paper ballots; voters have blamed electronic glitches on nefarious, and unfounded, ballot-swapping schemes; and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made unsubstantiated conspiracy theories of voter fraud in Texas a talking point during some of his recent stump speeches.   [He wore a Trump hat and 'deplorables' shirt to vote. Texas police arrested him.]   Now, there's this: Somebody in the Dallas metropolitan area glued razor blades to the bottom of a Trump campaign sign this week and plunged it into the ground outside an early-voting polling place. It was left in front of the official polling site sign, according to a statement obtained by ABC affiliate WFAA-TV, blocking ""vote here"" directions, so a do-gooder decided to relocate it at about 6:15 a.m. Tuesday. But in the early morning darkness, he didn't see the sharp, shiny line protruding from the sign's edge. He lifted -- and the blades sliced.

I have not seen that before,"" Collin County Elections Administrator Bruce Sherbet told WFAA. ""I'm not even sure what the motivation to do something like that would be,"" he said. The incident was reported to the Texas Ranger Division, which is investigating, Collin College spokeswoman Lisa Vasquez said in the statement. The sign was found on the college's Spring Creek Campus in Plano, a Dallas suburb. ""All campaign signs on the college's campuses are being inspected, and any sharps found on signage will be removed,"" Vasquez said. ""The college will be working with local election officials and both political parties to ensure safety."" Officials told Fox 4 News that there are no cameras in the area, and so far, no arrests have been made.   [Half of likely U.S. voters say they are concerned about violence on Election Day]   The man declined to seek medical attention for the minor cuts on his hands, according to the Collin College statement, and chose to treat the wounds himself. The man was there that morning, the statement said, to drop off a friend who was volunteering as a poll worker. ""It wasn't a prank as far as it looked to me. It looks like something intentional to hurt somebody,"" Sherbet told Fox 4. ""These things on the surface look one way, but you can't jump to conclusions, which is why they need to be investigated thoroughly."" Incidents of violence and vandalism have plagued this election cycle and seem to have escalated in recent weeks. In mid-October, a Republican Party headquarters in North Carolina, a state bitterly divided this year, was firebombed and spray-painted with a swastika and the words ""Nazi Republicans leave town or else.""

It is being investigated as a hate crime. A large pile of animal manure was dumped in front of a Democratic Party headquarters in Ohio. Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) joked at a get-out-the-vote meeting that gun rights supporters may want to put a ""bull's eye"" on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He later apologized.

""I will keep you in suspense,"" he said at the third presidential debate when asked whether he would consider the vote legitimate. The GOP nominee later said he would, of course, accept the results if he won, and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, clarified that the ticket would be cooperative. ""It's terrible we've become so polarized in our politics,"" Steve Spainhouer, the Democratic chair in Collin County Precinct 122, told CBS 11 News about the razor blade incident. ""I think it's deplorable. It just shows how far we've come in politics where people want to be so mean, so hateful to try and injure somebody who's probably got no political party persuasion one way or another and is just working at a poll."" He told the TV station it is the most heinous campaign-related incident he has seen in 16 years. Local Republican leaders agreed -- this act was intentional and disturbing. ""They were placed in front of a vote sign so someone would have to move it,"" Collin County Republican Party Executive Director Neal Katz told Fox 4. ""It's obvious intent was for someone to get cut.""

(Carlo Allegri/Reuters)    What leads citizens to vote for authoritarian candidates? In recent weeks, experts have argued that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign style and rhetoric -- unusual by U.S. standards -- look worrisomely familiar in an international context. A new ""Comparative Strongmen"" genre has blossomed, as observers debate whom Trump most resembles: Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, his successor Nicolas Maduro, Italy's Benito Mussolini or Silvio Berlusconi, or Argentina's Juan Peron.   [Donald Trump may be showing us the future of U.S. right-wing politics]   What do individuals who vote for strongmen have in common? Do Trump's supporters in the United States share core psychological traits with supporters of populist and authoritarian leaders in other countries? We look into that in our new article, forthcoming in Research & Politics. Two measures proved important: authoritarianism and levels of education. But exactly how they matter surprised us. Latin American elections hold clues to understanding who supports authoritarian leaders. It's hard to answer this question examining only U.S. elections, because few U.S. candidates have announced overtly authoritarian views. Instead, we looked to Latin America, where many presidents have shown disregard for democratic limits on executive power. Those have included Chavez and Ecuador's Rafael Correa, who curtailed freedom of the press, and El Salvador's Antonio Saca, whose ""Super Mano Dura"" (super hard-line) policy called for incarcerating citizens with suspicious tattoos.   [It's not just Trump. Authoritarian populism is rising across the West. Here's why.]   Latin America is also interesting to study because, in contrast to the United States, authoritarian candidates have appeared on both the political left and right. (You can find more information on how we identified authoritarian candidates here.) Do ""authoritarian"" personalities support authoritarian leaders? Only sometimes.  We investigated to see whether the psychological disposition called ""authoritarianism"" predicted voting for authoritarian leaders. When political psychologists talk about authoritarianism, they are referring to a basic disposition in which citizens value submission to group norms and authority figures, and are aggressive toward nonconformists. The psychological conception of ""authoritarianism"" doesn't necessarily imply a value judgment.   [Racial prejudice, not populism or authoritarianism, predicts support for Trump over Clinton]   We often measure citizens' levels of authoritarianism using survey questions that ask what traits they think are most important for children in general: on the one hand, things like creativity and autonomy, or on the other hand, respect for adults and discipline. In the United States, how people score on these questions is strongly correlated with many political attitudes -- not only support for Trump and Trump's issue positions in the current election, but also with attitudes toward terrorism and with Republican Party identification more generally. In the 2012 AmericasBarometer surveys administered across North and South America, we used three questions on parenting attitudes to develop a score for citizens' authoritarian dispositions, running from zero (highly non-authoritarian) to 1 (highly authoritarian).      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has suggested jailing his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Here are some countries where the threat of prison is a political reality. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   So how do citizens' authoritarian dispositions affect their probability of voting for authoritarian leaders?  The answer depends on what kind of authoritarian leader you're talking about, as you can see in the figure below.    Authoritarian Psychological Dispositions and Support for Authoritarian LeadersData: AmericasBarometer 2012; Figure: Amy Erica Smith and Mollie Cohen  People with authoritarian psychological dispositions are more likely to support right-wing authoritarian candidates -- such as Guatemala's Otto Perez Molina or Peru's Keiko Fujimori. Individuals' probability of voting for a right-wing authoritarian candidate rises by about 10 percentage points as their level of authoritarianism moves from lowest to the highest. Interestingly, authoritarianism is also correlated with support for right-leaning candidates who are not authoritarian in some countries, including Uruguay and Costa Rica. But here's the surprise: Having an authoritarian psychological disposition is not correlated with support for leftist authoritarians -- for instance, Chavez, Latin America's most famous authoritarian leader in the 2000s.   [This map will change how you think about American voters -- especially white small-town heartland voters]   Research from Eastern Europe shows that citizens with authoritarian personalities eventually supported left-wing authoritarian regimes in the Soviet Bloc. That's because those regimes had come to represent the status quo. That's not so in most Latin American countries today. Citizens with authoritarian dispositions usually favor the right wing -- whether the candidates are authoritarians or not. Left-wing authoritarian candidates appeal to citizens who are both high and low in authoritarian dispositions. And wealth decreases the likelihood of voting for authoritarian leaders -- but only the left-wing kind. So what does predict support for authoritarian leaders on either side of the aisle? Levels of education.  As you can see in the figure below, levels of education make a big difference in support for both leftist and rightist authoritarian candidates. The more education you have, the less likely you are to vote for an authoritarian -- even if you have an authoritarian predisposition. That difference is widest for left-wing authoritarian candidates, as you can see. Citizens with no formal schooling are about 20 percentage points more likely to vote for a left-wing authoritarian candidate than those who've gone to college and beyond. The education gap in support for right-wing authoritarians is less pronounced -- the difference is closer to six percentage points -- but it's still statistically significant.    Education and Support for Authoritarian LeadersData: AmericasBarometer 2012; Figure: Amy Erica Smith and Mollie Cohen  Why does support for authoritarian leaders drop as education increases? We can only speculate. Maybe schools teach democratic norms, and spending more time in the classroom leads voters to internalize those norms. Maybe education is just correlated with some other advantage that leads people to support the ideals of liberal democracy. Apparently the ""schools of democracy"" are, in fact, schools. Amy Erica Smith is assistant professor of political science at Iowa State University, and currently a visiting fellow at the Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame.  Mollie Cohen is a research fellow at the Latin American Public Opinion Project at Vanderbilt University.       [This new book helps you understand the rise of Donald Trump]  "
