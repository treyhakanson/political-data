Thank You 4 Your Service"" (Epic) On Veteran's Day, A Tribe Called Quest released their first album in 18 years with all four founding members -- Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi -- taking part. Phife, who called himself the ""Funky Diabetic,"" passed away in March from the disease. Rallying around his death, ""We Got It from Here. Thank You 4 Your Service"" caps off one of hip-hop's most storied runs. The Phifer's jovial wordplay and the track dedications to his life are the heart of the record. On some ""champion pen game,"" one minute he's scorching MCs in dancehall mode, the next he's griping about ""surge pricing on these Ubers."" But the Trini gladiator stayed grounded to the end: ""I take zero for granted, I honor my gift."" Spiritual leader Q-Tip is still the Abstract Poetic. And those abstractions run deep. On ""Black Spasmodic"" he's playing bass and dusting the Dead Sea with ""cremated molecules."" Along the way, he harmonizes with Elton John, perks up about a photoshopped ""face on a box of McCormick gravy"" and harnesses the power of a dusty Nairobi Sisters sample. Once content to play the wall, Jarobi even steps to the mic, emitting a confident Native Tongue flair. Longtime cohorts Consequence (who's ""got the game on IV"") and a Rastafarian Busta Rhymes also shine. Other stars show out in force. The Andre 3000 spot is a high point: ""I ain't no almanac/so lick my dictionary."" Kendrick Lamar is hot on his coattails rhyming ""Deuteronomy"" with ""fumigate our economy."" Talib Kweli echoes Gil Scott Heron's ""Winter in America"" and Kanye West is feeling that hook on ""The Killing Season."" Musically, their theories continue to favor the low end as they burrow paths of rhythm. And they still got the jazz, embedding vibrant chord structures in the forward push. The buoyant organ loop on ""The Space Program"" and jubilant hopscotch skitter of ""Dis Generation"" will please the ATCQ purists. New aspects include more live instrumentation (Jack White plugs in), a lean toward rock (Sabbath sample, Stooges influence) and a healthy dose of dub tactics. It's a feel good record but politics and race loom large. As Phife and Q-Tip direct on the opener, ""It's time to go left and not right."" The ideal soundtrack to the Black Lives Matter movement, slide this one right next to Public Enemy's ""Fear of a Black Planet."" At one point, Jarobi dejects, ""Seems like my only crime is having melanin."" But ATCQ is not just holding it down for black people. As Tip iterates on ""We the People.,"" they've got the backs of Mexicans, Muslims, the LGBT community and the impoverished. No longer Midnight Marauders, ""We Got It from Here. "" is about a new day, unbridled expression, cutting through disillusion and healing. But most of all flexing their inimitable vibe y'all. Tribe still getting live y'all.

PAUL, Minn. -- The Latest on court appearance for Minnesota police officer charged in black motorist's fatal shooting (all times local): 3:50 p.m. An attorney for a Minnesota police officer who shot and killed a black motorist during a July traffic stop says his client intends to plead not guilty. St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez made his initial court appearance Friday. He did not enter a plea, which is standard, but will plead not guilty at a later date. The next hearing is set for Dec. 19. Yanez was charged this week with second-degree manslaughter in the death of 32-year-old Philando Castile. Prosecutors said the shooting wasn't justified. Defense attorney Tom Kelly says Yanez's defense team is disappointed in the charges, and that statements by prosecutors were unfairly prejudicial to his client. ___ 2 p.m. A Minnesota police officer has appeared in court on charges stemming from the shooting death of a black man during a traffic stop in a St. Paul suburb this summer. St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez was released on his own recognizance after the brief hearing Friday. Yanez did not enter a plea. He is expected to enter a plea at a later date. His next hearing is set for Dec. 19. Yanez was charged this week with second-degree manslaughter in the July death of 32-year-old Philando Castile. Members of Castile's family attended the hearing as did supporters of Yanez. Nakia Wilson of St. Paul is a cousin of Castile's. She says she went to court to see the face of the person who killed her cousin. ___ 6:45 a.m. A Minnesota police officer who shot a black man during a traffic stop in a St. Paul suburb is expected to appear in court on criminal charges. St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez was charged this week with second-degree manslaughter.

Ryan (R-Wis.) said Donald Trump's presidential win reflected that most Americans don't like the direction the country is going in. (Reuters)   A solid number of Hill Republicans spent most of this presidential campaign ducking, disagreeing, denouncing and ditching Donald Trump. Now many of those same Republicans are going to have to spend the next four years working with him. Yes, things could get awkward. How Trump's relationship with a Congress made up of about three dozen lawmakers who had turned their backs on him will pan out is anyone's guess. (In case you can't tell, we're done predicting things at this point.) It is safe to say that for most Republicans, a Trump presidency was preferable to a Clinton one.   [How Donald Trump broke the old rules of politics -- and won the White House]   ""I'm very excited about our ability to work together,"" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters Wednesday, adding later: ""Donald Trump pulled off an amazing political feat. He deserves tremendous credit for that. It helped us keep our majorities.""  Indeed, January 2017 will be the first time since 2011 that Washington will have a government unified by one party. Thanks to Trump's big win, Republicans are poised to grasp the holy grail of governance: Congress, the White House and a conservative Supreme Court. And, oh, the things Republicans could do with that (Democratic filibusters in the Senate notwithstanding). They could repeal Obamacare, trash the Iran nuclear deal, dramatically loosen government regulations on the environment, energy and finance. And that's just the stuff we can think of on four hours of sleep. Even though Tuesday's election results are the stuff of Republican dreams, that does not mean everything will go smoothly between Trump and Capitol Hill Republicans. If recent history is any guide, it could even be as ugly as open warfare. To start, there's the question of whether Trump's win has reshaped what the party stands for. Many of the priorities he campaigned on are the opposite of what the conservative wing of the tea party has been lobbying for: Trump wants to tear up trade deals;, he has at times floated the idea of some kind of universal health care, and he wants to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cutting benefits. Those are among many, many other areas in which he and his party do not seem to read from the same policy playbook. Then there's Ryan himself, who has had a rocky relationship with Trump for most of this campaign. In an October interview with Fox News's Bill O'Reilly, Trump suggested that Ryan would not be House speaker after the election. Fox News host Sean Hannity suggested as much on Tuesday night. (On Wednesday, Ryan dismissed those discussions: ""I don't worry about intraparty issues,"" he said. ""I feel very good about where we are."") But if there is any level of mistrust between Ryan and Trump, it's easy to see where it came from. Since he endorsed Trump in June until he basically unendorsed him in October, Ryan denounced or disagreed with his party's nominee publicly on average once every 11/2 weeks or so -- and never actually campaigned with him.    (Philip Bump / The Washington Post)  And a little more than 48 hours after Trump's 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape came out in October, Ryan effectively broke up with Trump by telling House Republicans he was done defending or campaigning him. It was a slight that Trump did not take lying down:   Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2016     Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2016   On Nov. 9, Ryan sounded a much different note. ""Donald Trump heard a voice in this country that no one else heard,"" he said. ""He connected in ways with people no one else did. He turned politics on its head, and now Donald Trump will lead a unified Republican government. And we will work hand in hand to tackle the country's biggest challenges."" (Yes, he was talking about the same nominee.) Setting Ryan aside for a moment, how awkward will things be now for the three dozen or so Republican lawmakers who said, at some point during this campaign, they would not support or vote for Trump? In the wee hours Wednesday morning, some of those Republicans seemed willing to extend an olive branch to the man they did not want to be president. Hours after Sen Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) voted for the independent candidate Evan McMullin, he congratulated Trump.   My statement on the 2016 Presidential election. pic.twitter.com/r6FpkWPRpT -- Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) November 9, 2016   And the original Never-Trumper, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, struck a conciliatory, hopeful tone:   My family and I just prayed that President-Elect Trump will be wise and faithful in his new vocation. We call on all Americans to as well. -- Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) November 9, 2016     .@BenSasse statement: pic.twitter.com/0T5iVSj6IU -- James Wegmann (@jameswegmann) November 9, 2016   But if there's one character trait Trump proved over and over in the campaign, it's that he is not a man who lets grievances go lightly. Trump could decide not to let bygones be bygones, which would get a significant portion of the Republican caucus off on the wrong foot with their party's own president. There could be a silver lining for the Never-Trump Republicans: They could shape a Trump presidency their way by making him amenable to their priorities. A unified Republican Congress, theorized Cornell Law School professor Josh Chafetz, could ""be able to pass legislation that would then be presented to Trump in take-it-or-leave-it form. Because Trump doesn't seem incredibly interested in most policy details, he may be inclined to take what the Republicans in Congress give him."" That would certainly be the best-case scenario for congressional Republicans. But really, they probably know as much as anyone in America does right now about what the next four years of a Trump presidency will be like."
