Trump, saying that his inflammatory statements from the campaign trail do not necessarily reflect the actions he will take as president. El-Sissi, in an interview with Portuguese news agency LUSA released on Saturday, said, ""let's not jump into conclusions or worry"" about future U.S. actions or policies in the Middle East. The army chief-turned-president was interviewed prior to his upcoming Nov. 21 visit to Portugal. El-Sissi was among the very first foreign leaders to congratulate Trump's on his presidential victory.  ""We have to distinguish between the rhetoric that takes place within presidential campaigns and the real and actual administration of a country after the inauguration,"" he said. ""There will be a chance for more thorough readings."" El-Sissi's remarks echoed sentiments that have been circulating on local and regional media, with columnists speculating that Trump campaign rhetoric -- such as his call for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. -- will be watered down. Trump and el-Sissi have already shown a certain bond. Trump said there was ""good chemistry"" when they met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September. El-Sissi said Trump would ""without a doubt"" make a strong leader. El-Sissi, who was elected in 2014 after leading the military ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, has painted himself as a regional leader in the fight against Islamic militancy -- a stance that echoes Trump's priorities. The prospect of warmer relations with Trump comes after years of relative chill between el-Sissi and outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama. After the ouster of Morsi and the subsequent lethal crackdown on Islamist supporters, the Obama administration voiced criticism and briefly suspended part of the Egypt's robust American aid package. Egypt's pro-government media have often railed against Obama, accusing the U.S. of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and other dissident groups. Many of those pro-government media outlets are now cheering Trump's victory. Observers believe that Trump is less likely to take Egypt to task over human rights. Instead, he could offer el-Sissi international political support as the Egyptian leader battles Islamic State group-linked militants in the Sinai peninsula and in neighboring Libya.  ""I believe that President Trump will be vigorously engaged with the issues in the region,"" el-Sissi said. ""As a matter of fact, Trump has shown deep and great understanding of what is taking place in the region as a whole and Egypt in particular. I am looking forward and expecting more support and reinforcement of our bilateral relations."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In remarks that were equal parts pep talk and funeral dirge, Clinton encouraged her backers to ""never, ever give up.""  ""I know this isn't easy. I know that over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves whether America is the country we thought it was,"" Clinton said Wednesday night at the annual gala of the Children's Defense Fund, the child advocacy organization where she started her legal career. ""But please listen to me when I say this: America is worth it."" She added: ""It's up to each and every one of us to keep working to make America better and stronger and fairer."" Clinton never cited the president-elect by name in her remarks, making only an oblique reference to the controversial policies that fueled his rise to the White House. Instead, she focused on the future, asking her backers to ""stay engaged on every level.""  ""We need you. America needs your energy,"" she said. Clinton's surprising loss threw her party into a period of intense soul-searching, with an ascendant liberal wing blaming Clinton's campaign for failing to embrace a more populist economic message. In private calls with donors and Democratic officials, Clinton has largely attributed her defeat to the decision by the FBI to re-examine her use of a private server as secretary of state. In her remarks, Clinton offered no accounting for any failures she may have made during her presidential campaign, though she admitted that the past week hasn't been easy.  ""There have been a few times this past week when all I wanted to do was just to curl up with a good book or our dogs and never leave the house again,"" she ruefully admitted. She chose friendly ground to make her first public appearance since her emotional concession speech in New York City last Wednesday. Her first job out of law school in the 1970s was for Children's Defense Fund founder Marian Wright Edelman. She later became a staff attorney and chairman of the group's board. Throughout her campaign, she cited her work for the group as her ""north star,"" sparking her interest in standing up against injustice toward children and families. The group, which helps disadvantaged children, tried to return some of the affection on Wednesday night.  ""We love her and we appreciate all the hard work she has done and say it's not going to be for naught,"" said Edelman, in her introductory remarks. ""We're going to say that she is the people's president."" Still, in a sign of Clinton's new life as a private citizen, the event lacked many of the trappings of her presidential campaign. Security was light and she traveled with only a handful of aides. Sprinkled throughout the small theater where she addressed donors and supporters were a handful of empty seats.

Council on Tuesday gave final approval to legislation that would allow physicians to prescribe fatal drugs to terminally ill residents in the city, making the District the seventh jurisdiction nationwide to allow the practice. The council voted 11 to 2 in favor of the bill, with members Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1) and Yvette M. Alexander (D-Ward 7) casting the dissenting votes. The vote, which took a matter of minutes and involved no discussion, capped more than a year of intense discussion and lobbying on the part of lawmakers, advocates and opponents. D.C. is the first predominantly black community to legalize what is called ""death with dignity,"" overcoming objections from some African American residents and others who worried that ill patients could be coerced into an early death.  [""Right to die"" legislation faces skepticism from African Americans in nation's capital]  Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has said she will not veto the bill but has not indicated whether she will sign it. If she does nothing after 10 days, the legislation automatically becomes an act. It is sent to Congress for a 30-day review period; if Congress takes no action, it becomes law. Compassion & Choices, which has lobbied for right-to-die bills across the country, hailed the passage of legislation in the nation's capital as a significant victory for its movement. Colorado voters last week approved a ballot measure authorizing medical aid in dying. ""The fact that we have now gotten three states with diverse populations across the country, from the West Coast to the Midwest to the East Coast, is a huge sign of momentum and support for the issue across political, racial and demographic grounds,"" said Sean Crowley, a Compassion and Choices spokesman. The D.C. Catholic Conference, one of the groups opposed to the legislation, vowed to press Bowser to veto the legislation, despite her public statements that she would not. ""This bill imperils residents, particularly those who are sick, elderly, disabled and the uninsured,"" said Michael Scott, director of the conference. ""It allows for coercion and abuse, including third parties administering the lethal drugs to patients who may or may not be incapacitated or requesting assisted suicide."" The Death with Dignity Act, sponsored by council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), is modeled after Oregon's 1997 first-in-the-nation law. The bill would allow terminally ill patients with less than six months to live to request fatal drugs from a physician after consulting a doctor over two weeks, with two witnesses attesting that the decision is voluntary. Patients must ingest the medication themselves without the assistance of doctors or family members, and physicians can refer them to counseling if they think their judgment is impaired. An analysis by the District's chief financial officer estimated that fewer than 10 people a year would exercise the option. Advocates say the measure would allow terminally ill patients to choose the timing and manner of their deaths and to avoid prolonged suffering. But the practice is opposed by many who say it violates their religious beliefs. Advocates for the disabled say they fear people will be steered to premature death, and medical professionals say it violates the Hippocratic oath. It has faced particular opposition from African Americans, who make up nearly half of the District's population. Some say they are unsettled by the practice because of historical abuse by the medical establishment and concerns that they may be steered to early deaths. Physician-assisted death has been authorized in Oregon, Washington state, Montana and Vermont -- states with mostly white populations. In June, a right-to-die law took effect in California, despite opposition from Latinos and Catholics. Colorado voters passed a similar law Nov. 8. "

Former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), a respected voice on national security thought to be a leading candidate to run the CIA, was among those pushed out of the team over the past two days, two individuals with direct knowledge said, in a series of moves that have added to the anxiety across the upper ranks of U.S. intelligence agencies. The changes came as Trump met Tuesday with incoming Vice President Mike Pence to discuss Cabinet and top White House personnel choices. Pence last week replaced New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) as head of Trump's overall transition efforts, and Christie's associates -- who had been Trump's link to the GOP mainstream for months -- now find themselves losing influence.  [It's not just the Cabinet: Trump's transition team needs to find nearly 4,000 appointees]  A number of Christie allies have been told they were no longer in line for top posts, according to several people familiar with the transition, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly.      The Post's Robert Costa and Paul Farhi discuss the appointments by President-elect Donald Trump of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor and Reince Priebus as chief of staff. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Also on Tuesday, perhaps the most influential Republican on national security matters, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), weighed in on Trump's efforts to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying any efforts to ""reset"" relations with Russia are unacceptable. McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman who had a difficult relationship with Trump during the campaign, issued a statement blasting Putin as ""a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies and attempted to undermine America's elections.'' A former U.S. official with ties to the Trump team described the ousters of Rogers and others as a ""bloodletting of anybody that associated in any way on the transition with Christie,"" and said that the departures were engineered by two Trump loyalists who have taken control of who will get national security posts in the administration: retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Rogers had no prior significant ties to Christie but had been recruited to join the Trump team as an adviser by the New Jersey governor. At least three other Christie associates were also pushed aside, former officials said, apparently in retaliation for Christie's role as a U.S. prosecutor in sending Kushner's father to prison. Rogers' departure adds to the list of positions for which the Trump team is struggling to find suitable candidates, and came as Eliot Cohen, a leading voice of opposition to Trump among former GOP national security officials during the campaign, blasted Trump's transition team for its treatment of perceived foes.  Now operating below Pence on the transition team, the people said, are advisers who are close to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) -- himself a top Trump associate known for his hardline views on immigration -- and former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon. Bannon's recent appointment as chief White House strategist was denounced by advocacy groups and Democrats, who accuse him of racist, anti-Semitic and misogynist views. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Tuesday, in his first speech on the Senate floor speech since Trump's victory, that the president-elect should retract Bannon's appointment, calling the latter a ""champion of white supremacy"" whose hiring undermines Trump's call for national unity following the election.         1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

Reid said. ""I say to Donald Trump, take responsibility. Rise to the dignity of the office of the president of the United States instead of hiding behind your Twitter account. ... Show America that racism, bullying and bigotry have no place in your White House."" Inside Trump Tower in Manhattan, where the president-elect is planning his government, the shift is seen as a clear signal that Trump will govern more in line with the populist, hardline campaign he ran, the people said. In another surprising development on Tuesday, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has been a confidant to Trump since the end of the Republican primaries, is unlikely to join the administration but will remain an informal adviser. ""The way I'm leaning is to work from the outside and not from the inside,"" Carson said in an interview. ""I want to have the freedom to work on many issues and not be pigeonholed into one particular area."" Carson, who is Trump's most high-profile African American supporter, has been under consideration for several positions in Trump's Cabinet, including secretary of health and human services. Adding to the uncertainty, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared to take himself out of the running for attorney general. Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney and a top Trump adviser, had been considered a leading candidate for the prestigious post. ""I won't be attorney general,"" Giuliani said Monday at a Wall Street Journal event. Cohen, meanwhile, drew widespread attention for his tweet. ""After exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away. They're angry, arrogant, screaming ""you LOST!"" Will be ugly,'' tweeted Cohen, who served from 2007 to 2009 as counselor to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He was a driving force behind an open letter last spring -- eventually signed by 122 Republican national security leaders -- who opposed Trump's candidacy.  Cohen, who last week had urged career officials to serve in Trump's administration, said in an interview that a longtime friend and senior transition team official had asked him to submit names of possible national security appointees. After he suggested several people, Cohen said, his friend emailed him back in terms he described as ""very weird, very disturbing."" ""It was accusations that 'you guys are trying to insinuate yourselves into the administration...all of YOU LOST.'...it became clear to me that they view jobs as lollipops, things you give out to good boys and girls,"" said Cohen, who would not identify his friend. Cohen also said the transition official was ""completely dismissive"" of concerns raised about Trump's appointment of Bannon, who Trump's advisors have strongly defended. His friend's email conveyed the feeling that 'we're so glad to see the bicoastal elites get theirs,'"" added Cohen, who described the response as ""unhinged.'' Trump transition officials had no immediate comment Tuesday, but Jason Miller, a senior transition communication adviser, told reporters Monday night that Trump and Pence know the urgency of filling key positions.  ""Obviously, inauguration day is not getting further away. And people need to get going. This is an absolute top priority understood by the president-elect and the vice president-elect,"" Miller said. Some political observers were also stunned to hear that Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, an adviser to Trump, was being considered as a candidate for agriculture secretary in the new administration. Miller was widely criticized for recently calling Hillary Clinton a ""c-t"" on Twitter. He later placed blame for the tweet on a ""third-party vendor"" who he said would be removed from his campaign staff. As for the president-elect, Trump jumped back on Twitter on Tuesday morning to argue about his expected loss of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. Trump was known for his incendiary tweets during the campaign, but has tweeted only sporadically since his victory. ""If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y., Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily,"" Trump wrote at his personal account, @realDonaldTrump.  Six minutes later, Trump changed his tone and defended the electoral college, where his victory was secured. The system is ""actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!"" he wrote.  Amid the widespread uncertainty, coordination between Trump's transition team and the Obama White House is now on hold until Trump's team signs a key document, the Associated Press reported. The document, a memorandum of understanding smoothing interaction between the two teams, has yet to be signed by Pence, who recently replaced Christie as head of Trump's transition planning. White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said the Obama administration is working with Trump advisers to get the document signed. Some of Trump's biggest campaign fundraisers and super PAC donors were rewarded Tuesday with seats on his presidential inaugural committee, which will be headed by investor Thomas Barrack Jr., a Trump business associate who hosted the candidate's first fundraiser in May. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam - who together gave at least $11.2 million to his campaign and allied super PACs, making them Trump's biggest donors -- were named as finance vice-chairs.  Other major financial backers on the committee include New York financier Lew Eisenberg, who headed the Republican National Committee's joint fundraising effort with the campaign; Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks, who gave at least $1.9 million to support Trump; and Laurie J. Perlmutter, the wife of Marvel Entertainment chief executive Isaac Perlmutter, who gave $5 million to a pro-Trump super PAC days before the election. Other major campaign fundraisers were also give slots, including New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Dallas executive Roy Bailey, Florida lobbyist Brian Ballard, New York financier Anthony Scaramucci, Florida developer Mel Sembler, Dallas investor Ray Washburne and former RNC finance chairman Ron Weiser. Casino mogul Steve Wynn, who declined to say during the campaign which candidate he was backing, also secured a spot. The cascading developments followed a telephone call Monday between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which they agreed that relations between their countries were ""unsatisfactory"" and vowed to work together to improve them, the Kremlin said in a statement. Moscow said the two men discussed combining efforts in the fight against terrorism, talked about ""a settlement for the crisis in Syria"" and agreed that their aides would begin working on a face-to-face meeting between them. Trump's office later said that Putin had called to ""offer his congratulations"" and that they had discussed shared threats and challenges, ""strategic economic issues"" and the long-term relationship between the two nations. The president-elect spoke admiringly of Putin during the campaign, praising him as a stronger leader than President Obama and saying the two countries should join together to fight terrorists, particularly the Islamic State in Syria. Those views put Trump at odds with many GOP defense hawks, who are uniformly suspicious of Moscow and have denounced Russian actions in Eastern Europe, Ukraine and Syria. The offer of cooperation could also immerse Trump in a deep controversy with the Pentagon, where military and civilian leaders have strongly opposed collaboration with Russia, particularly in Syria.             Protests, meanwhile, continued for a sixth straight day in major cities and on college campuses over last week's election results, in which Trump won the electoral college but lost the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Noem, the state's only member of the U.S. House, easily won a fourth term last week. She announced the move in a video posted Monday by her gubernatorial campaign, saying she believes in the spirit of ""citizen legislators whose temporary service helped found our nation."" But Noem's future plans were likely hastened by a ballot measure South Dakota voters passed in the same election that will soon sharply limit how much money can be transferred from campaign accounts when running for a new office. On Monday, she moved $1.6 million from her House account to her gubernatorial campaign.  ""We just got through one campaign season, and we all need a break from politics, so while my campaign won't kick off officially until next year, I want you to know that I'm all in,"" she said in the video. Noem said she's ready to work with Republican President-elect Donald Trump during her final term on a new farm bill, tax reform and repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Noem will likely face off against South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley, who has said he's preparing to run for governor. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) questions witnesses during a committee hearing on the threat posed by Islamic extremists, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press)  The ouster of former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) from Donald Trump's transition team is a worrisome sign of continuing internecine battles in the GOP and the ascendancy of Trump's personal political allies in shaping the president-elect's agenda. Rogers, a widely respected former FBI agent who headed the House Intelligence Committee, had been seen as a figure of stability and continuity in intelligence matters. He was mentioned as a possible next director of the CIA or director of national intelligence. But Rogers was told last weekend by Rick Dearborn, executive director of the transition team, that he was being removed from his role in the national-security group advising Trump. He was replaced by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who took over as the committee's chairman after Rogers left Congress in 2014 and has been a far more partisan chairman. Rogers had angered House GOP hard-liners when his committee issued a bipartisan report in 2014 clearing Hillary Clinton of personal wrongdoing in the 2012 Benghazi incident. That report was characteristic of the way Rogers chaired the committee, in a working partnership with then-ranking Democrat, Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.). (Rogers added ""additional views"" that criticized ""senior State Department officials"" for dismissing threat warnings, denying requests for extra security in eastern Libya and other errors.) But this consensual approach clearly didn't suit Trump's inner circle. Rogers had been brought into the transition by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), another official with bipartisan credentials, who was ousted himself a week ago and replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Some GOP insiders see the real power behind Trump as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and they argue that there has been bad blood between Kushner and Christie for more than a decade. In 2005, when he was U.S. attorney, Christie obtained a guilty plea from Charles Kushner, Jared's father, on charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions.          1 of 8       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                       Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

According to GOP insiders, the most likely picks for CIA director include Nunes and former Rep. Pete Hoekstra (Mich.), who served on the House intelligence panel; former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn is being considered as well, though there are doubts he could be confirmed. A wild card mentioned by one source is former Defense Department official Frank Gaffney. All four are known as combative personalities who disdain the bipartisan approach that Rogers represented. A sign of Rogers's wide range of friends and contacts was a dinner party he gave Monday night at his Virginia home for some producers and cast members of the television drama ""Homeland."" It was attended by CIA Director John Brennan, National Security Agency Director Adm. Michael Rogers, and several prominent members of Congress from both sides of the aisle. Rogers didn't mention to his guests that he had been informed several days before of his removal from the transition. Rogers has been a strong advocate for the CIA and other intelligence agencies, and a critic of some efforts to restrict intelligence activities. But he was seen by many CIA officers as a political figure who, like former CIA director Leon Panetta (another former congressman), would have had the political influence to shield the agency from attack. A speech he gave last month to the Heritage Foundation illustrated one area where he might have disagreed with Trump, who favors conciliation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, ""The Russians are certainly on the march,"" Rogers said. ""Russia's change in the way they have used their cyber policy will give you a bead of sweat."" Rogers issued a generous statement Tuesday reiterating his strong support for Trump. ""America's challenges domestically and overseas are so enormous that we needed to move in a drastically different direction for our country,"" he said. Just how far the new administration may depart from long-standing U.S. national-security policies was demonstrated by Rogers's own departure. You could imagine the jaws dropping Tuesday across the intelligence community when people heard the news of Rogers's ouster. ""He fought for the guys in the field and has their respect,"" said one former top aide to Rogers. Like most of the rest of the government, the intelligence agencies literally don't know what to expect next.      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   "

Although CNN and Fox News were the most-watched networks on election night, NBC topped its broadcast brethren ABC and CBS, a major point of pride for the news divisions. The presidential contest also helped NBC's regularly scheduled newscasts. For example, the ""Today"" show on Wednesday had its most-watched single day since the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, as America tuned in to learn more about Donald Trump's election as president, the Nielsen company said. ""Today"" also beat ABC's ""Good Morning America"" for the week, its first weekly win since February, not counting the weeks NBC broadcast from the Olympics. NBC's ""Nightly News"" won last week as well, stopping at least temporarily a slide that has led ABC's ""World News Tonight"" to do better the last two months. Lester Holt's newscast on Wednesday was the most-watched since last February, Nielsen said. Meanwhile, 20 million people tuned in to a ""60 Minutes"" interview with President-elect Trump and his family on Sunday. That was the biggest audience for the venerable newsmagazine since its Sean Penn interview last January and, before that, all the way back to an interview with Barack Obama just after his election in 2008. Post-election cable news ratings gave a strong indication of who was interested in watching political news. Fox News Channel -- where most happy Trump fans would be likely to watch -- averaged 4.82 million viewers in prime time last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. That was up 48 percent from its average during October, Nielsen said. Meanwhile, the audiences for both CNN and MSNBC were depressed: CNN was down 1 percent from October for those three days, and MSNBC down 24 percent. NBC won last week in prime time, averaging 8.4 million viewers for the week. CBS averaged 8 million viewers, ABC had 6 million, Fox had 5.5 million, Univision had 2.2 million, Telemundo had 1.7 million, the CW had 1.3 million and ION Television had 1.2 million. Fox News was the week's most popular cable network, averaging 4.77 million viewers for the week. CNN had 3.15 million, ESPN had 2.43 million, Hallmark had 2.05 million and MSNBC had 1.89 million. NBC's ""Nightly News"" topped the evening newscasts with an average of 8.8 million viewers.

The classmate responded to the question ""You don't think Black people having equal rights??"" with ""No because they don't work for it and as a culture they are scary, violent, rude and needy / They expect to be catered to."" The students disapproved, and distributed a screen grab on their own Snapchat, to illustrate ""that this kind of racism still exists."" And then the school disciplined the two students, for ""disruptive behavior,"" apparently on the theory that publicizing the post ""opened [the classmate] up to harassment,"" and that they ""put a private message on a public forum."" (We only have the students' accounts of this; Fox 8 Cleveland reported that the school district said it can't comment on student disciplinary matters, and an ACLU letter about the matter reports that the original post was ""broadly posted."" [UPDATE: I originally characterized the letter as saying that the original post was ""public,"" but other reports claim it wasn't; I just talked to someone at the ACLU who says that she is confident that the post wasn't just a one-to-one message, but was posted in a place where a substantial group of readers could see it, though it may not have been outright ""public."" That doesn't affect my view of the matter, but I wanted to correct and clarify this.]) This, it seems to me, helps illustrate the need to limit schools' ability to discipline students for ""disruptive"" speech. Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. School Dist., which dealt with speech at school, did say that some such speech can be restricted if it materially risks substantially disrupting schoolwork. And I agree that even political speech off-campus can cause such disruption at school. But the Tinker substantial-disruption doctrine can't justify schools controlling students' speech 24/7, to the point that a student faces suspension (and, if that's allowed, then why not expulsion?) for engaging, off-campus, in political speech that classmates find offensive. It's one thing for schools to say ""school is for learning, so don't say things at school that interfere with school""; it's another for schools to say ""don't say anything anywhere that might interfere with school."" The school's view would make it risky for students to express any views that some might find highly offensive and might thus cause disruption -- whether condemnations of blacks, of whites, of illegal aliens, of Muslims, of Trump supporters, of evangelical Christians, of gays, or of anyone who condemns the condemners (or supports them). Tinker held that students do not ""shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate."" And though the court stated that, within the schoolhouse gates, some speech can be restricted in the name of preventing disruption, outside the schoolhouse gate student speech, especially political advocacy, has to be firmly protected. I do see that, with today's media, publicizing a classmate's comments could lead to a huge backlash against the classmate -- and perhaps even to some people physically attacking the classmate. But I don't think that fear of this can justify punishing students for accurately reporting their classmates' political sentiments, especially given that showing how the sentiments are indeed being expressed by a real classmate is itself part of the political message. (Some people condemning classmates that way might choose to blur out the criticized person's name, but especially given the frequency of hoaxes, including the name is often important to making the message credible.) Naturally, I think the classmate shouldn't be disciplined for her speech, either. The Fox 8 article states, [One of the suspended students] said she's disappointed the student who posted the racist rants was not disciplined. She said free speech is one thing, but disrespecting someone's race is a problem. The problem is thinking that just because some speech ""is a problem"" it isn't free speech any more. Thanks to Prof. Gary Dyer for the pointer."

A Malaysian rights group called the sentence a ""dangerous chill on free speech"" that could lead to a more repressive and unaccountable government. Rafizi Ramli, vice president of the People's Justice Party, was found guilty by the court of violating the Official Secrets Act by possessing and disclosing content of a government audit report on the indebted 1MDB fund, founded by Prime Minister Najib Razak. Rafizi, who often makes allegations on alleged government wrongdoing, said he would appeal. He risks being disqualified from running in the next general election, due in 2018.  ""I am not shocked, sad, angry, afraid or anything. No such feeling. Just another day. Been like this. What doesn't kill u makes u stronger,"" he tweeted just before the sentencing. The Malaysian rights group Lawyers for Liberty called the sentence harsh and excessive. It questioned why the Auditor General's report on 1MDB was suddenly classified as an official secret when it is normally presented to Parliament annually and made available to the public. Authorities were quick to punish whistleblowers like Rafizi, but have taken little or no action against alleged corruption involving the fund, it said.  ""The conviction and sentence will create a dangerous chill on free speech and result in a more repressive, opaque and unaccountable government,"" Lawyers for Liberty said in a statement. The 1MDB fund has been at the center of investigations in the U.S. and several countries amid allegations of a global embezzlement and money-laundering scheme. Najib started the fund shortly after taking office in 2009 to promote economic development projects, but the fund accumulated billions in debt over the years. The U.S. Justice Department says at least $3.5 billion has been stolen from 1MDB by people close to Najib and initiated action in July to seize $1.3 billion it says was taken from the fund to buy assets in the U.S. The government complaints also say that more than $700 million has landed in the accounts of ""Malaysian Official 1."" They did not name the official, but appear to be referring to Najib. The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing since the allegations of massive fraud in the fund erupted last year. Rafizi's sentencing comes ahead of a planned mass rally by the democracy group Bersih to demand Najib's resignation over the 1MDB scandal. New York-based Human Rights Watch said Rafizi's conviction under the Official Secrets Act was unprecedented and targeted to ""intimidate whistleblowers into silence over the 1MDB corruption scandal."" The group's deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson, said in a statement that the public has the right to know about Najib's alleged involvement in the scandal and ""express views without facing these kinds of politically motivated prosecutions."" Government minister Abdul Rahman Dahlan, however, said Rafizi had been warned repeatedly against disclosing any of the report.  ""He tried a cheap stunt for personal political gain, but he knowingly committed a serious crime in doing so,"" Rahman said in a statement. ""It is right that he pays the price -- and he has only himself to blame."" Najib has remained firmly in political control by clamping down on critics and because of unwavering support from most ruling party members. His ruling coalition won the last elections in 2013, but lost the popular vote to an opposition coalition that includes Rafizi's party. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"   Donald Trump campaigns in Moon Township, Pa., on Nov. 6. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Donald Trump's election to the presidency has permanently damaged the country. There's no getting away from that. But those of us who lost Tuesday can still build something from the wreckage. We can find and support each other in defense of common values. Americans across the political spectrum are alarmed by the election result. Here are some concrete ways we can act.  ""Mourn, then organize."" As Peter Dreier recently noted, Democrats need some time to mourn. Take that time for self-care, for whatever gives you joy and restores your resilience. I certainly needed that time. I'll never forget election night. About 10, my daughter, so excited about a potential Hillary Clinton victory, asked me in tears: ""What's happening, Daddy?"" My own tears began to flow. But then, after taking that time, we must get busy, to mobilize a broad coalition to oppose and eventually defeat President-elect Trump. There's no need for despair. Democrats are in far better shape than the Republicans were only eight years ago, when Barack Obama won handily, when Republicans were heavily outnumbered in Congress and when they bore the stigma of a failed Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina and the financial crisis.  I reject the Republicans' policy agenda and their norm-breaking tactics, such as holding the debt ceiling hostage. Yet Democrats can learn something from their resilience as they clawed back. Republicans were powerful grass-roots organizers, too. Many Democrats dismissed the tea party as some artificial grass turf. If only it were. We can learn from that. Like Democrats in 2009-2010, Republicans dominate all three branches of government, and will thus politically own their own unpopular measures on health care and other matters.   [Here's why Trump is already waffling on Obamacare]   Skip the circular firing squad. A narrow, historic upset will encourage recrimination and infighting. That's only human, especially among Democrats. Let's reserve our anger for political adversaries rather than the imperfect human beings who fought for progressive values and yet fell short. We must forgive one another. Clinton supporters can learn from Bernie Sanders's populist message that mobilized so many. Sanders folk could learn some things about policy substance from Clinton, too. Both groups might also reach out to principled #NeverTrump conservatives and libertarians with whom we generally disagree. At times, they may be important allies. Big data are nice. Big organizing is more important. Democratic political pros arrogantly overstated the power of top-down analytics this year. I suspect they overstated the role of high-tech in past Obama victories, too. Technology and data complement grass-roots passion and organizing. They can never replace or substitute for it. The Obama, Sanders -- and, yes, Trump -- campaigns possessed that energy. Clinton's supporters respected her and feared Trump. Still, too many of us were passive and diffident in our support. Clinton never quite mobilized sufficient passion. Too late, Trump has solved that problem for us.  Identify and support a group, candidate or cause you admire. The organization could be the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood, the International Rescue Committee or the National Immigrant Justice Center. That politician could command national prominence. But it's probably best if she's running for local school board or county treasurer. You can have an outsize influence on local races. You'll learn skills and develop the personal networks that greatly amplify your later efforts. Support good journalism. News media leaders are reportedly doing some soul-searching about their role. They certainly should. Terrible cable news programs elevated and normalized a Trump candidacy and placed disproportionate attention on Clinton's real but venial sins regarding her email and the rest. Throughout, the desire for false balance and the unspoken assumption that Clinton would win led reporters to be harder on her than on her preposterous opponent, with pathetically little attention paid to policy.   [Trump voters won't mind if he doesn't keep all his promises.]   Trump also brought networks good ratings. Which brought Trump special treatment and $2 billion in earned media. Les Moonves, chairman, president and chief executive of CBS, unwittingly said it best: ""It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS. ... It's a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald."" We can do better. We can support valuable work, such as Ari Berman's work on voting rights or Alec MacGillis's reporting on the complex politics of poverty in purple states. We can watch substantive programs that explore serious issues from different perspectives. We can spurn vacuous offerings such as ""Morning Joe,"" and prime-time shows featuring dueling Democratic and Republican ""strategists"" spouting partisan talking points. Engage ordinary Trump supporters with honesty and humanity. Half of the country voted for Trump. Millions of otherwise good people did so because they feel marginalized and disrespected in a changing nation that is callously leaving their communities behind. We must engage these men and women more effectively, showing our own readiness to listen as we hope they will listen to us. Whatever tough words we offer, we should adopt one simple rule: Say nothing about Trump supporters in private that we wouldn't say straight to their faces. They deserve that honesty and respect, even when we bluntly criticize their arguments or their vote. So don't Facebook unfriend that irritating Trump supporter or avoid Trump-curious relatives at Thanksgiving dinner. We need those human connections.  Remind your friends, neighbors and relatives that Trump is a minority president with no mandate. He won the election. There is no contesting that. But Clinton appears to have received more votes. Many Trump voters -- and millions who didn't vote, or who voted for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson or Green Party nominee Jill Stein -- told pollsters they are disquieted about his character and his competence. Whatever the president-elect may claim, he won no mandate. His stands on immigration, climate change and reproductive choice are distinctly unpopular. Many Republican officials who publicly support him privately find him appalling.  We must remind people of that. Don't normalize Trump or the political professionals who enabled him. It will be tempting to ease into normal relationships with the president-elect and his team. Resist that. Political professionals, from Reince Priebus and Kellyanne Conway on down, who abetted Trump's rise harmed the nation. They knew that he was dangerous and unsavory. They chose to help him anyway. They deserve the coolest of civilities, no more.  But grant policy experts the space to help Trump in certain areas to avoid national catastrophe. The president-elect and his motley inner-circle of advisers are ill-equipped for the task ahead. Out of duty and patriotism, foreign policy experts should do what they can to limit the damage. Many diplomats reportedly plan to resign rather than work for Trump. I sympathize, but I hope they stay.  Fight voter suppression. 2016 was the first presidential election since 1964 without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. That mattered. Florida, North Carolina and Wisconsin are among the battleground states that featured prominent battles over disenfranchisement and voter suppression. Trump won close victories in all of these states -- aided in no small degree by successful Republican efforts to limit minority voting. Such discriminatory practices undermine the legitimacy of our electoral system and violate basic American values. You can support organizations, such as the Moral Mondays movement or the Religious action center of Reform Judaism, that oppose such practices.  Be civil and restrained in opposing the president-elect's proposals. Trump will depict his political adversaries as scary or extreme. Let's not play into that, or gratuitously offend potential allies with wild rhetoric and behavior.  Support justified nonviolent protest. The Trump administration may implement cruel policies toward undocumented immigrants, Muslim Americans and other vulnerable groups. Those directly affected and their closest allies will take to the streets in protest. The rest of us must be there with them.  Join the 2018 campaign. Democrats typically slough off midterms to focus on presidential races. Even President Obama couldn't mobilize the troops in 2010, which proved fateful. We can't let down our guard again. Given the Senate map, we will likely lose many Senate seats, but we can create the resources and candidates we'll need later. We must convert our current anger and sadness into effective action on local, state and congressional races that Democrats stupidly tend to ignore. Chin up. I remain heartbroken. I'm also oddly exhilarated, girded for the coming fights. There is a clarity to these coming battles. We must remove a grifting demagogue from the White House. The stakes could hardly be higher. Those of us who oppose him have one another. We have much of the country, too, which I suspect will soon experience massive buyers' remorse.  So cheer up, progressives, and let's work. It won't be easy. Important things rarely are. We can weave our own silver lining within the dark cloud that now hovers over our nation. "
