However, minutes after it went into effect, activists in Taiz said that rebel shelling continued in the city while a rebel-affiliated military spokesman said that there was no halt of fighting. Col. Sharaf Loqman, a military spokesman, told The Associated Press that the fighting hasn't stopped at any of the front-lines. He said that the rebels support a full cessation of hostilities, but that the reality at the moment is, ""all parties are engaged in fighting."" The Saudi news agency SPA carried a statement from the coalition that said the truce would take effect at 12 p.m. Yemeni time on Saturday and that it could be renewed. The coalition warned the rebels, known as Houthis, against any sort of military movement. The ceasefire comes at a time that forces loyal to the Saudi-backed, internationally-recognized government have made advances in Taiz, which has been besieged by the rebels for the past year. The coalition has demanded that the Houthis send their representatives to meet with a de-escalation committee based in a southern Saudi city, in order to make security and military arrangements to end rebel control over several cities in the north -- including the capital, Sanaa. While the coalition stressed that the ceasefire is aimed at paving the way for peace, it didn't elaborate on whether it's accepting the U.N.-brokered peace plan -- which sidelines President Abed-Rabbo Mansour Hadi and gives the rebels a share of power. The truce also comes two days after an earlier plan for a U.S.-brokered ceasefire faltered. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with Houthi representatives in Oman this week, set Nov. 17 as the beginning of the ceasefire. The plan was immediately rejected by Hadi's government, which accused Kerry of striking a unilateral deal. The coalition made no comment on Kerry's announcement. The conflict in Yemen has divided the country into rival regions with the northern -- predominated by Shiites -- under rebel control while the south -- mostly Sunnis -- is under the coalition's control. The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 at the request of Hadi, who was forced to flee the country when the Houthis joined ranks with forces loyal to the ousted Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and descended from their northern enclave -- seizing the capital and pushing southward. The coalition imposed a blockade on Yemen, and the airstrikes along with ground fighting have left over 4,000 civilians dead and tens of thousands wounded. The conflict has forced 3 million people to flee their homes and pushed the Arab world's poorest nation to the brink of famine. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The monarch laid the first wreath of red poppies at the foot of central London's Cenotaph war memorial in an annual service to remember all those killed in past and present conflicts. A hush fell over the capital as those gathered observed a two-minute silence at 11 a.m. to commemorate the end of World War I on Nov. 11, 1918 -- when guns on the Western Front fell silent on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. Remembrance Sunday is held each year on the second Sunday in November. Later, crowds lining the streets of Whitehall cheered as some 8,500 veterans and servicemen and women marched past to music played by military bands. Remembrance events this year are especially poignant because 2016 marks the centenary of the Battle of the Somme and the Battle of Jutland. The British Army suffered almost 60,000 casualties on the first day of the Somme battle alone, and more than a 1 million men would be killed or injured on both sides over the course of the offensive. Britain holds great importance in paying tribute to those who fought in the two World Wars as well as the thousands killed or injured in conflicts since 1945. Prime Minister Theresa May said this year's tribute should also be a time to remember British forces fighting the Islamic State group, those combating piracy or taking part in peacekeeping efforts in Africa.

The police have laid siege to the town for months, a sign of the lingering standoff between Bahrain's Shiite majority and its Sunni monarchy more than five years after Arab Spring protests were crushed. The ongoing crackdown has seen some activists imprisoned, others exiled, and a major Shiite opposition group dismantled. But there was no sign of the unrest as Prince Charles and his wife Camilla took in the sights as part of a three-nation tour of the Gulf. The Prince of Wales inaugurated a new naval base on Thursday, the first permanent British military presence since its withdrawal from Bahrain in 1971. The royal visit and the military base suggest Britain, which has long had influence with Bahrain's own monarchy, may not be pressing it on human rights. Tensions continue to grow amid the crackdown, with some worried a larger crisis could loom in Bahrain, which is home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet.  ""You will reach the level where people realize they have nothing left to lose,"" one local activist told The Associated Press. Bahrain, a small island off the coast of the Arabian Peninsula, has long drawn revelers to bars across the causeway from dry Saudi Arabia. Its history as a port town for pearl divers and shippers has drawn an eclectic mix of Sunnis, Shiites, Iraqi Jews, Christian missionaries and Hindus. The 2011 Arab Spring protests were backed by the Shiite majority and others, and were aimed at demanding more political freedoms from the ruling Al Khalifa family. The government put down the demonstrations with help from Saudi and Emirati troops, and later pledged to reform. While low-level unrest persisted for years, things remained largely peaceful until April, when Bahrain's military announced it was ""ready to deal firmly and with determination with these sedition groups and their heads"" after a gasoline bomb killed a police officer. Since then, authorities suspended the country's largest Shiite opposition group, Al-Wefaq, and doubled a prison sentence for its secretary-general, Sheikh Ali Salman. Famed activist Nabeel Rajab was imprisoned and now awaits sentencing on a charge of spreading ""false news."" Zainab al-Khawaja, the daughter of well-known activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who himself is serving a life sentence over his role in the 2011 protests, was forced into exile. The standoff in Diraz began in June, when supporters of Shiite cleric Sheikh Isa Qassim surrounded his home after the government revoked his citizenship. Police now control entry to the town and film incoming local drivers, while Western expatriates blissfully jog past armored personnel carriers. Graffiti on nearby side streets demands ""death"" for King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, while others show crude drawings of Pearl Square, the epicenter of the 2011 protests, which was later demolished by the government. Internet access cuts off nightly here, an outage researchers blame on government interference. Bahrain has blamed its unrest partly on Shiite power Iran, though a government-sponsored investigation said there wasn't a ""discernable link"" between the 2011 demonstrations and Tehran based on the information the government gave them. Posters throughout Bahraini highways show heavily armed SWAT teams from a Gulf-wide police exercise on the island, part of recent military maneuvers designed as a deterrent to Iran following last year's nuclear deal. Low oil prices have hurt the local economy, and forced Saudi Arabia to scale back its international aid. Two activists who spoke Wednesday to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of facing criminal charges said Bahrain's rulers were inflaming sectarian tension through their crackdown.  ""They are betting on the silence of the West because of the supply of the facilities,"" one activist said, referring to the British and American bases. ""They are compromising other things for this."" In a statement to AP, Bahrain's government said ""no individual in Bahrain will, or can be, prosecuted for his or her political views due to the freedom of expression protections explicitly stated in the constitution,"" despite the cases to the contrary. The British Foreign Office, while declining to address Prince Charles' private conversations, said United Kingdom officials have ""frank discussions with the government of Bahrain about human rights concerns both in public and in private.""  ""We believe that it is not good enough to merely criticize other countries from the sidelines,"" the statement to the AP said. ""Only by working with Bahrain are we able to bring about the changes we would like to see in the country."" However, even the day after the royals arrived, activists said prosecutors brought in several people for questioning likely ahead of filing criminal charges against them. Activists also offered a list of over 20 people recently put on a travel ban list, while independent news gathering grows more difficult. On Thursday, Prince Charles traveled to the British Navy's new Mina Salman Support Facility, which the British Defense Ministry estimates will cost the U.K. at least 6.4 million pounds ($7.9 million), with Bahrain covering the rest. While there, Prince Charles visited the HMS Middletown docked at the base. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap.

(Jemal Countess/Getty Images)  Hours after the end of the 2016 election, the filmmaker and activist Michael Moore published five items of advice for his fellow, horrified Democrats. After advising them to take over the Democratic Party and dump the consultants, Moore told them to repeat, as much as possible, that Donald Trump had lost the popular vote. ""You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: 'HILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!'"" wrote Moore. ""The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an effed-up country, you don't. The majority of your fellow Americans wanted Hillary, not Trump."" Having lost the election, Democrats are fumbling for ways to win its aftermath. The exit polls that explain Trump's victory, solidified by narrow wins in Rust Belt states, offer them an opportunity: Trump won the election despite a lower favorable rating, more voter angst about his agenda, and almost certainly a lower popular vote total than Clinton.   [A question on Americans' minds: What does Trump's win say about us as a nation?]   In 2008, 54 percent of voters reported feeling ""excited"" or ""optimistic"" if Obama won the presidency, and 46 percent said the same of McCain. In 2012, exit pollsters asked only for voters' favorable views of the candidates, and the percentage who saw Romney positively -- 47 percent -- tracked with his overall vote. This year's polls found the exact opposite: A majority of voters, 57 percent, saying that they would have ""negative"" feelings if Trump won, and 53 percent saying that of Clinton. There is no precedent for a candidate winning the presidency with fewer voters viewing him favorably, or looking forward to his administration, than the loser. Moreover, just 40 percent of voters said they had a ""favorable"" opinion of the Republican Party; 47 percent said the same of the Democrats. There is precedent for this. Trump is the first candidate since 2000 to win the presidency while his party lost seats in both houses of Congress. That year, the presidency was not decided until mid-December, and Democrats comfortably argued that President George W. Bush lacked a mandate. But mandate-management, part of every election's next-day spin, seems to have gotten away from the Democrats. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) immediately pronounced a ""mandate"" for Republicans, and Democrats have fitfully proposed ways they could work with the new president. ""If President Trump wants to spend money on helping to rebuild Connecticut's roads and bridges and rail lines, then sign me up,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D) in a statement Wednesday afternoon. ""To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), who in January 2017 is likely to be the most politically popular member of the Democrats' congressional delegation. ""To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him.""   [Vigils and protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory]   The exit polls that reflected Trump's victory also found relatively few points of agreement between the winner and the electorate. Seventy percent of all voters, and 34 percent of Trump voters, said that undocumented immigrants deserved a chance for ""legal status."" Just 41 percent of all voters favored the construction of a wall on the Mexican border, one of Trump's most concrete promises (albeit one many voters admitted to not taking literally). A plurality -- 48 percent of voters -- said that the justice system treats black Americans ""unfairly."" All of that presents Democrats with a branding challenge -- one they no longer have to count on the Hillary Clinton campaign to do for them. Cenk Uygur, the founder and main host of the Young Turks video network, argued that the Clinton campaign bungled by attacking Trump less on economics than on him being ""racist and bigoted and sexist."" They should have run the sort of populist campaign that broke Romney, he said. ""For a lot of voters, that wasn't the bug -- that was the feature,"" said Uygur. ""They should have called him a loser and talked about his six bankruptcies. If those guys who wound up voting in the Rust Belt thought he was pathetic, not just offensive, that's a different ball game. Call him Dangerous Donald? Eh, okay. Call him a bull in a china shop? Sounds good! But if they have a sense this guy is a loser, that would have affected their votes."" Historically, the coverage of a presidential transition and the end of a contentious election sees the victor's favorable rating ticking up. But historically, a candidate like Trump does not win presidential elections. Democrats, who expected to win the election until late Tuesday night, are faced with the unique task of opposing a president most voters did not like, or vote for, but who commands a clear congressional majority. Until late Tuesday night, Republicans thought they might face a similar arrangement, and were preparing to challenge a President Clinton's ""mandate"" with investigations and holds on judicial nominees. It's not clear what Democrats can do with their available tools; it's only clear that they have the opportunity."

Park Geun-hye had to walk past opposition lawmakers holding signs saying ""step down"" to get into the National Assembly on Tuesday, where she made a rare visit to see Chung Sye-kyun, the speaker of South Korea's parliament. ""I came to meet the speaker, as it is my great responsibility to normalize state affairs,"" Park told Chung, from the opposition Minjoo Party, during their 10-minute meeting, according to local reports. Park is fighting for her political life after revelations that she had been taking secret advice from a lifelong friend who has no public policy background. The friend, Choi Soon-sil, used her connections to raise millions of dollars for two foundations and allegedly embezzled the money. Choi is now under arrest, and several of Park's top aides have been detained or are being investigated. Park went on live television twice in 10 days to apologize for her lack of judgment in trusting Choi, the daughter of a cult leader, and the president has replaced some of her senior advisers.   South Korean President Park Geun-hye arrives to meet with National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun at the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea. (Bae Jae-Man/AP)  She also planned to replace her prime minister with Kim Byong-joon, who served as policy chief to a liberal president a decade ago. However, the opposition chafed at the conservative president's ""unilateral"" decision and said it would not confirm Kim. With some lawmakers calling on Park to resign or risk being impeached, politicians from across the political spectrum are urging her to hand over day-to-day management of domestic affairs to a prime minister. Park on Tuesday asked lawmakers to recommend a new candidate for prime minister, saying she would let him run her cabinet. ""If the National Assembly recommends a new prime minister, I will appoint him and let him control the cabinet,"" she said, according to Yonhap News Agency. Her efforts have so far done little, if anything, to assuage public criticism over the way she has operated as president. Park's approval ratings last week plumbed new depths of 5 percent, according to a poll from Gallup Korea. It was the lowest recorded approval rating since South Korea democratized in 1987. Tens of thousands of South Koreans protested in central Seoul on Saturday night for the second week in a row, and organizers said they are planning an even bigger demonstration this weekend.

Here is a look at recent events and possible effects that could shape the territory's relationship with the mainland and its standing as an international finance center long known for stability and calm. ___ MONDAY'S DECISION TO BAR TWO LEGISLATORS China's legislature, the National People's Congress, issued an interpretation of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini constitution, stating that two legislators could not take their seats after refusing to make the official oath of office. According to Beijing-backed Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, it was only the fifth time that China's central government has issued such a ruling since the former British colony reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The NPC Standing Committee would not have taken such a step ""if there was no need for it,"" Leung said Monday following the announcement. Beijing's ruling circumvents a legal challenge filed by the Hong Kong government, which continues despite being rendered essentially moot. ___ BY-ELECTION TO BE HELD IF LAWMAKERS CAN'T TAKE THEIR SEATS A by-election will be held to fill the seats of the two members of the Youthspiration party, Sixtus Leung, 30, and Yau Wai-ching, 25, who altered their oaths to insert a derogatory Japanese expression for China. However, the NPC made no ruling on whether the two could run again for their original seats, and if they were to do so and be successful, ""we could be back where we're at,"" said Simon Young, an associate dean at Hong Kong University's law school. In such a case, Young said, they would likely be wiser in reading their oaths correctly and assuming their positions. ___ REASONS BEHIND CHINA'S DECISION TO INTERVENE China has grown increasingly concerned with an anti-Beijing trend among young Hong Kongers that manifested itself most dramatically in the 2014 Occupy Central protest movement. That action shut down parts of the city for weeks as part of a campaign to demand open nominations for the 2017 election of Hong Kong's chief executive by a small panel of mostly pro-Beijing elites, and inspired a new wave of political awareness among the young. As that movement was unfolding, Chinese President Xi Jinping was presiding over a wide-ranging crackdown on activists and legal professionals on the mainland. With the two legislators' case already in front of a Hong Kong court, the NPC likely ruled out of ""impatience and fear that the court might decide otherwise,"" Young said. ___ REASONS FOR HONG KONG'S YOUTHFUL OPPOSITION MOVEMENT Young Hong Kong residents, some of whom weren't even born when the territory was still a British colony, see little to identify with in the Communist Party and want a democratic process that they can feel part of. At the same time, they are under growing economic pressure and face reduced job opportunities, which they blame in part on heightened competition from the Chinese economic juggernaut. The abduction to the mainland of Hong Kong booksellers who published tomes on sensitive political topics has also raised concerns about new restrictions on freedom of speech and the rise of self-censorship. ___ DIVISIONS LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL Hong Kong faces a crucial test with next year's chief executive selection process, overseen by Beijing at every level. Although Leung Chun-ying is considered a safe bet for another term, he faces increasing competition from within the pro-Beijing camp -- including from other senior government officials. Meanwhile, the Legislative Council remains divided between the opposition which enjoys support from younger voters, and the pro-Beijing establishment rooted in the business community. In the near-term, protests in the chamber are expected to continue. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

China's top legislature effectively disqualified two newly elected Hong Kong lawmakers for failing to take an oath of allegiance to the territory's mini-constitution and instead advocating independence. The move was seen as a major blow to the territory's cherished autonomy and judicial independence. Beijing's decision, flagged in advance, sparked angry protests in Hong Kong on Sunday, with thousands of people taking to the streets in a demonstration reminiscent of the much larger pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in 2014.  Police used batons and pepper spray to beat back protesters, and four people were arrested. The latest troubles in Hong Kong flared after the two elected lawmakers, from a new pro-independence party, altered the oaths administered before taking their seats in the country's Legislative Council -- inserting a disparaging Japanese term for China, vowing to defend the ""Hong Kong nation"" and displaying a flag that read ""Hong Kong is not part of China.""  The oaths were ruled invalid, and attempts to redo them sparked chaos in the legislature.  On Monday, Beijing put its foot down.  [Beijing took a hard line on Hong Kong, and it may have backfired]  The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) issued its own ""interpretation"" of the Basic Law -- Hong Kong's mini-constitution, agreed to during the 1997 handover from British rule -- an interpretation it said was binding on the territory.  Any lawmakers who fail to take the oath of allegiance properly and violate the oath will be disqualified and will face legal consequences, it said. ""Retaking the oath is out of the question once the initial oath-taking process has breached the legal requirements and been ruled invalid,"" said Li Fei, chairman of the NPC's Basic Law Committee. The central government, he said, ""is determined to firmly confront the pro-independence forces without any ambiguity."" Advocating ""separatism"" is not a matter of political opinion but a major legal issue, Li said, and those doing so will need to be punished by law. ""Traitors of the country will not have good endings,"" he said. The question of whether the two lawmakers -- Sixtus Leung, 30, and Yau Wai-ching, 25, of the Youngspiration party -- had the right to retake the oath was already being considered in a court in the southern Chinese territory.  The Hong Kong Bar Association warned last week that any intervention by Beijing would deal a ""severe blow"" to the city's judicial independence and undermine international confidence in its autonomy. Lawyers and barristers are already planning a ""silent march"" through Hong Kong on Tuesday. While the NPC does have the right to interpret the Basic Law, it should not have done so while Hong Kong courts were actively considering the case, argued Johannes Chan, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong.  ""The implication is that 'I don't trust the courts, so I had better tell you what you should decide,' "" he said. ""So why should anyone trust the legal system?"" Hong Kong's independent legal system stands at the heart of the ""one country, two systems"" model under which the territory was granted significant autonomy from Beijing. Beijing's move dealt that model a ""fatal blow,"" Chan said, and set the stage for further confrontation between the pro-democracy and pro-Beijing camps in the weeks ahead. ""I am very pessimistic, and I think it will get worse,"" said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmaker. ""For Beijing, as soon as something starts, they want to shut it down,"" she said. ""This is the act of a coward."" On Sunday, thousands of people marched through Hong Kong to voice their opposition to China's decision to step in, holding signs saying ""Defend the Rule of Law"" and demanding that the territory's Beijing-backed chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, step down. Police put the number at 8,000, but organizers estimated that 13,000 people attended. In the evening, a smaller crowd gathered outside the Chinese government's ""liaison office"" in Hong Kong and was faced by hundreds of helmeted police officers carrying shields. Protesters tried several times to charge through police lines but were forced back, according to news agency reports. Police said they later took action to clear the streets and disperse the protesters. Two police officers were injured, one hit in the leg by a brick thrown from the crowd. Some protesters wore masks and held umbrellas, in a deliberate echo of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, which staged a long sit-in to demand full democracy for the territory.  But the extent of sympathy for the protests this time is unclear. Although many Hong Kongers fiercely guard the territory's autonomy and would like to see greater democracy, only a small minority back the call for independence. Beijing's intervention is likely to anger many Hong Kongers and might swell the protesters' ranks. Others, though, will probably condemn the protesters as troublemakers and dismiss their demands as unrealistic or undesirable. In the South China Morning Post, political editor Gary Cheung wrote last week that the ""antics"" of the two lawmakers ""only play into the hands of Beijing hardliners."" Columnist Alex Lo also complained that their ""childish display of defiance"" would result in a further erosion of the authority of Hong Kong's courts. ""We all know that all-out antagonism of Beijing is just a lose-lose proposition,"" he wrote. Chan, the law professor, said Beijing's response would lead to more polarization of opinion.  ""Very few people support what the two candidates have done, but this interference in the court process also generates a lot of resentment,"" he said.

For months, U.S. Rep. Joseph J. Heck (R) and former state attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto (D) have slugged it out in the most expensive Senate race in this state's history, locked in a tight contest that gives Republicans a chance to steal a Democratic crown jewel: the seat of retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D). A Heck victory would make the tenuous path for Republicans to hold the Senate majority easier to navigate. Democrats need four seats to capture the majority if their presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, wins the White House. Yet despite those high stakes, the Senate race here has often felt like an undercard boxing match on the Las Vegas Strip as everyone awaits the main event between the presidential candidates, Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump, who have campaigned and spent heavily in this key swing state. On a recent Saturday, Cortez Masto bounced around several barbershops here with a large African American clientele. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) was at her side, trying to boost support in populous Clark County.     View Graphic      Some potential voters recognized Booker, who, despite representing a state 2,500 miles away, has a high profile as one of just two black U.S. senators. Most who encountered the pair were like Michelle Monroe, who has been on work disability from her food service job since a 2009 accident. She was unfamiliar with Cortez Masto but said she was all for Clinton and would vote for whomever Clinton wants to replace Reid. ""Oh, I'm excited,"" she said, expressing disgust toward Trump's treatment of women and minorities. ""He's making a mockery of us."" Heck has his own image problems. After three terms representing the Las Vegas suburbs, he is a cipher to some northern and rural voters, usually a bedrock of Republican support. One recent poll, done by CNN, found Heck losing to Cortez Masto 51 percent to 45 percent in Washoe County, home to Reno, where the most recent successful Republican Senate candidate, Dean Heller, won by 12 points in 2012. Even the local media are distracted. When the Senate candidates held their only debate, on a Friday in mid-October, the political press corps hunkered down more than 400 miles away in Carson City, the state capital. That day, the legislature, after a raucous debate, approved a $750 million contribution to build a National Football League-ready stadium in billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson's bid to lure the Oakland Raiders here. The press corps hurried back a few days later for the final Clinton-Trump debate, held on the University of Nevada at Las Vegas campus. The relative anonymity of each Senate candidate makes it more likely that the race could be decided by the respective get-out-the-vote machines. Reid has bequeathed to Cortez Masto his top advisers and their vast experience in providing big wins for President Obama in 2008 and 2012. There are signs in early voting that show Democrats hitting critical levels, particularly among Hispanics. All of this has Cortez Masto and Heck functioning as a generic Democrat and a generic Republican, respectively.   That time Harry Reid found his 1992 picture with Donald Trump at a fundraiser    Heck is trying to take his finely tuned vote operation -- he went from a 2010 win of less than 1 percent to a 24-point victory in 2014, when he received 40 percent of the Hispanic vote -- and expand it statewide. Cortez Masto sounds like any Democrat of the past three years, citing as key issues comprehensive immigration legislation, raising the minimum wage and pay equity for female workers. Heck points to the economy and government regulations, along with increasing health-care premiums after the 2010 Affordable Care Act and fighting the Islamic State as the top issues -- a list almost any Republican would tout. Heck, a brigadier general and doctor in the Army Reserve, did break ranks with Trump after the revelation last month of a 2005 video showing Trump boasting about his aggressive unwanted advances on women. A week later, Heck announced at the debate that his wife had been the victim of domestic abuse in a previous relationship and that Trump's comments hit too close to home. ""This decision was made for a deeply personal reason,"" Heck said the next day in a roundtable interview with reporters. But Heck declined to detail his wife's experience, and Democrats continue to accuse him of political expediency. ""He can come up with any explanation, but it's not going to take away from the fact that this is a last-minute effort to save his career,"" Cortez Masto said in an interview. ""That's clearly what it is."" The decision to distance himself from Trump has helped Heck with highly educated voters in the Las Vegas suburbs such as Art Gisi, 70, a retired AT&T technician and his wife, Cathie Lynn Gisi, 65, a teacher at the local community college. They came away completely offended by Trump after seeing him locally in 2011 when he floated the idea of a presidential candidacy.  ""I never heard the f-word so much in my life,"" Cathie Lynn Gisi recalled during an interview in Heck's campaign office before she went out to volunteer. ""Could you imagine him doing a State of the Union address? We'd have to censor it.""   Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005   But Republican strategists say that Heck's retreat from his party's nominee has contributed to his underperformance in northern counties. He has tried to make up for that by bringing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to campaign with him there, as well as Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). Heck largely shunned appearances with Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), who is easily the most popular figure in Nevada but has earned the enmity of far-right activists for his bipartisan legislation to raise taxes for education funding. Democrats privately acknowledged that Cortez Masto has problems with key liberal constituencies, and her campaign responded by importing Democratic stars. She has appeared with Vice President Biden, first lady Michelle Obama, President Obama and Clinton. Cortez Masto even benefited from pop star Katy Perry knocking on campus doors at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas trying to turn out young voters for the Democratic ticket. The state has been notoriously difficult to poll, both because its burgeoning Hispanic population is so new to Nevada and difficult to reach and because the Las Vegas nightlife industry has so many workers with unusually timed shifts. That has resulted in divergent surveys: A CNN poll found Cortez Masto leading by seven percentage points in mid-October. A week later, an NBC News-Wall Street Journal-Marist poll found Heck leading by the same margin. All sides agree that the race could tilt either way, and in another sign of their low profiles, each is focusing on someone else in the waning days. Heck and his allies have aimed squarely at Reid, the most divisive figure in Nevada politics. ""He's extremely unpopular,"" Heck said. Some Republicans say polling shows voters split evenly on Reid, but it is a sharp divide, as most either love or hate him. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC allied with GOP leaders, poured millions of dollars into a late advertising fray linking Reid to his understudy: ""Don't let Harry Reid force another political failure on Nevada."" Cortez Masto sometimes sounds as if she is running against Trump. Her campaign needs a big turnout from minority voters, and she uses Heck's congressional votes to tell voters that he will not be on their side. ""Everything he has done in Congress, his votes and his record, show just the opposite, and they know that -- and it's Donald Trump's rhetoric,"" she said.  "
