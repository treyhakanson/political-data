The Arizona Daily Sun (https://goo.gl/JYfKVa ) reported that Marissa Morris said she did not assault Officer Jeff Bonar, who was placed on administrative after the incident Wednesday incident while police internal affairs and criminal investigations are conducted.  ""After he hit me, I was blown away,"" Morris told the newspaper. ""I couldn't believe it. I didn't know why it was happening to me, why he would do such a thing to me. I did nothing wrong to deserve that."" The incident occurred as the 30-year-old Morris and her boyfriend were being evicted. She was arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault and of resisting arrest. Police have said Bonar knew of arrest warrants for Morris in previous DUI cases but that police determined after Wednesday's incident that those warrants were no longer active.  ""I did exactly what I was supposed to do to take care of my warrants previously,"" Morris said. ""I couldn't believe it."" Morris is heard on the video telling Bonar that there were no active warrants for her arrest. In his police report, Bonar said Morris started running, so he grabbed her to prevent her from escaping. Danny Paredes, the brother-in-law of Morris' boyfriend, took the video and shared it on Facebook. Morris was released from custody Thursday after making an initial court appearance. A police department spokesman, Sgt. Cory Runge, said Bonar was equipped with a body camera but did not have it activated when he made contact with Morris or when he punched her. He did activate his camera after Morris had been placed in handcuffs, Runge said.  ""Officer Bonar's failure to activate the camera prior to the incident will also be addressed during the internal affairs investigation into his actions,"" Runge said in a statement. A neighbor who saw the scuffle said she Morris should have let the officer arrest her to avoid the altercation.  ""Dragging your feet and flinging your arms -- that's what I saw,"" Loretta Lee told KPNX-TV (https://goo.gl/DQfySQ . "" She added that it took three officers ""to get her to the car.

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)  Vice President-elect Mike Pence may be the most important member of the incoming administration, if only because is one of the few people in President-elect Donald Trump's inner circle who has any idea what he is doing. The Wall Street Journal reports: ""It is clear that he is going to be a very important conduit for members of the House,"" Rep. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.), one of Mr. Trump's earliest congressional supporters, said after the meeting with Mr. Pence. ""His affection for the institution, his relationship with the speaker and many in the room was probably the core of much of his message today."" ... Mr. Pence's high-profile role leading the transition team is a signal to lawmakers ""that he will be a player in this administration and not simply take on some ceremonial role where he's really outside the decision-making circle,"" said Rep. Mike Coffman (R., Colo.), who had vowed to stand up to Mr. Trump during the campaign. Mr. Pence told lawmakers to ""buckle up,"" Mr. Coffman said. Pence's most important role may be as a guide and early warning alarm for the new president. Trump has little ""feel"" for government or appreciation for how difficult it is to get others to do what you want. He has a combative relationship with the media, a vindictive personality and a shocking lack of knowledge about the world and public policy. Put that together and you have a president essentially flying blind. Given all that, what should Pence be telling his boss? First, the concern about Trump's businesses and conflicts of interest is not simply liberal chatter. The problem is real, and Pence should point Trump to the voice of the GOP business establishment, the Wall Street Journal editorial board, which recommends Trump liquidate his company: Mr. Trump could put the cash proceeds in a true blind trust. The Trump children can keep the assets in their name, and he can transfer more to them as long as he pays a hefty gift tax. Finally, Mr. Trump should stipulate that he and his children will have no communication about family business matters. The alternatives are fraught, perhaps even for the Trump Organization's bottom line: Thanks to a Clinton Administration precedent, Presidents can face litigation in private matters--so the company will become a supermagnet for lawsuits. Rudy Giuliani lamented on television that divestment would put the Trump children ""out of work,"" but reorganizing the company may be better for business than unending scrutiny from the press. Progressive groups will soon be out of power and they are already shouting that the Trump family wants to profit from the Presidency. The political damage to a new Administration could be extensive. If Mr. Trump doesn't liquidate, he will be accused of a pecuniary motive any time he takes a policy position. For example, the House and Senate are eager to consider tax reform--and one sticking point will be the treatment of real estate, which will be of great interest to the Trump family business. Ditto for repealing the Dodd-Frank financial law, interest rates and so much more. Trump does not want to do this, but it is up to Pence to warn the president that this, more than any other issue, could alienate his base and throw his presidency into a tailspin. Second, Pence should implore Trump to hold down the number of appointees who are inflammatory, scandal-plagued campaign cronies. Stephen K. Bannon and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn have used up his quota. What Trump needs are low-key, competent and widely respected figures -- such as Pence! -- to actually do the work and calm domestic and foreign allies. Trump would be wise to pick a foreign policy heavyweight (e.g. Mitt Romney, John Bolton, Sen. Bob Corker, retired Gen. David Petraeus) for State and a respected figure (e.g. former Sen. James M. Talent) to head up the Pentagon, someone who can reassure the generals Trump has insulted (and balance out the intemperate Flynn). Third, Pence needs to get the president-elect -- with a crane if that's what it takes -- out of Trump Tower and into Washington, D.C., where his new job is. Staying in his business office conveys skittishness (Trump has to be in his own bed each night?) and highlights the conflict of interest between his business interests and the presidency. Remaining holed up in his golden tower begins at some point to look weird, downright nutty, in fact. Fourth, Pence should tell Trump and his minions to stop acting like Hispanics, Muslims, civil libertarians and others he demeaned have no reason to be worried. Of course they do. Trump can take ownership of his campaign comments, convey he is now serious about governance and pledge to protect all Americans' Constitutional rights (not only the Second Amendment but the First, Fifth, 14th, etc.). His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and the rest of his staff should never tell critics not to peacefully protest or vent their discontent. For goodness' sake, Trump now is the president-elect of the United States, not a thuggish real estate operator; his staff should act like it."

Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) has used his perch on the House Intelligence Committee to attack major pillars of President Obama's foreign policy agenda, including the nuclear deal with Iran. Just hours before his name surfaced as Trump's CIA nominee, Pompeo tweeted that he looked forward to ""rolling back this disastrous deal with the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism.""  [Iran nuclear deal could collapse under Trump]  In closed-door briefings on Capitol Hill, Pompeo has been an intense critic of a covert CIA program to train and arm moderate rebel forces in Syria, according to U.S. officials who said that dismantling the program -- or at least subjecting it to a major re-evaluation -- would likely be at the top of his agenda if he is confirmed. Pompeo, 52, has no meaningful experience in espionage issues beyond his relatively brief stint as a member of the House Intelligence Committee. But he has earned a reputation as a serious student of national security issues who finished first in his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served as a cavalry officer in the Army and earned a law degree from Harvard.      Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet  Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that Pompeo is not widely known among the CIA rank and file but that his nomination was greeted at least initially as a reassuring development at a spy agency that has been treated largely with disdain by Trump. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who has sparred with Pompeo on Benghazi and other issues, gave the selection tempered praise in a statement released Friday.  ""Mike is very bright and hard-working and will devote himself to helping the agency develop the best possible intelligence for policymakers,"" Schiff said. ""While we have had our share of strong differences -- principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi -- I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA Director."" Pompeo's congressional background raised early comparisons to that of Porter Goss, who was plucked from the House Intelligence Committee by then-President George W. Bush to lead the CIA and was forced to resign two years later after a turbulent tenure during which one of his principal executives was convicted of corruption charges. Pompeo's ties to the arch-conservative tea party movement and scant background on intelligence issues were also cited as a cause for concern among some CIA veterans. ""The tea party owns the drones now,"" one official said, referring to the agency's involvement in lethal drone strikes against terrorist groups in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. But former senior CIA officials expressed guarded optimism that Pompeo's ideological bent can be tempered by the analytic approach he has brought to difficult security subjects.   Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), who has been nominated to lead the CIA by Donald Trump, speaks on Capitol Hill in October 2015. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)  ""I'm heartened by the choice,"" said former CIA director Michael V. Hayden, who has been a staunch critic of Trump on security matters. ""I would recommend that when he goes to Langley he get out of the car by himself and embrace the workforce,"" Hayden said, alluding to the rocky tenure of previous directors who arrived with entourages and agendas that put them at odds with the agency's powerful and entrenched directorate of spies. In some ways, Pompeo is already part of the intelligence inner circle in Washington. He attended a dinner this week with CIA Director John Brennan at the home of former Republican congressman Mike Rogers, who had previously been seen as a leading candidate for the CIA job under Trump. The gathering included cast and producers of the CIA-themed show ""Homeland,"" according to a person familiar with the event. Brennan has led a major bureaucratic overhaul of the agency over the past year, a reorganization designed to replicate the structure of the agency's Counterterrorism Center. Pompeo would face decisions on whether to preserve those changes. Pompeo emerged as a surprise pick for Trump. His name had not surfaced in the flurry of postelection rumors that had largely focused on other potential nominees, including Rogers, who was ousted from the Trump transition team this week, and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the current chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who reportedly turned down a chance at the CIA job. Pompeo reportedly has close ties to the Koch family, Kansas billionaires who have devoted a considerable part of their wealth to advancing a deeply conservative agenda and driving Democrats out of office. Articles in Kansas papers indicate that Pompeo built much of his wealth with investment funds from Koch industries and that his campaigns for Congress have been backed by Koch money. In just five years in Congress, he has built a political following by staking extreme positions in polarizing debates. He has called for Snowden to face the death penalty and for Clinton to be barred from receiving classified information.  Pompeo was one of the more outspoken Republican members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, saying that the Obama administration was guilty of a scandal ""worse than Watergate."" When the committee concluded its final report in July, Pompeo and a fellow member, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), released a 48-page annex charging ""failure at the most senior levels of government"" and calling for additional information on what Pompeo said was the administration's intentional misrepresentation and concealment of facts. During hearings, his questions to administration witnesses were often among the most accusatory. In October 2015, when Clinton testified for the second time, Pompeo grilled her on her relationship with slain U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. He asked a series of rapid-fire questions about why Stevens did not have her personal telephone number, did not know her personal home address and had never ""stopped by your house."" Separately, in remarks that drew sharp criticism from U.S. Muslim organizations, Pompeo said that Muslim leaders who fail to denounce acts of terrorism done in the name of Islam were ""potentially complicit"" in the attacks.  Pompeo led congressional attacks on the nuclear accord Obama reached with Iran last year, accusing the administration of hiding ""secret side deals"" from the public, allegations rejected by the White House. At the same time, it is not clear whether Pompeo will be in agreement with the most extreme positions taken by his new bosses, Trump and his designated national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.  Trump has called for the CIA to resume the use of waterboarding and other interrogation measures widely condemned as torture. Trump has derided the quality of the intelligence from the nation's spy community, publicly belittling a multiagency conclusion that Russia used cyberespionage methods to interfere in the U.S. election. Pompeo is not known to have publicly backed those positions and in some cases has articulated views that would seem at odds with those of the Trump team. In a speech delivered in Kansas last year after returning from a trip to the Middle East, Pompeo cautioned against equating all Muslims with terrorism, saying that a ""line needs to be drawn between those who are on the side of extremism and those who are fighting against them.""

(Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press)  Sixty percent of Russians believe that Internet censorship -- in particular, the banning of certain websites and material -- is necessary, according to a new poll. Just 25 percent opposed the idea; the rest of the respondents didn't know or declined to answer. The poll was conducted by the Levada Center, an independent polling firm, which asked Russians questions about trust in media and censorship between Oct. 21 to 24. On the subject of political censorship, 32 percent of Russians said that denying access to certain websites would infringe upon the rights and freedoms of activists, while 44 percent said it did not and 24 percent could not answer. More broadly, Russians seem to be generally skeptical about the Internet, Levada found, with 51 percent believing the Internet could not replace newspapers, radio and television -- roughly the same figure as when the question was last asked in 2006. And while 56 percent of respondents said that they fully or mostly trusted the news they saw on Russian television channels, only 37 percent said the same about news they saw on the Internet. In total, 35 percent of Russians thought the media was deceiving them frequently, while 49 percent said they felt that way only rarely. The role of the Internet in modern media has become a matter of global debate in recent months, with some in the U.S. suggesting that online outlets that purposely publish fake news had an effect on the outcome of the recent presidential elections. However, in countries such as Russia, where most mainstream news networks are strongly aligned with the government, opposition groups have been able to organize and spread criticism of the government through online media. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the country does not have the legal authority to ban websites. Though some smaller websites have been blocked at some points, experts doubted Russia had the capability to implement more widespread online censorship. There have been a number of recent signs that the country may be rethinking its approach, however. In April, Konstantin Malofeev, a wealthy businessman with links to the Kremlin who runs the pro-censorship lobbying group Safe Internet League, traveled to China to meet with the architects of that country's notorious ""great firewall."" And this week the country moved to block the professional networking site LinkedIn as it did not house data about its Russian users within the country, a charge that could also be levied at other major international social networks like Twitter and Facebook. Polling by Levada and other organizations in Russia has long shown widespread support for Internet censorship. According to a study conducted in May 2014 by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTsIOM), 59 percent of Russians believed that websites that showed gay pornographic content should be censored by the government, while 46 percent said social networks that allowed people to organize anti-government protests should be censored and 45 percent said the videos by the anti-government art group Pussy Riot should be banned.

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2016/11/02/how-south-korea-can-weather-park-geun-hyes-existential-crisis/	How South Korea can weather Park Geun-hye’s existential crisis	"   South Korean President Park Geun-hye bows before releasing a statement of apology to the public during a news conference last month at the Presidential Blue House in Seoul. (Baek Seung-ryeol/Yonhap via Reuters)  Chung Min Lee is a contributing columnist for Global Opinions and a professor of international relations at the Graduate School of International Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. South Korea is in the midst of an unprecedented political crisis, the worst since the restoration of democracy in 1987. The latest flare-up could potentially result in President Park Geun-hye's resignation, a profoundly damaged and irreparably weakened presidency, a massive altering of the political landscape more than a year before the next presidential election in December 2017, and a growing impetus to revise the 1987 constitution. On Monday, longtime presidential confidant Choi Soon-sil was arrested by the Supreme Prosecutors' Office after revelations that she was deeply involved in affairs of state without any formal role in the Park administration. Indeed, the local press has dubbed Choi the ""President of the Night"" to highlight her behind-the-scenes influence in shaping critical national policies, creating new policy initiatives, planting her cronies in ministries and agencies, enriching her family and her associates through lucrative government contracts and real estate purchases, and twisting the arms of leading Korean conglomerates to ""donate"" millions of dollars to two foundations that she spearheaded. Her late father, Choi Tae-min, was a con artist-cum-cult leader who befriended Park when her mother was assassinated in 1974. While rumors have always persisted about the elder Choi's influence on Park, no one really knew the true depth of Park's reliance on the Choi family over the past four decades -- until now. While it is nearly impossible to see any upsides in this cascading crisis, the sky isn't falling. South Koreans will pull through this, but only if members of the entrenched political class -- foremost among them Park and her supporters in the ruling party but also key leaders in the opposition -- realize that they must take courageous measures, including forsaking political power. For Park, it means that until the Supreme Prosecutors' Office completes its investigation and releases its findings, she must recuse herself from domestic affairs, resign from the ruling party and announce a supra-national, neutral cabinet. On Wednesday, the president appointed a former high-ranking official in the Roh Moo-hyun government, Kim Byung-joon, as prime minister. In response, opposition parties have all announced their unwillingness to open hearings to confirm the prime minister-designate. Although her term ends in February 2018, an exasperated public and key members of the opposition have called on Park to resign immediately. Such a move would be emotionally satisfying, but it won't resolve the ongoing crisis. Indeed, developments over the next several weeks will determine whether the only way forward is for Park to resign. But even if she steps down, she must do so after the machinery of government is fully restored. South Korea can't be run like a banana republic. The ruling and opposition parties have to leave aside the burning question of which party's candidate is likely to win the next presidential election and instead concentrate their efforts on ensuring that a bipartisan cabinet not only takes office but also functions with their full blessing and support. The two key opposition parties -- the Minjoo Party and the People's Party -- rather than doing everything possible to decimate Park's already damaged credibility and belittling the free-falling ruling party -- must act as though they are in power. And most critically, there has to be a solid political consensus that a new bipartisan cabinet will be able to fully address the growing nuclear threat from North Korea and maintain critical tenets of Korean foreign policy. Regardless of how the crisis ultimately unfolds, three critical dimensions must be addressed if South Korea emerges stronger from the current crisis. First and foremost, once a clear picture emerges on the magnitude of the damage that was sown by Choi, her wide web of cronies and the former Park officials who facilitated Choi's shadow cabinet, Park must assume full political responsibility. According to polls conducted by the Munwha Ilbo, 36 percent of respondents said that Park should resign, while 12 percent responded that she should be impeached. But because Park's approval rating has already dipped below 10 percent, if she can't turn the tide, she should step down gracefully. Second, while there is every reason to believe that the public mood has turned decisively against Park, the opposition is mistaken if it believes that anti-Park sentiment is going to translate automatically into support for the opposition. It is far from certain whether key figures such as Moon Jae-in, the former leader of the Minjoo party who lost to Park in the 2012 presidential election and who is a leading contender for the presidency, will emerge unscathed from the ongoing scandal. Specifically, if Moon continues to exploit the current crisis to capitalize on his own presidential aspirations rather than acting like a statesman of a loyal opposition during a period of unprecedented political uncertainty, South Korean voters won't support him in 2017. As much as the South Korean public is deeply disappointed in Park Geun-hye (even Park's die-hard supporters are wondering whether she can remain in office), it doesn't mean that Moon Jae-in, Ahn Cheol-soo (head of the People's Party) or Park Won-soon (mayor of Seoul) are automatic shoo-ins for the presidency. Third, ""Choi Soon-sil Gate"" provides a genuine opportunity to re-engineer South Korean politics so that the current five-year single term presidency is relegated to the history books with the crafting of a new constitution. The current constitution was introduced in 1987, when South Korea was transitioning from authoritarian rule to democratic governance and when virtually everyone agreed that a single five-year presidential term was the most effective way of preventing a return to authoritarian politics. But South Korea needs a new constitution that strengthens checks and balances while providing greater power to the National Assembly. South Koreans have to also understand that regardless of how the Park presidency ends, South Korea has to contend with several parallel challenges: Kim Jong Un's determination to increase North Korea's nuclear arsenal in the world's last remaining totalitarian state, maximizing South Korea's strategic leverage and defense capabilities in the face of mounting Chinese political and military pressure, the need to manage Seoul's critical U.S. alliance with a new administration in Washington, and remaking Asia's fourth-largest economy into a more competitive powerhouse. A Korean proverb reminds us that each crisis opens the window to new opportunities, and the spiraling scandal in the Park administration is not an exception. And no one has a greater obligation than Park Geun-hye to show the South Korean people that her final duty as president is not to cling to power, but to ensure that the democratic process will become stronger and much more resilient, even if it means stepping down from office. That would be a legacy that all South Koreans would support, even if they remain deeply disappointed at the failings of the Park presidency."
