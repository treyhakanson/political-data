Trump Tower, always a popular spot for visitors, has become even more of a spectacle since Election Day, with the selfie stick-toting thatch of gawkers mixing with, and sometimes posing with, the heavily armed police.  ""OK, you've got your picture, now move along,"" one officer repeated as he stood guard along a Fifth Avenue that has come to resemble its new nickname: Fort Trump. But new metal and concrete barricades, scores of police, and pedestrian checkpoints have done little this week to stop the crowds from gathering 26 floors below where Trump has been holed up interviewing potential cabinet candidates and planning his new administration.  ""It's history in the making,"" said Steve O'Neill, a 54-year-old police lieutenant from Tyngsborough, Massachusetts, who made the pilgrimage in part to drop off a photo he had taken with Trump during a campaign stop. ""He told us if he became president, we could come and have it signed. So we left it with the guard."" Connie Hunt, a 54-year-old real estate agent from London, Kentucky, said she came to New York to see her beloved Kentucky Wildcats play basketball at Madison Square Garden, but made time for a trip to her chosen candidate's famous home.  ""I love 'The Apprentice' the show. He's just famous. He's more famous than a politician,"" Hunt said. ""He's successful in everything he's done and I just wanted to see what he's built, what he's accomplished, instead of seeing it on TV."" Twenty-year-old Leigh Stolarz, of West Palm Beach, Florida, said she was outraged by Trump's victory, finding it unbelievable that someone with his attitude toward women and immigrants could be elected president. But she said she came to the tower anyway, in part to see how people were reacting. Her own reaction was similar to the thousands of the Trump Tower selfies that have populated Twitter, Facebook and Instagram since Election Day: a disgusted look, rolling eyes and an extended middle finger.  ""It seemed like a step back for us when we'd made so many progressive steps,"" Stolarz said. ""I feel like he doesn't represent our country."" Such opponents found a kindred spirt in Paul Rossen, who has stood outside Trump Tower five hours a day, five days a week for the past six months selling anti-Trump pins. He used to sell pins that said ""Dump Trump,"" but since the election he has switched to black pins with a white silhouette of Trump and the words ""Not My President.""  ""The main thing about the protests and this is, it's very good group therapy,"" he said. ""It's a cathartic form of saying, 'I will not submit,' even though we have no choice."" Tourists from outside the United States also stopped by to wonder how the new American president would affect them back home. Standing across the street from Trump Tower, 48-year-old businesswoman Dorotea Bustamante, of Coahuila, Mexico, recalled Trump's campaign rhetoric about her home country.  ""He can't judge all of us as criminals because we're not,"" Bustamante said in Spanish. ""He has to judge each person by their actions."" But she tried to stay optimistic that President Trump might be different than candidate Trump: ""He just might surprise me."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Republican Donald Trump was chosen by an electorate that through its votes supported xenophobia, racism, religious intolerance and even disdain for the disabled. It is not politics as usual for a candidate to demean women.  You cannot separate the candidate from the voter. Any voter who felt comfortable voting for someone who boasted about grabbing women's crotches is not anyone I care to even acknowledge. Nope. It's time to stay strong for my friends who have been victims of Mr. Trump's hate. I don't see those who voted for Mr. Trump as American casualties. They have been duped by a man who lacks a sense of boundaries and morals. Perhaps they should be pitied, but they don't deserve to be embraced. Respecting another's opinion is one thing; rewarding bad behavior is something else.    Pamela Kincheloe, Manassas                   During this presidential campaign, the Republican nominee aligned himself with the leader of Russia while openly calling the president of the United States incompetent and stupid. The Republican nominee, with whom white supremacy groups aligned, maligned women, Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims. The battle cries ""We want our country back,"" ""Make America great again"" and ""Build the wall"" are laced with the flames of bigotry and hatred.  In the aftermath of the election, the political pollsters and reporters ponder how their estimates could have been so inaccurate. As during the campaign, there is the failure to acknowledge the obvious: A racism-based campaign was waged, and racism trumped qualification in the end.  Now I am being asked to ""unite."" Did the Republican Party ""unite"" and allow President Obama to lead when he was elected in 2008? No. It questioned the legitimacy of Mr. Obama as a U.S. citizen. It became the ""party of no"" and opposed everything the president proposed. Republicans now seek to overturn initiatives supported by Mr. Obama. And I am expected to join hands with them now.   J.C.

And corporate America and lawmakers are salivating at the prospect of a windfall. ""Infrastructure"" is ""the happiest word in American politics,"" said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank. At least for now. A presidential transition website this week said Trump will invest about $550 billion in new projects. But he hasn't spelled out his priorities. Nor is it clear how much of that total would be new federal spending and how much would come from the private sector. And Congress might have its own ideas. Two of Trump's advisers, Wilbur Ross, a private-equity investor, and Peter Navarro, a University of California at Irvine business professor, released an analysis Oct. 27 suggesting that the federal government could provide tax credits -- a form of subsidy -- to investors in infrastructure and recapture lost revenue through taxes on higher wages and contractor profits. The credits would cover $137 billion, or 82 percent, of the equity investment needed for $1 trillion of infrastructure, according to the analysis. If Trump relies too heavily on the private sector, though, his initiative could fall far short of the new investment that businesses and economists say is desperately needed. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, the average age of U.S. infrastructure -- including water and sewer facilities, streets and highways, and electric power plants -- is two to three decades and has increased steadily since the late 1960s. For the time being, however, infrastructure spending has become a rallying cry. In his acceptance speech Wednesday morning, Trump again pledged to make such spending a top priority. ""We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,"" Trump said. ""We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it."" Marcia Hale, president of Building America's Future, a group representing a variety of city and state officials and former officials, called on Trump to make an infrastructure plan part of his first 100 days in office. ""The president-elect is a builder at heart. A developer,"" Hale said. ""Every president who goes through that door is hit with stuff that he is not familiar with. This is the one thing he knows. This is a passion for him, and he's very comfortable in this space.""   Plans to boost government infrastructure spending have been on the table for years. In his fiscal year 2016 budget proposal, for example, President Obama asked Congress to support a $478 billon, six-year public-works plan for roads, railroads and ports. He tried to bundle that with business tax reform. Funding for the infrastructure plan would have been offset with the windfall from a temporary tax adjustment that would have encouraged corporations to bring back profits parked overseas. But Republicans in Congress, who said they were concerned about the federal deficit, blocked Obama's proposals. Those lawmakers could prove an obstacle for Trump, too. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) favors linking infrastructure plans to comprehensive tax reform.        Meanwhile, leading economists have made the case for more infrastructure spending. ""Economists and politicians of all persuasions recognize that this can create quality jobs and provide economic stimulus without posing the risks of easy-money policies in the short run,"" Lawrence Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and as an economic adviser to Obama, wrote in September. ""They also see that such investment can expand the economy's capacity in the medium term and mitigate the huge maintenance burden we would otherwise pass on to the next generation."" By increasing the economy's productivity, infrastructure spending also boosts tax revenue.   But Harvard economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw cautions against possible waste. ""The term 'infrastructure' is broad, encompassing everything from useful public capital to bridges to nowhere,"" he said. ""Bridges to nowhere can create jobs in the short run, but they are still not worth spending taxpayer dollars on.""         Traditional infrastructure companies stand to benefit. Shares of heavy-equipment-maker Caterpillar climbed more than 10 percent this week. Chicago Bridge & Iron shares rose 5.3 percent. Fluor, a construction firm, was up 9.7 percent. Energy infrastructure would be another winner. Trump has said he will support oil and gas pipelines, including the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which Obama rejected. That's welcome news for the members of North America's Building Trades Unions, half of whom spend at least part of the year working on energy projects, including pipelines, wind turbines and petrochemical plants. Since the election, the chief executives overseeing three stalled energy projects have called NABTU President Sean McGarvey to say that they hoped to proceed and that the union would be supportive. ""Clinton's program was pretty detailed. President-elect Trump's is not,"" McGarvey said. ""But he talked about one bigger and huger than hers. We take him at his word that he's going to pursue it. We'll be supportive in any way we can.""    "

At least for a while.	"  MOSCOW -- For all the misgivings about Donald Trump's penchant for saying things Vladimir Putin wants to hear, there is one possible positive outcome of the ""bromance"" between the president-elect and the Russian leader.  It could make the world a safer place. At least for the next few months.  Call it a game of Russian reset. Like just about everyone else, Moscow was preparing for Hillary Clinton to win, which in the short term meant trying to delegitimize her victory by claiming the vote was rigged -- the Kremlin had even lined up a postelection news conference with its top human rights official to pan U.S. democracy as a sham. With Clinton, an intractable foe, in the Oval Office, Moscow would have had no reason to ease up on its brinkmanship in the Baltics, the bloody, road-to-nowhere standoff in Ukraine, and the vicious bombing campaign to wipe out resistance to Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, all coated in Cold War-style rhetoric and nuclear saber-rattling.  Instead? Trump is headed to the White House. He never once expressed interest in containing or contesting Russian influence in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and offered to at least discuss Kremlin wish-list items such as lifting sanctions or recognizing the annexation of Crimea. And Putin, some analysts say, has no reason to dissuade the Republican of his willingness to deal before he takes office; in the short run, the Russian leader could decide to substitute his trademark unpredictability with diplomacy. ""With a reset White House, Russia can seek its goals through diplomacy, rather than secret operations like landing troops in Syria overnight,"" said Vladimir Frolov, a Moscow-based foreign policy analyst. ""The important thing for Russia is to not be in the news for some massacre.""  [Aleppo residents in rebel-held areas wary of Russian-Syrian humanitarian pause]  Frolov and other analysts are quick to clarify that any softening of Russian aggression will only last as long as Moscow believes something can be gained from dealing with Trump.  ""My guess is that they will want to test the extent to which Trump will follow through on his rhetoric that places like Ukraine and the Baltics are not in the zone of U.S. vital interests by offering a 'sphere of influence' deal where they [Russians] can happily dominate their neighborhood in exchange for an end to confrontational rhetoric and efforts to destabilize Western European countries [plus cooperation in Syria],"" Dmitry Gorenburg, a senior research scientist for CNA, a nonprofit research organization in Arlington, Va., wrote in an email. Since the election, Russian officials have expressed guarded optimism that they will be able to deal with Trump. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, gushed that ""It is phenomenal how close they are to one another when it comes to their conceptual approach to foreign policy,"" while at the same time warning that establishing mutual trust could take years, according to Reuters. ""We shouldn't expect love or gifts from Trump,"" tweeted Alexei Pushkov, a member of Russia's upper house of parliament. ""He's a patriot and a businessman. But he's not an ideologue, he's a realist. And a realist understands the language of deals.""     In Mexico, China, Russia and Israel we ask people what they think of the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)   But each area where Putin would try to deal with Trump comes with a set of built-in snags. In Syria, the Obama administration has supported more moderate forces allied against Assad, and wants the Syrian leader to step aside in favor of a negotiated settlement. Putin, who committed himself to supporting Assad's regime, faces a choice between going for the all-out victory over rebel forces that Assad wants and some of his generals say is possible, or waiting for Trump. The Republican might be ""more amenable to accepting Russia's view that Assad should stay at least until ISIS and al-Qaeda are defeated in Syria,"" said Simon Saradzhyan, the founding director of the Russia Matters Project at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.  But for such a deal to work, Russia would have to be able to control Assad and persuade him to accept something less than an all-out victory. In Europe, Trump has raised expectations that he would reassess the U.S. commitment to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. In July, he said he ""would be looking into"" the possibility of recognizing Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, as Russian territory.  [Russia celebrates Crimea annexation while Ukraine looks to West for support]  Russia became alarmed about Ukraine's direction after anti-government protesters forced the ouster of its president in 2014 following his refusal to sign a pro-E.U. trade deal. Moscow had also viewed Ukraine's interest in joining NATO as unacceptable. Russia has backed a subsequent rebellion in eastern Ukraine, prompting the U.S. and European governments to broaden sanctions on Moscow initially imposed because of Crimea.    Trump's ""criticism of NATO indicates he may be far less enthusiastic about further expansion of the alliance into the former Soviet neighborhood, which Russia views as a grave threat to its security,"" Saradzhyan said. Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at the Belfer Center, said a solution for Ukraine that Putin might pursue, and Trump might accept, could involve a new effort to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine in return for lifting most of the sanctions. But the deal ""would likely depend on a Ukrainian commitment to remain a neutral and nonaligned state,"" a condition Kiev has not indicated it would accept. Russian analysts worry further about the hard-line stance toward Russia reflected in the names reportedly in the mix for Trump's foreign policy team -- a report by Politico included former House speaker Newt Gingrich; John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  ""These names make me sick,"" said Sergei Markov, an outspoken pro-Kremlin political analyst. And then there is Trump himself. Nothing he said in the election campaign amounted to a promise. All of his campaign talk about willingness to deal with Russia could be just that -- talk. As much as the Obama administration accused Russia of meddling in the election in favor or Trump, it is plausible that the Kremlin was not hoping for a Trump win. It is hard to know how a President Trump would react the first time a U.S. carrier gets buzzed in the Baltics or the first time his Congress pushes back over Ukraine. ""Unpredictability is Russia's most effective foreign policy tool,"" Frolov said. ""But it's also Trump's.""

When President Barack Obama tried to do it, a Republican Congress fought him at almost every turn, and Trump would have to contend with his party's deep-seated dislike for government spending and higher taxes to meet the $1 trillion tab for his proposals. But Trump has been vague what about he'd do and what it would cost. During the campaign he said he'd double the $275 billion boost in government infrastructure spending proposed by his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. A recent paper by Trump advisers calls for using federal tax credits to generate $1 trillion in private sector infrastructure investment over a decade. To offset the cost of the credits, U.S. corporations would be encouraged to bring home profits parked overseas to avoid taxes, in exchange for a low tax rate. ___ US stocks close mostly higher as Dow sets record high It was perhaps the most surprising trade in a record-setting week on Wall Street: How quickly investors swapped presidential pre-election jitters for enthusiasm at Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. That enthusiasm -- call it the Trump rally -- ultimately propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to consecutive all-time highs this week and gave the Standard and Poor's 500 index its biggest weekly gain in two years. The rally lost some steam Friday, pulling the S&P 500 slightly lower. ___ After election, are shoppers ready to think about holidays? NEW YORK -- The uncertainty surrounding who will be the next U.S. president is over. But with people still bitterly divided, are they ready to think about a holiday shopping season that thrives on feelings of joy and peace? Reports from retailers, including department stores like Kohl's, Macy's and J.C. Penney, showed that shoppers had been starting to step up their spending in the weeks leading up to the election won by Republican Donald Trump. And the companies are generally optimistic about a good holiday season, pointing to higher wages for workers and leaner inventories. ___ Chinese e-shoppers spend billions on Singles Day In a bright spot for China's cooling economy, online shoppers spent billions of dollars Friday on ""Singles Day,"" a quirky holiday that has grown into the world's busiest day for e-commerce. The country's biggest e-commerce brand, Alibaba Group, said sales by the thousands of retailers on its platforms passed 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) after 19 hours of the event. That is four times the $3 billion research firm comScore says Americans spent in total last year on Cyber Monday, the country's biggest online shopping day. Rivals including JD.com, VIP.com and Suning offered deep discounts on clothing, smartphones, travel packages and other goods to attract shoppers. ___ Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election NEW YORK -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is ""crazy."" Still, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media, mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets -- whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. Sources of spurious information has ranged from news articles produced by ""content farms"" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to ""hyperpartisan"" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. ___ Penney's reports 3Q sales shortfall, cuts outlook J.C. Penney cut its sales outlook for the year after reporting a surprise decline in a key sales figure for the third quarter as it wrestled with sluggish clothing sales. The report is a setback for Penney, whose business has been volatile, bouncing back in the summer after a tough start to the year. Like other department stores, J.C. Penney is trying to adjust to changing shopping patterns. Consumers are shifting their spending away from clothing and toward experiences like beauty treatments or toward furnishing their home. And when they do pick up clothing, it's more often at off-price stores or online as Amazon moves more into apparel. Given the environment, Penney wants to be less dependent on clothing, and is focusing its efforts on its home area and rolling out major appliances in it stores. ___ Senate GOP leader says he asked Trump to back Keystone LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The Senate's top Republican said Friday he asked President-elect Donald Trump to move swiftly in approving construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which has drawn strong opposition from environmentalists. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told reporters he made the request during his Capitol Hill meeting with Trump a day earlier. Trump listed the stalled Keystone project among his top priorities for the first 100 days of his administration. Obama rejected the proposed pipeline last November, declaring it would have undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal at the center of his environmental legacy. The 1,700-mile pipeline would carry oil from tar sands in Alberta, Canada, to refineries in the Houston area, passing through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. ___ Computer outage briefly grounds flights on several airlines DALLAS -- Travelers on several airlines had trouble checking in for flights and waited out delays Friday after a computer outage at a company that runs airline technology systems. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Alaska Airlines and Southwest Airlines confirmed that a technology glitch briefly interrupted their operations. The airlines blamed their difficulties on a breakdown in systems operated by Sabre Corp., a Texas company that provides software and other technology services to airlines and hotels. A Sabre spokeswoman said the systems were running again by early Friday afternoon. She said she did not know the cause of the breakdown. ___ Facebook glitch made it appear some users had died SAN FRANCISCO -- Some Facebook users received an unsettling shock Friday. Many of the social-media site's users saw their Facebook profile page topped with a message that referred to the process for ""memorializing"" the page of someone who has passed away. The message said Facebook hoped the users' loved ones would find comfort in seeing posts that others shared about them. Even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's page had the death notice. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the problem. But it appears that the company may already have fixed the glitch. ___ Pfizer lowers cost of Prevnar vaccine for some charity use Drugmaker Pfizer says it's reducing what it charges humanitarian groups for its blockbuster vaccine against pneumonia, ear and blood infections. Pfizer Inc.'s move to reduce Prevnar 13's price to $3.10 per dose -- but only for the groups' use with refugees and in other emergency settings -- follows pressure since 2009 by groups such as Doctors Without Borders. The biggest U.S. drugmaker previously preferred tax-deductible donations, which don't impact Prevnar's much-higher price. Pfizer's top-selling product, which requires three doses, brings it some $5 billion a year. ___ The Dow rose 39.78 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,847.66. The S&P 500 index fell 3.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,164.45. The Nasdaq composite index gained 28.32 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,237.11. Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.25, or 2.8 percent, to close at $43.41 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid $1.09, or 2.4 percent, to close at $44.75 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.31 a gallon. Heating oil fell 4 cents to $1.40 a gallon. Natural gas lost a penny to $2.62 per 1,000 cubic feet. ___ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But who are they really? The answer varies from state to state. The crowds include high school students, immigrants and even anarchists.  ""There's no professional protesters here,"" said Jennie Luna, a 40-year-old professor of Chicano studies at California State University-Channel Islands, just north of Los Angeles. The day after the election, she organized what she calls a ""self-care circle of courage"" on campus for students who needed an outlet for their distress over Trump's win. The event morphed into a rally and march that lasted several hours.  ""I am fearful for what will happen to the undocumented, I'm fearful of losing my reproductive rights,"" she said. ""And I'm fearful of the unknown."" America's new president has made many promises about changes to ""make America great again,"" such as undoing some regulations on companies, for example. He has also made pronouncements that have struck fear within certain groups of Americans -- women, Latinos, people with disabilities and racial minorities, among them. The protests that have spread across the nation are against Trump, but more pointedly, they are expressions of concern about how personal lives could change. Isadora Clemente Zurie, 21, was among those at a Thursday night protest in Salt Lake City, Utah, riding in her wheelchair with the crowd.  ""I'm disabled and I'm LGBT. I've been bullied all my life"" she told The Salt Lake Tribune. ""Now I'm in a world where for just being me, I could lose my entire life."" College students whose parents moved to the United States illegally are worried that Trump will follow through with his threat to rescind President Obama's executive order that protects young immigrants from deportation. At a Thursday night protest in Philadelphia, 23-year-old Jeanine Feito held a sign that read ""Not 1 More Deportation."" Protest organizers are using a tool that Trump made such effective use of -- social media. Tweets and Facebook posts have called people to protests across the country. Trump's election spawned a popular new hashtag: ""NotMyPresident."" Some of the protests are occurring in cities with a history of political activism such as Portland. In the 1990s, the staff of then-President George H.W. Bush dubbed the city ""Little Beirut"" because of the demonstrations his visits provoked. An organizer of the Portland anti-Trump protests is 23-year-old Gregory McKelvey, who has been a spokesman for the black activist group Don't Shoot Portland. At Portland's Thursday night protest by about 4,000 people, masked anarchists marching with the otherwise peaceful protesters smashed store windows with baseball bats, among other acts of mayhem. The protest became a riot and ended with 25 arrests. On Friday, McKelvey defended the protest.  ""It was our aim to channel the shared frustration, fear and anger that is so alive among so many of us considering our future prospects into a unified front for peaceful change,"" he said in statement. He disavowed the rioters: ""The violent actions that occurred last night had absolutely nothing to do with our group."" In Louisville, Kentucky, after Trump's election victory 23-year-old activist Mallie Feltner looked online for an event to vent her frustration but found none. So she decided to organize her own. The call spread through social media and more than 1,000 people showed up for the Thursday night protest. They chanted about women's rights, gay rights, the rights of immigrants and African-Americans.  ""My focus is showing solidarity to all of the people who felt disheartened and afraid like I did Wednesday morning,"" she said. ""I want them to feel heard. I want them to know I'm not going to become complicit in it."" The last time 65-year-old Leslie Holmes participated in protests was in San Francisco in the 1970s, during the Vietnam War. That changed with Trump's election. The website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, a registered Democrat and Hillary Clinton supporter, took an hourlong train ride to New York City to participate in demonstrations on Friday.  ""I think the progress we've made in the past eight years is something that's really worth defending,"" she said. ""This is the first time in 40 years I really felt motivated to put myself on the line."" ___ Associated Press writers Amanda Lee Myers in Los Angeles, Claire Galofaro in Louisville, Kentucky, and freelancer Dake Kang in New York City contributed to this report. ___ Follow Terrence Petty on Twitter at http://twitter.com/APOregonPetty .

Intelligence from surveillance aircraft flying over Sirte and areas south of the city allowed the U.S. military's Africa Command to track up to several hundred militants who U.S. officials now fear could be preparing to mount a counterattack on allied Libyan forces. The president's counterterrorism advisers are eager for Africa Command to pursue militants who have fled the coastal city but say military planners have more ""homework"" to do collecting and analyzing U.S. intelligence on their new encampments to ensure that U.S. strikes won't inadvertently kill civilians.  ""These guys are fleeing the fighting. There aren't too many of them,"" said one U.S. senior official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operations. ""Why wouldn't you want to pick them off?""  The Libya expansion comes amid a series of military escalations the White House has directed in recent months, from targeting leaders of al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria to launching major campaigns against Islamic State strongholds in Syria and Iraq. The Pentagon has also expanded operations in Somalia, Yemen and Afghanistan in a bid to beat back resurgent militant threats.    Though President Obama has seized on the decimation of al-Qaeda's core leadership as one of his central national security achievements, militant activity has evolved and spread to new theaters in recent years, representing a potentially more treacherous threat to the West.  That danger will be among the major issues facing President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office next year, forcing incoming officials to weigh the threat to Americans' security against the costs of intensified action overseas.   [Amid a world of problems, Trump's policy prescriptions remain opaque]  While the White House had hoped to quickly wrap up the U.S. air campaign in Libya, the Islamic State has mounted a tougher-than-expected defense in Sirte and beyond. U.S. officials said the operation had been repeatedly extended in part because of self-imposed restrictions on the strikes to mitigate the risk of civilian casualties.  The flight of experienced militants could pull the United States deeper into the conflict, potentially worsening the instability that has plagued Libya since its 2011 revolution and undermining a U.S.-backed project to build a broadly recognized unity government.   [Why it's taking so long to finish off the Islamic State in Libya]  The campaign in Libya has laid bare the challenge the United States faces in defeating even small bands of extremist fighters across the greater Middle East, who can seek shelter in remote areas or melt back into the population. Obama has been reluctant to commit significant U.S. ground forces to the fight, a stance Trump, given his campaign statements, seems likely to continue.  The extended air campaign over Sirte is emblematic of the challenge. Since August, the U.S. military has carried out more than 360 airstrikes in support of pro-government forces from the nearby city of Misurata. Small teams of elite U.S. commandos have helped local fighters push deeper into the coastal enclave, where officials say less than 100 extremists remain. Administration officials estimate that the Islamic State controlled the whole city at the start of the campaign. Now, they say, it holds one square block. But still, the militants have continued to hold out. Officials said that Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the head of Africa Command, has been eager to ensure that fleeing militants aren't allowed to regroup or attack local forces, who have sustained heavy losses in the fighting and already taken fire from the rear. A militant resurgence would also threaten to tarnish what has been Africa Command's first sustained bombing campaign since its activation in 2008.   [Obama directs Pentagon to target al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria]  ""At the request of the government of national accord, the United States military has conducted airstrikes to help severely constrict ISIL's ability to operate in Sirte and its environs,"" said White House National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog, using the administration's acronym for the Islamic State. ""We will continue to cooperate closely with the Libyan government as it works to prevent ISIL from finding safe haven anywhere in Libya."" The militants who have escaped Sirte are not believed to be Islamic State leaders but rather rank-and-file fighters. Military planners at Africa Command in recent days have been pouring over surveillance footage and other intelligence to try to ensure any expanded strikes won't put noncombatants at risk, officials said.  The Pentagon is concerned that any reports of civilian casualties could prompt U.S. partners in the region to pull back their support for the air campaign. NATO ally Italy has allowed the U.S. military to fly armed drones out of Naval Air Station Sigonella but could suspend the operations there if the U.S. campaign in Libya sparks a public backlash against the Italian government, U.S. officials say.  U.S. drones also conduct unarmed surveillance flights over Libya from neighboring Tunisia, which has likewise been nervous about a domestic backlash over its cooperation with the U.S. military.  Africa Command says its Sirte operation has killed no civilians to date.  The air campaign's potential expansion beyond the besieged city would build on a series of earlier strikes against militants in Libya, including one almost a year ago on a senior deputy of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Those strikes were conducted under a different set of authorities, approved directly by the White House rather than delegated to Africa Command. While the Pentagon pushed for months for authorization to attack the Islamic State before the Sirte operation began, the White House was cautious from the start about launching a sustained operation in another Muslim nation until a unity government and local forces were in place. For some officials, Libya has been an especially hard sell, given the country's political dysfunction and the lack of deep U.S.-Libyan ties.   [A reminder of the permanent wars: Dozens of U.S. airstrikes in six countries]  American officials have been keen to demonstrate their deference to the unity government, which has thrown its support behind U.S. air operations. While the unity government, headed by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, has secured Western backing, it has not yet won approval from rival Libyan factions, making it vulnerable to a political backlash over the United States' intervention.  Even if the United States can hunt down escaped militants outside Sirte, it's unlikely to signal an end to the Islamic State's most powerful affiliate.  Mattia Toaldo, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the militants, as they have elsewhere, are likely to adopt terrorist tactics as they lose control of territory. Most worrying, Toaldo said, is the fact that none of Libya's various security forces -- including militiamen and remnants of the pre-revolution army -- are positioned to contain militant cells.  ""There will be smaller streams going everywhere, going underground, and then re-emerging,"" he said.

Authorities say about three dozen Dakota Access oil pipeline protesters were arrested in a confrontation that shut down the state highway Friday. The highway was reopened but was closed again at about 4 p.m. after protesters created additional roadblocks. It happened about 20 miles away from a protest camp where hundreds of pipeline opponents have gathered for months. More than 470 people have been arrested since August.

(Abir Sultan via AP)  JERUSALEM -- Israel's ruling Likud party used Facebook to track the activities and posts of certain journalists it perceives as antigovernment, a member of the party, which is headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a public debate on Saturday. Likud parliamentarian David Bitan, who serves as chairman of the government coalition, told the gathering that he and some friends had been following the Facebook pages of journalists hired recently to set up a new public broadcasting service. ""We went and we checked the Facebook pages of these people. We saw what they are writing and I will tell you that we are talking about people who are leftist. They want to impose their own agenda on the new channel,"" he said in the forum. Bitan has been leading a crusade recently against the establishment of the Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation. The new public television and radio channel, which was slated to launch in the coming months, was approved by the government in 2014 to replace the country's antiquated Israel Broadcasting Authority. Last week, Netanyahu expressed his agreement with Bitan, establishing a committee tasked with finding a way to keep open the old Israel Broadcasting Authority and shutter the new media outlet. The committee will present its findings in three weeks. The prime minister and his supporters think the new public service channel is not working out as initially planned because there is not enough government supervision and because some of the newly employed journalists are overtly critical of his government and policies. It's a huge U-turn for Netanyahu, who two years ago called the change ""essential"" and ""necessary."" Despite the political wavering, intensive work breaking down the old television and radio channels has already started. Deals were reached with powerful unions and generous severance packages handed out to workers who agreed to quit voluntarily. The new broadcasting corporation has started its work, too, poaching media personalities from competing outlets and preparing content for a launch date that has already been postponed several times. The whole process has cost Israeli taxpayers millions of dollars. And, the actions of Netanyahu, who is also the country's communications minister, have come under severe scrutiny. The revelation on Saturday that members of his party were snooping around the private Facebook pages of journalists has also drawn a harsh response from the local media. Critics of the prime minister say that the new public broadcasting service should be free of political influence. They see Netanyahu's intentions as a clear attack on media freedom. Others say that yet another deviation from what was originally proposed will be a huge waste of public funds. He also faces political opposition, including from members of his own coalition. Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon announced last week that he would not support the dramatic turnabout, citing excessive costs and the loss of jobs for hundreds of people recently hired by the new corporation. Kahlon even said he would be willing to see new elections on this issue. After his comments were publicized, the Union of Journalists in Israel called on the attorney general to investigate the legality of Bitan's actions tracking the postings of journalists on Facebook. ""Closing down public broadcasting just because the prime minister can't control it crosses a red line reminiscent of a totalitarian regime and not a democratic society like Israel,"" said Yair Tarchitsky, union chairman. He likened the government's actions to McCarthyism and said professional journalists were being delegitimized with political labeling. Those who support Netanyahu's aims to dismantle the new service say it is the corporation that is a waste of public funds, especially if it turns out to be antigovernment. ""It's not going in the direction that we want. It is clear that the corporation will be left-leaning, according to what they are talking about. The journalists and workers are talking, they are tweeting, there is a red line that we will not allow it to cross,"" said Bitan during an interview last week with Israel's Channel 2 news. Established in 1948, the Israel Broadcasting Authority was Israel's sole television and radio outlet until commercial channels began broadcasting in the 1990s. Until four years ago, it was funded by an annual tax levied from television set owners. Now it is financed by the government. Revelations several years ago that the authority's expenditures were hugely inflated even as it draws a small percent of television audiences led the government to deem an overhaul of public service television as necessary."

(Achmad Ibrahim for the Center for International Forestry Research)  The United States is celebrating the centennial of its National Park Service, kicking off a proud ""second century of stewardship and engaging communities through recreation, conservation, and historic preservation programs."" The idea of engaging the population to protect nature works well in countries with effective democracy and low levels of inequality. Elsewhere in the world, nature conservation efforts don't always have the same effects. In new research published in Ecological Economics, I show that international campaigns for nature conservation in countries with higher levels of inequality and less effective democracy tend to get entangled with the vested interests of leaders and officials. This ends up wasting many of the resources directed toward conservation efforts -- and has a serious impact on indigenous and other forest-dependent communities. The world is adding more and more 'protected' land Countries have been meeting or exceeding global targets for protected areas set by the World Parks Congress since the 1960s. Protected lands nearly doubled from 1980 to 2000 (from 8.7 to 16.1 million square kilometers) -- and increased to 32 million square kilometers by 2014. Despite rapid economic growth in some of the largest forested countries since 1990, most countries in the world have seen significant increases in protected land, while none has witnessed a net reduction of the area under protection. This significant expansion of protected lands isn't what it seems My research shows that the rather unexpected expansion of protected areas is a product of political and economic inequalities. To demonstrate these relationships, I use standard measures of economic inequality (national Gini coefficients) and the strength of democratic freedoms (Freedom House index) and account for relevant geographic, demographic and economic variables for a statistically robust analysis of protected area designation in a sample of 135 countries. Additionally, my research draws on scholarship about protected area policies. Here's what happens: Stable democracies with relatively equitable societies (such as France, Germany and Spain) are likely to find it easier to develop a political consensus and policy measures needed to protect land. But the ""democratic dividend"" diminishes consistently with increasing income inequality. For instance, despite being among the strongest democracies in the world, United States is able to protect only 13 percent of its national territory, below the international average of 15.48 percent. This is because well-functioning democratic institutions afford opportunities for relatively poor communities that depend on farming and other land-based activities to protest government policies for setting aside large areas of land exclusively for the goals of nature conservation.   [Do we really need a new U.N. oceans treaty? Yes, and here's why.]   Why do undemocratic countries set aside more land? And here's the real surprise: Countries with poor democratic institutions and high levels of economic inequality (such as the Republic of Congo, Namibia and Zambia) set aside a larger percentage of territory as protected area. In these countries, governments can afford to dismiss land and forest rights of indigenous and other forest-dependent people who have customarily used these lands. Researchers at the ESRC STEPS Centre of the Institute of Development Studies, Land Deal Politics Initiative, and the International Institute for Environment and Development refer to the phenomenon of locking away land and natural resources in the name of environmental protection as ""green-grabbing."" It's not so clear that these lands are truly ""protected,"" however. Green-grabbing can set up new conflicts, as people push back to regain control of the land. But the failure of democratic institutions and lack of political accountability means many governments can overlook these conflicts without facing political consequences. Why do politicians from developing countries care so much about protected areas? To answer this question, in an Ecological Economics article and in a book in press I synthesize a vast amount of research on policies and programs of nature conservation in the global South. I found that politicians serve a number of political and economic interests by setting aside protected areas. Meeting global protection targets nets political capital First, heads of state try to meet global protected area targets to earn goodwill among the international community -- then use this goodwill to deflect global criticism on other matters. For instance, former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari ""turned to environmental protection"" to boost his support following a sullied presidential election in 1988. In India, then-prime minister Indira Gandhi earned significant political capital via her enthusiastic support of Project Tiger and other conservation initiatives. Such political capital helped Gandhi blunt international criticism of the human rights abuses that resulted from her suspension of the constitution (1975-1977). . . . and international funding Second, protected areas get a lion's share of international conservation funds. Leading fundraisers in 2014 include the Nature Conservancy ($949 million), WWF International ($700 million), Wildlife Conservation Society ($253 million) and Conservation International ($152 million).   [Elephants are in danger. Our research could help save them.]   Conservation funds become a source of corruption for politicians and high-ranking government officials, even as the foot soldiers of wildlife conservation remain underpaid. And governments also get to control extractive activities in the land they bring under central control. And by designating large land areas as under government conservation, in some countries the government actually gets the upper hand against political insurgencies. More recently, scholars have examined instances of ""war by conservation"" in which ""global security concerns, specifically the U.S.-led War on Terror and Counterinsurgency"" seem to be the primary goal while ""conservation is relegated to a position of secondary importance."" So, paradoxically, the world's acreage of legally designated protected areas has expanded, yet we see ""catastrophic declines in wilderness areas around the world over the last 20 years."" This means that setting global targets for the continued expansion of legally protected areas has been mostly ineffective. What's a better way to protect nature? There's a logic flaw in proposals to expand the protected area network, such as renowned biologist E.O. Wilson's advocacy of setting aside ""half the planet in reserve, or more."" Instead of chasing ever-larger targets, effectively protecting the lands already under ""protection"" might be a better option. Policymakers could create incentives for governments to plow back substantive shares of conservation funds into local development, engage directly with citizen groups and open up nature conservation policies for greater scrutiny. This will aid transparency in policymaking and implementation and is likely to improve accountability among government agencies and officials vested with the task of environmental protection. Environmental conservation efforts -- and the protected areas themselves -- would benefit from effectively functioning democratic institutions.
