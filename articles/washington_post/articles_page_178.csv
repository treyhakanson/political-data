Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan on Friday upheld a lower court's decision that said Hawaii law prohibits counties from regulating agricultural matters. The cases stemmed from a decision by Maui voters to ban the cultivation and testing of genetically modified crops in 2014 and related movements on other Hawaiian islands. Kauai County had imposed pesticide notification requirements and mandated pesticide buffer zones, and Hawaii Island had enacted an ordinance banning open air testing of genetically engineered organisms, among other things. But the court held that the county laws are pre-empted by state laws that regulate potentially harmful plants.  ""We will continue to stand and fight with the people of Hawaii against these chemical companies, and part of that is going to be demanding action at the state level to protect the people and the environment,"" said George Kimbrell, senior attorney for the Center For Food Safety, which pushed for the bans. ""We're considering all legal options, including appeal."" Monsanto, which farms genetically engineered seeds to be used by farmers around the world, was part of a group that fought the Maui GMO ban. Monsanto Hawaii employs approximately 1,000 people on Maui, Molokai and Oahu, Dan Clegg, Hawaii business operations lead for Monsanto, in an emailed statement.  ""We're listening and we've heard the concerns some people have about GMOs and today's farming practices,"" Clegg said. ""Our commitment to ongoing dialogue with our neighbors doesn't stop today. We understand the responsibility we have to farm sustainably and to work collaboratively, and we welcome the opportunity to continue having conversations with members of the community."" Kimbrell was pleased the judge also said according to federal law, state and local governments can regulate some commercial crops, namely those that have been deregulated by the federal government after they've gone through testing. Even so, allowing counties to do that would require a change in state law. He was disappointed the ruling stated that only the federal government could regulate experimental field trials of commercial crops. The Maui case ruling said scientific studies have not shown that food produced from genetically engineered crops pose any inherent risk to human health. But it said ""the cultivation and testing of GE plants raise several well-documented concerns,"" including harm to plants and animals caused by the increased use of pesticides sometimes associated with testing and growing genetically engineered crops, the proliferation of ""superweeds"" and pests resistant to pesticides and contamination of traditional, non-genetically modified plants during pollination.  ""As a mother and a resident of Kekaha, Kauai, I will continue to stand up and protect my family and my community,"" said Malia Kahaleina Chun, a mother, educator and Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner, in an emailed statement. ""It is our responsibility to insure that our keiki (children) have access to clean air, clean water and to aina (land) that sustains them."" ___ Follow Cathy Bussewitz on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cbussewitz .

District Superintendent Shawn Lewis-Lakin says administrators at Royal Oak Middle School found the apparent noose Friday afternoon while investigating a commotion at a boys' restroom. Lewis-Lakin says the district and Royal Oak police are investigating the incident. Video of the Nov. 9 chant in the school's cafeteria was widely viewed on social media. The chant was an apparent reference to Trump's call for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. It's not clear whether students were targeting other students. Reports of violence and threats toward ethnic minorities have increased since Trump was elected. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The German company said the job cuts, which account to around 5 percent of its global workforce, are part of a long-term plan to improve profitability and shift resources and investment to electric-powered vehicles and digital services. At a news conference at Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg, company officials said 23,000 of the job cuts will be in Germany and that the measures will save some 3.7 billion euros ($4 billion) a year from 2020. Volkswagen employs around 120,000 people at its namesake brand in Germany. ___ The effects of India's currency reform? 'Chaos' say analysts NEW DELHI -- The sudden withdrawal of 86 percent of India's currency has left cash in short supply, retail sales stumbling and wholesale markets in turmoil. That's just the immediate fallout from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surprise effort to stamp out corruption by making cash hoards in large denomination bills worthless. But what lies ahead could be even worse, some analysts say.  ""Basically, you've created chaos,"" said Steve H. Hanke, an applied economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and a global authority on currency policy. ""India is a cash economy. It's not like Europe or the U.S. where everyone is running around with a credit card. That's not the world of India.""  ""It doesn't look like this thing was thought through at all,"" he said. ___ Trump claims to save auto plant. But it wasn't closing DETROIT -- President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. Trump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a ""Lincoln plant"" would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there. A factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving production of the MKC. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. ___ Obama blocks new oil, gas drilling in Arctic Ocean WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is blocking new oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean, handing a victory to environmentalists who say industrial activity in the icy waters will harm whales, walruses and other wildlife and exacerbate global warming. A five-year offshore drilling plan announced on Friday blocks the planned sale of new oil and gas drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas north of Alaska. The plan allows drilling to go forward in Alaska's Cook Inlet southwest of Anchorage. The blueprint for drilling from 2017 to 2022 can be rewritten by President-elect Donald Trump, in a process that could take months or years. ___ As Trump talks wall, China builds bridges to Latin America LIMA, Peru -- An expected U.S. economic retreat from Latin America under Donald Trump is causing the region's leaders to look halfway around the world, to China, for help weathering the possible financial headwinds. They'll have the perfect opportunity to make their appeal this week when Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a Pacific Rim summit as part of a visit to Ecuador, Peru and Chile. This is Xi's third time in Latin America since taking office in 2013, and when he wraps up the tour he will have visited 10 countries in the region -- the same number as President Barack Obama, who has been in office twice as long. ___ Trump agrees to $25M settlement to resolve Trump U lawsuits SAN DIEGO -- President-elect Donald Trump agreed Friday to pay $25 million to settle several lawsuits against his now-defunct school for real estate investors, averting a trial in a potentially embarrassing case that he had vowed during the campaign to keep fighting. If approved by a judge, the deal announced by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman would lay to rest allegations that Trump University defrauded students who paid up to $35,000 to enroll in programs that promised to share Trump's secrets of the real estate industry. The deal would settle a lawsuit Schneiderman filed three years ago and two class-action lawsuits filed in California on behalf of former students. ___ Daily fantasy sports rivals DraftKings and FanDuel to merge BOSTON -- Daily fantasy sports rivals DraftKings and FanDuel have agreed to merge after months of speculation and increasing regulatory scrutiny. The two companies made the announcement Friday, saying the combined organization would be able to reduce costs as they work to become profitable and battle with regulators across the country to remain legal. In a matter of a few short years, the two have raised millions of dollars through investors and sponsorship deals, drawing the attention of policymakers across the country. ___ Abercrombie off the mark in 3Q as turnaround efforts sputter NEW ALBANY, Ohio -- Abercrombie & Fitch's plan to turn around its once-popular teen clothing brand failed to bring back shoppers to its stores. The company said Friday that a key sales measure fell for the third straight quarter, that its profit plummeted 81 percent in the latest quarter and that it expects a rough holiday season for the Abercrombie brand. Once a top shop for teens, Abercrombie has struggled to attract youngsters who are more likely to shop at cheaper fast-fashion chains such as H&M and Forever 21. Abercrombie ditched its sexy advertising and banished shirtless male models from its stores last year, but people are still not coming to its stores like they had been. Sales at established Abercrombie stores fell 14 percent in the most recent quarter, and the company said it expects the brand to remain ""challenging"" throughout the rest of the year. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average slid 35.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,867.93.

It's a situation that has put the Republican president-elect's hometown in the position of asking his new administration to pay ongoing costs for what Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio called an unprecedented security effort for a U.S. president's unofficial residence.  ""We're being asked to do something on a scale that's never been done before,"" the mayor said at a news conference with New York Police Department and Secret Service officials. The mayor spoke at a command center at NYPD headquarters where four video monitors carried live feeds of the intersection outside Trump Tower, in midtown Manhattan. The monitors showed how police have closed two of Fifth Avenue's five lanes, completely barricaded the block where residents have a private entrance and set up checkpoints manned by officers in guard booths. The measures, largely intended to fortify Trump Tower in a terror attack, have slowed motor and foot traffic outside and raised concerns among retailers it could hurt business during the holiday shopping season. Anti-Trump demonstrations have shut down Fifth Avenue entirely at least three times in the past 10 days. Authorities are still refining their tactics to minimize inconveniences to workers and shoppers through late January. In the immediate aftermath of the election, Trump Tower's entrance was walled off by dump trucks filled with sand and its atrium was closed to tourists, measures that were lifted within a couple of days. What happens after the inauguration will depend on how the new president divides his time between his high-rise apartment and the White House, officials said. Depending on the answer, the NYPD might create a new command assigned full time to securing Trump Tower. Officials also said they have begun exploring ways to get federal help in covering potentially huge overtime costs for the nation's largest police department. Similar reimbursements have been made in the past for large-scale events like Pope Francis' visit to the city last year.  ""I think the federal government will recognize that the NYPD is carrying a burden for the entire nation,"" De Blasio said. The mayor predicted New Yorkers would shrug off the hassle of protecting Trump.  ""After we get through legitimately grumbling, we'll go on with our lives,"" he said.

His friend Sebale Tsosie, 21, has the same concerns, saying it's unfair that a massive coal-fired power plant blamed for the pollution will not have to drastically cut back emissions until a generation from now. Federal rules exempt the Navajo Generating Station in Page, Arizona, from drastically reducing haze-causing nitrogen oxide emissions for several decades -- a decision being challenged by Navajo environmental groups at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The two young men and dozens of other Navajo youth, including some who organizers say suffer from asthma, filled the rows of a federal courtroom in San Francisco on Friday to listen to oral arguments in the case. Some of the youth also protested outside court.  ""The whole point for me being here is to show my face and show that us young people care about our land and about everything we had -- or have,"" Tsosie said while en route to San Francisco. The youth ranging from school-age children to young adults piled into vans to travel nearly 1,000 miles for the hearing. They are among the growing ranks of young activists to claim a role in recent environmental causes in the U.S. Last week, a federal judge in Oregon gave the green light to a lawsuit from 21 youths who allege the federal government failed to protect them from the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. In North Dakota, tribal leaders have said native youth opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline helped grow the movement that has led to months of protests. In the Navajo case, the lawsuit against the power plant was brought by conservation groups To' Nizhoni Ani, Dine Citizens Against Ruining our Environment and the Black Mesa Water Coalition, of which Natoni and Tsosie said they are members. The groups allege the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's decision to set back the deadline for the Navajo Generating Station to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 84 percent sets a double standard because other plants have had to meet speedier timelines. They say the decision does not meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act and that they and the Hopi Tribe, which also lives in the region, were not a part of consultations with the federal government, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Gila River Indian Community, the Navajo Nation and others. The plant serves customers throughout the Western U.S. It powers a series of canals that deliver water to Phoenix and Tucson, fuels the economies of the Navajo and Hopi tribes, and helps fulfill American Indian water-rights settlements with the federal government. The U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation co-owns the plant, which some consider an important supporter of the local economy. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Protesters rallied at New York's Union Square before picking up steam and taking their cause toward Trump Tower. Police set up barricades in front of some of the most expensive stores in Manhattan as the group made its way along Fifth Avenue.  ""I just can't have Donald Trump running this country and teaching our children racism, sexism and bigotry,"" said Noemi Abad, 30, a fashion designer, as she marched down the famous road. ""Out of his own mouth he made this division. He needs to go -- there's no place for racism in society in America."" Trump's comments -- particularly a 2005 recording of him making lewd comments about women -- sparked outrage during his campaign. That spilled over into a fourth day of demonstrations following an election that ended with half of U.S. voters choosing the other candidate, Hillary Clinton. In Los Angeles, several thousand people marched through downtown streets Saturday to condemn what they saw as Trump's hate speech about Muslims, pledge to deport people in the country illegally and crude comments about women. Jennifer Cruz, 18, of Ventura, California, carried a sign that asked: ""Legalize weed but not my Mom?"" -- a reference to Californians' Tuesday passage of a measure legalizing recreational marijuana use. Cruz said her parents have been in the United States illegally for 30 years, although her mother has spent years seeking citizenship. She called the possibility of their deportation terrifying.  ""We talk about it almost every day,"" she said. ""My Mom wants to leave it in the hands of God but I'm not just going to sit back and not do anything. I'm going to fight for my parents, even if it kills me.""  ""He doesn't realize all the families he's hurting,"" she said of Trump. Shawn Smith, 41, of Los Angeles, wore an American flag vest and held a glittery sign that said ""Love Trumps Hate.""  ""What he's been able to do is make 50 percent of the nation look over their shoulder,"" he said. ""If you're gay, if you're LGBT, if you're Muslim, if you're Latin, if you're special needs, if you're female, it's a much unsafer place now.""  ""What is happening today is going to be the normal for a while,"" he said of the demonstration, ""because we're not going to just sit back and watch our rights being taken away, our health care being taken away."" Protests were mainly peaceful, but in Portland, Oregon, a man who was participating in a march was shot after a confrontation with someone in a vehicle. Police expect the man to survive and detained four people in connection with the shooting. A motive for the shooting was unclear. The four people detained are believed to be gang members, but the victim is not. The shooting followed rowdy Friday night protests, when police used tear gas in response to ""burning projectiles"" thrown at officers, police said on Twitter. Hundreds of people marched through the city, disrupting traffic and spray-painting graffiti. Authorities reported instances of vandalism and assault during a rally that organizers had billed as peaceful earlier in the day. In other parts of the country, spirited demonstrations on college campuses and peaceful marches along downtown streets have taken place since Wednesday. Evening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta. Trump supporter Nicolas Quirico was traveling from South Beach to Miami. His car was among hundreds stopped when protesters blocked Interstate 395.  ""Trump will be our president. There is no way around that, and the sooner people grasp that, the better off we will be,"" he said. ""There is a difference between a peaceful protest and standing in a major highway backing up traffic for 5 miles. This is wrong."" Protests also were held in Detroit; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Olympia, Washington, Iowa City and more. More than 200 people, carrying signs, gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted ""not my president"" and ""no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA."" In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. In Cincinnati, hundreds of protesters had already taken to the streets early Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest the jury's deadlock in the trial of a former white police officer who killed an unarmed black motorist in 2015. A mistrial was declared in the trial of former University of Cincinnati officer Ray Tensing. He was fired after shooting Sam DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing front license plate last year. Anti-Trump protesters had joined up with trial protesters and marched through downtown. In Chicago, hundreds of people including families with small children chanted ""No hate. No fear. Immigrants are welcome here"" Saturday as they marched through Millennium Park, a popular downtown tourist attraction. Sonja Spray, 29, who heard about the protest on Facebook, said she has signed an online petition urging the electoral college to honor the popular vote and elect Clinton.  ""Women aren't playthings. Journalists aren't pawns. People of color are not commodities. Marriage equality is not up for debate,"" Spray said. Ashley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver.  ""It's not that we're sore losers,"" said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Clinton. ""It's that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation."" Demonstrations also took place internationally. A group of Mexicans at statue representing independence in Mexico City expressed their concerns about a possible wave of deportations. One school teacher said it would add to the ""unrest"" that's already in Mexico. About 300 people protested Trump's election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy near the landmark Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. President Barack Obama meets in Berlin next week with Chancellor Angela Merkel and several other European leaders, and is expected to confront global concerns about Trump's election. ___ Jablon reported in Los Angeles.

He was 79. The cause was respiratory failure, said his companion, Kim Hewitt. In a career spanning five decades, Mr. Marquette worked predominantly with United Press International and the Associated Press and chronicled four presidencies, from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush.  Mr. Marquette also photographed Capitol Hill hearings on matters ranging from the Iran-contra affair of the 1980s to the Abu Ghraib prison-abuse scandal after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.  He and a cadre of AP photographers shared the Pulitzer in 1999 for feature photography of impeachment hearings stemming from Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.    Photographer Joe Marquette, then with UPI, shot this photograph of President George H.W. Bush in the Pacific during a 1990 holiday to Honolulu. The UPI photographer was invited to swim along and brought his Nikon Action Touch waterproof. (Photo by Joe Marquette/UPI )  Mr. Marquette's winning photo depicted a confrontation between Clinton lawyer David Kendall and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in a House Judiciary Committee hearing room overflowing with spectators and other photographers -- a vivid evocation of the news frenzy. Off the political beat, Mr. Marquette, then with UPI, won a World Press Photo contest for his image of Britain's Sebastian Coe winning the gold medal at the 1980 Moscow Olympics in the 1,500-meter race. Mr. Marquette also captured a decisive moment of the 1983 Super Bowl when Washington Redskins fullback John Riggins broke free from Don McNeal of the Miami Dolphins to score a 43-yard touchdown that cemented the Redskins' victory, 27-17. Joseph Chartrand Marquette was born Jan. 6, 1937, in Indianapolis and grew up in Detroit. His developed an interest in photography as a child after his parents bought him a Kodak Brownie camera. He entered journalism as a courier at the Detroit News, and he formed friendships with photographers who helped smooth his path to jobs with UPI, first in Minneapolis and later in Denver. He spent several decades with UPI but also had stints in the mid-1980s with Reuters (where he helped establish its U.S. wirephoto service) and the Philadelphia Inquirer. He worked for the Associated Press from 1991 to 2003, followed by two years with the European Pressphoto Agency. He freelanced until moving to Oklahoma in 2009. His honors included a first-place award for presidential coverage from the White House News Photographers Association in 1992. His marriages to Eva DeMaggio and Carol Giacomo ended in divorce. Survivors include his companion of nine years, Kim Hewitt of Tulsa; a son from his first marriage, Anthony Marquette of Centennial, Colo.; a son from his second marriage, Christopher Marquette of Cos Cob, Conn.; a brother; and a grandson. As a UPI senior photographer in October 1990, Mr. Marquette accompanied President George H.W. Bush on a trip to Honolulu and intuited that the commander in chief would take an early morning swim in the Pacific Ocean. The photographer donned bathing trunks and, with a nod of approval from the Secret Service, waded in with a cheap waterproof camera.   Photographer Joe Marquette in undated photo. (Wilfredo Lee/AP)  ""What are you doing here?"" asked the startled president, according to a Washington Post account. ""I've got to make some pictures,"" Mr. Marquette replied. The resulting image of the president barely keeping his head above the waterline was widely reproduced. Mr. Marquette said he intended to capture the leader of the free world at play. But the photo also bore the exaggerated look of a political cartoon, a commentary on a president struggling to stay afloat politically amid intense budget talks and the looming Persian Gulf War.   Life magazine captioned the image ""Engulfed,"" which rankled the photographer. ""Taking a good picture and putting a bad story under it,"" he once told a National Press Club audience, ""that's not my game."" A year earlier, Mr. Marquette related in the same talk, he had been at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, and photographed first lady Barbara Bush as she played tennis. He said he wanted to be respectful and capture only her face -- but at the exact moment of the photograph, Bush had crossed her eyes. The picture made the front page of at least one major newspaper, Mr. Marquette recalled. But Barbara Bush took revenge about a month later, striding up to him at the White House Rose Garden and ordering him to put down his camera. When he sheepishly obliged, she stuck out her tongue and made a moose antlers gesture with her hands. ""She looked at me,"" the photographer recalled, ""and said, 'I gotcha!'

Elena Kountoura, Greece's alternate minister for tourism, said Monday that 2016 has been ""another great year for Greek tourism,"" with international arrivals up 7 percent in the nine months through September compared with the year before. The four summer months from July were the best ever for the sector, she said.  ""By the end of the year, international arrivals are expected to exceed 27 million, including cruise arrivals, which is a new high record for Greece,"" she said at the World Travel Market in London, the industry's biggest global gathering. That's a much-needed boost for a country that has spent the past few years mired in a debt crisis that's required successive governments to enact tough budget austerity measures in return for three massive international bailouts. Greece's tourism industry has benefited from a period of political calm this year and attracted travelers who decided not to holiday in places like Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey -- three countries that have seen extremist attacks and political volatility over the past couple of years. Tourism, which according to many measures accounts for around 25 percent of Greece's annual GDP when direct and indirect influences are incorporated, will play a key role in any economic recovery in the country. Since 2008, Greece's economy has contracted by around a quarter and seen unemployment spike to around 25 percent. It badly needs tourism revenue if it is to recover and sustainably create jobs. Vasilis Kontos, CEO of Corfu Holidays Travel, says the sector has seen a rise in interest from those who may have originally opted to holiday elsewhere in the Mediterranean. The boost in tourism numbers has helped the sector make up for hefty sales tax increases that were required by European creditors in return for last year's three-year bailout of around 80 billion euros ($89 billion). Firms opted against passing on that rise in costs in order to maintain tourist interest.  ""It's something we have had to absorb,"" he said at the World Travel Market.

It won't be easy. You can blame Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton or both for this campaign's guttural nature -- the lies, insults, exaggerations and accusations -- and certainly they can't be exonerated from the sins of distortion and embitterment. But it is too easy to blame this democratic debacle only on the candidates' flaws.  There are deeper causes, as I argued in a column some weeks ago. I headlined that column, ""Why this campaign was so nasty."" The thesis was relatively simple, suggested by historian Marc Levinson's new book, ""An Extraordinary Time: The End of the Postwar Boom and the Return of the Ordinary Economy.""  In brief, the first (roughly) quarter-century after World War II featured an explosion of economic growth in most of the developed world -- the United States, Western Europe, Japan -- that changed democratic politics. With strong economies producing rising tax revenue, governments were expected to remedy societies' various defects with new spending transfers and social programs. The problem, as Levinson shows, is that rapid economic growth was fading by the early 1970s. From this emerged a more-or-less permanent mismatch: Electorates retained the upbeat expectation of the early postwar decades, but economies could not meet all the resulting wishes and hopes. Politics became more cynical, as its practitioners strove to straddle the contradiction.  The first casualty (no surprise!) was truth. Political leaders here and elsewhere strove to conceal the contradiction. Chronic budget deficits became routine in many countries, including the United States, as a way of avoiding unpopular tax increases and maintaining popular spending programs. When deficits became too big to ignore, politicians sought to change the subject. This is the simplest explanation of why Trump and, to a lesser extent, Clinton switched to other themes: Trump, to draconian steps to change trade and immigration policies; Clinton, to a new generation of social welfare subsidies for preschool, child care and college tuition.  Still, the contradiction will not retreat. We expect our political leaders to do the impossible -- to use the fruits of meager economic growth to fix mega social problems -- and when they predictably fail, we conclude that they are inept or dishonest. The paradox is that government stands discredited by its very commitments to be helpful and to alleviate human misery, which breed more demands than can be reasonably met. What would in these circumstances have been desirable and useful -- but also innocent and unlikely -- was a debate on the realistic and legitimate functions of government. A dose of candor might actually make it easier to govern, but not of course easier to get elected. The victor will be blessed with triumph and cursed by popular contradictions.

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA:  FAYETTEVILLE, N.C.--Republicans typically perform well around military installations. At a rally yesterday afternoon just outside of Fort Bragg, the world's biggest Army base by population, Barack Obama crisply summarized why Democrats hope this year will be different - and why the Clinton campaign is competing so aggressively for the votes of active duty service members, their families and veterans. ""Listen, if you want to keep our military the greatest fighting force that the world has ever known ... then we can't have a commander-in-chief who suggests that it's okay to torture people,"" the president said, referring to Donald Trump. ""We can't afford a commander-in-chief who insults POWs [like John McCain], who attacks a Gold Star mother, who actually talks down our troops (and) says he knows more than our generals."" Obama recalled a briefing he received just hours after being inaugurated on how to launch nuclear weapons. ""It will sober you up,"" he said. ""We can't have somebody like that handling our nuclear codes."" -- North Carolina has a massive military presence. More than 50,000 active duty personnel are assigned to Fort Bragg. Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville houses several Marine Corps combat units and support commands. The Air Force's 4th Striker Wing is based in Goldsboro. With every poll showing that this state remains a true toss-up, strategists on both sides see these communities as top targets. Unfortunately, there is not recent, reliable polling on this specific demographic. Some earlier surveys showed Trump faring well among members of the Armed Forces but underperforming past Republican presidential candidates.    Mike Pence stumps in North Carolina. (Jason Miczek/Reuters)   -- So there has been a full-court press this week: Mike Pence, whose son Michael is a Marine second lieutenant, campaigned yesterday in Greenville, North Carolina. Ripping into Clinton for her handling of Benghazi, he declared: ""As the proud father of a United States Marine Corps officer, I say anyone who says 'What difference does it make?' should be disqualified from being the commander in chief of our military."" Tim Kaine held a rally on Monday right outside Camp Lejeune, where his son Nat, a Marine first lieutenant, is stationed (though he's currently deployed overseas). The senator, after being introduced by the Military Spouse of the Year, opened with a story about how he'd been in town last Thanksgiving to be with his son and how he came down to see him on July Fourth, before Hillary tapped him to be her running mate. His wife, Anne Holton, came to the same city last week as a campaign surrogate. Both stressed the work Clinton did on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Kaine then spent several minutes lacing into Trump over his criticism of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Gold Star parents who spoke at the Democratic National Convention. He seized on a New York Magazine story that came out last weekend, which recounted an adviser telling Trump back in August that it might not be a good idea to attack a Gold Star family. And Trump reportedly replied, ""What's that?"" Kaine was incredulous: ""What's a Gold Star family?! What's a Gold Star family?!?!"" Joe Biden opened speeches in Rock Hill and Charlotte on Tuesday by recalling his late son Beau's service in the Delaware Army National Guard, which included a tour of duty in Iraq. He then hit Trump using language very similar to Obama's.    Donald Trump addresses a rally in Selma, North Carolina, on Thursday. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)   -- Worried about softness in this area, Trump has changed up how he talks about the military in the closing weeks. His Thursday night rally in Selma, which is an hour away from Fort Bragg, focused on this constituency. Gone are his declarations that the military is ""a disaster."" Mainly reading from a TelePrompter, Trump told the crowd exactly what it wanted to hear. He promised to get rid of the caps on defense spending in the sequester, to expand the Marine Corps from 27 to 36 battalions and to ""provide full support for families - including jobs, education and housing."" ""I will never, never, never let you down ... and you've been let down many times over the years,"" he said. Seven Medal of Honor recipients stood behind him on stage. Trump read their names and praised each for his courage under fire. But then he could not resist going off the prompter. ""I'm brave in other ways,"" he declared. ""I'm financially brave!"" Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn warmed up the crowd of 15,000 by talking about his 16 years at Fort Bragg. Then Keith Kellogg, another retired lieutenant general, reminded everyone that the term ""Tar Heel State"" dates back to the Civil War. The Confederate soldiers from North Carolina were known as especially tough. ""When they attacked,"" Kellogg explained, ""they stuck like they had tar on their heels."" ""And you're tar heels,"" he added. ""You're part of history. You're part of the movement to take back this country from the elites."" Trump stressed that he will only use force ""when it is vital for the national security of the United States."" ""We will stop trying to build foreign democracies,"" he said to loud cheers. ""We have no right to be there. Instead, our focus must be on keeping American safe."" The GOP nominee pointed again to the Medal of Honor recipients behind him so he could take a dig at Clinton: ""To think of her being their boss, I don't think so.""    President Obama puffs out his cheeks at a baby after his speech in Fayetteville. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)   -- For the Clinton campaign, Obama's event at Fayetteville State University on Friday served dual purposes. Probably 95 percent of the crowd of 4,500 was African American. Hundreds of them wore garb signifying a personal or familial connection to the Army, whether a hat, a shirt or a tattoo. Obama's military-themed messaging resonated as much as anything else. ""The thing with Donald Trump is that he's a really great businessman,"" said Pamela Packer, 50, an Army veteran who is studying to become a social worker and plans to focus on helping military families. ""If we were looking for someone to run a corporation, he'd be totally great. But we're looking for someone to lead our military, and he's totally unqualified for that. Asking him to be president is like asking a nail technician to be your surgeon.""  Packer's husband also served--in the 82nd Airborne Division--for 22 years. Before bringing her three kids to hear Obama's speech, she planned to vote for Clinton. After listening to his pitch, she decided to walk around her neighborhood this weekend urging others to do the same. Willie Miller, 62, served in the Army during the Cold War, from 1973 to 1988, so it baffles him that more voters aren't outraged by Trump's praise for Vladimir Putin. ""It's totally crazy. Crazy! Trump praises a Russian dictator! I don't understand how that's not political suicide. It would have been for anyone else - especially in the past,"" he said. Miller, who retired as a sergeant first class and still works as a contractor for the military, said people around here also laugh hard at the idea that Trump thinks he knows more about winning wars than the generals do. ""Generals don't get that star on their shoulder without being exceptional,"" Miller said. Obama, who did not serve in the military, did not broach the topic during his speech, but several older voters expressed disgust during interviews that Trump got deferments to avoid being drafted to fight in Vietnam. The Republican nominee, for his part, once said that sleeping around New York City during that era, while trying to avoid getting sexually-transmitted diseases, was ""my personal Vietnam.""    Trump pauses while speaking about waterboarding in Tennessee earlier this year. (Andrew Harnik/AP)   -- Trump's celebration of torture as a weapon of war is also a huge concern for some military voters. ""Torture works,"" Donald has said. Even though the use of such enhanced interrogation techniques is against federal law, Trump reiterated this summer that he would approve waterboarding ""in a heartbeat"" because he considers it ""short of torture."" ""If it doesn't work,"" he said, ""they deserve it anyway for what they're doing."" (Senior military officers responded they would disobey such an order.) The most interesting man I met in Utah when I was there a few weeks ago was phone banking for Clinton. David Irvine is a retired Army brigadier general and a registered Republican who served four terms in the state House. ""At this point, we will be paying a price for a long time because he's said that. It just astounds me to hear Trump talk so flippantly,"" the 73-year-old said. ""The increased danger which he's created for American military personal in the Middle East is incalculable.""    A Trump supporter is removed during Obama's speech at Fayetteville State. (Gerry Broome/AP)   -- A POWERFUL MOMENT IN FAYETTEVILLE: As Obama riffed on why folks who care about the Armed Forces ought to support Clinton, an elderly white man in the bleachers - wearing a jacket with medals and military insignia - stood up, unfurled a Trump sign and begin yelling. The crowd went wild, angrily jeering the interloper. This has happened many times before, but it felt like something more in this case. Emotions always run high in the final days of any campaign, but it was as if this Trump supporter suddenly became a stand-in for all the hate that the first black president has faced. The audience seemed to be getting eight years of frustration off its collective chest. The president used the heckler as a foil. But first he had to regain control of his rambunctious supporters, and that proved startlingly difficult. For more than a minute, the commander-in-chief became annoyed as he tried to hush the crowd. As the police escorted the protester out of the arena, Obama pleaded: ""No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hey, hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! ... Hey! Listen, listen, listen, listen. ... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, listen up! Hey, everybody! Everybody! Hey! Hey! Listen up! Hey! I told you to be focused, and you're not focused right now! Listen to what I'm saying. Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second. Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second! Now, listen up! I'm serious!! Listen up!"" When Obama finally got a word in edgewise, he admonished his fans: ""You've got an older gentleman who is supporting his candidate. He's not doing nothing -- you don't have to worry about him. This is what I mean about folks not being focused. First of all, we -- hold up! Hold up! First of all, we live in a country that respects free speech. Second of all, it looks like maybe he might have served in our military, and we've got to respect that. Third of all, he was elderly, and we've got to respect our elders. And fourth of all: Don't boo. Vote!"" [Graphic: What the swing state of North Carolina can teach us about political polarization in America] -- Obama looked magnanimous and, to put it bluntly, presidential. It was a night-and-day contrast to how Trump would have responded if he'd been the speaker in the same situation. How can we say this with certainty? Because Trump held a rally right here in Fayetteville the week before the North Carolina primary in March. An African-American protester was sucker-punched by a 78-year-old white man in a cowboy hat as he was led out of the stands by police. After another disruption, Trump egged on his base. ""Get out of here,"" he yelled at the protester. ""Go home to mom!"" Trump at the time had been suggesting that his supporters ""knock the crap"" out of disruptors. ""I'd like to punch him in the face,"" he had said as a protester was escorted out. He even offered to cover the legal bills for his fans who roughed up hecklers. The county sheriff's office considered charging Trump with ""inciting a riot"" at his Fayetteville event, but authorities decided against it because precedent requires the government to prove that it was intentional. -- Happy Saturday, and welcome to a special edition of The Daily 202.

""U.S. officials say the plot appeared to emanate out of a group of al-Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan ...

(CNN) -- The air war: From the start of June to the end of October, Clinton has outspent Trump three to one on TV. Three remarkable stats from a Wesleyan Media Project report:  Pro-Clinton volume is one-half of Obama 2012, and pro-Trump volume is one-third of Romney 2012. Bernie Sanders has aired more ads than Trump in 2016. Campaign ads have aired 3.3 million times, and an estimated $2.4 billion has been spent on political television ads in the 2016 cycle.

While Christie himself wasn't charged, the case produced a steady stream of new allegations against the governor that are likely to haunt his future political prospects, Matt Zapotosky and Amber Phillips report. In a statement, the New Jersey governor continued to insist he had no knowledge of the bridge plan, saying he was ""saddened"" by the choices of his former allies: ""Today's verdict does not change this for me,"" he said.

(Ishaan Tharoor) THE FINAL DAYS: -- Clinton spent Friday stumping in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio, bringing a new urgency to her message as she asked supporters to imagine Trump taking the oath of office and having control over the nation's nuclear arsenal. ""Think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone with a very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who challenges him,"" Clinton said in Pittsburgh. ""Imagine how easy it would be that Trump would feel insulted and start a real war, not just a Twitter war at 3 in the morning."" -- Meanwhile, Trump traveled to rural towns in New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania, an eleventh-hour push as he seeks to win at least one blue-leaning state and dramatically drive up turnout in the battleground states. ""Don't let the pundits, the politicians or the media tell you what kind of a country you have,"" Trump said in Wilmington. ""Don't let them limit your dreams because they want to limit your dreams. You can have any future you want."" The move comes as Trump has made many stops in these small, majority-Republican towns, seeking to drive up heavy turnout by rural white voters to offset his weakness in other, more suburban areas.

It's not that Clinton has been stingy in offering policy proposals. Over the course of her candidacy, she has put forward a slew of plans, many of them incremental, to expand health-care access, make child care more affordable, raise the minimum wage and invest in the country's infrastructure, among many other things.  But what made headlines were her blistering critiques of Trump, whom she accused of avoiding taxes and ""degrading, insulting and assaulting"" women for decades. Some voters simply don't trust Clinton.

""It's the first piece of good news they have had since June,"" said politics professor Tim Bale, referring to those who voted to stay in the union. ""But I don't think anyone should be celebrating in the sense that this could scupper Brexit. But it does mean the government has lost the initiative.""    Clinton campaigns with Michelle Obama in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   GOOD READS FROM ELSEHWERE -- New York Times, ""The Closer: Michelle Obama,"" by Julie Hirschfeld Davis: ""The emails to Michelle Obama began flooding in minutes after she spoke out at an October rally in New Hampshire, her voice shaking, about [Trump's] treatment of women. Sexual assault victims recounted their trauma, fathers poured out anxieties about unhealthy influences on their sons, and a distraught parent agonized over how to explain rape to a 10-year-old. The next morning in the East Wing, a first lady who had spent years in the White House staying away from politics sorted through a thick sheaf of printed messages ... and realized there was an unlikely finale for her. Mrs. Obama had become the breakout voice of Campaign 2016."" No stranger to speaking her mind, Mrs. Obama nevertheless set about conforming to the traditional role of first lady after Obama won the presidency. ""As the first black woman in the role, she was well aware from the start that there would be little margin for error. 'She's gained confidence,'"" said longtime staffer Melissa Winter. ""I think she ultimately enjoys it more than she thought she might."" -- New York Times, ""How to Satirize This Election? Even the Onion Is Having Trouble,"" by Sarah Lyall: ""Now that it's almost over and we're all thoroughly miserable, is there anything funny left to say about this dreadful election? Even the writers at the satirical website The Onion were struggling the other morning to come up with fresh avenues of amusement. It's not that The Onion ... has not faced dismaying events before. Its specialty is finding satire even in topics seemingly impossible to satirize. 'God Angrily Clarifies 'Don't Kill' Rule' was its headline for a post-9/11 article in which a despairing God rails at the moronic nature of his creation."" But the 2016 campaign has proved particularly challenging: ""This last week is just us strafing to find new angles, to put into words how horrible this experience has been,"" said editor in chief Cole Bolton. Added managing editor Ben Berkley: ""It's hard to turn up the volume when the speaker is already blown out and everyone's ears are already bleeding."" -- The New Yorker, ""The Surreal Election Season of a Hillary Clinton Impersonator,"" by Susannah Kemple: ""The eerie excitement of looking, speaking, and living as a major political figure isn't without its stumbling blocks. Impersonators have been yanked offstage for inappropriate jokes and accused of being body doubles. For [Kelley] Karel, the earliest gigs were surreal: during a 1994 bit for NBC, she sang 'I've Gotta Be Me' in a Salt Lake City mall. Confused shoppers mistook her for the real First Lady and approached her, pleading for help with health-care crises. ... As the hysteria of the 2016 Presidential election intensifies, a more troubling threat than bullshit preoccupies Karel. She heard of another Hillary getting roughed up at an impersonation gig; she worries that she'll say the wrong thing in front of the wrong people. Scarier still, she has been pondering threats of violent resistance toward the real Hillary. 'I don't want a revolution,' Karel said. Her voice shook. 'I don't want her to be shot.'""     QUOTE OF THE DAY:  ""By the way, gas prices are two bucks a gallon,"" Obama said during his speech in Fayetteville. ""Back in '08, the folks who were running against me said you elect Obama it's going to be $6. It's $2! You notice, by the way, they don't say, 'Oh, we were wrong, thank you, Obama.' They don't say that. But I just thought I'd stick that in there to remind you: $2 a gallon!""      NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.: -- The Capital Weather Gang says today's forecast is ""peak fall"" -- AND the leaves are at their most colorful point all year: ""This is storybook fall, more or less. Yeah, it's a smidge warmer than normal, but when temperatures are in the 60s and it's sunny... See you outside! It could be one of those days where you're playing the ""find the cloud"" game. Highs are mainly targeting the mid-60s. North and northwest winds pick up in the morning, toward a peak around 10 mph with higher gusts in the midday and early afternoon."" VIDEOS OF THE DAY: Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler released a list of the biggest ""Pinnocchios"" of this year's presidential election. Check out the full list here. Quote du jour: ""Trump has amassed such a collection of Four-Pinocchio ratings -- 59 in all -- that by himself he's earned as many in this campaign as all other Republicans (or Democrats) combined in the past three years."" Here's a video recap:    Trump's team unveiled a two-minute television ad, spending $4 million to air it in nine battleground states and on nationally-televised shows. Campaign officials believe the unconventionally long ads will stand out from the noise as both campaigns ready for their final push, CNN Money's Brian Stelter reports.  Hillary for Amercia's newest TV ad is set to Katy Perry's ""Roar"" and lays out many of the reasons voters have given for turning out to vote:  The DNC released a new ad, aimed at African Americans, saying that electing Clinton will be ""a good send-off"" for Obama:  Mae Wiggins, a retired African-American nurse who said she was denied housing by the Trump Corporation decades ago because of her race, became emotional as she introduced Hillary during a rally in North Carolina:    No Trump, no Clinton.
