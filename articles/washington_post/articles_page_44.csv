Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), has purchased $11,000 of ad time in the D.C. area to support Donald Trump's choice of Stephen K. Bannon for White House strategist. ""Bannon's not like the Bush crowd,"" promises a narrator, in a spot that will run on cable stations for the next week. ""Bannon likes beating the left.""    The ad grew out of anger at Democrats who have attacked Bannon's support of the ""alt-right"" and management of right-wing Breitbart News since Trump's transition team announced his new role. ""There are all these attacks on Bannon, which are completely unfounded -- just silly attacks you could make against anyone,"" said Rick Shaftan, the PAC's spokesman. ""So we're making the case that the president should make his own picks. This is a new president with a new way of doing things."" A year ago, Shaftan and the PAC didn't see Trump that way. Courageous Conservatives PAC -- its name taken from a common Cruz phrase -- debuted with spots that attacked Trump as a pawn of big money and Cruz as a true reformer.    ""This PAC was skeptical of Trump, but the message is: 'This guy's doing what he said what he was going to do,' "" said Shaftan. ""People should tweet the president and say, 'We like what we're seeing.' Compare this to what we saw in the last Republican administration. People voted not just for change from Obama, but change from Bush."""

"   Donald Trump at the Shale Insight energy conference in Pittsburgh on Sept 22. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)    President-elect Donald Trump's new proposals to crack down on lobbyists' influence in Washington read like the most stringent attempt in recent history to rein in the booming influence industry. But the reality could be much different. Ethics experts and lobbyists say the new rules intended to ""drain the swamp"" of the special interests that Trump says control the nation's capital are rife with holes, appear vague and could be unconstitutional. And their biggest immediate impact would be to make it more difficult for the Trump transition, which is already scrambling to fill thousands of government jobs in the next several weeks, to find qualified people to work in the administration. ""It's going to be really difficult to fully flesh out a working government if you're not able to collect the talent of people who know how to pull the levers of government,"" said Democratic lobbyist Zach Williams, a partner at the lobby firm Forbes-Tate. When Barack Obama took office in 2009, he imposed strict rules on lobbyists working in the executive branch, barring political appointees, if they were lobbyists within the previous two years, from working for agencies they'd lobbied. The policy hasn't always worked. The administration ended up issuing several waivers -- including one to allow former Raytheon lobbyist William J. Lynn III to serve as deputy defense secretary -- prompting critics to say the rule was just for show. Under fire for loading up his transition team with lobbyists, Trump transition leaders have announced a trio of new restrictions on lobbyists working for the administration since Vice President-elect Mike Pence took control of the operation Tuesday. One would ban registered lobbyists from working in the new Trump administration. The second would prohibit officials leaving the administration from becoming lobbyists for the next five years. The third would place a lifetime ban on outgoing administration officials from becoming lobbyists for foreign countries. The exact language of the proposals and how they would be implemented are unclear, and transition leaders did not provide further details. Taken together, they could usher in some potentially groundbreaking changes to the way Washington does business -- but ethics experts and lobbyists said that there are easy ways to circumvent them and that the lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments could be illegal. ""Lifetime bans are really problematic from a legal standpoint because it prevents people from making a living,"" said Brent Kappel, a political-law and government ethics attorney. ""A lifetime ban on anybody in the administration ever becoming a representative of a foreign government? I don't see how that would hold up in court.""   [Trump administration will ban lobbyists, enact five-year lobbying ban after leaving government]   The most significant part of Trump's plan is the five-year ban that administration officials would face if they want to become lobbyists after leaving jobs in Trump's executive branch. It would significantly lengthen the amount of time departing officials must wait before taking a lobbying job. The ban is something Trump proposed on the campaign trail in October, and it expands lobbying-rules law imposing a one-year or two-year ban -- often referred to as a ""cooling-off period"" -- on lawmakers and administration officials joining the ranks of lobbyists after leaving government. ""That is fairly meaningful,"" said Al Mottur, a Democratic lobbyist at the law and lobby firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. ""It's not just window dressing. I don't think it's a good idea, but I think it's meaningful. It will reduce people leaving the administration from going into lobbying. If that's what they want to accomplish, they'll probably accomplish that."" But the five-year ban may have the unintentional side effect of deterring qualified people from joining the Trump administration to begin with if they know their job prospects after government could be severely limited. It is common for administration officials at all levels to join the law and lobbying industry after leaving government, because of their policy expertise and high-level connections. Such a ban is likely to hurt midlevel agency staffers the most, such as deputy assistant secretaries, who are less high-profile than Cabinet secretaries, who have far more varied employment prospects because of their prominence and top-notch network. The same phenomenon occurred when Obama was first elected and implemented a ban on lobbyists serving in his administration. At the time, some complained that it was harder to fill jobs with qualified people because of Obama's campaign pledge. ""When you ban lobbyists from going in, that's people who understand the interplay between the executive and legislative branch and how to run a government, which is the largest, most important enterprise here,"" said Williams, the Democratic lobbyist. The five-year ban is also likely to prompt some people to de-register as lobbyists before being considered for Trump administration jobs or to not register as a lobbyists after they've left the White House, even if they are involved in similar activities intended to influence public officials. One sign indicates this may already be happening. A close aide to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, Josh Pitcock -- a Washington lobbyist for the state of Indiana -- filed paperwork with the Senate on Monday to terminate his status as a federal lobbyist. Pitcock advised Pence, Indiana's governor, during the presidential campaign and has lobbied for the state since 2013, earning $280,000 a year to lobby on issues including health-care marketplace exchange rates and resources for the state's response to the Zika virus, lobbying records show. Under federal lobbying laws, people must register as a lobbyist if they spend at least 20 percent of their time lobbying for a single client. Many people who lobby do not register and instead call themselves ""consultants"" or ""advisers"" to avoid the lobbyist label. This class of unregistered ""advisers"" has been rising in recent years as the actual number of registered lobbyists has declined. ""You could see it driving lobbying more underground and people not registering, which would be terrible,"" Mottur said. ""When you don't register and you're advocating, it's worse than the transparency involved in the registration, where you know someone is a lobbyist."" ""Transparency is a great disinfectant, and sometimes these rules have the reverse result of shadow lobbying,"" he added. Trump would also impose a lifetime ban on anyone serving in his administration from lobbying for any foreign government, a proposal he touted during the campaign. But it is unclear how such a ban would be implemented. Such a ban raises constitutional issues, and would have to be more narrowly tailored to pass muster in the courts, Kappel said such a ban would have a better legal chance if it were narrowed to apply to employees of specific federal agencies -- such as certain State Department or Defense Department officials whose jobs involve working closely with foreign governments. Observers also noted that some of the ex-government officials Trump is considering for Cabinet positions appear to have violated the rule Trump is now advocating. The most prominent of those include Rudolph W. Giuliani, who runs a firm that has worked for various foreign governments and is reportedly being considered for the secretary of state, among other posts. There is no law that imposes a lifetime ban on post-government employment for administration officials, with one exception -- certain members of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office cannot represent foreign governments after leaving the agency. The reasoning is to prevent them from essentially ""switching sides"" and using the knowledge they gained while representing U.S. interests to weaken or amend the agreement to the benefit a foreign country.

Council member Deni Taveras (D-Adelphi) first proposed the bill after receiving complaints from several Langley Park-area mothers, who said units in their apartment buildings were being used as brothels and the property managers knew about it. Taveras says police told her they would like more legal tools to discourage landlords from leasing to individuals involved in sex trafficking, or forcing women and girls, often immigrants in this country illegally, to engage in prostitution. The bill makes it a misdemeanor to ""knowingly"" allow use of an apartment or home for prostitution or trafficking, punishable with a $1,000 fine or six months in jail. It passed the council unanimously last week, and a spokesman for County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) said he will sign it into law.  ""This can only stop when the property owner feels the pain and curtails this kind of activity,"" Taveras said. ""This is a mechanism that holds the entire chain of individuals, not just the pimp, responsible for what happens at these apartments.""  [Human trafficking survivors recommend changes to U.S. policies ]  The legislation is tailored to address criminal activity that police, government officials and community activists say is happening in the largely Hispanic immigrant community of Langley Park. ""There are men coming in and out of the apartments all night long,"" said Maria DeLeon, who lives in Langley Park and has sought help from Taveras. ""It's scary to know your family is only one or two doors away from it all. I'm frightened for my children."" Michael Lyles, co-chair of a task force in Prince George's County that develops recommendations for how to fight human trafficking, said gangs such as MS-13 are extorting money from forced prostitution rings, charging them for protection and providing lookouts. Men and women are being trafficked up and down the Interstate 95 corridor, Lyles said, and moved from apartment to apartment to evade authorities. Different jurisdictions have different tools for targeting human traffickers. In the District, nuisance abatement boards can penalize landlords for harboring illegal activity and benefiting financially. In Montgomery County, lawmakers have imposed strict regulations on businesses, such as massage parlors, that are believed to be fronts for illegal activity including prostitution. But the Prince George's law takes those efforts a step further by assigning criminal charges to those who ""knowingly"" sublease, assign, transfer possession, or permit use of an apartment or home for prostitution or trafficking. ""It's a crime of economics. And so if individuals are profiting from this business that's where we have to tackle cutting the head off the snake,"" said Jeanne Allert, founder and executive director of the Samaritan Women, a group that tries to help trafficking victims.  [Hunting for sex traffickers abroad by posing as johns]  The Apartment and Office Building Association of Metropolitan Washington initially opposed Taveras's bill, saying state laws that focus on property owners whose home or building that becomes a haven for drug manufacturing or sale should provide enough of a deterrent. State's attorneys can also use civil forfeiture laws to seize homes and properties where illegal activity is taking place. ""We don't want drug activity or prostitution on or near our premises,"" said Ronald Wineholt, AOBA's vice president of government affairs. ""We support prosecuting these crimes, but it's not entirely clear to us how this language will lead to stronger enforcement."" But John Erzen, spokesman for the Prince George's County State's Attorney Office, said there is no state law that attempts to hold property owners or managers criminally liable for human trafficking, he said. ""The intention is to provide a tool against those who are committing it or know it's being committed,"" he said. Critics questioned how prosecutors and investigators will be able to prove landlords or property managers know about trafficking and have done nothing to stop it. Taveras said she believes that property owners, when faced with the possibility of charges, will address problems before they become ""deeply rooted in the community."" The law also formalizes the county's system for reporting sex-trafficking crimes. Complaints phoned into the county's 311 line will be routed to Lyles's Human Relations Commission and to police. Landlords can call to find out if their property has been reported and request training workshops so building employees can better identify the signs of trafficking. Assistant Prince George's County Police Chief Hector Velez called the law a ""step in the right direction."" ""It is effective because it sends a message,"" he said. ""Having something like this puts people on notice that you can't turn a blind eye . . . and they are a part of the solution. And if you're not helping, you'll be held accountable."" "

Trump’s had practice	" WASHINGTON -- For nearly the entire week since he became president-elect, Donald Trump has been holed up in his gilded New York skyscraper. A steady stream of visitors has come to him, flooding through metal detectors and getting whisked up to Trump's offices and penthouse residence. The unusual arrangement has left Trump looking like the missing player in his own transition planning. He's left it to aides to explain the increasingly strained process and given space for allies jockeying for top jobs to set the tone during a crucial phase.  ""President-elect Trump is there receiving calls from different people. He has different meetings, interviews,"" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said earlier this week. ""We've really just been ensconced in Trump Tower trying to form a government."" Advisers have provided few specific details of Trump's schedule, leaving journalists gathered in the lobby of Trump Tower to piece together clues based on who is seen entering and exiting the building. He emerged briefly Tuesday night for a private dinner with family, but his team has given no indication of when he may next appear in public. Trump has long lived in a bubble of his own creation, a situation that could prepare him for the insular, security-shrouded cocoon that awaits him at the White House. Unlike President Barack Obama, who flew commercial and lived in a dingy Washington apartment within about a year of taking office, Trump has already spent decades living an unusually cloistered life. While Obama often bemoans his inability to take a walk or enjoy a meal at a sidewalk cafe, Trump doesn't appear to have much of an affinity for either.  ""The reason my hair looks so neat all the time is because I don't have to deal with the elements very often,"" Trump wrote in his 2004 book, ""How To Get Rich. ""I live in the building where I work. I take an elevator from my bedroom to my office. The rest of the time, I'm either in my stretch limousine, my private jet, my helicopter, or my private club in Palm Beach, Florida."" Indeed, Trump hadn't been seen outdoors since Thursday, when he traveled to Washington to meet with Obama and Republican congressional leaders. He left for dinner Tuesday without his press corps, which did not witness him during the outing. Trump was a fixture on the New York social scene when he was younger, but those close to him say he'd become more of a homebody even before he began running, preferring to camp out in front of the television at night watching cable news. He spends nearly all of his time at his properties, including Trump Tower in New York, his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, or at Mar-a-Lago, his exclusive South Florida club. If he travels outside of those locales, it's often to a place with a Trump property nearby. As president, Trump will be constantly surrounded by a pack of Secret Service agents, replacing the team of private security guards who protected him before he ran. He'll fly on Air Force One, giving his Trump-branded jet a break. And he'll be restricted from driving anything other than a golf cart, though he's said to rarely drive himself anyway.  ""To me, a great luxury is for me just to get into a car by myself and drive,"" Trump said last year. The insular world of the White House is often even more of an adjustment for the president's family. First lady Michelle Obama has notoriously chafed at the restrictions on her movement, speaking longingly about wanting to simply be able to get into a car and roll down the windows. But Melania Trump sounded sanguine about what's ahead, noting that she'd had time to get used to the bubble during her husband's presidential campaign.  ""It will just continue,"" Mrs. Trump said in an interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes. ""It's another level, but it will continue."" Trump aides say the businessman does plan to move to the White House -- ""The president is going to live in Washington,"" top adviser Rudy Giuliani said Monday -- but Trump is expected to continue spending time at his exclusive Mar-a-Lago, which the property's original owner, Marjorie Merriweather Post, willed to the U.S. government when she died in 1973 to serve as a retreat for presidents and visiting dignitaries. It has sometimes been dubbed the ""winter White House."" Members of the club, where he often spends winter weekends, describe Trump as a man of routine, who spends most of his time at the club or at his nearby golf courses, eating, mingling with guests, working -- and keeping an eye on his employees' work. While Trump was once known as a New York playboy who stuffed his calendar with galas and events, Lee Lipton, a Mar-a-Lago member for years, said that it's rare to see Trump venture to an event off-site these days.  ""He said, 'Why should I go anywhere else?'"" Lipton recalled Trump once explaining. ""'I have the best food in Palm Beach.'"" __ Associated Press writer Ken Thomas in New York contributed to this report. __ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Jill Colvin at http://twitter.com/colvinj Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The statement said the two leaders discussed combining efforts in the fight against terrorism, talked about ""a settlement for the crisis in Syria"" and agreed their aides would begin working toward a face-to-face meeting between them. Trump's office said in a statement that Putin had called to ""offer his congratulations"" and that the two had discussed ""a range of issues including the threats and challenges facing the United States and Russia, strategic economic issues and the historical U.S.-Russia relationship that dates back over 200 years."" Although Trump's statement did not mention Syria or other specific issues, it said that he told Putin ""that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the People of Russia.""   [A less-belligerent Russia might emerge with Trump's victory. At least for a while.]   The call came as Trump faced a growing backlash against his decision to name campaign chairman and former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist at the White House, a choice critics say will empower white nationalists. Since his victory last week, Trump has received congratulatory calls from a number of foreign leaders. Putin had initially sent Trump a telegraph last week expressing his desire for a dialogue based on ""mutual respect and genuine consideration for each other's positions."" During the campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Putin as a strong leader, and said that the two countries should join together to fight terrorists, particularly the Islamic State in Syria. He indicated that closer relations with Russia would keep the Kremlin from establishing tighter ties with China. Trump appeared to absolve Russia from responsibility for intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, and questioned the relevance of NATO, which has charged Moscow with engaging in provocative air and sea actions on the alliance's eastern flank. Giving Putin a free pass on those issues is directly counter to the Russia policy of the Obama administration, which has, among other things, called for an international war crimes investigation of Russia's actions in Syria. It could also undermine current European negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine, and support for U.S. and European Union sanctions. Russia is interested not only in getting the sanctions removed, but also in getting global recognition of equal status as a player in the Middle East and elsewhere.   [Obama says new president-elect is committed to NATO]   Equally controversial was Trump's selection on Sunday of Bannon. A chorus of advocacy groups, commentators and congressional Democrats has denounced Bannon as a proponent of racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic views as Trump has begun his first full week as president-elect. Trump named Bannon his chief strategist and senior counselor while also appointing Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to be his chief of staff. ""President-elect Trump's choice of Steve Bannon as his top aide signals that white supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump's White House,"" Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), said in a statement Sunday night. ""It is easy to see why the KKK views Trump as their champion when Trump appoints one of the foremost peddlers of White Supremacist themes and rhetoric as his top aide. Bannon was 'the main driver behind Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill,' according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.""   [Donald Trump plans to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants]   The statement echoed sentiments from leaders of the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, other Capitol Hill Democrats and some Republican Trump critics such as Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, who tweeted, ""Is there precedent for such a disreputable & unstable extremist in [White House] senior ranks before Bannon?"" A spokesman for Trump accused critics and the media of trying to ""divide people"" following the election when they raise questions about Bannon's views and history. Jason Miller, communications director for the Trump presidential transition, said Monday morning that Bannon has done a ""fantastic job"" since joining Trump's inner circle. ""If you've seen the president-elect since the election, he's taken a very measured tone,"" Miller said in an interview with CNN's ""New Day."" Kellyanne Conway, who worked closely with Bannon as Trump's campaign manager, also defended him. ""He's been the general of this campaign,"" Conway told reporters as she arrived Monday at Trump Tower in Manhattan to meet with the president-elect. Citing Bannon's resume as a former naval officer and Goldman Sachs executive, she called him a ""brilliant tactician."" Asked whether Bannon needed to explain his connections to the alt-right movement, Conway said: ""I'm personally offended that you think I would manage a campaign where that would be one of the going philosophies. It was not -- 56 million-plus Americans or so saw something else. . . . You should really focus on the will of the people, which was to elect Donald Trump the president."" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) sought to calm the fears many Americans still hold about Trump's election, which has been greeted by widespread protests. ""There is a lot of hysteria and hyperbole,"" Ryan said during an interview Monday with his hometown radio station, 1380 Big AM. ""I would tell people to just relax -- things are going to be fine. Trump's naming of Bannon and Priebus set up what could be a battle within the White House between the populist, outsider forces that propelled his winning campaign and the party establishment that dominates Washington.   [From October: Trump just laid out a pretty radical student debt plan]        During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   In appointing Priebus, 44, Trump has brought into his White House a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the party, and he signaled a willingness to work within the establishment he assailed on the campaign trail. But Trump sent an opposing signal by tapping Bannon, 62, who has openly attacked congressional leadership, taking particular aim at Ryan  -- who recommended Priebus for his new job. ""I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.""      Reince Priebus will be the next chief of staff of the White House. Here's what you need to know about the man with the top job in Trump's administration. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   Bannon's senior White House role has been welcomed by prominent figures on the alt-right. Richard Spencer, president of the white-nationalist National Policy Institute, wrote on Twitter that ""strategist"" is the ""best possible position"" for Bannon in Trump's White House. ""Bannon will answer directly to Trump and focus on the big picture, and not get lost in the weeds,"" he wrote Sunday night. ""He'll be freed up to chart Trump's macro trajectory,"" Spencer wrote, adding, ""The question is: Which way is the arrow pointing? It's pointing towards the #AltRight!"" Groups representing Jews, African Americans and Muslims have vocally opposed Bannon's appointment. Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said via Twitter on Sunday night that the ADL opposes Bannon's appointment to a senior White House role because ""he & his alt-right are so hostile to core American values."" Endorsing Greenblatt's message, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks tweeted overnight: ""Racism has been routinized; anti-Semitism normalized; xenophobia deexceptionalized; & misogyny mainstreamed."" The Bannon announcement came as Trump highlighted some of his first priorities in an interview on CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" vowing after he is inaugurated to ""immediately"" deport up to 3 million immigrants in the country illegally and to simultaneously repeal and replace President Obama's Affordable Care Act. He also repeated his remark that he knows more about the Islamic State than U.S. generals do, saying, ""I probably do, because look at the job they've done."" Trump's top two advisers could help him achieve different objectives. Priebus could help Trump notch early legislative victories in a Republican-led Congress and ingratiate himself with the insiders he claims to loathe but who dominate his transition team. A longtime lawyer and Wisconsin political operative, Priebus will work to smooth over residual friction from a campaign during which a number of Republicans refused to endorse Trump, reversed their endorsements or stepped away from him after a 2005 tape surfaced in which Trump is heard saying that he could force himself on women because he was a ""star."" Bannon will be the other voice on Trump's shoulder: He helped shape Trump's message on the campaign trail and relishes combativeness. The former Navy officer and investment banker has said the campaign was the American version of worldwide populist movements such as the British vote to sever ties with the European Union.   [Trump's win may be just the beginning of a global populist wave]   Bannon's appointment drew sharp criticism from political operatives on both sides of the aisle who see Bannon as being too close to the alt-right and white nationalism. Breitbart has published stories with headlines stating that women faced with harassment online should ""log off"" and that taking birth control makes women ""unattractive and crazy."" The site called Kristol a ""renegade Jew"" in 2015. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate-watch group, blasted the choice of Bannon and cited Breitbart headlines that included a call to hoist the Confederate flag weeks after shootings at a black Charleston, S.C., church and another that said that political correctness ""protects Muslim rape culture."" Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence against his former wife more than 20 years ago; the charges included trying to prevent a victim or witness of crime from reporting, inflicting injury and battery. Bannon was never convicted, and the case was dismissed. His former wife also accused him of making anti-Semitic remarks, according to a court statement obtained by the New York Daily News. Priebus said negative claims against Bannon do not reflect the man he knows. ""He was a force for good on the campaign at every level that I saw all the time,"" Priebus told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Monday. ""I haven't seen any of these things that people are crying out about,"" he told ""Fox and Friends."" Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich blasted the idea Sunday that Trump's campaign catered to the alt-right, calling it ""garbage."" In a statement, Bannon said he and Priebus had a ""very successful partnership"" on the campaign trail. ""We will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda,"" Bannon said. Priebus gave a preview of some of the administration's policy priorities: ""I am very grateful to the president-elect for this opportunity to serve him and this nation as we work to create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism. He will be a great president for all Americans.""   [It's not just the Cabinet: Trump's transition team needs to find nearly 4,000 appointees]   The personnel announcement comes as the contours of the Trump administration are starting to take shape and as he and his team pivot from campaign rhetoric to the nuts and bolts of governing. Trump and his advisers continue to paint a mixed picture of what the administration will look like, and they have been giving answers often at odds with Trump's campaign rhetoric, which included pledges to fully repeal the ACA and get Mexico to pay for a wall along the southern border, and crowd chants of ""Lock her up!"" about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. On undocumented immigrants, Trump said on ""60 Minutes"" that his administration will ""get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million. We are getting them out of our country, or we are going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country; they're here illegally."" The remarks are another sign of retreat from Trump's vows throughout much of the presidential campaign to remove all of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. By focusing on criminals only, Trump would be mirroring current Obama administration priorities, and experts say his numbers are highly inflated. Trump also built his campaign around a pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, but he said Sunday he would accept the plan of some congressional Republicans to build a fence in specific places -- something he told MSNBC in February would be acceptable for part of the border because of natural barriers. Trump again said Sunday that he will probably keep in place parts of the Obama health-care law, including provisions that allow children to stay on their parents' health plans until the person turns 26 and prevent insurers from refusing coverage for preexisting conditions. He said his administration would work to repeal and replace the law simultaneously; he said in a different interview Friday that the law might simply be amended. ""And it'll be great health care for much less money. So it'll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination,"" he told CBS's Lesley Stahl on Sunday. Trump has said that he would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, and in Vice President-elect Mike Pence he will be bringing one of the nation's most antiabortion politicians into the White House. When asked by Stahl whether he plans to appoint a justice who will overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump said whomever he names will be ""very pro-life"" and that ""if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states."" Trump also said he is ""fine"" with same-sex marriage being legal. The president-elect, who did not release his tax returns during the campaign, told ""60 Minutes"" he will make them public ""at the appropriate time."" Trump said he believes that some of the protesters involved in demonstrations that have taken place in major cities since Trump's victory are ""professional protesters"" and that people shouldn't be scared of his administration.   [A complicated past lies behind Portland's violent protests]   ""Don't be afraid,"" Trump said. ""We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don't be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time."" When asked of reports of racial slurs, harassment and personal threats against African Americans, gay people, Latinos and Muslims and others by some of his supporters, Trump said he didn't hear it but that he ""hates"" to hear that. ""I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, 'Stop it.' If it -- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it,' "" he said. Trump's personnel announcements are emblematic of the conflicting signals the new administration has sent since Tuesday's upset victory, in which Trump won the electoral college by sweeping a number of Rust Belt states even as he lost the popular vote. Trump vowed to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington, but numerous lobbyists and big-pocketed donors are appearing in the power structure he is erecting. Trump defended himself on ""60 Minutes,"" saying that these people ""know the system right now"" but that it is going to be phased out. The president-elect appears to have resumed full use of his Twitter account, which was restricted leading up to Election Day. He took aim at the New York Times, suggesting that a letter sent to subscribers amounted to the paper ""apologizing for their BAD coverage of me."" The letter did not apologize for bad coverage. Trump suggested on ""60 Minutes"" that he might not tweet as much when he occupies the Oval Office -- or just not in the way the world has gotten used to. ""I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication,"" he said.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/13/reince-priebus-named-as-trumps-chief-of-staff/	Reince Priebus named Trump’s chief of staff	"      President-elect Donald Trump announced Nov. 13 that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and former head of Breitbart News Stephen Bannon will be taking senior positions in Trump's White House. (Reuters)   President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, according to Trump's campaign. In choosing Priebus, 44, Trump has tapped a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the Republican Party. Priebus was recommended by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and will be a bridge between the White House and the Republican-led Congress, as well as the heads of Cabinet agencies.   [The next big political fight could be between Trump and Republicans]   The choice signals Trump's willingness to work within the very establishment he assailed on the campaign trail. Priebus, a lawyer and longtime Wisconsin political operative, has been head of the RNC since 2011 and is well liked within Washington after years of forging ties with Republican leaders and lawmakers. He will undoubtedly start to smooth over residual friction from a campaign during which a number of Republicans refused to endorse Trump, reversed their endorsements or stepped away from him after a 2005 tape surfaced in which Trump is heard saying that he could force himself on women because he was a ""star."" Trump had the chance to go in the opposite direction in picking his chief of staff: His antagonistic campaign chief executive and head of Brietbart News, Steve Bannon, also was said to be in the running for the job. Bannon will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor instead. As head of Breitbart News, Bannon launched political attacks against Ryan and other Republican leaders, assailing them as weak and ineffective, during the campaign. Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, also was believed to be in the running.   [How the Republican Party created Donald Trump]   Priebus had a few clashes with Trump during the campaign; after the 2005 tape was released, Priebus slammed Trump, stating, ""No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever."" But his main goal has been to unite his party. Since Trump's victory, Priebus said, the president-elect has worked to move away from his divisive campaign rhetoric. ""Once it was determined he was going to be the winner, he started looking at and thinking about that speech,"" Priebus said on Fox News of Trump's victory speech on Tuesday. ""He said, 'We're going to calm the waters. We're going to bring people together. We're not going to brag.' "" He added that Trump is a ""reflective person"" and that his public persona at rallies does not represent the complete man. ""The guy in private is the gracious, personable guy that I've gotten to know. ... I think that's part of the reason why he won,"" Priebus said. Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker who is on Trump's transition team, said the president-elect can work with both sides of the aisle in Congress -- something Priebus will no doubt help smooth. ""Trump has got to be the salesman,"" Gingrich said on CBS's ""Face the Nation. ""Take something big like infrastructure. He can work with [Senate Democratic leader] Chuck Schumer on infrastructure. He can find a bipartisan path that allows us to dramatically improve infrastructure, something Trump knows an immense amount about.""          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.
