REUTERS/Gary Cameron  The Federal Reserve appears on track to raise interest rates in December, but its plans to continue a gradual tightening of monetary policy next year could shift depending on what policies President-elect Donald Trump and Congress pursue, Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen signaled on Thursday. In remarks to the congressional Joint Economic Committee, and under questioning from its members, Yellen gave several indications that the central bank is poised for a rate increase next month unless economic data quickly sour. Yellen also said ""It is fully my intention to serve out my term,"" which ends in February of 2018, even though Trump criticized her frequently on the campaign trail. And she warned that the fiscal agenda that emerges under the incoming administration, which appears likely to include tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending, could change the Fed's calculus on how fast to continue raising rates. ""We will be watching the decisions that Congress makes and updating our economic outlook"" as they begin to play out, Yellen said, under questioning. ""Things could turn out very differently, we understand."" Financial markets appeared largely unfazed by her comments, with stocks barely fluctuating. Bond yields continued to climb on new inflation data that showed consumer prices increased last month at their fastest pace since April. Analysts have said that Trump's tax and spending plans, if enacted, could accelerate inflation, because unemployment has fallen below 5 percent and wages are growing at an increased rate. Yellen seemed to nod to those concerns, noting that the economy no longer needs the dose of fiscal stimulus that Fed officials called for in the wake of the Great Recession and urging lawmakers to keep America's long-run budget deficit concerns in mind. Asked if uncertainty over Trump's agenda warranted holding off on a December rate increase - which economists have long suggested, and which Fed officials have been foreshadowing for months - Yellen gave what amounts, in the guarded language of Fed chairs, to a fairly direct ""no"". ""My guess is that uncertainty about these measures will last for some considerable time, and we have had an accommodative monetary policy...for a long time,"" she said, adding: ""I would think that the judgment that the committee reached in November remains the appropriate one."" Most analysts read the Fed's November release as a sign that a rate increase was just around the corner. In her testimony, Yellen seemed to encourage that reading, telling the committee that Fed officials deemed this month ""that the case for an increase in the target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon."" She said growth and inflation appear to be gaining steam in the second half of the year, and she warned against waiting too long to begin raising rates again. ""Were the FOMC to delay increases in the federal funds rate for too long,"" Yellen said, ""it could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of the Committee's longer-run policy goals. Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage excessive risk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability."" What happens after the next rate hike could well hinge on Congress and Trump. The Fed has long suggested it would embark on a carefully planned series of moves to bring rates up from their historically low levels over the next few years. After a single and small increase last year, rates have remained just above zero throughout 2016. They have held off as they watched for even more evidence that the labor market is getting close to full employment and the inflation rate, which currently is running below the Fed's 2 percent target, is rising. In her remarks, Yellen said the Fed, ""continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time"" in order to reach full employment and not overshoot on inflation. She also said that ""While above-trend growth of the labor force and employment cannot continue indefinitely, there nonetheless appears to be scope for some further improvement in the labor market."" Analysts cautioned that Yellen may need to change her tune in short order, if Trump and Congress agree on a package of measures to stimulate the economy. ""At some point, particularly if a stronger pace of growth materializes in the back half of 2017 as we anticipate,"" researchers from Deutsche Bank said on Wednesday, ""the Fed may have to rethink this 'gradual' strategy."" Taking questions from the House and Senate members on the committee, Yellen addressed two other possible consequences of the election. She said she hoped the new administration would not roll back financial regulations put in place under the Dodd-Frank bill passed after the Great Recession. ""I certainly would not want to see all the improvements we have put in place, I would not want to see the clock turn back on those,"" she said, ""because I think they're important to reduce the odds of a future crisis."" Yellen also made a case for continued Fed independence, an issue that has bubbled up given Trump's criticism of the central bank and Yellen personally, and efforts in Congress to impose more oversight. ""We've really seen terrible economic outcomes in countries where central banks have been subject to political pressure,"" she said."

The shooting killed three Americans. The three slain Americans were assigned to the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) from Fort Campbell, Kentucky. They were identified as 27-year-old Staff Sgt. Matthew C. Lewellen, of Lawrence, Kansas; 30-year-old Staff Sgt. Kevin J. McEnroe of Tucson, Arizona; and 27-year-old Staff Sgt. James F. Moriarty of Kerrville, Texas. They died after the convoy they were in came under fire as it entered the al-Jafr air base in southern Jordan on Nov. 4. The Americans were in Jordan on a training mission. Embassy spokesman Eric Barbee told The Associated Press on Thursday that U.S. investigators are considering all possible motives and ""have not yet ruled out terrorism."" After the shooting, Jordan's state news agency Petra reported that the slain American military trainers had disobeyed direct orders from Jordanian troops, which led to a deadly exchange of small-arms fire. Barbee said there's ""absolutely no credible evidence"" for the claim. Jordan later issued a different statement removing the claim. A fourth American soldier was wounded in the incident, as well as the Jordanian soldier who opened fire and has not yet been identified. Brett McGurk, the White House envoy to the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group, said Jordan's King Abdullah II expressed condolences over the deaths of the Americans. McGurk also said an investigation is ongoing and praised Jordan's role in the fight against IS, which holds territory in neighboring Syria and Iraq. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

In a speech before the Pakistani parliament on Thursday, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said ""the West is at the moment with Daesh,"" adding that weapons seized from the militants originated in Western countries. ""Daesh"" is an Arabic acronym for the extremist group. Turkey is a member of NATO and of the U.S.-led coalition battling IS in Syria and Iraq. Coalition airstrikes against the extremists have helped Iraqi and Syrian forces drive them out of a number of towns and cities over the past year. IS captured a large number of U.S.-supplied vehicles and weapons when it swept across Iraq in the summer of 2014. ___ 2:15 p.m. Iraqi special forces say Islamic State militants have fired mortar rounds on government-controlled neighborhoods in eastern Mosul, killing at least seven civilians. Army medic Bashir Jabar, in charge of a field clinic run by the special forces, says IS attacked the city's eastern Tahrir neighborhood and nearby areas on Thursday as civilians were fleeing to camps sheltering displaced families. Jabbar says two children were among those killed and that 35 people were wounded, including 18 children. On a donkey-drawn wood cart, a grieving family carried the body of their 18-year-old son, wrapped in a white plastic bag. The slain teen's uncle, Mohammed Ismael, said his nephew was in the street when a mortar shell landed nearby, wounding him fatally in the head. ___ 10:40 a.m. Iraq special forces say they're temporarily pausing in their push into the northern city of Mosul held by the Islamic State group due to poor weather. Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil says clouds over the city on Thursday have obscured the visibility of drones and strike aircraft. He says the troops are securing areas they have taken with checkpoints and sweeping for explosives. Heavy fighting broke out a day earlier in Mosul's eastern Tahrir neighborhood, where an IS suicide car bomber disabled an Abrams tank belonging to the Iraqi army. Iraqi forces launched the long-awaited operation to retake Mosul nearly a month ago but have only advanced into a few eastern districts. The troops have faced fierce resistance, with snipers, mortar fire and suicide bombers driving armor-plated vehicles packed with explosives. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

How would Trump be able to do that? To start, he would have to appoint his attorney general and then order the attorney general to select a special prosecutor to look into the matter. The special prosecutor would have to agree with Trump that Clinton violated federal law pertaining to the handling of classified information. Even then, Clinton would still be allowed a trial, at which the prosecutor would have to contend with the fact that the FBI investigation of Clinton found insufficient evidence to bring a case against her. FBI Director James B. Comey said in July that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring a criminal case against Clinton.  Time frame: Trump could get the process started as soon as he comes into office if he appoints an attorney general willing enough to go after Clinton.  Obamacare      Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Now that he's won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat still might not be too easy. Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund explains. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)   Trump has pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a set of new health-care programs. Trump benefits from the fact that House and Senate Republican leaders share his goal. Congress probably can readily rescind parts of the ACA that involve federal spending, through a method called budget reconciliation -- a strategy that produced a bill early this year that President Obama vetoed but Trump would sign. This method requires 50 Senate votes -- one fewer than the GOP majority in the next Senate -- and could be used to eliminate federal subsidies for ACA health plans, the requirement that most Americans have insurance, and other important elements. Because it would require 60 Senate votes to avoid a filibuster, Trump might have more trouble winning passage of some of his health-care proposals. They include converting Medicaid from an entitlement program to state block grants, allowing insurance companies to sell policies across state lines and letting individuals take tax deductions for their insurance costs, as businesses already do.  Time frame: Quickly for portions of the ACA to be abolished through reconciliation -- as soon as the House and Senate scheduled votes. Unclear for the rest.  Waterboarding  Harsh interrogation tactics such as waterboarding, Trump said, should be used again. Trump would have to appoint a team of lawyers to come up with a law that could win court approval. Trump would probably have to restart the program under a massive amount of public and congressional scrutiny. Former CIA director Michael Hayden has said repeatedly that the agency would not waterboard again, saying Trump would need ""his own damn bucket."" Waterboarding had been a key part of the U.S. military's Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape program and was used on trainees in controlled environments. In the early 2000s the CIA hired two clinical psychologists to create an interrogation program that incorporated aspects of SERE.   Time frame: Unknown. Trump would need to appoint a CIA director willing to direct his personnel to waterboard, as well as a defense secretary willing to do the same.      Trump mused about accepting immigrants to the United States using a ""merit system"" during a campaign rally in Pensacola, Fla. (The Washington Post)    The wall  Trump's earliest campaign promise was perhaps his boldest -- to build a ""beautiful"" wall along the Mexico border to keep out illegal immigrants and to force Mexico to pay for it. To do this, Trump will have to work with two governments -- Mexico's and his own. His first step would be to persuade Congress to appropriate the money, which experts say could run into the tens of billions of dollars with Mexico refusing to pay. Trump has said he would force Mexico to pay by withholding about $24 billion in remittances to the country from illegal immigrants. But those are many of the same migrants he's vowing to deport, and remittances also come from legal immigrants. To build the structure, Trump would also have to overcome major obstacles, including environmental and engineering problems; fights with people who don't want to give up private land; and the huge geological challenges of the border.  Time frame: Trump says he'll start immediately, but given the myriad obstacles, this could take forever.  Deportation  In addition to the wall, Trump vowed to deport all illegal immigrants convicted of crimes, to remove many other undocumented migrants and to kill executive actions that protect some from deportation.  To do this, Trump has vowed to triple the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, which experts say would require congressional approval and be very costly. He would also have to appoint an aggressive secretary for homeland security who would focus on measures to make it easier for ICE to deport the estimated 820,000 illegal immigrants who've committed crimes. Trump can end Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which has given temporary protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of people who arrived in the United States as children.  Time frame: Targeting and deporting about half of the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants would take years.  Syrian refugees  Trump has promised ""an extreme and total ban"" on Muslim refugees entering the United States from Syria. More recently, he changed that vow, instead calling for an entry exam to determine ""if hate is in their hearts."" This would be an unprecedented step. The Trump administration's first action would be a directive to the Department of Homeland Security to somehow design a test that certifies whether a refugee or asylum seeker from a majority-Muslim country is a threat. The agency would have to identify which citizens from which countries would be subject to such an exam, and he would have to persuade Congress to go along with it.   Time frame: This could take two years of drafting, analysis and hearings before final approval.  Iran nuclear deal  Another Trump pledge has been to renegotiate the deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions by imposing limits on some nuclear programs in return for lifting sanctions. To pull it off, he would have to get all the parties that agreed on the deal, including the U.N. Security Council and Iran, back to the table to renegotiate some of the key tenets. If Iran deemed that to be a violation of the agreement, Tehran would be able to walk away from it altogether. Trump has said in the past that he has issues with some of the deal's ""sunset"" provisions, specifically those that pertain to Iran's enrichment of uranium. Under the deal it will be 15 years before Iran is allowed to make uranium that is weapons grade.   Time frame: However long it could take to get the U.N. Security Council and Iran, as well as Germany, back to a place where they would all want to renegotiate a hard-won deal.   Military   A signature Trump promise is to rebuild the military and cooperate with Russia in Syria.  To ""rebuild"" the military, Trump would have to persuadee congressional Republicans to roll back the defense budget sequester that affected force size and readiness levels. The sequester went into effect in 2013 but was a part of the Budget Control Act of 2011. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, this would cost $450 billion through 2026. Trump would have to find a way to offset these costs and has proposed cutting the federal workforce to help do so. Trump has also pledged to cooperate more with Russia in Syria. This effort could be modeled by creating -- much like the U.S. forces have done in Iraq -- a joint intelligence cell in a neighboring country where the two countries could coordinate.   Time frame: Rebuilding the military could take years. But Trump could direct the Pentagon to start talking to Russia immediately if generals and intelligence briefings don't change his mind.   Federal workforce  Shrinking the size of the federal government through attrition and a hiring freeze is another Trump vow. Military, public safety and health employees would be exempt. This doesn't require congressional action. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan imposed hiring freezes by issuing executive orders. Reagan issued such an order on his first day in office and made it retroactive to Election Day. These days, agencies have installed hiring freezes to avoid layoffs. Unlike in previous calls for a freeze, Trump's goal isn't to save money; it's to clean up what he calls corruption and special interests in Washington.   Time frame: As Carter and Reagan showed, this can start in a snap. Meaningful results, however, will take years.  Oil and gas  Trump has promised to expand drilling for oil and gas and lift regulations on companies that dig for coal. This responsibility would fall to the Interior Department. Trump's interior secretary would have to instruct staffers to draft a new policy on energy excavation on federal land to replace the muscular regulations that restrict the practice. That would take a year of drafts and public hearings before approval. It would be complicated by a sour energy market. Even with regulations, the industry managed to excavate so much of the resources that they flooded the market. With too much supply, global prices fell, the industry suffered losses and jobs are still being cut.   How long: About 150 days, allowing for many court challenges from environmentalists.  Climate change  The Paris climate agreement reached late last year will be canceled, Trump has said. Trump doesn't have to do much to achieve this. He could simply shrug at the nation's obligations under the accord. By failing to live up to the commitments promised by Obama under the agreement, Trump could throw the process into turmoil. If the United States doesn't honor its vow to lower greenhouse-gas emissions, why should China, Brazil or India, which is racing to supply its vast and growing population with electric energy using coal? Experts say such a move would leave U.S. international credibility in shreds, but Trump has called global warming ""a hoax"" and has given little indication that his mind has changed.  Time frame: Ignoring an agreement takes no time at all. It might be a year or two before the international accord unravels.  Trade deals  Here's what Trump said in June: ""I am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership."" He also vowed to ""immediately renegotiate"" the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Trump can withdraw from the TPP literally by doing nothing. The agreement doesn't take effect until it is ratified by all of its 12 signatories, and under federal law, Congress can't ratify the deal until the president submits it. Renegotiating NAFTA is more complicated. Trump can propose changes to his counterparts in Mexico and Canada, but they are under no obligation to negotiate. Any NAFTA signatory can withdraw with six months' written notice. But he could make trade a lot harder. Presidents have wide powers to impose tariffs or other trade restrictions without Congress's approval.  Time frame: Immediately. Leaders in Congress say TPP is dead unless Trump revives it.

It is therefore incumbent upon conservatives (like me) who have been highly critical of Trump to think through how to make a success of the coming years of Republican rule.  It begins by recognizing Trump's remarkable political instincts. As House Speaker Paul Ryan noted in his morning-after olive-branch news conference, Trump heard ""a voice out in this country that no one else heard."" Trump spoke to and for a working class squeezed and ruined by rapid technological and economic transformation.  One of the principal tasks for the now-dominant GOP is to craft a governing agenda that actually alters their lives and prospects. In the end, it was this constituency of those left behind by the new globalized digital economy that delivered the presidency to Trump. Nonetheless, this election was not just about the social/economic divide. It was also about the ideological divide between left and right. The most overlooked factor in the election is the continuing deep and widespread dissatisfaction with Obamaism. It tends to be overlooked because President Obama remains personally popular (56 percent approval in the latest Gallup poll). As a charismatic campaigner, whenever his name is on the ballot, he wins. But when it's not -- 2010, 2014, now 2016 -- the Democrats get shellacked.     As a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to dismantle some of President Obama's key achievements. Washington Post White House reporter David Nakamura breaks down what the Obama administration is worried about going forward. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   The reason is no mystery. The problem was never with Obama himself, but with his policies. Before each of those losing elections, Obama would campaign saying that his name wasn't on the ballot but his policies -- and now his legacy -- were. The voters made clear what they thought of his policies and legacy. Simply put, from the beginning of his presidency, Obama overreached ideologically, most spectacularly with his signature legislative achievement -- Obamacare. The spike in Obamacare premiums and deductibles just two weeks before Tuesday's election proved a particularly damaging reminder of what Obamaism had wrought. Hence the other principal task for the now dominant GOP: Undo Obamaism. Begin with canceling Obama's executive orders on everything from immigration to climate change. Then overturn his more elaborate legislative adventures into overweening liberalism, starting, of course, with Obamacare. The promise of a Trump presidency is that, if it can successfully work with a Republican Congress, it could turn Obamaism into a historical parenthesis. Republicans would then have a chance to enact the Reaganite agenda that has been incubating while in exile from the White House. For years Washington gridlock has been attributed to GOP obstructionism. On the contrary, serious legislation, such as Medicare reform passed by the GOP House, was either strangled in the Senate by Democratic leader Harry Reid or died by veto on Obama's desk. Beyond the undoing, there's now the prospect of doing. Serious border enforcement, including a wall, for example. That's not only a good in itself, it would offer leverage in a grand bargain that would include eventual legalization of resident illegal immigrants, an idea supported (according to the exit polls) by more than 7 in 10 voters.  Another given is a reshaping of the currently rudderless Supreme Court with the nomination of a conservative justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia. During the campaign, Trump's populism often clashed with traditional Reaganism. The key to GOP success is to try to achieve an accommodation, if not a fusion. Two agendas: one ideological, one socioeconomic. They both need to be addressed. Onto the Reaganite core of smaller government and strict constitutionalism must be added a serious concern for the grievances of the constituency that animated the Trump insurgency, the long-suffering, long-neglected working class.  If Reaganite conservatives want to head off wrongheaded solutions -- such as massive tariffs, mercantilist economics and trade wars -- they must be prepared to accept such measures as federal wage subsidies and targeted restraints on trade. This involves giving up a measure of economic efficiency. But the purpose is to achieve a measure of social peace and restore dignity and security to a stressed and sliding working class. Some might even call it compassionate conservatism. The key to success for a Trump presidency is for the Reaganite and populist elements in the party to be willing to advance each other's goals even at the cost of ideological purity. This will require far-reaching negotiations between a Trump White House and a GOP Congress. The Republicans have gained control of all the political branches. They have the means to deliver. They now have to show that they can.   Read more from Charles Krauthammer's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

But rarely in the United States have we seen an embodiment of the traits Machiavelli admired quite like Donald Trump, the president-elect. Go down the list of Trump's controversial characteristics and you will find many of the qualities the cynical Machiavelli thought were essential for a tough leader. Trump can be a liar, which the Florentine philosopher believed was sometimes a necessary part of leadership. He can be a bully, like some of the Italian potentates Machiavelli lauded. He has boasted of a voracious sexual appetite, like Machiavelli himself.  To say that Trump displays attributes that Machiavelli deemed necessary in the fractious, perpetually warring states of the 16th century is not to recommend him as a modern leader. Nobody would want a neo-feudal dictator to lead a 21st-century democracy, you might think. But the American public voted Tuesday for Trump, perhaps in part because it shares Machiavelli's concept of strength, or as he liked to call it, ""virtue.""  I came to my interest in Machiavelli in a somewhat unusual way: I wrote the libretto for an opera about him, composed by Mohammed Fairouz, which will premiere in March at the Dutch National Opera in Amsterdam. One thing I discovered in the process was that Machiavelli mocked the version of ""political correctness"" of his day. He thought most advice manuals for princes were nonsense, in calling for saintly goodness rather than strength. For Machiavelli, leadership was about the decisive exercise of power, not about morality. The prince's task was to create a strong state, not necessarily a ""good"" one.     Speaking from the Oval Office, Nov. 10, President Obama said he was ""very encouraged"" following a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Trump said the meeting lasted longer than expected and easily could have gone longer. (The Washington Post)   ""Everyone knows how laudable it is for a prince to keep his word and live with integrity instead of by trickery. But the experience of our own time shows us that the princes who have accomplished great things are those who cared little for keeping faith with the people, and who used cleverness to befuddle the minds of men,"" he wrote in ""The Prince."" The leader's responsibility was to see the world as it truly was, not as a morality play: ""A man who wishes to always do good will surely be ruined among so many who are not good. Thus it is necessary for a prince wishing to retain power to learn how not to be good, employing this art or not according to need."" Trump's hunger for public affirmation might have worried Machiavelli. Leaders inevitably want to be both feared and loved, but Machiavelli famously warned that if they have to choose, ""it is far safer to be feared."" Machiavelli's model of a virtuous leader was Cesare Borgia, who in most historical accounts comes across as a bloodthirsty and rapacious military commander. But Machiavelli thought those qualities allowed Borgia to govern decisively. ""Cesare Borgia was considered cruel, yet his cruelty brought an end to the disorders in the Romagna, uniting it in peace and loyalty,"" he explained.  Machiavelli had a chip on his shoulder, politically. He had served as a senior adviser to the republican government that briefly ruled Florence after the Medici dynasty was toppled in 1494. This experiment briefly empowered the fanatical monk, Savonarola. When the Medici regained power in 1512, a cash-strapped Machiavelli tried desperately to gain their confidence. He actually wrote ""The Prince"" to curry favor with the Medici, but they spurned it. His masterpiece wasn't published until 1532, five years after his death. Machiavelli's free-wheeling sex life contributed to what was, bizarrely, his greatest renown later in life. He became celebrated as the author of sex farces, including one called ""The Mandrake,"" about a randy old man's misadventures with a Florentine herbal version of Viagra.  In an excellent 2011 biography, Miles J. Unger writes that Machiavelli's personal insecurities help explain his deep cynicism: ""Disappointed in his hopes, burning with unfulfilled ambition, he wrote a pugnacious work that makes a fetish of strength and oozes contempt for anything that smacks of weakness or vacillation."" We live in a world in which Machiavellian personalities -- ruthless leaders with a cynical view of human nature -- seem increasingly dominant. Atop the world stage these days are autocratic tough guys, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump may be tempted to take his place beside them on the rostrum. But when he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20, he will represent a democracy whose Constitution and Bill of Rights remain the hope of the world.

A spokeswoman for Trump denied the assertion, but it raised the ongoing suspicions about the president-elect's relationship with Putin's government that had dogged his campaign with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Russia is hopeful that a Trump presidency will herald improved relations with the United States. But, in a sign of the cold realism that Putin is known for, Moscow is not betting on an immediate drastic turnaround in the strained relationship. And while Trump himself has said he wants to be friends with Russia and join forces in the fight against terrorism, he has outlined few specifics as to how he would go about it. President Barack Obama began his presidency with a similar goal, only to see progress unravel over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press in an interview in New York that Russian experts had contacts with people in both the Trump and Clinton campaigns. He said such contacts are ""quite natural, quite normal.""  ""And our experts, our specialists on the U.S., on international affairs ... Of course they are constantly speaking to their counterparts here, including those from Mr. Trump's group,"" Peskov said.  ""Of course, it's quite natural that Russian experts are trying to maintain the dialogue with people from different camps. It's very important to understand the main streams, and understand the main tendencies, nuances and the positioning of different parties, different camps here in the United States,"" he said. Peskov said Russia has ""a very good relationship"" with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and relationships with some academics and U.S.-Russia experts involved in foreign policy, which he also called ""normal."" Earlier, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as telling the Interfax news agency that ""there were contacts"" with influential people in Trump's circle. ""I don't say that all of them, but a whole array of them supported contacts with Russian representatives."" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks denied such contacts.  ""It never happened,"" she said. ""There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign."" Hicks also said there are no meetings planned between Peskov and Trump or anyone with the campaign. Among Trump's inner circle was Paul Manafort, a longtime Republican operative who'd advised a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party before its ouster over alleged corruption. Manafort left the campaign after those contacts were made public. The U.S. government believes Putin might have interfered in the presidential election. The intelligence community has concluded that Russia was responsible for hacking into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and gave them to WikiLeaks, which released them. Some embarrassed and damaged the Clinton campaign. In his comments, Ryabkov was careful not to overpromise.  ""We do not feel any euphoria,"" he said, recalling ups and downs in the Washington-Moscow relationship under both Republican and Democratic administrations.  ""We wouldn't like our public ... to have an impression that we are full of some rosy expectations. I have to say that the judgments about Russia aired by members of the Trump campaign and people from his entourage were quite tough. And we didn't see any reason to revise our view that the election campaign in the U.S. in fact saw a bipartisan anti-Russian consensus."" Still, speaking with the careful phrasing befitting the spy he once was, Putin has made it clear he expects a great deal from Trump. And, Trump has suggested he wants a far more transactional relationship with Putin than Obama has had. Trump's rise to the White House puts two men into seats of global power who are paradoxically both remarkably similar and wildly different. Trump's praise of the Russian president as a strong leader, his suggestion that the U.S. could abandon its NATO commitments and his vehement complaints about allegedly biased news media all appear to parallel Putin's view of the world. Trump has repeatedly called for better relations with Russia, frequently musing about a rosy world in which Russia and the U.S. get along. On Wednesday, Putin did the same, hoping that the ""degraded"" relations between the two countries would improve once Trump takes over. Putin noted, however, that the tension ""is not our fault."" Trump made no specific mention of Russia in his first post-election comments but made clear that he wants good relations with all nations ""willing to get along with us."" Putin would be pleased if the U.S. dropped the sanctions imposed for Russia's annexation of Crimea and its involvement in the continuing war in eastern Ukraine. That could appeal to Trump's sense that he is the master of the deal.  ""I believe that Trump is a practical man; he will lift sanctions on Russia that are harmful to U.S. business,"" Putin aide Sergei Glazyev told the state news agency Tass. The U.S. sanctions have been a strong factor in Russia's economic decline over the past two years, along with a plunge in prices for oil, its major export. ___ Lee reported from Washington.

There sits Mapfre Stadium, formerly Columbus Crew Stadium, where, on a quadrennial schedule since 2001, the U.S. and Mexican national teams have clashed in a World Cup qualifier. Capacity is less than 25,000. Many fans will watch from metal bleachers. The private boxes are barely private. It is, by American stadium standards, a bare-bones, no-frills venue. The occasion would seem to demand a high-end stage, one that could meet public demand for tickets and offer a world-class TV backdrop. But the little stadium -- four miles north of the statehouse and within earshot of 18-wheelers rumbling toward Mansfield, Ashland and Cleveland -- has become an almost-permanent location for the program's biggest home match of all. The teams will renew their bitter rivalry Friday, the first game for each on an 11-month odyssey during the six-nation final round of qualifying. Three countries will punch tickets to the 2018 World Cup in Russia, while a fourth will have to pass through a playoff against an Asian side.   [Viewing guide for this weekend's World Cup qualifiers]   The Americans aim to collect three points on every home date -- and gain a few on the road -- in order to secure an eighth consecutive World Cup berth. But the match that stirs emotions like no other and attracts the most attention is the home game against El Tri (Mexico). Once the Americans had escaped the previous round and learned the date of the Mexico showdown, the U.S. Soccer Federation began finalizing plans for Columbus. No other venue was seriously considered. ""It should always be here,"" goalkeeper Tim Howard said. ""This is where it belongs. We finally got that in our back pocket -- a place that we feel comfortable, we feel at home."" The United States has hosted Mexico in four previous qualifiers here. All ended in 2-0 victories. Accordingly, a slogan was born: ""Dos a Cero."" The USSF could sell 100,000 tickets to a U.S.-Mexico game. But by doing so, it would sacrifice home-field advantage. With millions of Mexican supporters living in the United States, the team has an enormous fan base that turns up everywhere El Tri plays. For revenue purposes, Mexico plays most of its friendlies at U.S. venues. A year ago, for a U.S.-Mexico game organized by CONCACAF, the regional governing body, the sold-out Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., had a predominant Mexican flavor. Many times over the years, the Americans have felt like the visiting team at home when facing not only Mexico, but other Latin American foes backed by an expatriate community. With a small ticket manifest in Columbus, though, the USSF has greater control of distribution: Members of the American Outlaws supporters group and Columbus Crew fans get first crack. Most other tickets go in a lottery. Mexican fans do acquire tickets and the Mexican federation is allocated a small amount. For the most part, however, ""it's an American crowd that gives us a feeling from minute one that we have an advantage,"" U.S. captain Michael Bradley said. This year's game comes with political overtones in the wake of Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election Tuesday.   [With U.S.-Mexico match looming, Howard and Bradley react to Trump victory]   Both coaches tried playing down the political angle. ""Football worldwide is a sport that connects people,"" U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann said. ""It's purely a sporting event. We have a lot of respect for Mexico and their people and their team. This is a wonderful side of sports that brings people together."" Mexico's Juan Carlos Osorio, a U.S.-educated Colombian who coached MLS's Chicago Fire and New York Red Bulls, said he can ""sympathize with what the Mexicans feel about the whole situation. However and nevertheless, my efforts are all directed toward winning that game and nothing else."" Leaders of the American Outlaws reached out to their members via a statement Thursday, encouraging the 8,000-plus members in attendance to ""focus on lifting up our team and its supporters rather than tearing down our opponents and their fans.   ""This Land is Made for You and Me""  MUST READ: https://t.co/jOPA5a16F9 #ActAbove pic.twitter.com/Lqw7RWxMpO -- The American Outlaws (@AmericanOutlaws) November 10, 2016   ""We are certainly not without our flaws and our bad apples, but our group has always strived to learn, grow, and change so we can represent the best of our country: diversity, tolerance and openness. We shall endeavor to be no different on Friday."" Just before kickoff, the group plans to sing a chorus from Woody Guthrie's ""This Land Is Your Land."" The U.S. team will seek to take advantage of the setting, cold weather and history. Four consecutive victories, USSF President Sunil Gulati said, ""is in our heads, and in theirs as well."" The first and third Columbus meetings (2001 and 2009) also began the final stage, both on February nights. Friday's game-time temperature is expected to be 43. To prepare his young charges for the Mexico/Columbus experience, Klinsmann invited three retired U.S. players employed by the Crew to address the group. At the end of his speech, Frankie Hejduk did a cartwheel. ""I don't know how many espresso shots he had,"" current midfielder Alejandro Bedoya said. Despite the Columbus hex, Mexico arrived in great position to take at least one point: a 12-1-2 record since Osorio took over 13 months ago and a growing stable of players aligned with European clubs. ""We have a good opportunity,"" veteran defender Rafael Marquez said, ""to change the story.""

And dust settles according to the laws of physics. And while politics isn't physics, the way it settles is not entirely random either. There were factors in place since the beginning of the race that were spelling Donald Trump's eventual defeat. His lurch toward a shrinking base made for great primary politics, and terrible general election politics. His flamboyant and hateful language made great ""news"" but did nothing to expand his base. The endlessly repeated refrain that Hillary Clinton was the second-worst candidate ever was eventually undermined by the lack of truth to it. Even the cravenly last-minute Hail Mary pass thrown by the FBI has now evaporated into the thin air it was made of. Clinton is hugely qualified, killed it in the debates, and assembled a ground game that demonstrates determination, organizational skills, long-term focus and, soon, results. Easy to say now that it's almost over? Nope, I said it all before, on the day of the first caucus in Iowa, and again when things were looking good for Trump. I promised to eat my last prediction blog post if I was wrong, which was a joke because you can't eat pixels, but this time I promise that if Trump wins the presidency, I will eat a paper copy of one of my many Trump cartoons."

The session in the historic capital of Cetinje was attended by 42 lawmakers of the 81-seat parliament, including members of the ruling pro-Western Democratic Party of Socialists and allied groups. It was held a day after Montenegro's special prosecutor said unidentified Russian nationalists were behind the election day plot to assassinate the country's prime minister and take over power because of his government's NATO membership bid. The Kremlin has denied involvement.  ""We categorically deny the possibility of official involvement in any attempt to organize illegal actions of any sort,"" Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. He added that Montenegro has not filed any formal request that Russia investigate any of its citizens. Some 20 Serbian and Montenegrin citizens were arrested in Montenegro during the Oct. 16 vote for allegedly planning to overthrow the government. Two Russian operatives have reportedly been deported from neighboring Serbia after they monitored Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's movements. Montenegrin officials have suggested that some opposition politicians could face legal action because of their alleged ties to the coup plotters.  ""We have evidence and conditions are being formed to press charges,"" Djukanovic told reporters on Monday. ""All this was about politics."" Opposition parties have rejected the election results, claiming the vote was rigged. The DPS won 36 seats, followed by the opposition Democratic Front with 18 seats. Democratic Front leader Andreja Mandic on Monday accused Djukanovic's party of staging the alleged coup attempt to stay in power. Mandic said the opposition had warned the state prosecutor of the plans days ahead of the balloting.  ""Apparently, he (the prosecutor) has chosen to serve DPS in their dishonest activities,"" Mandic insisted. The small country of some 620,000 people has been invited to formally join NATO next year. Russia has opposed the bid by its traditional Slavic ally and has openly supported the anti-NATO opposition in Montenegro. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
