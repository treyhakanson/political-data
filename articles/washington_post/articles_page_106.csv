McDonnell, felony cleared, to teach at Christian U	" VIRGINA BEACH, Va. -- Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell can be called ""professor"" in January, when he'll begin teaching government and policy at a private Christian university. Tuesday's announcement by Regent University in Virginia Beach comes after federal prosecutors dropped their corruption case against McDonnell and his wife following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn his 2014 conviction violating federal bribery law by accepting gifts from a wealthy businessman. The university said McDonnell will help establish a Governor's Center for Federalism and Civility, which will assist states in understanding their role in a federal society. McDonnell, who earlier served as Virginia's Attorney General and as a state lawmaker, said in a statement that his ""painful journey through the justice system"" refocused his attention from politics to people and policy.

The Christ Church Preservation Trust tells The Philadelphia Inquirer (http://bit.ly/2fbrbV1 ) that the marble ledger tablet marking Franklin's final resting place has developed a significant crack on top of the pitting caused by the ritual of tossing pennies onto Franklin's grave. Tens of thousands of coins are thrown onto the marker each year in tribute of Franklin's famous adage, ""a penny saved, is a penny earned."" Franklin, who died in 1790, is one of seven signers of the Declaration of Independence buried at the two-acre graveyard across from Independence Mall. The trust has received grants to restore the gravestone but is seeking another $10,000 for the project. ___ Information from: The Philadelphia Inquirer, http://www.inquirer.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(All times EST): 11 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden says Donald Trump's election victory should have little effect on U.S.-Israel relations. Biden was receiving an award from the World Jewish Congress at New York's Pierre Hotel on Wednesday night. He says he has ""no doubt, none whatsoever, that in a Trump administration there will be no diminution of support"" for Israel. Biden says that even if the new administration was inclined to reduce support, ""Congress would never let it happen, the American people would never let it happen."" Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who presented Biden's award, admitted he expected the outcome of Tuesday's election ""to be the opposite of what happened."" ___ 6:50 p.m. Bernie Sanders says he's prepared to work with Donald Trump to help the working class, but will ""vigorously oppose"" other policies promised by the president-elect. The independent Vermont senator has released a statement noting Trump ""tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media."" He says that if Trump ""is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him."" But Sanders adds that if Trump ""pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him."" Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, and supported her candidacy after she won that race. ___ 6:40 p.m. The White House says Melania Trump will meet with first lady Michelle Obama on Thursday morning. President Barack Obama has invited Donald Trump to the White House as the two leaders prepare for the transition of power following a bruising, often nasty presidential election. Obama's meeting with the president-elect will take place in the Oval Office, while the first lady and Mrs. Trump will meet in the residence of the White House. Obama says former President George W. Bush could not have been more gracious after his 2008 election victory and he has instructed his team to follow that example in preparing the way for Trump. ___ 6:30 p.m. Kansas' secretary of state says he's serving on President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. Kris Kobach, a conservative Republican, told various Kansas media outlets Wednesday he has no expectation of a role in Trump's eventual administration. But he says he's open to working for Trump, if offered. Kobach will help advise Trump on policy matters leading up to his January inauguration. He advised Trump on immigration policy during the campaign, adding to the Republican Party's platform Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Kobach also served as counsel to Attorney General John Ashcroft during the President George W. Bush's administration. ___ 5:31 p.m. Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan has captured a New Hampshire Senate seat, defeating first-term Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. The Associated Press called the race for Hassan on Wednesday. Ayotte says in a statement that she has contacted Hassan to concede the close race and offer her congratulations. She is thanking the people of New Hampshire for their support. Democrats have picked up two Republican-held Senate seats -- one in Illinois, the other in New Hampshire. They had been far more optimistic about capturing GOP seats on Election Day, but lost in Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri and North Carolina. Republicans are expected to hold the Senate seat in Louisiana in next month's contest after a Republican and Democrat advanced to the runoff. ___ 5:25 p.m. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he has no interest in at least one agenda item preferred by President-elect Donald Trump: term limits for members of Congress. Trump praised the idea during the campaign, but McConnell said Wednesday the issue is going nowhere in the Senate. The Kentucky Republican tells reporters: ""I would say we have term limits now. They're called elections. And it will not be on the agenda in the Senate."" McConnell also says he hopes Vice President-elect Mike Pence follows former Vice President Dick Cheney in attending the Senate GOP's weekly luncheons. McConnell says Cheney, a former congressman, served almost as Senate liaison for President George W. Bush. He says he hopes Pence, a former Indiana congressman, will do the same for Trump. ___ 5:09 p.m. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire has conceded and congratulated her Democratic rival Gov. Maggie Hassan. In a statement late Wednesday, Ayotte said the voters have spoken and ""now it's time for all of us to come together to get things done"" for the people of New Hampshire. Ayotte, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and leader on defense issues, said it was a tremendous privilege to serve one term. She thanked her family and supporters. The Associated Press had not called the race because Hassan had a lead of just 0.1 percent. ___ 5:05 p.m. Organizers of a comedy benefit featuring performances by John Oliver, George Lopez and others have canceled Wednesday's red carpet arrivals. A spokeswoman for the Natural Resources Defense Council's ""Night of Comedy"" benefit in New York said Wednesday afternoon that ""in light of current events, we will no longer be having the red carpet."" Seth Meyers is hosting the comedy benefit, where Mike Birbiglia and Hasan Minhaj are also performing. The event was originally billed as ""the place to be the night after the presidential election."" ___ 4:38 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has spoken to President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his upset victory over Hillary Clinton Tuesday night. A spokesman says the California Democrat told Trump that she hoped to ""find common ground where possible,"" including an infrastructure bill that could create jobs. Each of the top four leaders in Congress -- the top Democrat and Republicans in both House and Senate -- has spoken with Trump since the election. ___ 4:20 p.m. The FAA has imposed temporary flight restrictions over Donald Trump's high-rise home as a safety measure in response to his presidential victory. A notice dated Wednesday bars aircraft from flying below 2,999 feet in midtown Manhattan, where Trump Tower is located, and in parts of Brooklyn and Queens. It says military aircraft supporting the Secret Service are exempt, along with police and emergency aircraft. The FAA generally issues temporary restrictions when there's a special event or hazardous condition. The notice says the New York City air space restrictions are needed because of ""VIP movement."" They expire Jan. 21. ___ 3:25 p.m. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is proposing that she and President-elect Donald Trump ""put aside our differences"" and work together to rebuild the American economy for working people. A favorite of liberals, Warren has waged a bitter war of words with Trump. She's called him a ""pathetic coward"" and worse on Twitter. He's nicknamed her ""Pocahontas"" -- a reference to claims she made about being part Native American. As recently as Monday, Trump called Warren a ""terrible person,"" ''a terrible human being"" and a ""terrible senator."" In a statement Wednesday, Warren said the integrity of U.S. democracy is more important than an individual election. She said she hopes Trump will fulfill the role of president ""with respect and concern for every single person in this country, no matter who they are."" ___ 3:15 p.m. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says President Barack Obama has congratulated the Senate's top Republican about his party's success in maintaining its majority in the Senate. Earnest said Obama and Mitch McConnell discussed priorities that should be taken up as lawmakers meet before a new Congress takes office. They spoke Wednesday, the day after the election. While he did not have details about the issues discussed, Earnest said Obama will continue to encourage Republican leaders to take up a massive trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said the president believes the trade pact will benefit the U.S. economy. President-elect Donald Trump strongly opposes the deal. Earnest says the president also hopes to talk with House Speaker Paul Ryan. ___ 3:05 p.m. The White House says the President's Daily Brief and other intelligence materials are now being made available to President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and other members of Trump's transition team. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it's a courtesy that former President George W. Bush extended to President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and a few aides as they were preparing to take office. The President's Daily Brief is a classified document delivered to the president each morning. Until his victory Tuesday, Trump had received some classified briefings but not as extensive as what he'll now be receiving. Earnest says it's part of Obama's efforts to ensure a smooth transition. ___ 3 p.m. The Senate's top Republican isn't interested in rehashing contentious comments President-elect Donald Trump made about Hispanics during the campaign. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky wouldn't say whether he thought Trump's remarks have caused lasting damage to the Republican Party with an important demographic group. Trump has called some Mexicans rapists and criminals and had claimed that a judge might be biased against him because of the judge's Mexican heritage. Several months ago, McConnell publicly worried that Trump could push Hispanics from the party as Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater had done with blacks in the 1964 election. McConnell said: ""We should look forward and not backward and rehash and re-litigate the various debates we had both internally and with the Democrats over the past year."" ___ 2:45 p.m. White House spokesman Josh Earnest is disputing the notion that Thursday's meeting between President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump will have an air of insincerity about it given the harsh things they've said about each other. Earnest said ""I'm not saying it's going to be an easy meeting."" But he said the president is sincere about fulfilling a basic responsibility he has to ensure a smooth transition of power. Earnest said the success of America's democracy depends on all citizens setting aside their partisan affiliations and political preferences, and rooting for the success of the American president. During the campaign, Obama had called Trump unfit and unqualified. ___ 2:25 p.m. Donald Trump is spending the day after winning the presidency holed up in Trump Tower, where sleep-deprived aides appear jubilant as they come and go. The usually buzzing lobby of Trump's residence and campaign headquarters is currently closed to the general public, though an impersonator of the famous ""Naked Cowboy"" --wearing a robe -- was at one point spotted strolling through. The scene outside is chaotic, with protesters and a mass of press gathered in penned-off area. Curious onlookers are clogging foot traffic as they pause to take in the scene. The east side of Manhattan's busy Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th is also closed to the public with dump trucks filled with dirt forming a protective barrier outside the building's lobby. ___ 1:58 p.m. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says President Barack Obama's top priority following Tuesday's election is not his legacy. Earnest says the president is focused on the 20 million people who gained health insurance after the Affordable Care Act went into effect. Earnest is taking questions from reporters about how the election results will affect Obama's legacy on issues such as health care and climate change. Earnest says the president is also concerned about the prospect of protections being stripped from millions of Americans who benefit because health insurers are not allowed to discriminate based on pre-existing health conditions or impose a lifetime cap on expenses. Earnest says the tearing away those protections would negatively affect a lot of people, and ""that's something Republicans will have to consider moving forward.""

At several points this year, Democratic leaders predicted that Donald Trump's presidential nomination would prompt an anti-Republican wave that would sweep 20 or more Democrats into the House. Instead, the wave went against Democrats. They will be lucky to net more than a half-dozen seats. Democrats seized four redrawn, GOP-held districts in Florida and Virginia and ousted incumbents in a few more. But they could not unseat Republicans in key districts across the country, including suburban seats that they thought they could win easily with Trump on the ticket. In the Northern Virginia suburbs, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) fended off a strong challenge that generated $6 million in television spending in the past week alone. Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R) handily won a Miami-area district that Democrats targeted for months. And Rep. Mike Coffman (R) was able to separate himself from Trump in a diverse pocket of the Denver suburbs.     Democrats appear to have an outside chance of taking back the House, which they lost after the 2010 election. View Graphic     Democrats appear to have an outside chance of taking back the House, which they lost after the 2010 election.  Democrats edged out victories in a few districts. Reps. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.) and Bob Dold (R-Ill.) lost, and Democrats claimed a pair of GOP-held seats in Nevada. In New Hampshire's first district, Democrat Carol Shea-Porter defeated Republican incumbent Frank Guinta. But they struck out in many more districts, including six Republican-held seats in New York and two in suburban Minneapolis. Top Democrats have sought in recent days to temper expectations that a double-digit presidential win by Hillary Clinton might translate into House gains of 20 or more seats, taking a major portion out of their current 30-seat deficit. Several Democrats blamed FBI Director James B. Comey's decision late last month to disclose in a letter to Congress new evidence in the agency's investigation of Clinton's email practices for swinging close races toward Republicans. Clinton's lead in published polls dipped after the revelation; House results tend to be closely correlated to the presidential results.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters Tuesday that Comey ""became the leading Republican political operative in the country, wittingly or unwittingly,"" by intervening less than two weeks before Election Day. ""This is like a molotov cocktail thrown into a very explosive arena,"" she said at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. David Wasserman, House editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said there is evidence that Republicans benefited from Comey's intervention.     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted View Graphic     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted  ""Republican voters may have come home anyway, even without that letter, but it could help save Republicans five to 10 House seats,"" he said. But by midnight, with Trump appearing to claim an advantage in the presidential race, the talk of Comey's role suddenly rang hollow. Republicans said Democrats were scrambling for explanations after several missteps and faulty assumptions. ""I just think that's starting to sound like an excuse,"" Rep. Steve Stivers (Ohio), a deputy chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said. Stivers pointed to a number of Democratic recruiting missteps, strong campaigns of GOP incumbents and, perhaps most crucially, a competitive presidential race. ""In the places where it needed to be close . . . it got close and stayed close,"" he said. Stivers pointed to a closely contested seat in eastern Iowa, where Rep. Rod Blum (R) hung on to a traditionally Democratic seat with the help of the NRCC and national Republican super PACs. He also pointed to the Omaha-area seat of Rep. Brad Ashford, one of several Democrats whom Republicans think they have a chance to unseat. Ashford trailed slightly in late returns Wednesday morning. And the Democratic-held Florida seat vacated by Rep. Patrick Murphy -- who lost his bid for the Senate on Tuesday night to Sen. Marco Rubio (R) -- was claimed by Republican Brian Mast. Early Wednesday, Republicans still had opportunities to flip two Democratic seats in rural Minnesota. Democrats also targeted four GOP incumbents in California, including Rep. Darrell Issa, who occupied a high-profile role as chairman of the Oversight Committee during the early years of the Obama administration. Issa held a small lead in early West Coast returns, and other California Republicans appeared headed for victory. The limited GOP losses could be a major boon for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), who has come under intense pressure from fellow Republicans because of his careful handling of Trump's candidacy. Ryan has crisscrossed the country on behalf of embattled incumbents, raising roughly $50 million to preserve Republicans' majority. A single-digit paring of his majority could give him better standing within his conference to fend off a revolt from the party's populist wing. Republicans' biggest obstacle turned out to be a pair of court-ordered redistrictings. In Florida, former governor Charlie Crist (D) unseated Rep. David Jolly (R) in a St. Petersburg-area district, and former Orlando police chief Val Demings (D) won in another redrawn district that now favors Democrats. In another Orlando district, GOP Rep. John L. Mica, a 24-year incumbent, lost to Democratic newcomer Stephanie Murphy.  In Virginia, state Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D) won his bid to become the second African American in the state's congressional delegation, joining Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott (D).  Rep. Steve Israel (N.Y.), a former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman, said that Democrats will be unlikely to seriously contend for the House majority until the next national redistricting -- ahead of the 2022 elections. After Republicans won sweeping gains in 2010, they used their new advantages in statehouses to draw congressional lines in the GOP's favor. ""They seized control of the maps, and in this climate, they fortified themselves against catastrophic losses,"" Israel said. In 2012, Democratic House candidates garnered 1.4 million more votes than Republican candidates did, but the GOP won 33 more seats. The Cook Political Report's Wasserman said that partisan redistricting explains only some of the Democrats' poor showing, but the party has only one immediate paths to the majority otherwise. ""If they can't get 218 [seats] this year, it's going to be almost impossible to get 218 in 2018 if Hillary Clinton prevails,"" he said. ""Democrats' best shot at a House majority in 2018 involves Donald Trump winning today.""  "

The tough-talking New York billionaire claimed victories in the nation's premier battleground states, but his appeal across the industrial Midwest -- Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in particular -- sealed a victory that defied pre-election polls and every expectation of the political establishment.  ""I say it is time for us to come together as one united people,"" Trump told supporters gathered in a Manhattan hotel near his Trump Tower campaign headquarters.  ""For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so we can work together and unify our great country,"" he said, the stage crowded with family and his most loyal allies. Trump addressed the nation after sweeping most of the nation's top battlegrounds -- and created some new ones. He won Ohio, Florida and North Carolina. He also took down the Democratic Party's ""blue firewall"" by scoring victories in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that haven't supported a Republican presidential candidate since 1988 and 1984 respectively. Trump's win shocked political professionals and global financial markets alike. But it created pure joy inside the hotel ballroom where hundreds of Trump supporters waited for hours for his celebration speech. They hugged each other, chanted ""USA!"" and bellowed ""God bless America"" at the top of their lungs. House Speaker Paul Ryan called Trump Tuesday night to congratulate him on his ""incredible victory.""  ""We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people,"" Ryan, who had a rocky relationship with Trump at times, said in a statement. ""This has been a great night for our party, and now we must turn our focus to bringing the country together."" While Democrat Hillary Clinton was trying to make history as the first female president, Trump made a different kind of history as one of the least experienced presidential candidates ever elected. A businessman and former reality TV star, he is a true political outsider in a way that marks a sharp break from past presidents. Some were branded resume lightweights: ex-governors George W. Bush of Texas, Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Ronald Reagan of California, among them. But they had served somewhere -- whether in Congress, states or in a leadership post in an administration. Trump's outsider status ultimately helped him politically far more than it hurt. His political inexperience allowed him to cast himself as a change agent just as frustrated voters in both parties were hungry for change. The message was particularly effective against Clinton, a fixture in public service over the last three decades. Ever the showman, his strategy relied almost exclusively on massive rallies to connect with voters, ignoring the grunt work that typically fuels successful campaigns. Pre-election polls suggested he was the least popular presidential nominee in the modern era. Yet there were signs that Republicans who previously vowed never to support Trump were willing to give him a chance moving forward.  ""If Trump wins, he does deserve the benefit of the doubt because he was right on his chances and so many of us were wrong,"" tweeted conservative leader Erick Erickson. ___ Peoples reported from Washington.

6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/08/black-voters-and-trumps-supporters-actually-have-a-lot-in-common/	Turns out SNLâ€™s â€˜Black Jeopardyâ€™ was way more accurate than people realized	"   Voters cast their ballots and wait in line at Monelison Middle School on Nov. 8 in Madison Heights, Va. (Jay Westcott/News & Daily Advance via AP)  In today's presidential election, African Americans and the white working class will likely support opposing candidates: The former has been firmly behind Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton since the primaries, while the latter forms the foundation of Republican candidate Donald Trump's base. But these two groups arguably have more in common with one another than with the rest of the country. In particular, they have a common religious history, and they share certain views on political issues like same-sex marriage as well as a skepticism of certain earthly authorities, such as large corporations and government. African Americans and the white working class share ""a similar fundamental outlook in terms of the way the world works,"" said Eric Oliver, a political scientist at the University of Chicago. Trump has been remarkably successful in appealing to white voters who understand the world in this way. He has brought religious leaders onto the stage with him and stoked suspicion of the political establishment. But his appeal has not extended to members of other racial groups with similar views. Polling shows that these groups are divided on an issue that, at least in this election, will likely prove more influential than religion or values as voters cast their ballots today: cultural and racial identity.   [A massive new study debunks a widespread theory for Donald Trump's success]   NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" made this point last month with an instantly classic ""Black Jeopardy"" sketch in which black contestants share common views with a supporter of Trump about religion and their mistrust of government. They share an affinity for Tyler Perry's religiously themed films, raise suspicion about the purpose of iPhone's thumbprint security feature, turn a skeptical eye toward transgender Olympic champion Caitlyn Jenner, and agree that secret forces decide the election before voters enter the booths.  Implicitly, the segment raised the provocative question of how American politics and American society might be different if it weren't for the question of race. ""You can find lots of similarities. Where those two groups really separate in a very significant way are around issues of race and group identity,"" Oliver said. He added that the issue of race ""precludes that sense of commonalty that would otherwise be there."" 'Shaped by God' The similarities begin with faith. Though African Americans and the white working class have had vastly different experiences over the course of American history, they share a religious tradition, and they continue to subscribe to many of the same principles. Nationally, a bare majority of Americans -- just 51 percent -- are Protestants today, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. That is compared to 77 percent of African Americans and 60 percent of the white working class (identified by the institute as those without a college education who are not salaried). Many in both groups today can trace their traditions and beliefs to the Second Great Awakening, a series of revivals during which Methodist and Baptist preachers gained followers, making these denominations two of the largest in the early republic. Although the churches that developed afterward quickly segregated, the religious meetings were often interracial, said Laurie Maffly-Kipp, a historian at Washington University in St. Louis. ""That was part of the appeal,"" Maffly-Kipp said. ""The Holy Spirit worked in you whether you were white or black or rich or poor.""   [The non-religious are now the country's largest religious voting bloc]   Some historians argue these evangelical faiths were more democratic and that they were particularly successful with black congregants and the white working class as a result. The faiths placed an emphasis on believers' individual capacity to choose salvation and then to serve as God's mouthpiece and instrument by, for example, healing the sick through prayer. On one hand, people have had a range of reasons for following their faith. Though many wealthy Americans shared this religious enthusiasm, there was an early appeal to people who were disadvantaged in American society, said Nancy Isenberg, a historian at Louisiana State University. Race and class were irrelevant to this direct relationship with God. ""Those features are really important for people who are powerless or who feel alienated, or feel that the world has moved in a direction they don't like,"" Isenberg said. ""They believe in prayer -- that their destiny will be shaped by God, not necessarily social or economic forces, which, to them, don't look that bright, which tend to look more bleak."" The power of prayer This religious history is arguably reflected in black Americans and white working class Americans today. Oliver asked respondents about biblical inerrancy and prophecy and the healing power of prayer. Overall, 45 percent of respondents said that prayer had the power to heal. The figure was 53 percent among Trump's supporters (who include the majority of white working-class voters) and 57 percent among African Americans.     On the whole, 35 percent said that the Bible could not be wrong. Among African Americans and Trump's supporters, the figure was 49 percent and 46 percent, respectively.       These strong religious views also unite black Americans and the white working class on certain political issues. For instance, just 39 percent of black Protestants and 27 percent of white evangelical Protestants favor same-sex marriage, compared to 55 percent of the country as a whole, according to the Pew Research Center. Religion might also explain one of the more striking similarities between these two groups: their views on child rearing. ""Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right,"" instructs Ephesians 6:1. Polling data has shown that views on child rearing are part of what unites Trump's coalition. A poll conducted during the primary campaign found that, among demographically similar Republicans, those with stricter views on parenting were more likely to support Trump. Political scientists at Vanderbilt University have found that roughly three quarters of African Americans also believe it is more important for children to respect their elders than to be self-reliant. Nearly four in five favor good manners in children over curiosity. These views on child rearing, however, have not led to significant support among African Americans for the Republican candidate.   [A strange but accurate predictor of whether someone supports Donald Trump]   Oliver's poll also suggests a shared skepticism of the motives of certain elite authorities between black Americans and the white working class, as reflected in more common acceptance of conspiracy theories than in the general population. For instance, in Oliver's poll, 34 percent black respondents said they thought the financial crisis had been a scheme to extend the power and influence of the Federal Reserve. An identical share of Trump's supporters agreed.     Nearly half -- 48 percent -- of African Americans said they believed the Food and Drug Administration was withholding natural cures for cancer to make money for the pharmaceuticals industry, and a quarter said federal officials were withholding information about a connection between autism and vaccination. Trump's supporters were even more conspiratorially minded. Fifty-six percent endorsed the theory about cancer and 30 percent agreed with the claim about autism and vaccines. In a poll conducted in May at Fairleigh Dickinson University, 29 percent of Trump's supporters said it was definitely true that ""global warming is a myth concocted by scientists,"" and 22 percent of black respondents agreed.       Oliver's past research has found that there is an association between views on prayer and the Bible and belief in conspiracy theories. He pointed out that those who believe that the apocalypse is approaching might be more likely to see divine or demonic forces at work in the world, and as a result, they might be more likely to assign ulterior motives to political actors -- one of the conceits the best-selling books in Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins's ""Left Behind"" series. 'Losing out' Despite these similarities, polling shows black Americans and the white working class are divided on one issue that will likely prove more influential in this election. Among demographically similar Republicans and Republican-inclined independents, those who were anxious about white status relative to that of other groups were more likely to support Trump in the primary. Those who told pollsters that white Americans ""losing out due to preferences for blacks and Hispanics"" is a bigger problem than the reverse were more likely to support Trump, the analysis found.   [The disturbing reason why we don't believe young, black women are really doctors]   Although Trump announced his campaign by describing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists, his supporters might interpret the New York businessman's rhetoric as a defense of what they believe to be the legitimate interests of white voters. In a recent poll by The Post and ABC, less than half of white respondents without a college degree said that Donald Trump is biased against women and minorities. African Americans apparently view Trump's rhetoric differently. Seventy-seven percent of black respondents in that poll said that Trump was biased.     They also had more favorable views of immigrants. Sixty-eight percent said that immigrants strengthen American society overall, while exactly half of white respondents without a college degree agreed. Among black respondents, 84 percent favored eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants, compared to just 70 percent of white respondents without a college education. The ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch ends with an acknowledgment of the capacity of racial tension to divide people who have so much else in common. ""Black Jeopardy"" host Darnell Hayes, played by Kenan Thompson, reads the final category: ""Lives that Matter."" There is an awkward pause, then Hayes turns to the Trump supporter and says, ""Well, it was good while it lasted, Doug.""

In 1971, seated from left: Gloria Steinem, member of the Democratic National Policy Council; Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.) and Betty Friedan, women's rights advocate; standing is Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) (Charles Gorry/Associated Press)  As I dressed to go to the polls this morning, I put on three pieces of jewelry that I save for special occasions: a silver bracelet by the Mexican artist Antonio Pineda, my legacy from my grandmother on my father's side, and two enamel rings that belonged to my husband's grandmother, a gift from my mother-in-law. Neither woman lived to see this historic Election Day; my grandmother, Edna Quinto Rosenberg, died 22 years ago this month, while my husband's grandmother, Mimi Gertz died in January last year. The prospect of going to vote without some token of them, without carrying their memories into the booth to cast my ballot, was unbearable.    My grandmother's bracelet and my husband's grandmother's rings.  As the election has approached, we've read stories about the many women born before, or even on, the day the 19th Amendment became law who have lived to cast their votes to elect Hillary Clinton president of the United States. My grandmother on my mother's side, a lifelong political trooper who wore a hat festooned with a Ford car and a button declaring ""Republicans Eat Peanuts"" to the 1976 Republican convention, has been following the election avidly all season. But in the midst of this joy at the progress we can measure in a single lifetime, I've felt melancholy, too, remembering all the women who didn't live to see this day, to debate its meaning and to push the woman who may become the first female president harder and higher. I lost my Grandma Edna when I had just turned 10, but her example was clear to me even at that age. An October 1996 Cincinnati Magazine story about Crazy Ladies, the feminist bookstore and community space where she was ""revered,"" captures her political evolution. ""Rosenberg became an activist in the 1960s when a local swim club refused to integrate,"" Coleen Armstrong wrote. ""Her tires were slashed. Undaunted, she continued to be vocal until the policy was changed. Two decades later, serving on the Crazy Ladies board, she became aware of an equal need to address discrimination against women. 'Kids,' she'd say to [store manager] Colleen Ernst, 'you know I'm not a feminist. But some things just aren't right.'...'I can see her now,' says Ernst, 'dressed in her suit and pearls, sweeping the sidewalk in front of the store, muttering to herself, 'If you're going to sell books, then you'd better have this place looking good.'"" Like Edna, Mimi Gertz was born in New York. She lived there her entire life, and spent her whole career in public service, working first as a secretary for the Department of the Navy during World War II, and later in the same capacity for the New York Police Department. She voted for Clinton in the primary in 2008; after she died, one of the things my husband and I brought home from her apartment was his signed ticket to Clinton's concession speech at the National Building Museum. I wish I could hear what Edna and Mimi would have had to say about this election and this day. And they aren't the only ones whose voices, imagined and dearly missed, ring in my head. What might Bella Abzug, the former congresswoman from New York, and my mother's former boss, a woman who defended Willie McGee in a death penalty rape case as well as the targets of Sen. Joseph McCarthy; who founded Women Strike for Peace; who insisted on swearing a ""people's oath"" when she arrived in Congress, with Rep. Shirley Chisholm doing the honors; who described her job as ""figuring out how to beat the machine and knock the crap out of the political power structure,"" have made of the day that a woman proved her place was not merely in the House and Senate, but in the Oval Office? Abzug, who died in 1998, once declared once that ""There are those who say I'm impatient, impetuous, uppity, rude, profane, brash and overbearing. Whether I'm any of these things or all of them, you can decide for yourself. But whatever I am -- and this ought to be made clear from the outset -- I am a very serious woman."" I'm betting Abzug would have slapped a ""Nasty Woman"" button on her signature hat and prepared to give Clinton hell about her conduct of America's wars, among many other things. What about Fannie Lou Hamer, who at the 1964 Democratic National Convention described being harassed by the police, evicted by the plantation owner for whom she worked as a sharecropper, shot at, arrested, beaten, having her dressed pulled up by a white policeman and jailed in the process of attempting to register to vote? She was pushing the Democrats to seat the delegation from the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, formed as a challenge to the state's segregationist official delegation. ""If the Freedom Democratic Party is not seated now, I question America,"" Hamer said in 1964. ""Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave where we have to sleep with our telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily because we want to live as decent human beings -- in America?"" Fifty-two years later, her question hangs over an election defined by the degradation of voting rights in America, a contest where black women have been repeatedly named as the country's saviors. Our nation's inability to give Hamer, who died in 1977, the answer she deserved fills me with shame.    In recent weeks, thinking about these and other women, I've found myself pondering the story of the Exodus. The liberation of the Jews from Egypt is a joyous event, but it's not the end of the story. After Moses leads the Israelites across the Red Sea, he and they spend 40 years in the wilderness; Moses, and a whole generation of his people, die before they reach the Promised Land. Ostensibly, those 40 years are meant to be a cleansing period. Only those worthy are allowed to enter the Promised Land. But there's a harshness to that quest for purity, a sense of mourning for those who didn't complete the journey, who died in the wilderness within sight of home. In our decidedly more complex present, the woman who is poised to smash the ""highest and hardest glass ceiling"" is very much a product of America's own wilderness years. If Clinton enters the White House as its undisputed mistress in January, she will do deeply shaped -- and in some respects malformed -- by the trials of those decades. But no generations of waiting will produce a perfect, uncompromised woman to lead us into a new era of American politics. I only wished so many other women who wandered so long and worked so hard were alive to cross the border with her."

(David Becker/Getty Images)  The cult of celebrity has reigned supreme during this most unusual presidential race, and no we're not just talking about the candidates themselves -- one a bona fide reality star and the other a household name for decades. No, we're talking about those other celebrities, the actual famous folk who have made stump speeches, embarrassing gaffes and political Instagram posts part of their regular publicity blitz in 2016. Despite ""Wheel of Fortune"" host Pat Sajak's warning against the celebrity endorsement, the alluring star stamp of approval will likely never get old. Policy be damned, what the public really wants to know is how Chachi Arcola feels about this election. The stream of celebrity political consciousness was seemingly unending during this election cycle with one big name endorsement replacing the last before you could say ""who?"" or ""huh?"" Here are some of the standout moments that reminded us why politics and the pretty people don't always mix.    The USA Freedom Kids vs. Donald J. Trump Okay, this Mickey Mouse Club for kids who value ""ameritude!"" isn't exactly famous famous. But in the tradition of Romney Girl and Obama Girl, these youngsters who sang songs about freedom while executing cute dance moves in their patriotic cheerleader costumes at Donald Trump rallies were the first unofficial mascots of the campaign. A video of the trio singing their Trump-themed ""Freedom's Call"" (sample line: ""enemies of freedom face the music, come on, boys, take 'em down!"") at a Florida rally in January has been viewed more than 6 million times. But since their viral stardom -- they even appeared on ""Inside Edition"" -- the Freedom Kids' relationship with the Trump campaign has soured somewhat. The manager of the group is suing the Trump campaign for compensation.    Former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin endorsed Trump on Jan. 19 in Ames, Iowa. (Mary Altaffer/AP)  Sarah Palin's adjective-packed endorsement of Trump The former governor, vice-presidential candidate and star of ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"" showed up in a bright and jangling bolero jacket to throw her political weight behind Trump. And the subsequent speech she gave was just as technicolored. The 2,782 words that followed will undoubtedly go down as the most head-scratching and rhyming rallying cry in recent memory. She called on ""farm families, and teachers, and Teamsters, and cops, and cooks,"" plus ""rock-and-rollers"" and ""holy rollers!"" to support Trump, who, according to Palin, came from ""the private sector"" where ""you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the main thing, the main thing, and he knows the main thing.""    Actress and screenwriter Lena Dunham campaigns for Clinton on Jan. 9 at Eight Seven Central screen printers in Des Moines. (Brian C. Frank/Reuters)  Lena Dunham's campaign fashion The enthusiastic backing of ""Girls"" creator/actress Lena Dunham no doubt helped Clinton cultivate her millennial girl-power cred. Did we mention Dunham was enthusiastic? Her kitschy campaign-trail costume choices went well beyond the typical logo tee: There was the star-spangled drum-majorette number emblazoned with ""Hillary,"" that pearl-encrusted pantsuit with ""Vote 4 Hillary"" typed out in faux jewels on the back. Oh, and the mod dress with ""Hillary"" printed on the fabric. It was enough to make the campaign's other fashion moments -- Marco Rubio's high-heeled boots (memba them?) and Katy Perry's turban -- seem as dull as a power pantsuit.

Call them Clinton never-wearers. It all started when Perry, who's a big fan of HRC, promised on Instagram to use her body as ""clickbait to help change the world."" Basically the ""Roar"" singer shed her clothes for a Funny or Die video promoting the ease of voting. (So easy in fact that you can do it naked! Of course, you can't, though.) Madonna then followed suit with a since-deleted naked selfie entitled ""Nude Voting series # 1."" Franco joined in with his own barely there video supporting Clinton.

How about ""Joanie loves Chachi?"" Apparently Trump does. Scott Baio, the star of the '80s sitcom about a manny and his mini charges, was the biggest ""get"" at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer. Baio, a card-carrying Republican and a prolific political tweeter, told the convention crowd, ""Let's make America America again."" Later he told the Hollywood Reporter that he didn't care if his staunch support of Trump cost him his career in left-leaning La-La Land. ""I genuinely, in my heart, do not care if I ever work again. I don't care. I'm comfortable and I've got a great life, but If I don't have a country that is recognizable to me, I've got nothing."" Unfortunately, Baio's fellow B-listers for Trump have had a rougher go of it.

You're being ridiculous."" And the crowd went wild. And then the Bernie never-enders started up again. But Silverman still had her moment in the spotlight.

While Trump had the nastiest lines (bringing the word ""p--y"" into national political discourse), the TV host didn't come off so great, either, egging pre-candidate Trump on and leering at an actress on set.

China's top legislature effectively disqualified two newly elected Hong Kong lawmakers for failing to take an oath of allegiance to the territory's mini-constitution and instead advocating independence. The move was seen as a major blow to the territory's cherished autonomy and judicial independence. Beijing's decision, flagged in advance, sparked angry protests in Hong Kong on Sunday, with thousands of people taking to the streets in a demonstration reminiscent of the much larger pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in 2014.  Police used batons and pepper spray to beat back protesters, and four people were arrested. The latest troubles in Hong Kong flared after the two elected lawmakers, from a new pro-independence party, altered the oaths administered before taking their seats in the country's Legislative Council -- inserting a disparaging Japanese term for China, vowing to defend the ""Hong Kong nation"" and displaying a flag that read ""Hong Kong is not part of China.""  The oaths were ruled invalid, and attempts to redo them sparked chaos in the legislature.  On Monday, Beijing put its foot down.  [Beijing took a hard line on Hong Kong, and it may have backfired]  The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) issued its own ""interpretation"" of the Basic Law -- Hong Kong's mini-constitution, agreed to during the 1997 handover from British rule -- an interpretation it said was binding on the territory.  Any lawmakers who fail to take the oath of allegiance properly and violate the oath will be disqualified and will face legal consequences, it said. ""Retaking the oath is out of the question once the initial oath-taking process has breached the legal requirements and been ruled invalid,"" said Li Fei, chairman of the NPC's Basic Law Committee. The central government, he said, ""is determined to firmly confront the pro-independence forces without any ambiguity."" Advocating ""separatism"" is not a matter of political opinion but a major legal issue, Li said, and those doing so will need to be punished by law. ""Traitors of the country will not have good endings,"" he said. The question of whether the two lawmakers -- Sixtus Leung, 30, and Yau Wai-ching, 25, of the Youngspiration party -- had the right to retake the oath was already being considered in a court in the southern Chinese territory.  The Hong Kong Bar Association warned last week that any intervention by Beijing would deal a ""severe blow"" to the city's judicial independence and undermine international confidence in its autonomy. Lawyers and barristers are already planning a ""silent march"" through Hong Kong on Tuesday. While the NPC does have the right to interpret the Basic Law, it should not have done so while Hong Kong courts were actively considering the case, argued Johannes Chan, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong.  ""The implication is that 'I don't trust the courts, so I had better tell you what you should decide,' "" he said. ""So why should anyone trust the legal system?"" Hong Kong's independent legal system stands at the heart of the ""one country, two systems"" model under which the territory was granted significant autonomy from Beijing. Beijing's move dealt that model a ""fatal blow,"" Chan said, and set the stage for further confrontation between the pro-democracy and pro-Beijing camps in the weeks ahead. ""I am very pessimistic, and I think it will get worse,"" said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmaker. ""For Beijing, as soon as something starts, they want to shut it down,"" she said. ""This is the act of a coward."" On Sunday, thousands of people marched through Hong Kong to voice their opposition to China's decision to step in, holding signs saying ""Defend the Rule of Law"" and demanding that the territory's Beijing-backed chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, step down. Police put the number at 8,000, but organizers estimated that 13,000 people attended. In the evening, a smaller crowd gathered outside the Chinese government's ""liaison office"" in Hong Kong and was faced by hundreds of helmeted police officers carrying shields. Protesters tried several times to charge through police lines but were forced back, according to news agency reports. Police said they later took action to clear the streets and disperse the protesters. Two police officers were injured, one hit in the leg by a brick thrown from the crowd. Some protesters wore masks and held umbrellas, in a deliberate echo of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, which staged a long sit-in to demand full democracy for the territory.  But the extent of sympathy for the protests this time is unclear. Although many Hong Kongers fiercely guard the territory's autonomy and would like to see greater democracy, only a small minority back the call for independence. Beijing's intervention is likely to anger many Hong Kongers and might swell the protesters' ranks. Others, though, will probably condemn the protesters as troublemakers and dismiss their demands as unrealistic or undesirable. In the South China Morning Post, political editor Gary Cheung wrote last week that the ""antics"" of the two lawmakers ""only play into the hands of Beijing hardliners."" Columnist Alex Lo also complained that their ""childish display of defiance"" would result in a further erosion of the authority of Hong Kong's courts. ""We all know that all-out antagonism of Beijing is just a lose-lose proposition,"" he wrote. Chan, the law professor, said Beijing's response would lead to more polarization of opinion.  ""Very few people support what the two candidates have done, but this interference in the court process also generates a lot of resentment,"" he said.
