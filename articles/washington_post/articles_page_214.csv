The Virginian-Pilot (http://bit.ly/2gmRmMK ) reports that Chief Michael Goldsmith announced in an email to the department Thursday night that he will move to City Hall to become a deputy city manager. There, he will deal with public safety and neighborhood issues. Deputy Chief Larry Boone will replace Goldsmith as chief of police. Boone will assume his new role on Dec. 1. Goldsmith says Boone will help bridge the gap between the police and community. The move comes four months into Mayor Kenny Alexander's term. Alexander had previously expressed concerns about the police department, saying it lacked transparency. In August, the city decided to turn over investigations of fatal police shootings to the Virginia State Police. ___ Information from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
