The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump ""70 News"" site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to ""70 News"" remained prominent in its results. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College's decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton's lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump's election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren't passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election's aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its ""trending"" news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as ""crazy "" in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that ""more than 99 percent of what people see"" on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what's blatantly wrong isn't always an easy task.  ""Identifying the 'truth' is complicated,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted."" The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google's search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. ""In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,"" the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics.  ""What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm,"" Doctor said. ""These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings."" It's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research's survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The exhumations are part of a new investigation into the crash ordered by Poland's conservative ruling party, Law and Justice, which is led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the late president's twin brother. Post-mortems will be carried out to determine the cause of the deaths and of the crash, identify all the remains and check for explosives, since some of Kaczynski's followers believe that a planned blast downed the aircraft, killing all 96 aboard. Kaczynski has cast doubt on earlier investigations -- carried out by both Poland and Russia -- which concluded that the crash was an accident caused primarily by bad weather and pilot error. Kaczynski has for years encouraged a conspiracy theory suggesting Russia carried out an assassination with the support, or at least the consent, of the Polish prime minister at the time -- Donald Tusk, now the president of the European Council. Kaczynski wants to take Tusk, his nemesis, to court and is seeking evidence against him.  ""There will not be a free Poland, a truly free Poland, without the truth, without a proper honoring of those who died, without a closure of this case which has cast such a long shadow on our national and social life,"" Kaczynski said last Thursday. The bodies of Kaczynski and his wife, Maria Kaczynska, were being removed from their alabaster tomb at the Wawel Cathedral in Krakow, the resting place of many of Poland's kings and writers. Jaroslaw Kaczynski and the presidential couple's daughter, Marta Kaczynska, and experts were seen arriving at the site to attend the exhumation. Priests were to say prayers during the procedure. The media had no access to the site The remains were to be taken in hearses to a forensics laboratory at Krakow's renowned Jagiellonian University for a series of tests, including computer tomography and DNA tests. Scientists will also look for the presence of explosives to check the belief held by many Kaczynski supporters that the plane, a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154 operated by the Polish air force, disintegrated in mid-air in an intended explosion. Prosecutors say they plan to exhume and perform similar post-mortems on a total of 83 bodies through the end of 2017. Four bodies were cremated, while nine other bodies were already exhumed in 2011 and 2012 after families protested major errors in autopsy reports carried out by the Russians right after the crash. It turned out six victims had been buried in the wrong graves. The Russians have said the mistakes occurred due to the fragmented state of the bodies, but to many Poles they are proof of wrongdoing by the Russians, suspicions fueled by Moscow's refusal so far to return the plane's wreckage and the flight recorders to the Poles. Law and Justice, which assumed power a year ago, says Tusk's team neglected to have each of the bodies examined, out of disregard for the late president, a political rival, and out of concern that the findings could anger Russian President Vladimir Putin -- something Tusk and members of his Civic Platform party deny. The exhumations are proving controversial, with most Poles dismissive of the conspiracy theories, and some relatives aghast at the thought of their loved ones being exhumed.  ""We stand alone and helpless in the face of this ruthless and cruel act,"" the relatives of 17 victims wrote in an open letter.  ""The forceful exhumations constitute a violation of a taboo existing in our culture that calls for the respect of the bodies of the dead,"" said Malgorzata Rybicka, the widow of Arkadiusz Rybicki, a lawmaker with Civic Platform, in an interview with the Tygodnik Powszechny Catholic magazine. ""It also shows the lighthearted approach to the feelings of the families."" However, Malgorzata Wasserman, daughter of Zbigniew Wasserman, a lawmaker who perished, called the exhumations ""a procedural must"" given that Poland carried out no autopsies as the stunned nation watched the dozens of coffins, draped in white-and-red national flags, arrive from Russia in 2010. The Russian autopsy report on her father described him as having the healthy liver of a young man when in fact the 60-year-old had only part of his liver left after an operation. The tragedy occurred April 10, 2010, when the presidential delegation was traveling to honor 22,000 Polish officers who were murdered by the Soviet secret police at the start of World War II in the Katyn forest and elsewhere. The delegation included government members, lawmakers, military commanders and the relatives of officers slain in the wartime massacre. The symbolism of the mission only added to the national grief and the suspicions. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In a commutation application released by her attorneys, the transgender soldier said there was no historical precedent for such an extreme sentence for the leak of secret documents. Manning was arrested in 2010 and convicted in 2013 in military court of six Espionage Act violations and 14 other offenses for leaking more than 700,000 secret military and State Department documents, plus some battlefield video to WikiLeaks. At that point she was known as Bradley Manning. She is in custody at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Manning, who was an intelligence analyst in Iraq, acknowledged leaking the documents but said it was intended to raise public awareness about the impact of war on innocent civilians. She later filed a transgender prisoner rights lawsuit and has tried to commit suicide multiple times citing her treatment behind bars.  ""I am living through a cycle of anxiety, anger, hopelessness, loss and depression,"" she wrote in her application, dated Nov. 8. ""I cannot focus. I cannot sleep."" Retired Air Force Col. Morris D. Davis, a 25-year-veteran who was chief prosecutor for the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay for two years, said much of the information Manning leaked had little value and could be found through open sources on the internet. Davis, who now serves as an administrative law judge for the U.S. Labor Department, wrote a letter attached to Manning's application that called the 35-year sentence far too harsh for releasing documents whose impact six years later ""could fairly be described as inconvenience and embarrassment."" ACLU attorney Chase Strangio said his hope is that Obama commutes the sentence and cements his legacy as a president who stood up for society's most vulnerable people.  ""She has lived under incredibly harsh conditions the last six years and spent more time in prison than anyone in U.S. history for giving information to the public,"" Strangio said. ""I'm worried she won't survive much longer in these conditions. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

But who are they really? The answer varies from state to state. The crowds include high school students, immigrants and anarchists.  ""There's no professional protesters here,"" said Jennie Luna, a 40-year-old professor of Chicano studies at California State University-Channel Islands, just north of Los Angeles. The day after the election, she organized what she called a ""self-care circle of courage"" on campus for students who needed an outlet for their distress over Trump's win. The event morphed into a rally and march that lasted several hours.  ""I am fearful for what will happen to the undocumented, I'm fearful of losing my reproductive rights,"" she said. ""And I'm fearful of the unknown."" America's new president has made many promises about changes to ""make America great again,"" such as undoing some regulations on companies. He has also made pronouncements that have struck fear within certain groups of Americans -- women, Latinos, people with disabilities and racial minorities, among them. The protests that have spread across the nation are against Trump, but more pointedly, they are expressions of concern about how personal lives could change. Isadora Clemente Zurie, 21, was among those at a Thursday night protest in Salt Lake City, Utah, riding in her wheelchair with the crowd.  ""I'm disabled and I'm LGBT. I've been bullied all my life"" she told The Salt Lake Tribune. ""Now I'm in a world where for just being me, I could lose my entire life."" College students whose parents moved to the United States illegally are worried that Trump will follow through with his threat to rescind President Obama's executive order that protects young immigrants from deportation. At a Thursday night protest in Philadelphia, 23-year-old Jeanine Feito held a sign that read ""Not 1 More Deportation."" Protest organizers are using a tool that Trump made such effective use of -- social media. Tweets and Facebook posts have called people to demonstrations across the country. Trump's election spawned a popular new hashtag: ""NotMyPresident."" Izzy Steel had never participated in a protest until this week, when she demonstrated outside Trump Tower in Chicago. Bothered by Trump's statements about women and immigrants, the 23-year-old acting student, who voted for Hillary Clinton, heard about the event on Facebook.  ""Even when you lose, it's important to show you're not defeated,"" Steel said. ""It was more about showing that we won't lie down or succumb to the hatred."" She planned to protest again in the coming weeks.  ""I'm just more humiliated than anything that he is representing my country,"" she said. Some of the protests are occurring in cities with a history of political activism such as Portland. In the 1990s, the staff of then-President George H.W. Bush dubbed the city ""Little Beirut"" because of the demonstrations his visits provoked. An organizer of the Portland anti-Trump protests is 23-year-old Gregory McKelvey, who has been a spokesman for the black activist group Don't Shoot Portland. At a Thursday night protest by about 4,000 people, masked anarchists marching with the otherwise peaceful protesters smashed Portland store windows with baseball bats, among other acts of mayhem. The protest became a riot and ended with 25 arrests. On Friday, McKelvey defended the demonstration.  ""It was our aim to channel the shared frustration, fear and anger that is so alive among so many of us,"" he said in statement. He disavowed the rioters: ""The violent actions that occurred last night had absolutely nothing to do with our group."" In Louisville, Kentucky, 23-year-old Mallie Feltner looked online for an event to vent her frustration but found none. So she decided to organize her own. The call spread through social media and more than 1,000 people showed up Thursday night. They chanted about women's rights, gay rights, the rights of immigrants and African-Americans.  ""My focus is showing solidarity to all of the people who felt disheartened and afraid like I did Wednesday morning,"" she said. ""I want them to feel heard. I want them to know I'm not going to become complicit in it."" The last time 65-year-old Leslie Holmes participated in protests was in San Francisco in the 1970s, during the Vietnam War. That changed with Trump's election. The website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, a registered Democrat and Hillary Clinton supporter, took an hourlong train ride to New York City to participate in demonstrations on Friday.  ""I think the progress we've made in the past eight years is something that's really worth defending,"" she said. ""This is the first time in 40 years I really felt motivated to put myself on the line."" ___ Associated Press writers Amanda Lee Myers in Los Angeles; Claire Galofaro in Louisville, Kentucky; Sophia Tareen in Chicago; and freelancer Dake Kang in New York City contributed to this report. ___ Follow Terrence Petty on Twitter at http://twitter.com/APOregonPetty .

Trump built his campaign message around bold vows to, among other things, force Mexico to pay for a massive border wall, fully repeal the Affordable Care Act and ban Muslims from entering the United States. But in the days since his upset election victory, he or his advisers have suggested that those proposals and others may be subject to revision. On President Obama's health-care law, for example, Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Friday that he would like to keep some parts of the law intact and may seek to amend the statute rather than repeal it. Trump said he came to the conclusion after Obama, during Trump's Oval Office visit Thursday, suggested areas of the law that should be preserved. Trump suggested provisions that prevent insurers from refusing coverage for preexisting conditions and which allow children to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26 should stay. ""I like those very much,"" he said. In the same interview, Trump also avoided answering whether he would follow through on a campaign vow to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. ""It's not something I've given a lot of thought, because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform,"" he said.     The Post's Marc Fisher explains how some of President-elect Donald Trump's traits could inform his leadership style when he takes office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)    [Trump health-care agenda evolves toward mainstream GOP thinking]  That ambivalent tone is a far cry from Trump's sweeping rhetoric on the campaign trail, where he repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace the ACA and led crowds in chants of ""Lock her up!"" in reference to Clinton. His lack of clarity on these and other issues has added more uncertainty to a tumultuous presidential transition, as he scrambles to build a team.  There is also no guarantee that Trump will not return to his previous positions. In August, he appeared to consider softening his proposal to deport millions of illegal immigrants en masse, only to give a rousing speech retaining his hard-line stance. With little clarity from Trump himself, some of his surrogates and advisers have given a mixed view of what Trump will hope to accomplish in his first 100 days in office, discounting some of his most well-known proposals. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, cast doubt this week on whether the new president would seek to have Mexico fund his proposed border wall -- a pledge that inspired regular chants of ""Build that wall!"" during campaign rallies. ""He'll spend a lot of time controlling the border. He may not spend very much time trying to get Mexico to pay for it, but it was a great campaign device,"" Gingrich said Thursday during a conference call sponsored by Dentons, a global law firm. Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a close adviser to Trump, sounded certain that the wall would be built -- but was far from clear about the timeline. He said during an interview on CNN Thursday that he thinks Trump should prioritize tax reform in his first 100 days rather than issues such as building the border wall.      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   ""The wall is going to take a while,"" Giuliani said. ""Absolutely he's going to build it; it's a campaign promise. He's not going to break a campaign promise.""  [Pence replaces Christie as leader of Trump transition effort]  On deportations, the campaign has yet to detail how many undocumented immigrants might be targeted for immediate removal by the Trump administration. The number could range from 1 million to 6 million, according to various priorities Trump outlined over time throughout the campaign. During the GOP primaries, he repeatedly said that all of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants would have to leave. Other proposals also carry constitutional and ethical implications. After calling for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" in 2015, Trump recast the idea this year as encompassing countries that have been ""compromised by terrorism."" He has not been clear about what is on the table now that he will be the president. After exiting a meeting with Republican leaders Thursday on Capitol Hill, Trump was asked by reporters to list his top three priorities after taking office. He mentioned securing the border, health-care reform and job creation. ""Will you ask Congress to ban all Muslims from entering the country?"" a reporter asked. Trump appeared to hear the question before thanking everybody and walking away. Trump said during the campaign that he would reinstate the use of waterboarding against terrorism suspects -- a practice that Congress made illegal after its use during the George W. Bush administration. But former House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) said this week that Trump's waterboarding remarks were just ""campaign talk,"" according to CNN. The future president, who ran on an anti-establishment message, also faces pressure to accede to conservative orthodoxies that run counter to promises he made on the campaign trail. Speaking about the months ahead, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) signaled this week that he would consider cutting Medicare, arguing that the program ""is going broke"" and would need to be reformed at the same time Republicans repeal Obamacare. That, however, would contradict Trump's vows not to touch entitlement programs. Ryan has proposed turning Medicare into a ""premium support"" model, which would involve doling out federal subsidies for private insurance rather than the current single-payer model.   [Many of Trump's sweeping promises will be hard, if not impossible, to fulfill]  On international trade, it remains unclear whether Trump will follow through on his recommendations for punitive tariffs against China. Trump made a point throughout his campaign of trashing the Chinese for devaluing their currency, and said on occasion that he would put a tax on goods from China as a retaliation. ""The tax should be 45 percent,"" he told the New York Times in January, a figure he used on several occasions. But senior policy adviser Wilbur Ross, who has consulted with Trump on his first 100 days, sought to walk back those campaign claims during an interview this week with Yahoo Finance, denying that Trump had made the suggestion. ""He's been misquoted about the 45 percent on China. Everybody says, 'Oh, he's going to slap 45 percent tariff on everything out of China.' That's not what he said, and it's not what he intends,"" Ross said. ""What he actually said was if it turns out that the Chinese yuan is 45 percent overvalued, or as much as 45, and if they won't negotiate with us, then it may become necessary as a negotiating measure to threaten them with as much as a 45 percent tariff."" Trump has railed against the Iranian nuclear deal, promising to undo and renegotiate the agreement as it currently stands. In October, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said a Trump administration would ""rip up the Iran deal.""  But Trump's advisers have been vaguer on the topic this week. "" 'Ripping up' is maybe a too strong of word. He's gonna take that agreement, it's been done before in international context, and then review it,"" Trump adviser Walid Phares told the BBC Thursday. ""He will take the agreement, review it, send it to Congress, demand from Iranians to restore few issues or change few issues. And there will be a discussion; it could be a tense discussion.""  ""But the agreement as is right now . . . is not going to be accepted by a Trump administration,"" Phares said. Trump indicated this year that he would move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, which his campaign said in a statement was ""the eternal capital of the Jewish People"" that must be recognized ""as the undivided capital of the state of Israel.""  Phares hedged during the BBC interview and said that Trump had committed to doing it only ""through consensus."" Palestinian leaders would not support such a plan. But Trump adviser David Friedman told the Jerusalem Post on Wednesday, ""It was a campaign promise, and there is every intention to keep it."" "

He was confident that Donald Trump, whom he'd endorsed despite the nominee's frequent protests, would win the presidency. He was confident that his own race for the Senate would break his way, too, despite a late start and media coverage that treated him like a curiosity. ""I've always got three or four times what I've got in any poll,"" the former Klansman said. ""It happened last time I ran for Congress, in 1999."" But Trump, who was polling strongly in states across the country Tuesday night and who easily won Louisiana, provided no lift for Duke, undermining the suggestion that Trump's candidacy, with its appeal to white voters, could be a political boon for the far right. Duke had not won office since George H.W. Bush was president. He had never risen higher than the state legislature -- his runs for U.S. Senate and governor drew national attention and ended in landslide defeats. And Duke's latest bid for the Senate was equally unpopular, according to early returns, which had him at about 3 percent. From the first day of his presidential campaign, with his warning about Mexico ""not sending their best"" immigrants across the border, Trump echoed some of the rhetoric that white nationalists had pitched for decades. He never made the strategy explicit. He rejected accusations that his was a racial appeal and denounced Duke specifically, with greater intensity every time he was brought up. In the final week of the campaign, Trump's son Eric said Duke deserved a ""bullet,"" and conservative commentator Ann Coulter, who had backed Trump from the outset, joked that Duke existed only when Democrats needed him.  [What's the alt-right? A primer.]  But the strategy Trump used to come closer to the presidency than any poll had predicted, and any Republican strategist thought possible, was still one people like Duke had dreamed of. White nationalists had argued that the Republican Party should double down on whites instead of trying to appeal to minorities -- indeed, that it had only a few years to do so before being overwhelmed by nonwhites. Jared Taylor, the editor of American Renaissance, wrote column after column, and was ostracized from conference after conference, for saying so. But voters in Louisiana drew a sharp distinction between Trump and Duke. They embraced the presidential candidate while rejecting Duke's efforts to ride his coattails. The vote could ease concerns that Trump would mainstream some of the white-supremacist movements or ideas that have long existed on the far edges of American politics. In the early 1980s, when nonwhites made up a far smaller proportion of the electorate, Duke imagined an America that could officially segregate them: Cubans around Miami, blacks in a stretch of the old South. ""The exploding numbers of nonwhites are slowly wrapping formerly white nations in a dark human cocoon,"" Duke wrote in 1983. ""Should a butterfly emerge, or a beast that has haunted the ruins of every great white civilization that submitted to invasion by immigration and racial miscegenation?"" When he entered politics, Duke's tone softened. As a vote-winning politician, he proposed drug tests for welfare recipients, inveighed against Japan taking American jobs and attacked affirmative action. When he went statewide, however, he faltered. Duke's simple solutions were punctured by journalists who wanted to see how his philosophy could apply to people's lives. And the process repeated itself Tuesday. After giving out the address of his election night party, at his home north of Lake Ponchartrain, Duke changed course. The party would be limited to family and friends, as the Senate race was falling short of expectations. But Trump was more than making up for that. ""This is a historic moment,"" Duke said. ""If he goes on to win this race, it is a vital victory for taking America back.""  Read more:        "

Young (R-Ind.) thanks supporters after winning his race at an election night rally in Indianapolis on Tuesday. (Michael Conroy/AP)  The Senate will remain in Republican control, after Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) beat out his Democratic challenger, Jason Kander, dashing the Democrats' hopes of a return to power in Congress next year. The House will also remain in Republican control next year, after Democrats made only modest pickups there. While a couple of races were still outstanding as of 5:30 a.m. Wednesday, Republican wins in competitive states left no viable pathway for Senate Democrats to seize control from the GOP, despite earlier polling that suggested they were likely to do so. Under a Donald Trump presidency, a Republican Congress and White House will be able to attempt sweeping rollbacks of President Obama's landmark policies, including the health-care law known as Obamacare and last year's nuclear deal struck with Iran. The Senate Democrats' threat of a filibuster would, in many instances, be the only viable way to block such legislative efforts. Democrats had to pick up at least four seats if Hillary Clinton became president, and five under Trump, to seize the Senate majority. They never came close.   [Trump's White House win promises to reshape U.S. political landscape]   Democrats picked up only one seat, in Illinois, where current Rep. Tammy Duckworth unseated incumbent Republican Sen. Mark Kirk. Of the competitive races, it was the seat most likely to flip to Democratic control. Democrats also won a competitive Senate race in Nevada, where former state attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto beat Republican Rep. Joseph J. Heck. But the seat, which is being vacated by retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid, already belonged to Democrats. Democrats maintained a shot early Wednesday at eking out a victory in New Hampshire, where Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan were running neck-and-neck with almost 90 percent of precincts reporting. But elsewhere, Democrats did not score the victories they had hoped for. In Pennsylvania, Republican incumbent Sen. Patrick J. Toomey flouted almost all polling in the days before the election showing him closely losing to his Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty, while in Wisconsin, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson defeated former senator and favored Democratic candidate Russ Feingold to hold onto his seat. North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr prevailed after coming under a serious challenge from Democrat Deborah Ross, holding an important seat for the GOP. Burr, the Senate's top Republican on intelligence matters, including cybersecurity, has comfortably kept his seat for two terms. Democrats had hoped to oust him in a wave of swing-state victories to take back the Senate majority. Democrats also suffered losses in other Senate races they had sought to contest more closely during the campaign season. Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain cruised to an easy victory Tuesday night over his Democratic challenger, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, despite months of polls showing the two were neck-and-neck. McCain had broken ahead of Kirkpatrick in the most recent polls, but the race was still considered to be among the more competitive ones in the country. And in Indiana, Republican Rep. Todd C. Young beat Democrat Evan Bayh, who served two terms in the Senate and hails from one of Indiana's most powerful political families. He was recruited as one of the Democrats' stronger candidates but ultimately fell short against Young, a three-term congressman from the southern part of the state.      The Fix's Chris Cillizza breaks down why Republican Todd Young's win in Indiana's Senate race is important. Young defeated Democrat Evan Bayh, a former Indiana governor who held the Senate seat for 12 years. (The Washington Post)   In Florida, Republican Marco Rubio, who ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign earlier this year, was also reelected to his Senate seat Tuesday night, keeping it in the GOP's column as he overcame a challenge from Democrat Rep. Patrick Murphy. House races in Florida yielded mixed results. Florida Democrat Stephanie Murphy staged an upset against one of the GOP's veteran members, Republican John L. Mica, who has held his seat since 1993. Mica's race in part was fueled by redistricting that led to a defeat for the normally safe incumbent, who ultimately lost by nearly three points.      Republican Marco Rubio celebrates winning his Senate re-election bid in Florida, beating Democrat Patrick Murphy. (Reuters)   Democrats also picked up a House seat in Florida from Republican Rep. David Jolly, who lost his reelection battle to former Florida governor Charlie Crist. Crist, who was a Republican and an independent while governor, joined the Democratic Party in 2012. But Democrats lost the House seat being vacated by Patrick Murphy -- who lost to Rubio in the Senate race -- when Florida Republican Brian Mast defeated Democrat Randy Perkins. In Virginia, Republicans also overcame a Democratic effort to oust Rep. Barbara Comstock, who easily rode to a nine-point victory over Democratic challenger LuAnn Bennett. In general, House Democrats were frustrated and disappointed at less-than-expected gains.   [Map: House of Representatives results]   Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) blamed FBI Director James B. Comey's decision late last month to tell Congress about possible new information pertaining to the Clinton email probe. Many Democrats had charged that Comey's decision was politically motivated, and Pelosi said Tuesday that it had a ""definite impact"" on Democrats' efforts to seize more congressional seats. In the House, it was possible that Democrats could knock out one of the GOP's chief attack dogs against the Obama administration in California's Darrell Issa, who as the former chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform was banging the GOP's Benghazi drum before there was a Benghazi committee. If Issa loses to Democrat Doug Applegate, a former Marine colonel whose camp has ridiculed Issa's recent attempts to recast himself as a friend of the Obama administration, it could be the Democrats' biggest House upset of the night. Some Democratic gains came in urban areas where Trump's candidacy created negative headwinds: In Illinois's 10th, Rep. Bob Dold (R) lost to Democratic challenger, former congressman Brad Schneider, while in New Jersey's 5th District, Rep. Scott Garrett (R) lost to Democratic challenger Joshua Gottheimer. But in Iowa's 1st District -- another bellwether -- Republican Rep. Rod Blum held out against Democratic challenger Monica Vernon. Other competitive House races were all over the country, from New Hampshire to Nevada. The race in New Hampshire's 1st District was called after 4 a.m. Wednesday, with former Democratic congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter defeating incumbent Republican Frank Guinta. In Nevada's 3rd District, Democrat Jacky Rosen defeated Republican Danny Tarkanian, while in the 4th District, Democrat Ruben Kihuen beat incumbent Republican Rep. Cresent Hardy. In general, Democrats performed better in Nevada, which boasts a large Latino voting population, than they did nationwide. Early Wednesday morning returns were inconclusive in Minnesota's 2nd District, where Democrats backing Angie Craig tried to link Republican talk radio host Jason Lewis to Trump over his comments about ""not-thinking"" women and ""cultural suicide"" by the ""white population."" One of them will replace outgoing Rep. John Kline (R). In the Senate, meanwhile, the parties held onto their seats in other high-profile races. Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who just a few months ago was on the shortlist of incumbents most in danger of losing their seats, was reelected to a second term in one of the earliest races to be called Tuesday night. And in Iowa, Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley won a seventh term over Democrat Patty Judge, despite earlier fears that his tenure was in jeopardy.   [Map: Senate results]   In Maryland, Democrat Chris Van Hollen was elected to his first term as a U.S. senator in the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D), while in California, Democrat Kamala Harris was elected to her first term in the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer (D). Democratic Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), who is expected to replace Reid as the Senate's top Democrat next year, won a fourth term, while Washington Democrat Patty Murray, also a member of the leadership team, won her fifth term. The Senate's No. 3 Republican, John Thune (S.D.), was reelected to his third. In Georgia, Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson was reelected to a third term in a race against Democratic challenger Jim Barksdale. While Isakson was not in grave danger of losing his seat, it was not clear that he would pass an important 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff until the last days of the election. Elsewhere in the Senate, Vermont's Democratic Sen. Patrick J. Leahy was reelected to his eighth term, while Alabama Republican Sen. Richard C. Shelby won his sixth, and Idaho Republican Mike Crapo won his fourth. Republicans Tim Scott of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii were reelected to their first full terms in the Senate, while Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republicans Rand Paul (Ky.), Mike Lee (Utah), Jerry Moran (Kan.), John Boozman (Ark.), and John Hoeven (N.D.) each won a second Senate term. Colorado Democrat Michael F. Bennet was also reelected to his second full Senate term, while Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden was reelected to his fourth full term. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was reelected to her third full term, while the Senate race to replace outgoing Sen. David Vitter (R) in Louisiana will head to a December runoff between Republican John Kennedy and Democrat Foster Campbell. The outcome of that runoff, in which the Republican is favored, will not affect which party holds the majority in the Senate. Mike DeBonis contributed to this report."

Will you?	"   (I Side With)  A friend who lives in a major swing state recently told me that he voted third-party. Far be it for me to judge the votes of my friends, but I kinda wondered -- what was he thinking? Did he really believe this person's platform? Was it a vote of protest?  Nah, he explained: This candidate was his top result on the wildly popular I Side With.   [The only true winners of this election are trolls]   Ah yes, I Side With -- the viral Buzzfeed personality quiz of voter education. Since 2012, a staggering 44 million people have taken the 20-to-100 question survey, rating their beliefs on everything from tax policy to abortion. The quiz is intended to be instructional -- it's become a mainstay in high school civics classes. It's also strictly apolitical in every way but one: It significantly boosts the visibility of third-party candidates, to the degree that some have lobbied just to become options.  By both accident and design, I Side With recommends candidates like Gary Johnson and Jill Stein at rates far higher than one might expect from the way they poll. Other third-party campaigns, including those of Reform Party candidate Rocky de la Fuente and transhumanist Zoltan Istvan, say they credit the quiz with exposing them to tens of thousands of voters.     [The secret network of political tweeters making campaign memes go viral]   ""I tried for over a year to get on the site, since it's obvious how powerful of a tool of it is,"" Istvan told The Intersect by email. He's now encouraging his supporters to forward the quiz to their friends in Florida, where even a few extra votes for a third-party contender could ""make all the difference in the final election.""     According to @iSideWith , I should for @zoltan_istvan , but I DONT EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS. #Zoltan2016? #ZoltanIsAcoolName pic.twitter.com/Q5YhbKrMKq -- Jeff Hortenstine (@TheHortenstine) October 25, 2016     Retook #iSideWith. Apparently I should vote for #Transhuman party. Didn't know it existed, no joke the website talks about cyborgs. I'm in. pic.twitter.com/4nMLQNHaqx -- Kade Hammes (@kadehamm) October 26, 2016   Admittedly, neither Istvan nor the creators of I Side With -- a pair of post-college buddies who started the site on a lark -- know exactly how many of the site's millions of users actually vote their quiz results. This is only I Side With's second go-round, and no one has studied its impact on voter mobilization. Still, word on Twitter, and in third-party campaigns, is that I Side With makes a difference.  ""People like Johnson and Stein have definitely gotten traction through us,"" said Taylor Peck, one of the site's two cofounders. ""I think connecting on issues, rather than party, is the future of politics."" This is a philosophy that Peck arrived at over time: When he and former roommate Nick Boutelier launched I Side With ahead of the 2012 elections, neither of them was particularly deep in conventional politics. Boutelier was an as-of-yet-undecided voter and a software engineer at a California ecommerce firm; Peck was a ""political news junkie"" and a professional marketer. In the course of discussing the issues with his friend, both men realized there could be a better way to parse and classify their political beliefs. They had a model already, in fact, in the form of match-based online dating. As on eHarmony or OkCupid, users begin the I Side With process by filling out a lengthy questionnaire -- 20 questions in the basic mobile version, or as many as 100 in the full test. In place of queries like ""do you smoke"" and ""what are you looking for in a relationship,"" however, you get queries like ""do you support the legalization of same-sex marriage?"" Users also assign each question a ""passion score"" to indicate how important it is.  Behind the scenes, Peck has completed the same process for the candidates, answering the questions based on their platforms and assigning ""passion scores"" based on factors like how frequently they discuss the topic. When you click ""Show My Results,"" the site compares your answers to those of eight different major and third-party candidates. It then displays, as a percentage, which one matches you best on the measured issues, giving special weight to your favorite subjects.  This method is not perfect: the quiz only addresses issues on which both major-party candidates have taken positions, and the all-important passion score is pretty arbitrary. Still, for third-party candidates, I Side With is an important source of visibility. The sites most frequently visited after users take the quiz on I Side With are the big social networks -- Facebook, Twitter, Google -- and Wikipedia, according to web analytics firm SimilarWeb. That suggests they're not only checking out their results, but researching and sharing them.       I didn't know anything about @DarrellCastle until @iSideWith indicated that I agree with him 91% of the time. -- Jeff Davis (@onlyJeffDavis) July 27, 2016     @divinehemipenis Same. I learned most of what I know about Johnson by doing a candidate comparison on isidewith, the site with the quiz. -- 420Fox (@ArtistOfRandom) July 22, 2016     So, I just took that isidewith quiz to see who I side with on the most issues, and apparently I should vote for Jill Stein. Huh. -- Trev (@Zytabyte) November 4, 2016   Certainly that's the experience of Transhumanist Party candidate Istvan, who told the Post that Google searches for his name doubled the day that I Side With added him as a match option. Rocky de la Fuente, the eccentric 62-year-old businessman running on the Reform Party ticket, was even more effusive: He gave me the login credentials to his personal Alexa account and encouraged me to check how much traffic to his website jumped because of I Side With. While it's difficult to attribute changes in the site's traffic to any one source, particularly since so much of it came through search engines, the number of unique visitors did spike by almost 18 percent in the days after I Side With hosted an online debate for third-party candidates.  ""Maybe that's only a one or two-percent boost"" in terms of actual votes, acknowledged de la Fuente, who earned 67,000 votes in the Democratic primary. ""But for me, every little bit helps. It's about the sum of the digits.""  De la Fuente isn't unique in this, of course: with Election Day upon us, and the race continuing to narrow, those very small numbers become more important for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, as well. Clinton surrogates, like President Barack Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders, have urged their supporters not to vote third-party out of fear of throwing the election. Meanwhile, Trump and others in his corner have expressed outrage over the candidacy of potential Utah-stealer Evan McMullin. All of this has provoked an interesting argument in some political circles -- an argument against voting on the issues, alone. Political theorist Julia Maskivker contends, for instance, that voting on the issues is immoral if it ends up electing what she terms the ""greater of two evils."" Whoever you think that is in this particular case, Maskivker's argument is persuasive: There may be some questions that just can't be decided by even a very thorough online quiz.   Then again: ""My vote should represent my views, not just picking the second worst choice,"" said my third-party-voting friend. Even as the polls in his state narrow, he insists, with true I Side With conviction, that he stands wholeheartedly by his decision.  Liked that? Try these:  Yes, you do have an obligation to vote for the lesser of two evils. Here's why. Your ballot selfie still might be illegal. Sorry. Ken Bone was a 'hero.' Now Ken Bone is 'bad.' It was his destiny as a human meme. "
