Roskomnadzor said Thursday it has sent a notice to communications providers requesting them to block access to LinkedIn. Last week, the Moscow city court rejected LinkedIn's appeal against a ruling that it had broken a law that requires personal data on Russian citizens to be stored on servers within Russia. The case was brought by Roskomnadzor. . Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  Moving out of the country is tough, even with the right motivation, like a political existential crisis. You need a job, a roof, probably a passport, and depending on where in the world these would-be Carmen Sandiegos land, a new language under your trench coat. No one is discovering this hard truth more than the pro-Clinton celebrities who claimed they were packing their bags for Canada (or the cosmos) should Donald Trump become president. Well, The Donald is checking out his new digs at the White House as we speak, and these famous emigres are eating crow on their same old couches. First up, there's Amy Schumer, the comedian and cousin of Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who said in an interview that if the then-GOP nominee won the presidency, she'd move to Europe. ""My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish because I will move to Spain or somewhere,"" she told the BBC in September. ""It's beyond my comprehension if Trump won. It's too crazy."" Que sorpresa, the ""Trainwreck"" star is staying put. In a lengthy Instagram post the morning after the election, Schumer, who watched as 200 people left her Florida comedy show last month because it was too political, said she was just joking, guys. ""Anyone saying pack your bags is just as disgusting as anyone who voted for this racist homophobic openly disrespectful woman abuser,"" wrote Schumer, after adding that her plans to move was said ""in jest."" And the rant continued on: ""All the celebrities backing her would have. People asked how much I was paid to stand with her. Nothing. None of us were paid a dollar. We would have had to pay a lot more because we are fortunate enough to make a high income."" And are any of these other high earners planning to make good on their promises to skip town? Big name Clinton supporters such as Lena Dunham, Ne-Yo, Bryan Cranston, Barbra Streisand, Samuel L. Jackson, Josh Gad and Snoop Dogg have also expressed their desire to ditch America if the results didn't go their way, but so far no one's headed for the border. Cher joked she'd move to Jupiter. So that's probably not going to happen. Instead she tweeted that she spent Wednesday night in New York on Fifth Avenue and 55th Street, just one block away from Trump Tower. The ""Believe in Life After Love"" singer said that she talked and listened to the protesters carrying handmade signs on their way to shout ""Dump Trump"" in front of the president-elect's building.   Didn't Cry Nite B4 & Didn't March On t.t Last Nite.Talked &Listened 2Protesters,They Hugged Me & Marched On.Where I Was,They Were Peaceful -- Cher (@cher) November 10, 2016   Comedian Chelsea Handler had a plan that didn't involve space travel. She told Vanity Fair that she ""had a house in Spain that is going to be ready right after the election."" But on Wednesday night, the Netflix talk show host, who admitted to being ""sad, disappointed and confused,"" was back to work as usual. ""But if Hillary can make it through a concession speech then I can make it through a stupid television show,"" Handler said on air. ""And I'm taking her lead. She said we can do it so I'm going to do it for every woman out there."" Handler did admit that she ""really, really"" wanted to be in Spain right now, but wasn't going to throw in the towel. But some celebrities couldn't swallow the bitter pill of this presidential cycle without tears. Pop star Miley Cyrus, an outspoken supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders, and later Clinton, for president, had said on Instagram, ""I am moving if this is my president! I don't say things I don't mean!"" She might have meant that eight months ago, but during a two-minute tear-filled video on Wednesday the ""Wrecking Ball"" singer followed Clinton's example. ""So Donald Trump I accept you,"" she said through sniffles. ""And, this is hard to say, I even accept you as the president of the United States and that's fine, because I think now I want to be a hopeful hippie."""

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  Dear Secretary Clinton, Though everything in your personal history suggests that Tuesday's defeat will not mark the end of your work in American public life, I can imagine that this will be a moment of reflection and recovery for you. And though we have some profound disagreements, on the occasion of this transition, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for some of the contributions you've made in the past quarter-century as one of the most prominent women in American politics. In the two and a half decades that Americans have used you to work out our complex and contradictory ideas about women, work and marriage, I have been moved by your dignity and resilience. I don't envy you the compromises -- the enforced cookie-baking, the meeting with a group of female journalists to ask for advice on how to present yourself -- or what must have been moments of agony in your marriage. But as I've watched you from a very great distance, I have been grateful to you for bearing some of the slings and arrows of the outrageous fortune that is the lot, in different degrees and forms, of all the women of this country. Every insult that didn't level you, and every moment of absurdity you absorbed without staggering, helped start conversations about the expectations and standards women face. You didn't have a solution for this conundrum. None of us do. But if you couldn't solve American gender politics in the span of a life, or act as a shield against the harshness directed at other women, you created space for the rest of us. We won't surrender it. Thank you for your commitment to service. Defeat is not easy to accept with grace, and there is always a temptation in the days that follow to choose a different course or to withdraw entirely from the fray. After President Bill Clinton's plans for comprehensive health-care reform failed during his first term, you became one of the champions of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. After you lost to then-Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 primary, you campaigned for him and served as his secretary of state. You've demonstrated over and over again that you are truly committed to your pledge to ""Do all the good you can,"" even if the gains are smaller than you might have hoped, or if doing that good requires you to put aside hurt feelings. This is an exhortation and a model that we all ought to emulate in the weeks and months to come. In the days since the election, I have thought frequently of the example you set in reaching out to others and forming life-long friendships with them. Hearing from Ryan Moore, Aleatha Williams and Janelle Turner about your correspondence with them, and your care and attention during both painful and proud moments in their lives, has been a reminder to me to be more diligent in my efforts to stay in touch with the most important people in my own life. Listening to the Mothers of the Movement talk about how you listened to them is a testament to the simple power of presence. It's precisely because time is in such short supply that offering it to others is a valuable gesture. Thank you for laughing in the face of absurdity. Thank you for apologizing about occasions when you were wrong, and keeping alive the idea that politicians ought to educate themselves and to grow, rather than intellectually immobilizing themselves as the world changes. Thank you for your dedication to the Constitution and to the peaceful transfer of power in our democratic system; among many other things, your opponents will be measured by whether they show the same measure of allegiance to our most valuable norms and institutions. I can only begin to imagine how painful it must be to feel that you are exiting one public arena with your work undone. I hope you take some measure of comfort from the idea that, though you may not see the garden in bloom, many of us will be tending the seeds you planted. With respect and gratitude, Alyssa    "

The Thursday report said the families and relatives of the deceased soldiers, as well as authorities and local citizens, attended the funeral in holy city of Qom, some 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of the capital Tehran. It called the soldiers ""defenders of shrine,"" but did not identify them or provide additional details on their deaths. In August, Iran said that the families of at least 400 fighters killed fighting in Iranian brigades in Syria had been referred to the Martyr Foundation to receive financial support. Iran has provided military and political backing to President Bashar Assad in Syria's civil war, saying it is defending Shiite shrines. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

City police spokeswoman Sgt. Andrea Janvier says that 65-year-old Jeff Brown had cast his ballot to vote at P.S. duPont Middle School and was walking away from the area when the incident occurred. Brown said he felt targeted by an unknown man after he was told that he would not be allowed to vote. After voting, Brown said he encountered the suspect twice more and a physical altercation took place. Brown sustained minor cuts and scratches to his elbow and knees. Police describe the suspect as a black male, 20-30 years of age, 180-190 pounds, standing between 5'9""-5'10"" tall who was driving a silver colored vehicle that left before officers arrived.

""When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program, and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. We'll keep them out,"" the Republican nominee told hundreds of people packed into a barn at the Loudoun County fairgrounds, with even more listening from outside. The stop was Trump's fifth since Sunday afternoon, several of them in Democratic strongholds he is trying to wrest away from Hillary Clinton in hopes of creating a path to victory on Tuesday. After starting his day in Iowa, where polls show him ahead, Trump stumped in Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, all states that have gone for Democrats for more than a quarter century. Until recently, polls had showed Clinton with a comfortable lead in Virginia as well. Clinton, meanwhile, campaigned in Pennsylvania, where she maintains a lead, and in Ohio and New Hampshire, two battleground states that could go either way. Clinton has maintained a narrow lead nationally and has several more plausible scenarios than Trump for winning in the Electoral College.     View Graphic      The candidates' frenzied pace Sunday came as news broke that, after an expedited review of newly discovered Clinton emails, FBI Director James B. Comey had affirmed his decision that she should not face charges related to her use of a personal server as secretary of state. During Trump's Michigan rally -- a state a Republican presidential candidate last carried in 1988 -- he said Clinton was ""being protected by a rigged system, it's a totally rigged system."" ""Hillary Clinton is guilty,"" Trump said. ""She's knows it. The FBI knows it. The people know it. Now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8th.""  [Clinton leads by five points nationally as Trump personality concerns persist, Post-ABC Tracking Poll finds]  Comey's announcement on Oct. 28 that the FBI was scrutinizing newly discovered email reinvigorated Trump's campaign in the closing stretch of the race, and polls in multiple battleground states have tightened since then. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri reacted to the FBI news on the campaign's flight to a Cleveland rally, telling reporters: ""We are glad to see that ... [Comey] has confirmed the conclusions he reached in July, and we are glad that this matter is resolved."" Clinton is using the closing days of the race to try to both shore up support in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania where she has been leading and to tip the balance in other swing states.      How the electoral college works View Graphic     How the electoral college works  Clinton appeared Sunday night in New Hampshire, where the race has tightened considerably. ""This election is a moment of reckoning,"" Clinton told her crowd in Manchester. ""It a choice between division and unity. ... What's really on the ballot is what kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren."" Clinton was introduced at the rally by Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father of slain U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who died while serving in the 2004 Iraq War. Khan, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention and was later criticized by Trump, posed a pointed set of questions to Trump about whether his son, a Muslim, and other minorities would have a place in his America. ""Would anyone who isn't like you have a place in your America, Mr. Trump?"" Khan said. ""On Tuesday, we're going to prove America belongs to all of us."" Clinton said that Khan's family ""exemplify the values that make America great."" Folk singer James Taylor performed at the rally ahead of Clinton's appearance. Clinton appeared earlier Sunday at a rally in Cleveland, where she was introduced by Cleveland Cavaliers basketball star LeBron James, part of an effort to spark enthusiasm in Ohio, a state where polls have showed Trump leading. ""I want an America where everyone has a place, where everyone is included,"" Clinton said there. ""And I know there is a lot of frustration, even anger, in this election season. I see it, I hear it, you know, I'm a subject of it. I get it. But anger is not a plan. Anger is not going to get us new jobs."" The more optimistic look toward the future was a script her campaign had hoped to use as a springboard past the exceptional rancor of the last several months of her contest with Trump, but it had been muted somewhat by the uncertainty surrounding the renewed FBI inquiry and the tightening polls. Sunday's event was Clinton's last scheduled visit to Ohio, where she trails despite heavy emphasis on turning out black voters in Cleveland. James was part of that effort, as were husband and wife singers Jay-Z and Beyonce, who performed a get-out-the-vote concert with Clinton on Friday night. In attempt to cobble together the 270 electoral votes needed to win, Trump has new targets in his sights in historically Democratic states including Michigan, Minnesota and New Mexico. Once thought to be safe for Democrats, Michigan has become a last-minute battleground, with Clinton heading to Grand Rapids on Monday, the campaign announced this weekend. President Obama, who won Michigan twice, will campaign in Ann Arbor on Monday. And former president Bill Clinton made a stop in Lansing on Sunday after visiting churches in Flint. Clinton began her day Sunday by campaigning in Philadelphia after attending a get-out-the-vote concert in the city on Saturday night. And she will return to the state for two rallies on the eve of Election Day, a sign that the Keystone State is among the battlegrounds where her lead over Trump has dwindled in recent days. Her campaign announced that rock star Bruce Springsteen would join her at a Philadelphia rally that will also include President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama.  [What to know about the 15 states that will decide the election]  Clinton also deployed a full slate of high-level surrogates around the country on Sunday, including Obama, who appeared in Kissimmee, Fla., and poked fun at Trump. ""Apparently his campaign has taken his Twitter,"" Obama told the crowd at Osceola County Stadium. ""In the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said we're just gonna take away your Twitter. Now, if somebody can't handle a Twitter account, they can't handle the nuclear codes."" Trump started his five-state swing in Sioux City in eastern Iowa, close to the Nebraska border. Nebraska is one of two states that can split its electoral votes between candidates, and in 2008, one electoral vote from the Omaha area went to Obama.  Trump's stop in Northern Virginia on Sunday night came as Republicans see new hope in a state where Clinton has long held a comfortable lead.  He promised ""massive"" tax cuts for the middle class and to rebuild inner cities that he said in some cases are ""worse than war zones."" And Trump decried NAFTA and other trade deals that he said are robbing the country of jobs. ""We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the world,"" Trump said. ""We will stop the jobs from leaving Virginia, that I can tell you."" At an earlier rally Sunday in Minneapolis, Trump told the crowd that Clinton was taking the Democratic leaning state of Minnesota for granted by not visiting it. Trump also warned about a local immigrant population: Somalis, most of them Muslims, who have left their war-ravaged country and settled in large numbers around Minneapolis.  ""You don't even have the right to talk about it. You don't even know who's coming in. You'll find out. You'll find out,"" Trump said. He mentioned a recent stabbing case, in which the suspect is a man whose parents brought him from Somalia when he was three months old. ""You've suffered enough in Minnesota."" In Michigan, rock star Ted Nugent, a native of the state who in a 2012 Facebook post called for Clinton to be tried and hanged for treason, provided entertainment at the rally, declaring it was ""good to see the real Michigan together."" When Trump took the stage, he ticked off a series of trade deals that he said had devastated the state. He falsely claimed that Clinton is supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pending deal supported by Obama. Clinton previously backed the deal while secretary of state but has since come out against it.   [Is there a 'hidden' Hillary Clinton vote among women?]   Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign continues to use its huge financial advantage over Trump to press its case to swing voters on the airwaves.  The campaign on Sunday released two national ads appealing to moderate and Republican voters to reject Trump and embrace Clinton. Both ads feature straight-to-camera testimonials from Republican military veterans who say they cannot vote for their party's nominee, citing Trump's comments about women. Another two-minute ad was set to air Monday night, aimed at reaching about 20 million people, according to a campaign aide. Trump also released a closing campaign ad , a two-minute spot tying Clinton to the ""failed and corrupt political establishment"" and ""global special interests."" But the ad, which features images of piles of cash along with Jewish corporate and financial leaders, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen, was sharply criticized by the Anti-Defamation League for what it called anti-Semitic overtones.   Gearan reported from Manchester, N.H., and Wagner reported from Washington. Greg Jaffe in Kissimmee, Fla.; Ed O'Keefe, Abby Phillip, Katie Zezima, Robert Barnes, Sarah Parnass and Sean Sullivan in Washington; Steve Friess in Sterling Heights; and Laura Vozzella in Richmond contributed to this report.
