Monsanto had fought a Maui GMO ban and the company says it's committed to an ongoing dialogue with its neighbors. Circuit Judge Consuelo M.

The cases stemmed from a decision by Maui voters to ban the cultivation and testing of genetically modified crops in 2014 and related movements on other Hawaiian islands.

If approved by a judge, the deal announced by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman would lay to rest allegations that Trump University defrauded students who paid up to $35,000 to enroll in programs that promised to share Trump's secrets of the real estate industry. The deal would settle a lawsuit Schneiderman filed three years ago and two class-action lawsuits filed in California on behalf of former students. The complaints accused the program of misleading students by calling itself a university when it was not an accredited school and by saying that Trump ""hand-picked"" instructors. Trump has denied the allegations and repeatedly said he would not settle. He told supporters at a May rally that he would come to San Diego to testify after winning the presidency.  ""I could have settled this case numerous times, but I don't want to settle cases when we're right. I don't believe in it. And when you start settling cases, you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as a settler,"" Trump said at the time. The deal does not require Trump to acknowledge wrongdoing. In a statement, Trump's attorneys said they had ""no doubt"" that Trump University would have prevailed in a trial, but ""resolution of these matters allows President-elect Trump to devote his full attention to the important issues facing our great nation."" Schneiderman said the $25 million to be paid by Trump or one of his business entities includes restitution for victims and $1 million in penalties to the state. Trump ""fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. Today, that all changes,"" Schneiderman said in a statement. He called the settlement ""a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university."" Plaintiffs' attorney Jason Forge says all 6,000 people in the class-action case will get at least half their money back, and some receive a full refund. Forge said he ""definitely detected a change of tone and change of approach"" from Trump's camp after the election. A federal judge in California had been set Friday to consider arguments on Trump's latest request to delay a trial until after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. After the settlement was announced, the trial was canceled. The Trump Organization is a party to numerous lawsuits that threaten to prove a distraction in his administration. The settlement comes a day after watchdog groups and ethics experts who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations sent a letter to Trump urging him to make a clean break from his business to avoid ""embroiling the presidency in litigation."" One of the authors, Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer at the White House under George W. Bush , said he thinks the Trump University settlement might backfire if lawyers think Trump is eager to settle to avoid court cases while president.  ""The plaintiffs' lawyers are going to smell blood in the water,"" he said. Trump's attorneys said in a court filing last week that preparations for the White House were ""critical and all-consuming."" Six months ago, when they unsuccessfully sought a delay until after Inauguration Day, lead attorney Daniel Petrocelli said the period between the election and swearing-in is hectic for a president-elect but that it was preferable to a trial during the campaign.  ""The task is momentous, exceedingly complex, and requires careful coordination involving the respective staffs and teams of both President (Barack) Obama and President-elect Trump,"" Trump's attorneys wrote. ""In fewer than three months, the President-elect must be prepared to manage 15 executive departments, more than 100 federal agencies, 2 million civilian employees, and a budget of almost $4 trillion."" Trump's attorneys also raised the prospect of having the president-elect testify by video recording before the trial begins in the class-action lawsuit on Nov. 28. ___ Klepper contributed from Albany, New York.

If Democrats in the House and Senate would support a constitutional amendment to cap service at three and two terms, respectively, they could drive a wedge between Donald Trump and the party that nominated him, perhaps making it easier for Democrats to cut deals with the new president in other areas. Term limits would also help rid Congress of the Republican hard-liners whose intransigence has rendered the institution dysfunctional since that party took over the majority six years ago.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Election Day. (Lisa Hornak/European Pressphoto Agency)  Victor Davis Hanson writes the flip side of what we kept hearing before the election about the supposed ""implosion"" of the Republican Party: In the aftermath of defeat, where goes the Democratic Party? It is now a municipal party. It has no real power over the federal government or state houses. Its once feared cudgel of race/class/gender invective has become a false wolf call heard one too many times. The Sanders-Warren branch of the party, along with the now discredited Clinton strays, will hover over the party's carcass. It might be a bit early to talk about ""the party's carcass"" just yet, or to dismiss its appeal to racial minorities, to women, or, under the right circumstances, to the poor -- or the rich:  The Democratic Party won a plurality of the popular vote. It dominates California, the most populous state; it has huge power in New York and Illinois, two of the next four states by population. It won the last two presidential elections before this one, by substantial margins. It would have won the electoral vote in this election if there had been tiny swings in a few states. The mainstream media, which continue to be extremely influential (though less so than before), overwhelmingly lean Democratic. The incoming Republican president -- though undeniably, if surprisingly, effective at getting elected -- has shown himself quite capable of unforced errors. Precisely because the party will have control of the presidency, the Senate and the House, as well as a Supreme Court that will be seen as sympathetic to Republicans, it will be held responsible if it fails to adequately address the nation's problems -- and those problems, foreign and domestic, are going to be very hard to address.  There's no ""carcass"" of the Democratic Party -- there is a powerful force which commands the allegiance of much of the nation's population, and which is likely ready to capitalize on the Republican Party's inevitable missteps. It was let down by a candidate who proved to be weak, and a party establishment that (along with most of the rest of the country) badly erred in evaluating the political mood of a substantial chunk of swing voters. The Democratic Party surely has its own structural and ideological problems. I think it's wrong on many policy matters. But those who overestimate the supposed direness of the Democratic Party's condition are likely to end up the same way as those who overestimated the supposed direness of the Republican Party's condition."

Figuring that the larger turnout for the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would benefit a new stadium, city officials rushed to get the initiative on Tuesday's ballot, and observers say it could be close, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported (http://bit.ly/2ewqHYB ). The new stadium would replace Globe Life Park, which opened in 1994. To pay for as much as half of the new stadium, voters are being asked to extend Arlington's half-cent sales tax, 2 percent hotel-occupancy tax and 5 percent car-rental tax. Arlington currently uses those revenues to pay down the remaining $155 million debt it owes for its share of the construction cost of the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium, which opened in 2009. The vote also would allow for a maximum 10 percent admission tax and $3 parking tax for the Rangers' use, which opponents have criticized because the city legally could have used those taxes for its share. It approved the same deal for the Cowboys. Vote Yes! Keep the Rangers, a political action committee that includes the mayor as chairman and all city council and school board members, has said the Rangers should get to use that revenue since they will take responsibility for maintenance and operation of the stadium. Sarah Patterson voted against the new stadium during early voting because she didn't ""see a point in spending money that doesn't need to be spent."" And Juddie Rice echoed the concerns of city officials, who struck a deal with the Rangers in May to keep them in Arlington through the 2053 season. If the stadium proposition fails, she said, ""I just think it opens it up for Dallas or Frisco to talk to them. I want to keep them."" The Rangers haven't publicly threatened to leave, although a team representative held preliminary talks with Dallas officials about a covered stadium. Vote Yes! campaign manager Brian Mayes told The Associated Press on Monday that ""a lot of supporters have turned out to vote"" and the group will campaign until polls close Tuesday. He said he believes the opposition has been turning people off by being aggressive and negative. ""Nobody wants to be accosted at a polling location. Our people stayed positive,"" he said. Peggy Rudd and her husband, Bill Gaut, had distributed fliers denouncing the new stadium to thousands of Arlington homes. And during early voting, they had more fliers critical of the stadium, including a rip on the roof: ""The Rangers have played ball here 44 years. Suddenly now, it's too hot."" Rudd told the newspaper that she was seeing a correlation between a voter's stadium choice and presidential pick.  ""We're finding that when they vote for Trump they vote against the stadium,"" Rudd said. ""I guess they don't like seeing government joining forces with rich dudes."" Despite the politically charged environment, University of Texas at Arlington political science professor Allan Saxe predicts the new stadium will become a reality. ""The 'Yes' vote will win, but it won't be overwhelmingly so,"" he said. ___ Information from: Fort Worth Star-Telegram, http://www.star-telegram.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-opinions-are-local/wp/2016/11/03/the-next-great-election-shakeup-begins-in-virginia/	The next great election shakeup begins in Virginia	   Congressional candidates Henrico Sheriff Mike Wade, left, and state Sen. A. Donald McEachin shake hands after their final debate in Richmond, on Oct. 20. Their race could be a new model. (Alexa Welch Edlund/Richmond Times-Dispatch via Associated Press)  Given this year's dramatic presidential campaign, you could be forgiven for missing one of the most important political stories in Virginia of 2016. A three-judge panel in Richmond issued a ruling that alters the state's political terrain significantly. The January decision remakes Virginia's 3rd and 4th Congressional Districts, acting on a judgment that legislators in 2012 diluted African American influence by crowding these voters into a single majority-minority district. This move comes as a number of other states, including North Carolina, Wisconsin and Florida, face their own legal challenges to allegations of gerrymandering. Virginia's Republican congressional delegation challenged the timing of the decision and lost. As a short-term matter, its concerns were valid: There wasn't much time before the start of primary season for voters or candidates to adjust to the updated map. And as you might expect, there's plenty of room to debate the exact configuration of the new boundaries. But when it comes to the long-term health of both their party and statewide politics more broadly, Virginia Republicans should embrace this opportunity eagerly for two reasons. First, insofar as redistricting breeds competitive elections, it's undeniably good news for voters. Experiences from Democratic inner cities and Republican rural towns show that one-party dominance can be a marvelous recipe for corruption and complacency. Research from Oxford's Petra Schleiter and Alisa Voznaya bolsters the point: In a study of 70 democracies, they find that meaningful party competition is crucial for limiting the scope of governmental corruption. Second, from a practical perspective, Virginia Republicans are in dire need of a reset. The 2013 gubernatorial election saw the GOP get shut out of the three major statewide offices - governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general - for the first time in nearly 25 years. The losses came despite facing a Democratic ticket led by a career political operative with virtually no experience in state politics. Of course, the Virginia GOP isn't alone. The spectacle of Donald Trump battling Hillary Clinton this fall has driven anticipation that the United States' two-party system is itself in for a realignment. That's certainly possible, but it misses a big piece of the story: Subtle yet powerful changes in how - and where - the parties compete for control of Congress could produce an enduring new landscape all their own. Evidence that such a geographic realignment could spark a political one is already emerging. Consider what's happened in Virginia's 7th District, where popular Henrico County Sheriff Mike Wade was planning to challenge Rep. Dave Brat in a Republican primary this spring. Instead, Wade is running for an open seat in the newly configured 4th District, turning what was destined to be yet another intra-party squabble into a more intriguing general election contest. The two districts look little alike. The 7th is the very definition of a Republican stronghold, last electing a Democrat to Congress in 1968. The new 4th District, on the other hand, is 41 percent black and was carried by President Obama with 61 percent of the vote in 2012. The GOP has its work cut out for it there, but Wade has the type of track record - one that emphasizes nontraditional issues in a congressional race, such as criminal justice reform - that could appeal to a diverse electorate. No matter the outcome next month, Wade's campaign is a model for what Republicans and Democrats must do across the country: Embrace new, supposedly hostile districts. Study them carefully. Learn from these voters while competing hard for their support. Elections will be lost, as meaningful realignments don't happen overnight. But both parties ought to welcome the new map in Virginia as an ideal rather than hope that the court's decision ends up being an outlier. This path forward is especially crucial given the state of the 2016 race, which is alienating voters across the spectrum at record pace. Trump vs. Clinton reflects the culmination of a trend nearly 15 years in the making. Since 2002, the number of Americans with an unfavorable view of both political parties has quadrupled to 24 percent. Congress, with its abysmal 20 percent approval rating, has contributed mightily to the problem. Yet if Virginia's House races are any indication, the prospect of meaningful competition offers at least a glimmer of hope that better days really do lie ahead.

(Facebook)  The Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General doesn't make a habit of investigating memes. But when those viral images appear designed to suppress votes in an election, the AG takes them seriously. That's certainly been their reaction to an ""online voting"" meme that's circled Facebook, Twitter and Instagram a lot in recent weeks. It's an official-looking graphic that assures Pennsylvania's Democrats that they can vote Tuesday by merely posting the status ""Hillary"" on their social network of choice. This is not ""American Idol,"" of course -- you can't vote in any state using a hashtag. Which is why the meme has scandalized both Clinton supporters and the Pennsylvania state government.   [What was fake on the Internet this election]   Little did they know, they'd all been had. Pwned, in gamer-speak. The meme was, according to its propagators, less a sincere attempt at election fraud than a bit of calculated adolescent trolling. Would these dummies take the bait? Would they legitimize the gag with their reaction, and thus transform it into actual news? ""I saw it on Twitter, thought it was funny, and shared it for some laughs,"" said Rick Barbee, one of the first to share the ""online voting"" meme outside of its inevitable birthplace, 4chan. In other words, he shared it for the lulz -- because we are living through the lulz election.    Fans of Donald Trump wear shirts that say ""Obama you are fired,"" just before Trump speaks at a rally Aug. 21, 2015, in Mobile, Ala. (Brynn Anderson/AP)  Lulz, as in that particular type of schadenfreude unique to our time -- the sort of aloof, perverse pleasure one derives from causing someone else to get upset online. The term began popping up on 4chan boards and in IRC chats sometime around 2006, first as a harmless misspelling of ""lol"" and later as a shorthand for the sadistic joys of online trolling. Why make a 9-year-old cry on YouTube, or plaster Second Life with racist imagery? Why, ""for the lulz,"" naturally. (In the words of the very lulzy Encyclopedia Dramatica, ""doing it for the lulz on the Internets is a perfectly acceptable excuse to do anything."")    A misleading ""text voting"" meme circulated on Twitter. (Twitter via Buzzfeed)  But in one of the most politically polarized eras in recorded history, lulz have grown into far more than a juvenile excuse: They are the default means of engaging people with opposing views. Lulz are a worldview, an outlook, a political philosophy. They're the deliberate foil of civic dialogue, rooted in cynicism, detachment and outright misanthropy. Fake news and misinformation are part of that, as are the traditional griefing techniques of subcultural trolls. But lulz also fueled -- and sometimes, explain -- this year's surge of racist, sexist and anti-Semitic discourse. ""The lulz have become prominent during this election in a way we've never seen before,"" said Whitney Phillips, a professor of literary studies at Mercer University and the co-author of a forthcoming book on Internet antagonists. ""But it's dangerous to frame [lulz] as somehow different or separate from actual extremism. Whether or not you're doing it for laughs, the message is the message."" This is true on both sides of the political spectrum, of course: Certainly, lulz-seekers on the left have gotten a few good punches in this cycle. (Serial news hoaxer Paul Horner, who purposely deceives conservatives with his fake news articles, recently wrote on Facebook that he can scarcely contain his ""joy and laughter."") But trolls are scavengers, Phillips explains, and they're drawn to the cultural fissures that will provoke the most anger. And in this election, those issues tend to skew to stomping grounds of the right: Think concerns about race, class, gender, sexual assault, sexual orientation and religion.   [These charts show exactly how racist and radical the alt-right has gotten this year]   From the earliest days of his campaign, Donald Trump has been buoyed by a contingent of 4chan devotees who pass around memes, swastikas and campaign slogans with the same winking irreverence. Their pursuit of lulz is explicit: They trend hashtags like #Repealthe19th and #DraftOurDaughters to ""trigger"" feminists; they juxtapose Stars of David with pictures of Clinton to -- in the word's of one troll's Twitter bio -- ""offend you if you are Liberal, Politically Correct, Feminist, Democrat or Piers Morgan.""    Milo Yiannopoulos, a conservative columnist and Internet personality, holds a news conference June 15 in Orlando. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)  The guiding lights of this crowd -- people like the right-wing blogger Mike Cernovich and Breitbart tech columnist Milo Yiannopoulos -- have become not only legends on their own hashtags, but leading figures in the offline Trump movement. Cernovich, an erstwhile pickup artist who is largely responsible for the rumors about Clinton's health, encourages his followers to abide by the maxims ""conflict is attention"" and ""attention is influence."" Yiannopolous, meanwhile, was famously suspended from Twitter for inciting the racist harassment of the actress Leslie Jones, which he defended on the grounds that he's a ""prankster."" In other words, he harassed Jones as some sort of nihilistic joke -- a metaphor for online culture, if I've ever heard one.   [Just how offensive did Milo Yiannopoulos have to be to get banned from Twitter?]   It would be a mistake, however, to pretend that lulz-seeking is exclusively confined to the Internet, when its symptoms surface so regularly in other parts of public life. Trump supporters have begun wearing T-shirts that scream ""Trump that b---,"" apparently just to see which strangers will be upset by them. (""I'm just trying to be funny and get attention,"" one buyer told The Washington Post's Jenna Johnson in June.) At a Trump rally in Phoenix on Saturday, a man wearing as ""Hillary for Prison"" shirt began chanting ""Jew-S-A"" in front of the press pen, then denied the chant was anti-Semitic. The day after that, at another rally in Las Vegas, a hype man for Trump transfixed the crowd with a grotesque story -- there's no better term -- about Clinton dying in a fiery car crash.    A campaign worker for Donald Trump shoots T-shirts into the audience during an Oct. 25 campaign rally on the tarmac at Orlando Sanford International Airport in Sanford, Fla. (Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel via AP)  The connecting thread among all these provocations is that none are necessarily sincere -- or if they are, the sincerity is an afterthought, a distant second to the desire to deceive, offend or jeer. Pennsylvania's ""online voting"" memes are just the latest in the series: Trump-supporters who shared the meme often used the language of voter suppression and disenfranchisement, but there's little to suggest that chatter was serious, like you might hear from more seasoned political operatives. ""It's like the bullies who would do things in grade school for a laugh,"" said Brooke Binkowski, the managing editor at debunking site Snopes. ""There's no endgame . . . but if something more happens, its even funnier to them.""   [A revealing look into Donald Trump's unofficial Internet campaign]   Unfortunately for the grade-school bullies of the Trump movement -- and counter to the promises of Encyclopedia Dramatica -- no one seems terribly placated by the ""for a laugh"" excuse these days. There's a growing understanding among Internet users that the harms of these stunts are quite real, despite their posters' less-than-genuine intentions. And in the Internet of the alt-right, especially, you can never tell if ""the lulz"" function literally, or as a smokescreen for hardcore extremists. The Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General confirmed to The Washington Post that it has recently launched a review of the online voting meme, in light of the fact that it was shared, at one point, by a city councilman. (""Virtually everybody understood it was a joke,"" griped that official, Josh Lorenz.) Jeff Coon, a Clinton supporter who sounded the alarm about a similar ""online voting"" meme, seemed equally unmoved. ""I don't believe that who ever created this meme or others like it were just posting it as a joke or to troll,"" he said by Facebook Messenger. And even if they were: ""It's not a joke if [some] people are disenfranchised of their votes."" And yet, despite mainstream condemnation of lulz-seekers, it's unclear if anything will turn that tide back now. Both social media and the news media incentivize provocative online behavior: They shower views, and likes, and fame or infamy, on anyone loud or mean enough to inspire anger. As for the rank cynicism and alienation that fuel lulz politics, polls by the likes of Gallup and Pew suggest we're growing more polarized and estranged from one another than we've ever been.

What if, instead of antagonizing him on Facebook, Barbee sat down and talked to Coon? They're different people but -- if nothing else -- they have their passion for the fate of the country in common. ""If there's a solution to any of this, it's sincere, earnest engagement with people we don't understand,"" Phillips said. ""We need to be thoughtful and respectful and stop deflecting responsibility for the things we do and say on the Internet."" This is why Phillips is deeply concerned about figures like Cernovich and Yiannopoulos -- and, above them, Trump himself. For surely no one else has been so successful at cynically exploiting cultural tensions to get a reaction. Trump has sent Cinco de Mayo tweets after insulting Mexicans; he led the ""hunt"" for President Obama's birth certificate. There's widespread belief that after the election, Trump will launch a Trump TV channel, inspiring some pundits to wonder whether his whole campaign was just a calculated gambit for national attention. You can bet he's getting the last lulz -- regardless of who wins next week's election. Liked that?
