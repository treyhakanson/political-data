The Richmond Times-Dispatch (goo.gl/mkHvum) reports that House Appropriations Chairman S. Chris Jones and Senate Finance Co-Chairman Emmett W. Hanger Jr. are creating the panel to help lawmakers prepare for the changes to, or the repeal of, the Affordable Care Act. Trump and the Republican-led Congress are pledging to repeal and replace federal health care law, though Trump has indicated that he wants to keep some parts of the law.

At a ceremony Friday, the school will formally name buildings for two professors who taught economics there, James Buchanan and Vernon Smith. Buchanan, who died in 2013, won a Nobel in 1986 for his work on the intersections of politics and economics. Smith won in 2002 for developing methods for lab experiments that illuminate economic behavior. Smith, who is 89, will attend Friday's ceremony. The building on the Fairfax campus now known as Mason Hall becomes James Buchanan Hall. The five-story Metropolitan Building on the Arlington campus becomes Vernon Smith Hall. Buchanan and Smith helped Mason develop a national reputation for work in economics, particularly for those with conservative leanings. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Steve Vick tells The Richmond Times Dispatch (http://bit.ly/2fJOZjw ) that State Police will support Metropolitan Police with security and traffic during the January 2017 event. Republican businessman Donald Trump is set to be sworn in as the 45th president on Jan. 20. Vick said he can't release the number of officers that will be dedicated to the event due to ""operational and officer safety issues."" He says that Virginia State Police have sent troopers to assist local officers in inauguration ceremonies for 20 years.

Marcel Briche died in a hospital two days after the Nov. 8 accident on a bypass around the southwestern city of La Rochelle, according to deputy prosecutor Julien Wattebled. Wattebled said Friday that investigators are still questioning witnesses and it is too early to determine what happened. Briche's children, Thierry and Martine, are quoted in local newspaper Sud-Ouest as saying they sought the investigation to determine whether the convoy was at fault. Hollande's office referred questions to the local government administration, which would not comment while the investigation is underway. Hollande was in La Rochelle on Nov. 8 for a maritime economy meeting. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The 81-year-old monk is starting a four-day visit to predominantly Buddhist Mongolia on Friday evening. His visit is being described by his hosts as purely religious in nature and no meetings with officials are planned. Despite that, China's Foreign Ministry reiterated its rigid opposition to all foreign travel by the Dalai Lama, who has been based in India since fleeing Tibet during an abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. The Dalai Lama is a ""political exile who has long been engaging in splitting China activities in the name of religion with the aim of alienating Tibet from China,"" ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.  ""We strongly demand that Mongolia, for the purpose of maintaining the general picture of a sound and steady development of bilateral ties, earnestly stick to its commitment on Tibet-related issues, does not allow the visit by the Dalai Lama and does not provide any form of support and convenience to the Dalai Lama clique,"" he said. Mongolia's herding and resource-centered economy is heavily dependent on China and the country is currently in negotiations for a $4.2 billion loan from Beijing to help pull it out of a deep recession. Mongolian Buddhism is closely tied to Tibet's strain and traditionally reveres the Dalai Lama as a leading spiritual figure. The Dalai Lama made the first of his eight visits to Mongolia in 1979, when the country was still under Communist rule. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The move, one of the first key decisions as Trump pivots from campaigning to governing, amounted to a demotion for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been running the Republican's transition planning for months. On the heels of Trump's upset victory this week, his team has begun to embark upon building a government, an enormous undertaking that likely requires Trump to alter his hands-on management style and consider going outside his small, insular group of loyalists. He has been scrambling to identify people for top White House jobs and Cabinet posts, a herculean task that must be well in hand by the time Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20. For Trump, who ran on a pledge to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington insiders, the team is strikingly heavy on those with long political resumes. And another apparent contradiction emerged Friday as Trump, who repeatedly vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act ""on day one,"" said he would be open to maintaining portions of President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. In a statement Friday, Trump said Pence would ""build on the initial work"" done by Christie. ___ Trump chief of staff pick to signal direction of presidency WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump is considering a conservative bomb-thrower and the face of the GOP establishment, among others, for White House chief of staff -- a major post that could set the direction for his presidency. The Republican president-elect is days away from naming his chief of staff, according to people with direct knowledge of his thinking. No position is considered more important than chief of staff, a behind-the-scenes power player who typically controls access to the president, guides the enactment of his policy priorities and oversees White House hiring. Trump has already narrowed his list to a handful of high-profile loyalists that includes Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, campaign CEO Steve Bannon and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. The incoming president repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" during his campaign's final weeks, yet both Priebus and Conway have operated for years in that same Washington ""swamp."" Bannon, by contrast, would represent a dramatically different direction, having spent recent years leading a conservative news site that fueled conspiracy theories popular with the ""alt-right"" movement of white nationalists. Trump ran as an outsider, but some suggest it would be risky to tap another outsider to serve as his right hand in the Oval Office. ___ Trump protesters: students, immigrants, anarchists and more PORTLAND, Ore. -- Donald Trump says the thousands of men and women taking to the streets to protest his election are ""professional protesters incited by the media."" But who are they really? The answer varies from state to state. The crowds include high school students, immigrants and anarchists.  ""There's no professional protesters here,"" said Jennie Luna, a 40-year-old professor of Chicano studies at California State University-Channel Islands, just north of Los Angeles. The day after the election, she organized what she called a ""self-care circle of courage"" on campus for students who needed an outlet for their distress over Trump's win. The event morphed into a rally and march that lasted several hours.  ""I am fearful for what will happen to the undocumented, I'm fearful of losing my reproductive rights,"" she said. ""And I'm fearful of the unknown."" America's new president has made many promises about changes to ""make America great again,"" such as undoing some regulations on companies. ___ Schools report racist incidents in wake of Trump election In the wake of Donald Trump's election, reports of racist incidents are emerging from the nation's schools and universities, including students who chanted ""white power"" and called black classmates ""cotton pickers."" Reporting by The Associated Press and local media outlets has identified more than 20 such encounters beginning on Election Day, many involving people too young to cast a ballot. At the University of New Mexico, a Muslim engineering student said a man attempted to snatch off her hijab Tuesday while she was studying.  ""I turned around and there's a really buff guy wearing a Trump shirt,"" freshman Leena Aggad said Friday. ""He reaches his hand out to my forehead and attempts to pull my scarf off."" Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League office that monitors extremism, said young people ""were watching and observing this presidential campaign as closely as anyone else."" Now that the campaign is over, ""the impact of what they have seen is not just going to go away."" ___ Chicago chief to meet monthly with black student protesters CHICAGO -- Chicago's police chief agreed Friday to hold monthly meetings with a group of black high school students who had planned a demonstration protesting an officer's fatal shooting of a black man and racist text messages distributed by students at another school. Superintendent Eddie Johnson met with the group of public school students, the principal of a Catholic school where students distributed the texts and leaders in the Mount Greenwood community on the city's South Side. He commended the students for ""forcing"" officials to discuss their safety concerns and assured them that if they do decide to protest, police will make sure they're protected. Marist, the Catholic high school, canceled classes Friday after the group that calls itself Black Lives Matter Youth scheduled a demonstration. One of its organizers, Eva Lewis, said the students' protest was postponed because the school district contacted their parents to warn them about potential threats. Johnson provided few details about the meeting but confirmed his offer to talk monthly to the group.  ""I told them if they created a curriculum and they wanted to come in and speak to members of the (Chicago Police Department), I would facilitate,"" he said. ___ AP EXPLAINS: How Paris was attacked a year ago, what changed PARIS -- A year ago the Islamic State group brought its extremist war to Paris, seeding terror with attacks on a rock concert, the national stadium and bustling sidewalk cafes. Here is a look at the deadly events on the night of Nov. 13, 2015, and their lasting consequences for the world. WHAT HAPPENED: THE ATTACKERS, THE VICTIMS, THE CHAOS It began with suicide bombings outside the Stade de France around 9:20 p.m., during a match between the French and German national soccer teams, with President Francois Hollande in attendance. Three bombers killed one passerby. If the attackers had made it past stadium security, the toll would have been much worse. Within minutes, the shooting began in eastern Paris, as the cafes of the 10th and 11th arrondissements were booming with Friday night revelers. Six cafes were targeted by a three-man commando unit-- Le Carillon, Le Petit Cambodge, Cafe Bonne Biere, Casa Nostra, La Belle Equipe and the Comptoir Voltaire. More than 400 shots were fired over about 10 minutes, leaving 39 people dead. Then came the Bataclan concert hall, where 90 others lost their lives. Three attackers stormed the hall during a performance by the California rock band Eagles of Death Metal, spraying concert-goers with gunfire and hunting down others who were desperately trying to hide during a nearly three-hour standoff. ___ John Kerry talks climate change but not Trump in Antarctica McMURDO STATION, Antarctica -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry didn't comment on Donald Trump's election victory while visiting Antarctica, but did say that citizens who care about limiting emissions might have to march in the streets to push for more aggressive action. Kerry became the highest-ranking American official to visit Antarctica when he landed for a two-day trip on Friday. He's been hearing from scientists about the impact of climate change on the frozen continent. Trump has called climate change a hoax and said he would ""cancel"" U.S. involvement in the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming.  ""We need to get more of a movement going,"" Kerry said when addressing several hundred scientists and staff at an evening event at McMurdo Station, the large base which is the hub for U.S. operations. ""We need to get more people to engage."" Kerry said there was a risk that much of Antarctica's ice will eventually flow into the ocean, raising sea levels worldwide. ___ UN reports civilian killings, other atrocities in Mosul BASHIQA, Iraq -- New reports emerged Friday of public killings and other atrocities committed against Mosul residents by Islamic State militants, including dozens of civilians whose bullet-riddled bodies were hung from telephone polls after they were accused of using cellphones to leak information to Iraqi security forces. The United Nations human rights office said IS fighters killed some 70 civilians in Mosul this week, part of a litany of abuses to come to light in recent days, including torture, sexual exploitation of women and girls, and use of child soldiers who were filmed executing civilians. The revelations are the latest reports of IS brutality as the group retreats into dense urban quarters of Iraqi's second-largest city, forcing the population to go with them as human shields. In its report, the U.N. human rights office in Geneva said IS shot and killed 40 people on Tuesday after accusing them of ""treason and collaboration,"" saying they communicated with Iraqi security forces by cellphone. The bodies, dressed in orange jumpsuits, were hung from electrical poles in Mosul. A day later, the extremists reportedly shot to death 20 civilians at a military base. Their bodies were hung at traffic intersections in Mosul, with signs saying they ""used cellphones to leak information."" ___ Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election NEW YORK -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is ""crazy."" Still, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets -- whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. Sources of spurious information have ranged from news articles produced by ""content farms"" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to ""hyperpartisan"" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. Case in point: ""FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE"" -- a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. Is it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? ___ Surf's up! Women compete for 1st time in big-wave contest HONOLULU -- Charging into violent waves at a Maui surf break known as ""Jaws,"" a group of women made history Friday as they competed for the first time in the World Surf League's big-wave surfing competition. The female competitors paddled into mountains of turquoise water towering more than 30 feet, but the wind shifted at the start of the first heat and several were pummeled by an unexpected breaking wave. Women have pushed for years to be included in big-wave surfing competitions, while organizers of some contests argued that conditions at famous breaks such as Mavericks in California were too dangerous for women. That competition will include women for the first time this season after state regulators said they might refuse to grant a permit if women were not included. And for the World Surf League, which holds professional competitions around the globe, it's been a matter of getting enough participants to hold a women's event. Competitor Bianca Valenti, who has pushed for women to be included in professional big-wave surf contests, called the day a big step forward for women in the sport.

""I told them if they created a curriculum and they wanted to come in and speak to members of the (Chicago Police Department), I would facilitate,"" he said. The meeting came amid increased tensions in the predominantly white neighborhood that is home to many police officers, firefighters and other city employees. An off-duty police officer fatally shot Joshua Beal, a 25-year-old Indianapolis resident. Police say Beal pointed a gun at the officer during a melee that began when an off-duty firefighter told the driver of the vehicle Beal was in that it needed to be moved because it was blocking a fire station's driveway. Since then, activists have held at least two demonstrations -- both of which attracted largely white crowds that shouted profanity and racially charged language at the protesters. At Marist, administrators launched an investigation after media reports that some female students in a group text discussed the shooting and the subsequent protests, with one using a racial slur against blacks. In a message posted online, school officials said they were ""devastated by the incident"" and that security at the school had been increased. The school also said that ""disciplinary action"" had already been taken but they would not elaborate. Some white residents of the area have said they were merely trying to stand up in support for the many police officers who live in the community. But the scene that was captured on videos showed angry crowds shouting down the demonstrators to go back to their communities and revving their motorcycles to drown out what they were saying. The alderman who represents the community on the City Council said he was caught off guard by what he saw on the videos of the protests.  ""Certainly when something as ugly as we have seen in the last week in my community, I was caught by surprise and I'm saddened by it,"" Alderman Matt O'Shea said. The school said in a statement Friday that it called off classes to ""ensure safety and limit learning disruptions."" School officials have launched an investigation of the students' text messages, telling parents in a message posted online that they were ""devastated by this incident"" and that security at the school had been increased. The school said that ""disciplinary action"" was taken but did not elaborate. In his own message on the Archdiocese of Chicago website, Archbishop Blase Cupich said he supports the school taking ""the necessary steps to deal with this situation swiftly and take appropriate disciplinary action."" And, he said, ""Racism is a sin and has no place in the Church, including the Archdiocese of Chicago."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The statehood referendum provides the most intrigue to a sleepy general election in the nation's capital, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 12-to-1. Hillary Clinton was expected to easily win the District's three electoral votes. President Barack Obama received more than 90 percent of the District's vote in each of his campaigns. On the statehood question, voters were being asked to endorse a draft constitution that would have city residents electing a governor, not a mayor, and a 21-seat state legislature instead of a city council. The constitution includes new borders for the proposed state, with the White House, the Capitol and the National Mall carved out as a separate federal enclave. Andre Williams, 53, a bus driver, said he voted for statehood.  ""We need representation,"" he said. As it stands, the city's lone representative in Congress is Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a 79-year-old Democrat who is barred from voting on the House floor and faces only token opposition in her bid for a 14th term. If voters approve the statehood referendum as expected, city leaders would then submit it to Congress, which can admit a new state into the union by simply voting to approve the document. But Republicans remain deeply opposed to statehood for both constitutional and partisan reasons: Making the District a state would dramatically shift the balance of power by all but guaranteeing two new Senate seats for Democrats. On Tuesday, voters also were choosing six members of the 13-member D.C. Council, though none of the races is expected to be competitive. The most noteworthy involves former mayor Vincent Gray, who is running to represent his home ward on the council and did his heavy lifting in the June Democratic primary, when he defeated incumbent council member Yvette Alexander. Coming out of his polling place in Gray's home ward, east of the Anacostia River, Anthony Jeffries, 63, said he voted for Gray.  ""When he was the mayor, he did a whole lot of good for the city,"" he said. Gray's bid for a second term as mayor was derailed by a long-running federal investigation that exposed corruption in his 2010 campaign. Six people who helped Gray get elected pleaded guilty to felonies. Federal prosecutors said Gray knew about the illegal funds that aided his campaign, an allegation that Gray denied, and after five years, prosecutors declined to charge the former mayor. On the council, Gray could serve as an antagonist to Mayor Muriel Bowser, who defeated him in the 2014 Democratic primary. The two politicians have a deep-seated personal animosity even though they lack major policy differences. Gray, 73, has not ruled out a run for mayor in 2018, although his support citywide is much weaker than in his ward, which is overwhelmingly black and poorer than most of the city. ___ Follow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols .

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/11/08/what-voting-for-clinton-would-have-meant-to-my-grandmother/	What voting for Clinton would have meant to my grandmother	"   (Darron Cummings/Associated Press)  This fall, my mother walked into the office for her first full day of work in 23 years. It's no coincidence that 23 years is also the amount of time I've been alive. With a B.A., a J.D. and a master's under her belt, my mom stepped off the escalator carrying her to professional success to take care of her newborn daughter and, three years later, her son. My mother, my grandmother and I were all born in the District's now-defunct Columbia Hospital for Women. My grandmother never went to college because no one expected her to. She didn't work, either, for the same reason - until, when her children were grown and her husband's career was all but over, she became involved in D.C. politics. My grandmother kept a big plastic bag of political buttons in her closet that I used to sift through and prick my fingers on - from George McGovern and every other Democratic lost cause of the second half of the 20th century to D.C.'s Polly Shackleton (the first elected city council member for Ward 3, whose 1974 campaign Granny managed) and Marion Barry (whose voice I heard projected from our answering machine in a voicemail after she died). I never understood when my grandmother was alive what the buttons meant: Before she worked, they were a way to feel that she, too, was in the mix, making a difference at the ballot box. After she worked, a way to show that she had done what no one had anticipated - and what no one had wanted her to do. My great-grandfather told my grandmother not to go to college. My grandfather, on the other hand, told my mother to get every bit of education she could, yet she chose not to work while she raised her children anyway. I don't think she regretted it. But it's hard to imagine she would have made the same decision if she had been a man. There's an idea out there that being excited about Hillary Clinton simply because she's a woman is anti-feminist. If we really held both sexes equal, the argument goes, gender wouldn't be a factor at all. We don't, of course, but even if we did today it'd be shortsighted and selfish not to think about how things were yesterday. Last night, I fished a shirt - suffragette white, I realized - out of the hamper and peeled off the ""I Voted Early"" sticker, which I placed on the bulletin board in my bedroom. I've voted before, but now seems like a good time to start my own collection."

The death of Mouhcine Fikri, who was crushed inside a garbage truck compactor, has prompted almost daily protests across Morocco involving complaints that far exceed the scope of the inciting event late last month. Fikri had climbed into the garbage truck to retrieve swordfish that had been confiscated and discarded by police because the species is out of season. Eleven people face manslaughter charges. Protesters in the Moroccan capital chanted ""We are all Mouhcine"" on Sunday as they marched down the main avenue toward Parliament. They also held banners reading ""No to Corruption"" and ""No to Humiliation."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
