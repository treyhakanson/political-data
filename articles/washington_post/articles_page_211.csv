The campaign launched Friday includes an interactive exercise where users can pretend to be a young person considering jihad. It's the latest of several government efforts to counter the slick propaganda of the Islamic State group, which has leveraged social media to draw in hundreds of disillusioned French people and has staged several deadly attacks on France. The government said in a statement that 5,700 suspected radicals have been flagged to authorities by family or acquaintances since 2014. Government prevention and deradicalization efforts have had limited success in the past, in part because many people attracted to extremism are distrustful of authorities.

Lawmakers late Thursday approved the change in a 64-0 vote in the 90-member parliament. Center-right opposition lawmakers abstained saying the vote was nothing more than a publicity stunt. Lawmaker Branko Grims said the this is ""nothing but PR."" Slovenia's constitution now states everyone has the right to drinking water. It says water resources are a public good managed by the state and supplied in a nonprofit service. Prime Minister Miro Cerar says ""being able to drink tap water around Slovenia should not be taken for granted."" He says ""it is a huge privilege that we must preserve for us and generations after us."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
