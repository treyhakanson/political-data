A new report warns of a leadership vacuum and even a nuclear arms race if the U.S. withdraws from a region threatened by a provocative North Korea. But authors of the Asia Foundation report provided to The Associated Press ahead of its publication Tuesday also say in some parts of the region there's hope that a shift from President Barack Obama's signature foreign policy could be for the good. Despite the major diplomatic capital invested by Obama in reaching out to Asia in the past eight years, his so-called ""pivot"" policy has yielded only modest gains in countering the rise of an assertive China. There's been a slight increase in the U.S. military presence in the region; a political opening in former pariah state Myanmar; and better relations with old enemy Vietnam. The main economic plank of his policy -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- is in ruins. Trump's election victory has erased chances of early U.S. ratification of the 12-nation trade pact. Determining what else of Trump's populist campaign rhetoric translates into action remains a guessing game -- one with high stakes for Asia. Trump has raised the specter of withdrawing U.S. forces from South Korea and Japan unless they share more of the burden of hosting the 80,000 troops -- even as neighboring North Korea has conducted nuclear and missile tests with unprecedented intensity. The Asia Foundation report, based on consultations among academics and former officials from 20 Asian nations, warns that withdrawing U.S. forces could compel Tokyo and Seoul to seek their own nuclear deterrents -- rather than rely on America's -- which in turn would ""trigger massive destabilization of the regional order.""  ""A precipitous reduction of engagement in Asia would be detrimental to the interests of most Asian countries as well as the United States,"" the report says. Trump has taken some early steps to allay those fears. He quickly reassured the leaders of Australia, Japan and South Korea of his commitment to U.S. alliances. On Thursday, Trump will meet in New York with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who is traveling to a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Peru. Japan's archrival, China, views a Trump presidency with less trepidation. It has viewed the pivot as a U.S. attempt to contain China's rise as a military and economic power. But Beijing is wary of Trump's threat to impose hefty import tariffs over alleged trade and currency violations, amid fears it could stoke a trade war. President Xi Jinping Monday called Trump and told him that cooperation was needed between the world's two biggest economies. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a Thai academic and one of three co-authors of the report, said that despite the uncertainty over Trump's lack of government experience, he has something in his favor -- a clean slate. Thitinan said that's a plus in Southeast Asia, where current U.S. policy has failed to live up to its billing and where criticism on human rights has turned off old allies like the Philippines and Thailand.  ""Southeast Asian nations don't want to be dominated by China, they don't want to put all their eggs in the China basket, but they've had to because the pivot and rebalance were shallow and ultimately hollow,"" he said. Indian academic C. Raja Mohan said Trump has in his own chaotic way opened a constructive debate about how Asian nations might take a more active role to cope with the rise of China with less dependence on America.  ""Unlike the European liberals' reaction in the last few days, Asians are going to accommodate rather than object,"" Mohan said. ""We have to deal with who is in power in Washington."" Once Trump fills top positions on foreign policy and defense, his intentions on Asia should become clearer. A recent commentary by two Trump advisers may offer clues. Former Republican congressional aide Alexander Gray and University of California economist Peter Navarro advocated an Asia-Pacific policy of ""peace through strength."" They cited Trump's commitment to increase the U.S. Navy from 274 to 350 ships, saying it will reassure allies that the U.S. ""remains committed in the long term to its traditional role as guarantor of the liberal order in Asia."" But they add: ""It's only fair - and long past time - for each country to step up to the full cost-sharing plate."" South Korea currently pays about $860 million a year -- about 50 percent of non-personnel costs of the U.S. military deployment on its soil -- and is paying $9.7 billion more for relocating U.S. military bases. Japan pays about $2 billion a year, about half of the cost of the stationing U.S. forces. Despite fears of chaos if the U.S. withdraws its military, former South Korean foreign minister, Yoon Young-kwan, there will be ""strong reservations"" about paying more.

Pipeline opponents are seeking to draw the attention of President Barack Obama and get his administration to reject a crossing at a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota. On Monday, the Army Corps said it had completed its review of the disputed pipeline but wanted more study and input from tribes before announcing its support for the crossing. Here's a guide to the latest developments and key background about the protest: ___ HOW WE GOT HERE Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners obtained federal permits for the $3.8 billion pipeline in July, two years after it was first announced. The pipeline would carry a half-million barrels of crude oil daily from western North Dakota's oil fields through South Dakota and Iowa to an existing pipeline in Patoka, Illinois, where shippers can access Midwest and Gulf Coast markets. Supporters say the pipeline would create more markets and reduce truck and oil train traffic. But the Standing Rock Sioux, other tribes and environmental groups say that the pipeline could threaten water supplies for millions, since it will cross the Missouri River, as well as harm sacred sites and artifacts. Since April, tribal protests have grown considerably at the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri rivers. Nearly 500 have been arrested, including Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman David Archambault II, as the protest has grown in size. ___ IN THE COURTROOM The Standing Rock Sioux, whose reservation straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border, are suing federal regulators for approving the oil pipeline. They have challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' decision to grant permits at more than 200 water crossings and argue that the pipeline would be placed less than a mile upstream of the reservation, potentially affecting drinking water for more than 8,000 tribal members and millions downstream. The tribe hasn't fared well in court so far. A federal judge in September denied its request to block construction of the entire pipeline and an appeal is pending in federal court. ___ WHAT'S THE TIMETABLE? The Army Corps of Engineers on Monday said it has finished a review of the disputed Dakota Access pipeline but wants more study and tribal input before deciding whether to allow it to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. Energy Transfer Partners said it will finish the pipeline by Dec. 1 except for a small disputed section in North Dakota, and expects it to begin moving crude in the first quarter next year if the government clears the final obstacle. The company still needs permission to construct the pipeline adjacent to and underneath Lake Oahe -- one of six reservoirs on the Missouri River. It said it would finish the pipeline within 120 days of getting approval for the easement. ___ LATEST DEVELOPMENTS A United Nations group that represents indigenous people around the world says the U.S. government appears to be ignoring the treaty rights and human rights of American Indians opposing the pipeline. The statement is from the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. It came after forum member Edward John spent three days at a camp in North Dakota that's drawn hundreds of protesters. John said he met with both protesters and law officers, and that he found a ""war zone"" atmosphere. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The remarks by Naftali Bennett reflect sentiment in the nationalist Israeli right wing that Trump's election could usher in a new era of relations with the United States. While the two countries are close allies, relations were sometimes tense between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because of their vastly different world views. Bennett last week welcomed Trump's election, predicting that ""the special relationship"" with the U.S. would grow stronger and noting that the Republican campaign platform had no mention of a Palestinian state. ""The era of a Palestinian state is over,"" he declared at the time. Speaking to foreign reporters on Monday, Bennett was more cautious, citing an order by Netanyahu for his Cabinet not to talk about the election in public. But he made clear that he will push his own government to rethink its commitment to Palestinian independence.  ""The combination of the changes in the United States, in Europe and the region provide Israel with a unique opportunity to reset and rethink everything,"" Bennett said.  ""It's no secret that I think that the notion of setting up a Palestine in the heart of Israel is a profound mistake,"" he added. ""I believe that we have to bring alternative new ideas instead of the Palestinian state approach."" Though Bennett said he didn't know whether Trump would support that view, he said it's critical that Israel now clearly define its own vision.  ""My expectation is not from anyone abroad,"" he said. ""After many years, the Israeli government has to decide what do we want."" Bennett's comments were also an indicator of the pressure Netanyahu could soon face to abandon his commitment to the ""two-state solution"" favored by Obama and the international community. For two decades, the international community has been pushing for a negotiated peace deal that would include the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip -- areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. The thinking was that Israel's continued occupation of millions of Palestinians would create a demographic time bomb in which Arabs would eventually outnumber Jews, threatening Israel's status as a democracy with a Jewish majority. After opposing Palestinian independence for most of his career, Netanyahu reluctantly endorsed the idea shortly after Obama took office in 2009. But critics, including Obama, have said that continued Israeli settlement on occupied territories have undercut this goal, and the Obama administration has at times questioned Netanyahu's commitment to seeking peace. Bennett leads the Jewish Home party, a coalition partner that is affiliated with the West Bank settler movement. He is one of the most influential voices in Israeli politics, and both his party and most members of Netanyahu's Likud oppose Palestinian statehood on either religious or security grounds. Bennett has instead called for annexing parts of the West Bank and granting the Palestinians in other parts expanded autonomy, with new roads, office parks and economic opportunities, with Israel retaining overall security control. Israeli hard-liners welcomed Trump's election last week, noting the strong support for Israel in his campaign platform and the many pro-Israel officials who advised him during his campaign. Their spirits were further boosted after a Trump adviser, Jason Greenblatt, told an Israeli radio station last week that his boss doesn't think West Bank settlements are an ""obstacle to peace."" Following Greenblatt's comments, Cabinet Minister Ofir Akunis, a close Netanyahu associate, called for a renewed wave of settlement construction. But such sentiments may have been premature. Trump's unpredictability has raised concerns that he might change his attitudes once in office. Over the weekend, for instance, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he would like to help broker a solution to the conflict ""for humanity's sake."" In an interview with ""Israel Today,"" a free daily owned by Republican super-donor Sheldon Adelson, Trump said he believed his administration can play ""a significant role"" in helping the Mideast parties reach an agreement. Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday that he would soon be meeting Trump. He ordered his Cabinet and lawmakers to avoid speaking to the media about the election while the incoming U.S. administration formulates its policies. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The department, which under President Obama built an aggressive civil rights division, is likely to take a more hands-off approach toward police departments alleged to have overused force and to loosen restrictions on surveillance in Muslim communities, according to legal analysts and Trump's public statements. Trump sought to position himself as the candidate of law and order, delivering apocalyptic speeches describing a nation torn apart by crime and terror. He said police in Chicago could stop a spate of deadly violence by being ""very much tougher than they are right now,"" and wrote to the International Association of Chiefs of Police that he would generally keep the federal government out of local law enforcement's business. He has been critical of Obama's effort to give clemency to inmates serving long prison terms for nonviolent drug offenses. In response to the terrorist attack in Orlando in June, Trump said he would renew surveillance on mosques.  [Donald Trump could actually take steps to try to jail Hillary Clinton]      Donald Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown"" of Muslims entering the U.S. in December. But since then, his commitment to a ""total and complete shutdown"" has wavered repeatedly. Here's how. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Those positions put him at odds with the current Justice Department. Under Obama, officials have tried to position Muslims as a partner in the fight against terrorism, and they have been supportive of broad changes to the criminal-justice system, including more lenient sentences for nonviolent drug crimes. The department has also taken a tough stance toward policing issues -- scrutinizing entire departments with comprehensive ""pattern or practice"" inquiries and investigating high-profile incidents of officers killing people. With the impending change, civil rights advocates said they are bracing for the worst. ""This is a guy who will have no problem targeting civil rights leaders, targeting reporters. We're back to a Nixon enemies-list world,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network. ""We've got to get ready to fight. This is serious."" The Justice Department's policy positions and priorities often change when a Republican takes over from a Democrat, and vice versa, and in many ways, Trump's administration will be no different. Under President George W. Bush, for example, the civil rights division took significantly fewer enforcement actions on anti-discrimination and voting rights laws than it did under President Bill Clinton. After Obama took office, then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. moved to give it back its teeth, taking aim at policies that officials thought resulted in racially disparate outcomes, even if the intent of those policies was not explicitly or intentionally racist. ""The civil rights division gets whipsawed more than any other part of the Department of Justice when the White House changes parties,"" said Bill Yeomans, who spent 26 years at the department, primarily in the civil rights division. ""This promises to bring a dramatic shift in priorities and ideology."" Legal analysts said the core mission of the Justice Department -- enforcing the nation's federal laws -- should remain the same. And they stressed that, because Trump has not yet indicated whom he will select as his attorney general, nor is he likely to follow traditional norms, it is hard to assess what his Justice Department might look like. ""We've never had a transition like this,"" said Jamie Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general under Clinton.   Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's top advisers and advocates, previously served as the third-highest-ranking official in the Justice Department. (Seth Wenig/Associated Press)  Two of Trump's closest advisers -- former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- have federal legal experience. Both were U.S. attorneys, and Giuliani served as the Justice Department's third-highest-ranking official under President Ronald Reagan. Giuliani has staked his reputation on the drop in crime during his time as mayor. Officers under him employed controversial stop-and-frisk tactics that a federal court in 2013 ruled were unconstitutional. Both Giuliani and Trump have made the dubious claim that the tactics drove down crime. Christie, likewise, built his political career on his image as a tough-on-crime former prosecutor, talking extensively during his presidential primary campaign about his national security prosecutions. The governor, though, has been tainted by the ""Bridgegate"" scandal, in which two of his former aides were convicted last week of conspiring to shut down the nation's busiest bridge to punish a local mayor who refused to support Christie's reelection bid. After his inauguration, Trump will face an early test in what, if anything, he decides to do with the investigation of Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. Although FBI Director James B. Comey recommended no charges in that case, Trump has said that he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into the matter and that, if he were president, Clinton would ""be in jail."" Trump could, in theory, order his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to reinvestigate the former secretary of state, although many conservatives argue that it would be ill-advised to do so. Analysts say Trump already will have to contend with the perception that the Justice Department is partisan. ""If anything has become clear as a result of the Justice Department's recent involvement in political affairs, it's that the public needs to be reassured that it's substance, not politics, that drives Justice Department decision-making,"" said George Terwilliger, who served as deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. Whomever Trump appoints will take over a department that has regularly waded into eruptions of anger that followed the deaths of black men and boys at the hands of police officers. In recent months, the Justice Department has opened investigations of fatal police shootings in Baton Rouge and Tulsa. The department also is investigating the Chicago police force, the country's second-biggest local department, after video footage emerged of an officer fatally shooting a teenager there. A U.S. official familiar with the investigation said that it is ""unlikely"" that the inquiry will wrap up before Trump is sworn in, and that once the new Justice Department leaders are in place, they could react to the investigation by deciding to take out some required reforms. The official said, though, that it was unlikely that new leadership would opt to override the results of the Chicago investigation or others that resulted in reform agreements already in place. Such inquiries are carried out by career officials rather than political appointees. ""I can't imagine that they would come in and undo those"" existing agreements, the official said. ""But would they initiate a new one in the future? They might be a little less likely to do those."" Giuliani, speaking to the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association in October, said that court-mandated police reform agreements show how the Justice Department has become ""politicized"" during the Obama administration. It is possible, were he to be appointed attorney general, that the department would simply stop suing police departments to bring about new agreements, or even enforce old ones, analysts said. ""The consent decree agreements already in place -- they could just choose not to enforce. They can let it all die by doing nothing,"" said Jonathan Smith, who for five years was the Justice Department's chief of special litigation, overseeing investigations of police departments. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, who has been outspoken on the issue of race and policing, announced recently that the FBI will begin a project next year to start collecting nationwide use-of-force statistics in hopes of building a national database. Trump, in response to questions from the International Association of Chiefs of Police, seemed skeptical to the idea, writing that ""the federal government should not be in the habit of demanding data from local or state law enforcement organizations."" ""Crime reporting should take place, but the management of local and state law enforcement should be left to those jurisdictions,"" he wrote. Sharpton and others said they are strategizing how they will apply pressure to Trump and his advisers, with the hopes of influencing his selection of attorney general, the Cabinet post most vital to issues of civil rights. ""We've fought for years, for decades on these issues. It is all at risk,"" Sharpton said. The American Civil Liberties Union, after Trump's election, vowed to challenge in court any of his policies that might run afoul of U.S. law. Many of Trump's changes, though, probably would draw support. The Fraternal Order of Police, which has more than 335,000 members and describes itself as the country's biggest police union, endorsed Trump in September. ""Our membership . . . is pretty energized by the results of the election,"" Jim Pasco, the union's executive director, said Wednesday. Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said that after Trump's comments about violent crime, immigration, drugs and terrorism, it remains to be seen whether his administration will provide more resources or try to expand its assistance to state and local jurisdictions in how they confront those issues. ""It's a different administration, and they will have different priorities, and they will put their resources where they think is important,"" he said. ""He definitely has expressed support for officers on the street. That did not go unnoticed. The question is: When you get into policy, how does that translate?""

The motion by South Africa's biggest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, was rejected by a vote of 214 to 126 after an often raucous debate in which rival lawmakers heckled and traded insults. The ruling African National Congress party, which has a majority in the parliament, had said it would not support the opposition motion against Zuma, virtually ensuring its defeat. While some ANC members have urged Zuma to resign, it was unlikely that ruling party lawmakers would defy the party leadership to back the opposition move against the president.  ""The only time we ever talk about our constitution in this house is when we debate how our president violated it,"" said Mmusi Maimane, leader of the Democratic Alliance. Nomvula Mokonyane, the minister of water affairs and sanitation, said the opposition was trying to distract Zuma's government from dealing with poverty and other pressing concerns. Last week, South Africa's state watchdog agency recommended that a judicial commission investigate the relationship that Zuma and some state officials had with the Guptas, a business family of Indian immigrants accused of meddling in the government for financial benefit. A watchdog agency report found possible ethical violations because the Guptas were allegedly involved in the removal and appointment of Cabinet ministers and directors of state-owned firms. Zuma said he wasn't given a chance to provide ""meaningful input"" in the investigation. In April, the parliament also rejected a motion to remove Zuma. That vote followed an apology by Zuma after the Constitutional Court ruled that he failed to uphold the constitution in a scandal over millions of dollars in state spending on his private home. ___ Follow Christopher Torchia on Twitter at www.twitter.com/torchiachris Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

What didn’t she see?	   Hillary Clinton at a rally in Raleigh, N.C., on the eve of the election. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Inside Hillary Clinton's campaign, she was known as Ada. Like the candidate herself, she had a penchant for secrecy and a private server. As blame gets parceled out Wednesday for the Democrat's stunning loss to Republican President-elect Donald Trump, Ada is likely to get a lot of second-guessing. Ada is a complex computer algorithm that the campaign was prepared to publicly unveil after the election as its invisible guiding hand. Named for a female 19th-century mathematician -- Ada, Countess of Lovelace -- the algorithm was said to play a role in virtually every strategic decision Clinton aides made, including where and when to deploy the candidate and her battalion of surrogates and where to air television ads -- as well as when it was safe to stay dark. The campaign's deployment of other resources -- including  county-level campaign offices and the staging of high-profile concerts with stars like Jay Z and Beyonce -- was largely dependent on Ada's work, as well.   [Trump's White House win promises to reshape U.S. political landscape]   While the Clinton campaign's reliance on analytics became well known, the particulars of Ada's work were kept under tight wraps, according to aides. The algorithm operated on a separate computer server than the rest of the Clinton operation as a security precaution, and only a few senior aides were able to access it. According to aides, a raft of polling numbers, public and private, were fed into the algorithm, as well as ground-level voter data meticulously collected by the campaign. Once early voting began, those numbers were factored in, too. What Ada did, based on all that data, aides said, was run 400,000 simulations a day of what the race against Trump might look like. A report that was spit out would give campaign manager Robby Mook and others a detailed picture of which battleground states were most likely to tip the race in one direction or another -- and guide decisions about where to spend time and deploy resources. The use of analytics by campaigns was hardly unprecedented. But Clinton aides were convinced their work, which was far more sophisticated than anything employed by President Obama or GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, gave them a big strategic advantage over Trump. So where did Ada go wrong? About some things, she was apparently right. Aides say Pennsylvania was pegged as an extremely important state early on, which explains why Clinton was such a frequent visitor and chose to hold her penultimate rally in Philadelphia on Monday night. But it appears that the importance of other states Clinton would lose -- including Michigan and Wisconsin -- never became fully apparent or that it was too late once it did.      President Obama brought his tried-and-true campaign slogans and humor-filled attacks on Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton's defense in the final days of the presidential campaign. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   Clinton made several visits to Michigan during the general election, but it wasn't until the final days that she, Obama and her husband made such a concerted effort. As for Wisconsin: Clinton didn't make any appearances there at all. Like much of the political establishment Ada appeared to underestimate the power of rural voters in Rust Belt states. Clearly, there were things neither she nor a human could foresee -- like a pair of bombshell letters sent by the FBI about Clinton's email server. But in coming days and weeks, expect a debate on how heavily campaigns should rely on data, particularly in a year like this one in which so many conventional rules of politics were cast aside.
8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/11/08/should-we-really-trust-voters/	Should we really trust voters?	"   A sign outside the Fairfield County Board of Elections Office in Lancaster, Ohio. (Ty Wright/Bloomberg News)  In the weeks leading up to today's election, we saw a resurgence of literature discussing an age-old question in political science: Are voters rational? Can we trust average citizens to make the right decisions at a collective level? This is a difficult question to answer, especially because it's not clear what being ""rational"" means. Economists have long argued that the act of voting itself is an irrational exercise, especially because a single vote has an estimated 1 in 60 million chance of ever being decisive in an election. Without a doubt, many find this a convincing enough argument not to show up at the polls on Election Day. If there's no sense that their vote will matter in the grand scheme, especially in a solid red or blue state where the outcome is essentially already written, why take the time and effort to contribute? Indeed, states that see larger margins of victory tend to see lower voter turnout, as data from the 2012 presidential election shows:       The core definition of rational behavior in economics would assume that voters primarily vote for their own self-interest, but this is not necessarily the case. Surveys have shown that voters often make their decisions based on what they think would be best for the country as a whole. In fact, research has also shown that voters often act more altruistically and display more delayed-gratification behavior than those who sit out elections. And while it's easy -- and often entertaining -- to run through all the evidence showing how ignorant the average American is about government and public policy, surveys do show that they are generally able to get the basics of what's in the news right. But even if the collective competency of the average voter is (marginally) acceptable, that doesn't necessarily mean they should set the agenda of the nation. As John Adams once famously said, ""Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself. There was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.""  That's not the ringing endorsement you'd want to hear from those who embarked on the world's first modern democratic experiment. And despite 240 years of a relatively operational government, the intellectual skepticism of democracy still runs deep.  Those of us who obsess about policy development see government as a sort of science, governed by empirical evidence and belabored dialogue. But you don't have to spend too much time at campaign rallies to figure out that the average voter doesn't think that way. Politics is primarily ideological and often personal. Hours of argument won't necessarily change people's minds; conspiracy theories and misconceptions are rife within the body politic.  The ideal democratic government keeps its elected officials accountable to the general electorate. If they're bad at governance, it's reasonable for them to be kicked out of office. But how do we expect voters to measure that? Research shows that voters are generally pretty good at reelecting governors if the economy is doing well and booting them when it's not doing well, but how much control does an incumbent have over the economy? Should voters be considered ""rational"" if they aren't able to parse out the nuance of economic trends? Even the staunchest believers in democracy must admit that it takes an extraordinarily long amount of time and effort for the general population to change its opinion on common-sense policies (such as ending slavery, enforcing civil rights and allowing women to vote, just to name a few of the uncontroversial items). This all seems to suggest that the question of voter rationality really depends on what we expect from the electorate. What does it mean for voters to be ""rational""? If the average voter is irrational, what does this mean for our political system? Over the next few days, we'll hear from: Robert Kurzban and Jason Weeden, authors of ""The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind: How Self-Interest Shapes Our Opinions and Why We Won't Admit It"" Jason Brennan, economics professor at Georgetown University and author of ""Against Democracy"" David Greenberg, professor of history and of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University"

"  The allocation of electoral college votes, by state.  In the charming children's book ""Duck for President,"" the title character outpaces the incumbent by five votes out of more than 101 million ballots cast. There is a national recount, and 10 more paper ballots stuck to the vice president go to the challenger. Duck wins! But of course in real life those 10 votes would only matter if they were hanging chads in Florida. You don't need 50,546,180 votes to be president -- you need 270. The electoral college will determine the winner of the presidential election tonight. I'll hold off on the debate over whether this is a good thing (until Wednesday, anyway!) Instead I want to highlight two other aspects of the electoral college (EC). First, its origins in the long-lost world of pragmatic political compromise. Second, its reminder that short-term solutions, when embedded in formal institutions, can become long-term forces that shape political behavior and outcomes. So how did the framers of the Constitution come up with this institutional legacy? For more detail, I'd refer you to Shlomo Slonim's essay ""Designing the Electoral College,"" published in Thomas Cronin's edited volume ""Inventing the American Presidency,"" or to Jack Rakove's book ""Original Meanings."" But the short version is that EC is the result of a series of trade-offs between contending interests. Keep in mind that the point of the Constitutional Convention was to write a new compact that could be approved not just by the delegates on the scene but also ratified by the states. In the 1960s, political scientist John Roche went so far as to call the EC ""a jerry-rigged improvisation"" that was ""subsequently endowed with a high theoretical content."" It's certainly true that the EC fit the needs of different constituencies. Even though there is a classical approximation of the EC in the Roman republic's method for choosing its officials, that parallel doesn't seem to have been discussed at the convention. Instead, it was all about finding a solution to a system of several different political equations. The moving parts included how to elect the president; how long the president's term should be; and whether the president should be eligible to run for reelection. Some thought Congress should choose the president, either because of legislators' superior knowledge of the candidates available, or because this would protect smaller state populations from having larger states dictate the presidential choice. After all, once the three-fifths compromise boosted slave state representation in the House, it was in their interests to push for legislative selection rather than a popular vote. They were joined by less-populous northern states, who feared that only candidates from the big states would ever win federal office. That position won out in the first draft of the Constitution -- which created a president who served for seven years and could not seek reelection. But this rested uneasily with many delegates. Some favored popular election on either tactical or normative grounds. They wanted electoral accountability, and that also meant the ability to run for reelection. Otherwise a permanent (and perhaps corrupt) lame duck might simply cash in while in office. But if legislators made the choice, the ""work of intrigue, of cabal, and of faction"" might simply cross the branches. And after all, giving one branch the ability to choose another undermined the separation of powers. This brought the idea of electors into the conversation. One proposal was to create a national electoral college, where each state would get votes on the basis of population, but with the ratio between large and small state votes capped at 3 to 1. Another, arguing that producing a national gathering was physically implausible, urged a state-by-state model. This had the advantage of making it much harder to corrupt all the electors at once, since those electors would be in 13 different places. But the arguments continued. How to choose those electors? Wouldn't people just choose candidates from their own state? Wouldn't all this just be a confusing mess? Finally -- in fact after the delegates had given up and gone back to legislative selection for a while -- the committee formed to work out unfinished business came up with the EC as we know it. It walked a fine line between most of the previous objections:  It gave larger states the edge, but not by nearly as much as a true popular vote would have done. At the time, the largest state had about 10 times the population of the smallest. (Today, that ratio is about 70 to 1.) In the EC, though, the ratio was 4 to 1 at the time (18.3 to 1 now). It adopted the state-by-state casting of ballots noted above. More crucially, it allowed the states to decide how to choose electors -- via popular vote, via the choice of state legislators (something the 2000 Bush v. Gore decision specifically reinforced), or via any other method the state came up with (electoral Powerball, anyone?) It required electors to vote for two names, one of whom could not be from your state -- so smaller states might get over the line after all, especially since . . . It kept legislative selection (by the House, voting by state delegation) as a backup plan, in case the EC did not have a majority. Some delegates certainly expected the EC to be the de facto nominating process, with the House as the final arbiter most years. Finally, by creating a temporary body that couldn't be bribed by an incumbent president, it changed other parts of the equations. Now the president could be eligible for reelection. And since the president was now independent from the legislature, they could give that office more power.  The EC satisfied many short-term political needs, then -- not least the need for different people to go back to different states and sell it as different things, so as to ensure ratification. And that short-term solution has had a long-term impact. The 12th amendment made sure the president and vice president ran on a ticket, but otherwise the original choices made by the framers are largely intact. As scholars have long observed, institutions are often ""sticky"" -- shaping tactics and outcomes far down the historical timeline. Now, as in 1787, we still argue about representation and balance -- between large states and small states (if no longer, thankfully, between slave states and free states), between the states and the federal government, and between the branches of the federal government. The deal reached then was hardly satisfactory to all, and rested on a ""not so great"" compromise as well as the ""great"" one creating Congress. But it helped confirm that the United States would be a ""democratic republic"" -- where both parts of that phrase mattered. We can hope, at least, that a spirit of compromise -- of making all of our democratic (small d) republican (small r) institutions work -- will imbue all of our political actors when the electoral votes are counted."
