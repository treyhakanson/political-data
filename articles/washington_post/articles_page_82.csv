The two men had made up the president-elect's chief of staff shortlist, and while Priebus received that job, Bannon's post also is expected to wield significant clout. The media executive with ties to the alt-right and white nationalist movement was given top billing in the press release announcing their appointments. Trump's hires were, at first glance, contradictory, though they fit a pattern of the celebrity businessman creating a veritable Rorschach test that allowed his supporters to see what they wanted. Priebus, who lashed the RNC to Trump this summer despite some intraparty objections, is a GOP operative with deep expertise of the Washington establishment that Trump has vowed to shake up. He has close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Wisconsinite.  ""I am very grateful to the president-elect for this opportunity to serve him and this nation as we work to create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism,"" Priebus said in the statement announcing his appointment. Bannon, meanwhile, helped transform the Breitbart news site into the leading mouthpiece of the party's anti-establishment wing, which helped fuel the businessman's political rise. Ryan has been one of his most frequent targets. ___ A man with many friends: Priebus tapped as chief of staff WASHINGTON -- In the year of the outsider, Reince Priebus was the face of the Republican establishment. Yet the Republican National Committee chairman would come to earn the trust and confidence of President-elect Donald Trump, who on Sunday named Priebus as his chief of staff, along with flame-throwing media executive Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist. The position puts Priebus at the power center of the new Trump administration. The 44-year-old Wisconsin political operative will help guard access to the president-elect, guide policy and political decisions, and if past practice holds true, will often be, along with Bannon, the last person Trump consults before making major decisions. Priebus has no governing experience in Washington. Yet his extraordinary ability to build and maintain relationships with his party's power brokers and grassroots sets him apart from other prospective chiefs of staff. The affable and slow-talking Priebus maintains a particularly close relationship with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is also from Wisconsin. At the same time, Priebus may have been almost as popular among the Republican National Committee's 168 members, who represent many different factions of the GOP and come from every state in the nation. ___ 10 Things to Know for Monday Your daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Monday: 1. TRUMP FILLS TWO KEY JOBS Republican Party chief Reince Priebus will be the White House chief of staff, while conservative media exec Stephen Bannon -- an unconventional pick -- is named top strategist. 2. ELECTION UPENDS BATTLEGROUND ON ABORTION, LGBT RIGHTS For the combatants in America's long-running culture wars, Trump's triumph sparked elation on one side, deep dismay on the other. ___ France marks 1 year since Paris attacks, wary and watched PARIS -- Less insouciant, more policed -- France is a changed place since Islamic State extremists killed 130 people in the country's deadliest attacks a year ago. Fearing it's becoming more divided, too, survivors and victims' families marked Sunday's anniversary of the violence by pleading for national unity instead. Tourism is hurting, armed forces roam streets and France is still under a state of emergency that rights groups call abusive and ineffective -- and that the prime minister now says may be extended yet again.  ""We always have this fear that weighs heavily in our hearts. We always try to be careful. And every time we pass by here, we think of them,"" said Sabrina Nedjadi, paying respects Sunday at two cafes in her diverse eastern Paris neighborhood targeted in the attacks. At midday, hundreds of balloons were released to honor the memories of the victims; at dusk, paper lanterns were released into the Canal Saint Martin, bearing red, white and blue lights representing the French tricolor. Onlookers, including many families with children, lined the canal and surrounding bridges, watching silently as the lanterns drifted. Some fear that France itself is adrift, its government unable to defeat the amorphous extremist enemy even as authorities encroach on liberties the French hold dear. ___ Powerful earthquake strikes New Zealand, killing 2 people WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A powerful earthquake that rocked New Zealand on Monday triggered landslides and a small tsunami, cracked apart roads and homes and left two people dead, but largely spared the country the devastation it saw five years ago when a deadly earthquake struck the same region. Strong aftershocks continued to shake the country on Monday, rattling the nerves of exhausted residents, many of whom had spent a sleepless night huddled outside after fleeing for higher ground to avoid the tsunami waves. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck the South Island just after midnight in a mostly rural area that's dotted with small towns. Near the epicenter, it opened up snaking fissures in roads and sparked landslides. The quake caused damage in Wellington, the capital, more than 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the north. It was also strongly felt to the south in the city of Christchurch, which was devastated by an earthquake in 2011 that killed 185 people. Residents said the shaking went on for about three minutes. Police said one person died in the small coastal town of Kaikoura and another in Mt. Lyford, a nearby ski resort. Several other people had reportedly suffered minor injuries in Kaikoura, police spokeswoman Rachel Purdom said. ___ Trump win resets culture war debate on abortion, LGBT rights NEW YORK -- For the combatants in America's long-running culture wars, the triumph of Donald Trump and congressional Republicans was stunning -- sparking elation on one side, deep dismay on the other. Advocates of LGBT rights and abortion rights now fear setbacks instead of further gains. But the outcome emboldened the anti-abortion movement and breathed new life into the religious right's campaign for broad exemptions from same-sex marriage and other laws. Kelly Shackelford, head of First Liberty Institute, a legal group that specializes in religious freedom cases, said that, for his cause, the environment will transform from ""brutal"" under the Obama administration to friendly given GOP control of both Congress and the White House. His clients include two Christian bakers in Oregon who were fined for refusing to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding.  ""Many of us who fight for religious freedom have felt in the last four or even eight years there was a lot of overreaching that was wrong,"" said Shackelford, who was among hundreds of religious conservatives who met with Trump last June. ""To have someone who is president-elect, who says I'm going to put an end to this ... we're going to go back to a country built on religious freedom. That makes us very hopeful."" Among the election's repercussions will be a renewed campaign, in state legislatures and in Congress, to pass tough anti-abortion legislation. Religious conservatives will press for far-reaching conscience protections and a repeal of regulations they said violated their religious liberty. And the push to let transgender students use the bathroom of their choice at school, strongly backed by President Barack Obama, may wither in the face of GOP resistance. ___ Once in office, Trump can quickly alter Supreme Court agenda WASHINGTON -- Even before Donald Trump chooses a Supreme Court nominee, the new president can take steps to make several contentious court cases go away. Legal challenges involving immigration, climate change, cost-free contraceptive care and transgender rights all could be affected, without any help from Congress. The cases turn on Obama administration policies that rely on the president's pen, regulations or decisions made by federal agencies. And what one administration can do, the next can undo. It is not uncommon for the court's docket to change when one party replaces the other in the White House. That change in direction is magnified by the high-court seat Trump will get to fill after Senate Republicans refused to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland.  ""We were hoping we'd be looking forward to a progressive majority on the Supreme Court. After the election results, there is a new reality,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. ___ New trouble in hardscrabble town: Blood tests for chemical NEWBURGH, N.Y. -- In this chronically struggling city along the Hudson River, residents beset by poverty, high crime and boarded-up homes now have an entirely new worry -- that their tap water may have exposed them to a chemical linked to cancer. State officials recently launched an ambitious effort to offer blood tests to Newburgh's 28,000 residents after the chemical PFOS -- used for years in firefighting foam at the nearby military air base -- was found in the city's drinking water reservoir at levels exceeding federal guidelines.  ""The fact that I've been drinking that water for years, and my daughter's been drinking and bathing in it, that's shocking to me,"" says Stuart Sachs, an artist who moved here from Brooklyn 14 years ago. ""My daughter is 11. What diseases is she going to have to look forward to? It's scary."" PFOS, or perfluorooctane sulfonate, has been linked to cancer, thyroid problems and other serious health issues. Results of the blood testing, expected to be released early next year, won't tell people whether they're actually at increased risk for any specific health problem, but will show how their exposure compares to others. Similar testing has been done in several smaller communities with water contaminated with PFOS or its close chemical cousin, PFOA, which is used in nonstick and stain-repellent coatings. ___ Gasps, tears as Iraqis return to IS-destroyed parish KARAMLIS, Iraq -- There were gasps, followed by tears at a small church in northern Iraq as a group of Christians returned to their parish Sunday to find that everything had been destroyed, including the statue of the Virgin Mary, which Islamic State militants had decapitated before they left. A confessional had been turned into a closet, a tomb had been desecrated, red prayer benches were burned. As the Rev. Thabet Habib recited prayers at the St. Addai church, the sound of broken glass crunched beneath worshippers' feet. Keramlis, a Christian town on the Nineveh plains in northern Iraq, fell to IS in August 2014, two months after the extremist group took Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul and surrounding areas, sending most of its inhabitants fleeing. The town was retaken by Iraq forces three weeks ago as part of the push for Mosul, but most of its homes were destroyed in the process. Many residents of the ancient Assyrian town some 18 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of Mosul now live in camps in Iraq's Kurdish region. Hundreds of others fled to neighboring countries, Europe, the United States and elsewhere. Some who returned Sunday came to attend a prayer service in their hometown, and check on their homes. ___ Rocker Leon Russell dies in Nashville NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Leon Russell, who performed, sang and produced some of rock 'n' roll's top records, has died. He was 74. Russell's wife, Jan Bridges, said in a statement that her husband died in his sleep Sunday at their Nashville home. She said Russell had heart bypass surgery in July and had been planning on resuming touring in January. His final performance was July 10 in Nashville. Besides his music, Russell was known for his striking appearance: wispy white hair halfway down his back and that covered much of his face. Russell recorded hit songs like ""Tight Rope"" and ""Lady Blue"" and participated in ""The Concert for Bangladesh."" John Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison played on his first album, ""Leon Russell."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
