There are the intimates: Stephen K. Bannon, the controversial provocateur and keeper of Trump's populist, nationalist flame; Jared Kushner, the unquestionably loyal son-in-law who whispers his machinations; and Jeff Sessions, the firebrand senator from Alabama whose clout is all-encompassing and often unseen. There are the operators: Reince Priebus, the consummate party man who will manage the White House; Paul D. Ryan, the wonky House speaker who stands ready to implement a wholesale overhaul of the tax code, health care and regulations; and Mitch McConnell, the wily Senate majority leader who intends to personally tilt the Supreme Court and federal judiciary to the right. And then there is Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is positioned to exert sweeping authority on all matters foreign and domestic as Trump's partner in governing. These seven men, as well as Trump's adult children and a few others, will make up an unusual power grid in a capital city used to a hierarchical structure. Trump is presiding over concentric spheres of influence, designed to give him direct access to a constellation of counselors and opinions.         1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

As president, his associates said, Trump will seek rather than shun competing advice. His presidency will be governance as a series of ongoing conversations. ""He's got this habit where he calls people every day to check in,"" said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser. ""He likes a lot of input, multiple, competing voices at the table. So a top-down White House is not him."" So it is that in assembling his White House, Trump announced that his chief of staff, Priebus, and chief strategist and senior counselor, Bannon, would be ""equal partners"" -- a departure from President Obama's West Wing, where Chief of Staff Denis McDonough stands alone atop the pyramid. The turbulent first week of Trump's transition has revealed a tendency in the president-elect -- one that was evident throughout his business career and during his campaign -- to reject rigid chains of command. So far, Trump has prized loyalty above all else. He demoted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as transition chairman in favor of Pence. People linked to Christie have been purged from the transition team -- including former Michigan congressman and House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers -- and acolytes of Sessions were elevated. Word has gone out to those interested in serving in the Trump administration that the top positions will almost certainly go to those who supported him during the campaign.   Sen.

Clary/AFP/Getty Images)    [Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet]   Jason Miller, communications director for the Trump transition, dismissed discussions of the emerging power matrix as ""inside baseball, palace intrigue."" ""If you know anything about Donald Trump's leadership style, it's that he's the one who's going to set the tone and the pace and the vision for what he wants to accomplish with the government that he's forming,"" Miller said. ""You can talk about all the different people coming on board to help implement that, but there's one person who's ultimately going to be driving it, and that's the next president of the United States."" People involved in the transition said Kushner is orchestrating nearly everything alongside Trump and Pence, from personnel to the administration's initial policy agenda. As quiet and discreet as his father-in-law is loud and combative, Kushner is said to have taken part in the ouster of Christie and the New Jersey governor's network. It is unclear whether Kushner will have a formal role in the administration or whether he and wife Ivanka will remain in New York, where they run their own businesses and are raising three small children. Regardless, though, Kushner is certain to be a regular sounding board for the new president. ""Jared Kushner's role is to provide advice and counsel as requested by the president-elect, which he does very well,"" Miller said. On Capitol Hill, leaders are calculating how to take maximum advantage of what they see as a rare opportunity with Republicans controlling both the legislative and executive branches. They believe Trump will put an emphasis on velocity -- hoping for a blizzard of accomplishments early on -- but focus less on the granular details, which could allow lawmakers to inject their pet priorities into Trump's big-ticket items. It is a careful dance. While Ryan (Wis.) and McConnell (Ky.) are busily preparing a spate of bills to take up in concert with the White House, they are treading cautiously, wary of getting ahead of the president-elect and cognizant that he is driven more by relationships and instincts than a political ideology. To that end, Ryan is promoting his ""A Better Way"" agenda as a guide for Trump on taxes, health care and regulatory issues. ""We're ready to roll in the House with a set of policies that we think Mr. Trump will buy into,"" said Rep. Sean P. Duffy (R-Wis.). ""I know he'll want to put his fingerprints on it, but it's almost a plug-and-play scenario."" Ryan or aides speak daily with Trump's team, with Jonathan Burks, the speaker's longtime policy adviser, serving as a liaison. Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), an early Trump supporter, has also been a bridge between the House leadership and the Trump operation. Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) said he and fellow Trump allies in the House would ensure the president-elect's populist views, as well as his hard-line approach to illegal immigration, are infused in every piece of legislation the body passes. ""For those of us who were with Trump when he had less than a 1 percent chance of winning, we want him to know that we're here for him to rely on,"" Barletta said. ""We know he won't settle for things being done slowly."" McConnell, meanwhile, is poised to be the ultimate dealmaker, considering how narrow the Republican majority is in the Senate, and already eyeing scores of vacancies in the federal judiciary, chief among them the Supreme Court seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.  Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said he and McConnell are working along with other Senate Republicans to get Trump prepared to make a round of judicial nominations. ""He's working with us, and I suspect we'll do just fine,"" Hatch said. ""He has said he'd accept someone from the Federalist Society list, and we'll be weighing in as he makes his decisions. We know he'll listen, because he knows this issue is one of the reasons why he won the presidency."" Trump's ability to work with Senate Democrats remains a variable, although he and new Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer -- both brash New Yorkers; Trump is from Queens and Schumer from Brooklyn -- could find bipartisan bonhomie on economic issues such as infrastructure spending. ""To do big, huge stuff you have to have bipartisan support,"" said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). ""We have a 52-seat majority in the Senate, a thin margin for majority votes. When it comes to huge things, you'll need 60. His instincts probably get that already, but if you want to move on your issues, that's the reality."" Throughout his life, Trump has followed a pattern, said Tony Schwartz, co-author of Trump's 1987 memoir, ""The Art of the Deal."" ""Trump sees himself as the straw that stirs the drink,"" Schwartz said. ""He has almost no interest in the details of how things happen, but he has an intense interest in being the decision-maker."" As Trump assembles his White House, he is reimagining the traditional staffing chart in the mold of his personality, with a group of aides and outside confidants expected to have direct lines to the Oval Office, members of his transition team said. Former GOP presidential rival Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and a vice chairman of Trump's transition committee, said the incoming team would work in harmony to transform the government. ""Bannon and Priebus worked very well together during the campaign, so there's certainly no reason to think that they won't work well together here as well,"" Carson said. ""Usually things are dictated by ideology and relationships. With Trump, they will be dictated by common sense, by what's practical and what actually works."" But other Republicans offered warning signs about erecting rival power centers. Patrick J. Buchanan, a veteran of the Nixon and Reagan White Houses, pointed out that Bannon and Priebus, regardless of their shared allegiance to the president-elect, carry with them different ideologies and experiences. ""Bannon is coming in with very strong views and ideas, and those are not the same ideas that Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan and the others have -- on security of the border, on trade deals, on globalization, on war and peace,"" Buchanan said. ""This is the reality. You're going to have a clash in the White House -- and the president is going to have to make the call."" Schwartz, who was a critic of Trump's candidacy and informally advised Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign on her opponent's psychology, said Trump seeks a variety of opinions in part out of necessity. ""He doesn't have a clear set of guiding principles inside him,"" Schwartz said. ""He doesn't have values that he feels compelled to live by. He doesn't have a significant store of knowledge about the subjects he's dealing with. So it would make sense that he's casting around for intelligence, even if he doesn't end up trusting or relying on it."" As with all things Trump, there are always people in his ear. His orbit extends to friends who may not join the government but whom he considers peers: investors Carl Icahn, Andrew Beal and Tom Barrack, and casino magnates Phil Ruffin and Steve Wynn. Amid this week's hubbub about filling the Cabinet, Icahn took it upon himself to break some news. ""Spoke to @realDonaldTrump,"" he tweeted Tuesday. ""Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce.""

Its Congress should take it.	" COLOMBIAN VOTERS stunned their government last month by rejecting a painstakingly negotiated peace accord with the FARC guerrilla movement, potentially reopening a 52-year-old war that has killed some 225,000 people. Complacency was part of the problem: Sixty percent of the electorate failed to turn out for the referendum, and the ""no"" vote was concentrated in cities far from the rural areas where the FARC has wreaked havoc. But many Colombians had serious objections to the pact, which would have provided amnesty for the insurrection's 7,000 remaining fighters and allowed their leaders to join the political system. Now President Juan Manuel Santos, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize shortly after the negative vote, has produced a new and amended accord that he says addresses most of the critics' concerns. Intensive talks between the government and opponents had produced a list of 57 issues; the president says 56 were addressed in the new deal with the FARC. It's likely that some of the accord's toughest adversaries will remain unsatisfied. But Mr. Santos would be right to move forward with the new agreement by seeking its ratification by Colombia's Congress. The implementation of the deal could end the last Cold War-era conflict in Latin America; the FARC was originally a Cuban-inspired Marxist movement that later took up drug trafficking. It could open Colombia's vast hinterlands -- the country is larger than Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico combined -- to investment and development, and provide alternatives to cocaine production and trafficking. It would also represent a foreign policy success for the United States, which beginning in the 1990s helped build and professionalize Colombia's military so that it could defeat the FARC on the battlefield. If that bipartisan policy has become more controversial in Washington, it is because Mr. Santos's predecessor Alvaro Uribe, who led the fight against the FARC from 2002 to 2010, has been critical of the peace settlement. Mr. Uribe in particular objected to the failure of the accord to provide for imprisonment of FARC leaders guilty of war crimes and its allowance of their conversion into political officeholders. The revised accord only partly addresses those concerns. Militants convicted of crimes by special tribunals would be confined to specified areas for determined periods; judges could effectively make it impossible for them to travel to the capital. The FARC would also be required to disclose its assets so that they may be used for reparations to victims. But the movement would still be guaranteed a certain number of seats in Congress, and its leaders would not be explicitly banned from holding them. The FARC argues that this is essential for its conversion to a peaceful democratic political party; in that there is some logic. Mr. Uribe has not yet taken a position on the new accord, but he appears to be in agreement with Mr. Santos that its fate should be decided by Colombia's Congress, not another referendum. If it is approved, the U.S. Congress should be ready to support it, by appropriating the $100 million in additional aid requested by President Obama. Colombia is finally on the verge of ending one of the hemisphere's most vicious and destabilizing conflicts; the United States, which did so much to make that possible, should help secure what ought to be seen as a clean foreign policy victory.

Last Tuesday's defeat of the longtime sheriff of metro Phoenix raises questions about whether his successor, Paul Penzone, will keep the contentious practices and how he will overhaul an agency that has been criticized for targeting immigrants, creating a culture of cruelty in its jails and serving as self-promotion for Arpaio. The retired Phoenix police sergeant will take office in January amid national uncertainty over the status of immigrants and fear within the Latino community since Donald Trump won the presidency. Penzone said he will cut off Arpaio's investigation into Obama's birth certificate and eliminate practices that he regards as Arpaio publicity stunts. But he is interested in keeping some of Arpaio's signature methods, such as using posse volunteers who help out in sheriff's operations to free up officers for police work. Here are some of the challenges that Penzone faces when he takes office: ___ JAILS Early in his two-decade tenure, Arpaio became popular with voters for jailing inmates in outdoor military tents amid Phoenix's triple-digit summer heat, making them wear pink underwear and using them to work on old-time chain gangs. The tough conditions appealed to those who believed, as he did, that jail should not be comfortable. Penzone said he will eliminate the pink underwear, which he calls a ploy lacking value to taxpayers.  ""That's the sheriff's brand,"" Penzone said of Arpaio. ""That's not about law enforcement."" He said he is willing to close the Tent City jail but is reserving judgment until he can make a full evaluation. Penzone plans to dramatically scale back the chain gangs by only using them in places such as parks. ___ IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWNS Penzone has no plans to restart the immigration crackdowns that made Arpaio a key figure in the country's border debate. Even if the incoming sheriff wanted to bring them back, the courts have barred the agency from immigration enforcement. Still, Penzone will be living with that legacy from Arpaio for years. Arpaio dragged his feet in complying with court orders to stop the patrols that a judge determined racially profiled Latinos, increasing the costs to taxpayers. The financial hemorrhaging is likely to continue until the sheriff's office comes in full compliance for three straight years. The case also led to a criminal contempt-of-court charge for Arpaio two weeks for Election Day, and he still faces possible jail time if convicted. Penzone said ending court oversight of the agency and controlling taxpayer costs are his priorities. The case is projected to cost taxpayers $72 million by next summer. ___ MISCONDUCT After a court order, the sheriff's office is overhauling how it investigates officer misconduct. The judge in the profiling case said Arpaio's internal investigations were fraught with biased decision-making and had been manipulated to shield officials from accountability. The judge has ordered new investigations into allegations that Arpaio's officers regularly pocketed items in traffic stops and safe-house busts. The agency's former head of internal affairs is under federal investigation on suspicion of concealing nearly 1,500 IDs. ___ REBUILDING TRUST Perhaps the most difficult challenge Penzone faces is restoring the Latino community's trust in the sheriff's office. The relationship was damaged by the dozens of Arpaio's immigration crackdowns over the years, leading some Latinos who witnessed crimes to avoid cooperating with police. The incoming sheriff said he will rebuild trust by establishing a culture of professionalism, meeting expectations on how the agency should operate and relieving taxpayers of their unnecessary financial burdens from the racial profiling case. Penzone said he was not worried about a backlash if he reverses Arpaio's policies.  ""You can be efficient, you can be ethical, you can be professional and still be strong on crime,"" he said. Arpaio said he doesn't mind if Penzone decides to undo his signature practices. The voters made a decision and he will accept it.  ""If someone else wants a change, it doesn't bother me at all,"" Arpaio said. ___ Follow Jacques Billeaud at twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud.

A couple sipped $10 martinis as a red campaign hat sat on the bar next to them. A group of guys with $5 beers filled a table, all of their bodies turned toward the four gold elevators in the lobby. Hours earlier on Tuesday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, walked through the bar en route to a meeting with the soon-to-be president upstairs, leaving a motorcade waiting just outside the bar door. Throughout the day, there was a parade of men in suits who looked important, creating a never-ending game of ""Guess Who?"" for the gawking media and actual gawkers. Just then, there was a commotion by the elevators as Trump's second of three wives -- Marla Maples -- emerged, rushed past reporters and left through the Trump Bar. Trump Tower is where Donald Trump lives and works. It was the setting for his reality television show and the headquarters of his presidential campaign. And now, as he prepares to become president, this is where Trump is building his administration. Unlike a private office building, the lobby of Trump Tower was legally designated as a public space as part of a deal that Trump struck with the city in the late 1970s and must be accessible to members of the public from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. That has forced the Secret Service and the New York City Police Department to devise an elaborate protection plan for at least the next two months.     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet   [After purge, Trump claims transition going 'smoothly']  There is a no-fly zone over Trump Tower, and the police have barricaded sidewalks near the building, creating a maze for those wanting to enter. Inside there are security checkpoints where bags are scanned, and visitors are wanded. Although Trump says he wants to get rid of gun-free zones on his first day in office, weapons are banned in his tower. Trump has a history of using this public space for his own financial gain, and he was fined in 2006 and 2015 for setting up kiosks to sell his own merchandise, according to the Associated Press. Months into Trump's campaign for president, he continued to operate two kiosks in the lobby, where he sold campaign merchandise alongside Trump-branded gear. Those pop-up shops vanished by the spring, and in late May, New York City officials investigated whether Trump was blocking members of the public from the atrium when he held news conferences and primary-night celebrations. As soon as that happened, Trump stopped hosting formal events here. Now the Trump Tower atrium is busier than ever. When the doors open to the public at 8 a.m., there is usually a swarm of reporters waiting to get inside. They spend the day sitting on a row of metal benches set up across from the elevators, watching who is coming and going, interviewing possible Cabinet members and trying to keep tabs on the president-elect, who rarely leaves. There are rules of decorum: no sitting on the ground, and no putting your feet on the benches or standing on them to take a photograph. Most reporters were on their feet all of Tuesday, trying to determine who was attending Trump's casting call. First came the campaign workers turned transition staffers. Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., arrived holding a pair of athletic shoes. Deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner rolled in with a suitcase. Beyond pleasantries, none wanted to talk to reporters.     Vice President-elect Mike Pence arrived at Trump Tower for talks about the transition from President Obama's administration to President-elect Donald Trump's administration on Nov. 15 in New York. (The Washington Post)    [Trump dumps his press pool again, raising flags about future access]  Then came the potential Cabinet members. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has advised Trump for months, strolled in and chatted with a few reporters about how this is ""such an exciting time."" He jumped into a packed elevator when the questions turned to his possible role in the administration. Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group partner who is advising Trump, walked up to reporters and said he is helping the president-elect prepare to ""get the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan."" But he demurred when asked about rumors that he is in the running for treasury secretary: ""I'm not going to comment."" Whenever there was a lull in the traffic, a janitor wearing a bow tie and dinner jacket would rush in to mop the marble floors, which were especially difficult to keep clean that day as rain poured. At one point, security personnel put up a red velvet rope to better corral the ever-growing group of reporters. As the day wore on, more and more tourists arrived, taking photos of the media and asking who famous might be there that day. Two tourists from Belgium hung around for nearly an hour but left when told the media had not laid eyes on Trump since late last week. Two other tourists from Italy provided unsolicited political punditry. At 11:28 a.m., Pence's motorcade pulled up outside the Trump Bar long after its expected arrival time. Out came the vice president-elect, his wife and an entourage of aides and security. Pence waved but did not say anything. When he left more than six hours later, he said just four words: ""Great day! Great day!""  [Here are the people the rumor mill says Trump might pick for Cabinet spots]  At lunchtime, the food court in the building's basement -- reached using the famous escalator that once carried Trump down to his announcement speech in June 2015 -- was packed with police officers, journalists, tourists and a few people who actually work in the building. As the afternoon progressed, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg stopped by to let reporters know that it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the transition process or anything happening upstairs but that everything is going ""great, great."" ""He's going to be a great president,"" Kellogg said. ""He's got a great team. He's got great people."" As Kellogg listed everything that is great, Peter Thiel -- a libertarian Silicon Valley billionaire who leads a venture capital firm -- sneaked into the lobby and quietly got on an elevator without the media noticing. Soon there was another lull, and a bow-tied man vacuumed the carpet, while a mother from Alabama and her two daughters asked reporters for directions. Fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger was spotted, although he has an office in the building and was probably headed there. Then, just before 4 p.m., Maples -- Trump's second wife who barely seems to have aged since they divorced in 1999 -- was spotted at the Starbucks on the second floor, taking photos with people who recognized her. Soon, she was in the elevator, presumably headed to see Trump. Less than 30 minutes later, she was back in the lobby and walking quickly toward the Trump Bar. "

Republican lawmakers were discussing the plan at a closed-door meeting when Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the plug, saying the issue should be debated in public. Ryan promised to revisit the issue early next year. Former Speaker John Boehner imposed a moratorium on earmarks several years ago after they became associated with corruption and boondoggle projects such as Alaska's ""Bridge to Nowhere."" Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, said he supports efforts to revisit earmarks -- with more openness and clearly defined rules -- but said the timing was off. Voters chose President-elect Donald Trump in part because of his pledge to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington corruption, and restoring earmarks so soon ""would have been a bad look,"" Simpson said. Still, Simpson and other lawmakers defended earmarks, saying the five-year-old moratorium has given power to ""unelected bureaucrats"" in the executive branch who now decide whether projects important to local districts are built.  ""There's a sentiment that we've given away too much of our own power to the executive branch,"" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a seven-term veteran and ally of both Boehner and Ryan. Asked about Trump's pledge to ""drain the swamp,"" Cole replied that the swamp ""must be in the executive branch,"" because voters ""didn't change much in the legislative branch,"" where Republicans maintained control of both chambers. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the third-ranking House Republican, said that under President Barack Obama, executive-branch officials ""are writing rules and regulations that are having a negative impact on our economy. It's time to restore that balance and frankly return that power to the people of this country."" Follow Matthew Daly: https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

"   President-elect Donald Trump walks onto a balcony at the Capitol in Washington on Nov. 10. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)  The election of Donald Trump, who campaigned on reducing regulation across industries, lifted shares of publicly traded for-profit colleges, a sector that Wall Street shunned as operators contended with tougher federal rules and oversight. But while investors might expect a wholesale roll back of regulations aimed at for-profit educators, higher-education experts said that will not be enough to save the industry.   [Trump's win leaves Obama's higher-education reforms in doubt]   ""The irrational exuberance around the election and the future of for-profits will prove enormously misplaced,"" said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, speaking Wednesday on a panel hosted by the Cato Institute. ""The government can certainly put the schools on the honor code, wish them luck and not police them. But at the end of the day, they can't force people to enroll. Victims go back to their communities, speak to their neighbors and the sector runs out of targets.""   [Is the federal government trying to take down the for-profit college industry?]   Trump has made no mention of his views on for-profit colleges, and the lawsuits over his own Trump University could complicate matters. But he has called for curtailing the powers of the Education Department, if not the outright abolishment of the federal agency at the center of the industry's complaints. The department has enacted stringent employment and student loan rules that for-profit colleges say are designed to cripple the sector, alongside a rash of state and federal investigations and lawsuits. ""Most for-profit colleges have been fighting for their survival with a regulatory administration who was really emboldened to advance a political agenda,"" Eric Juhlin, chief executive of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education, which runs career schools Stevens-Henager College and CollegeAmerica, said at the Cato panel on for-profit education. ""And that political agenda from the current administration filtered into the Department of Education."" Former students, advocacy groups and liberal lawmakers have argued that after years of deceptive marketing, shoddy programs and high loan-default rates, for-profit colleges have no one to blame for the upheaval in the market but themselves. They say government rules and sanctions arrived too late for the tens of thousands of students harmed by Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institutes, whose behavior did more to hurt the image of the industry than the government. ""What I see from the for-profit sector is an utter failure to recognize that the obstructionism and absolute unwillingness to really work constructively to fix whatever problems exist,"" Nassirian said. ""That obstruction has created such brand toxicity for the sector that it is going to take them better than a decade to restore some measure of neutrality."" For-profit colleges have fought to kill rules that would banish them from the federal student aid program when graduates fail to find work earning enough to repay their debt, as well as force them to cover the cost of canceling the loans of students defrauded by their schools. Congressional Republicans have stood by the industry, and Nassirian suspects there will be an effort to undo some regulations, but it won't be easy.   [New federal rules could make it easier to have student loans forgiven]   Rules governing the discharge of student loans, for instance, have been finalized. Even though they don't take effect until July, the most the new administration would be able to do is push back the date, he said. Unraveling the gainful employment regulation, which is already in effect, would mean going through the same arduous rulemaking process that produced the rule after years of negotiations. Nassirian said he doubts the incoming administration will have the manpower in place a year from now to get the process going. Juhlin, of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education, said it would be a mistake for the for-profit industry to push for the wholesale repeal of all regulations enacted in the past seven years. Instead, they should ask for parity in the application of those rules because all sectors within higher education could do a better job graduating students and helping them find work. ""With a new leader in the Department of Education, we'll swing back to a more objective perspective where we're enforcing the rules, but removing some of the most draconian, punitive regulations that exist to target specific sectors . . . simply because there was an intent to drive a political perspective,"" he said. Century Foundation senior fellow Robert Shireman, a former undersecretary of education, said applying the regulations equally would mean a for-profit college must put all of its revenue into education and have leadership without vested financial interests in the school. He has criticized the financial structure of career schools, including those run by Juhlin, who is suing the government for refusing to recognize his chain as a nonprofit organization under the federal financial aid program.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is saying ""progress does not move in a straight line."" T-Mobile's CEO John Legere tweeted ""let's see what an out of the box, non-typical, non-politician can do for America!"" CEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the election -- a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that major brands have long espoused. Some are using it as an opportunity to bring their employees together following a divisive election campaign. Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies' values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign. The men and woman who head the nation's biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. They also know that they operate in liberal bastions like New York and San Francisco just as much as in Trump-leaning places like Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Charleston, West Virginia.  ""Neutral is the best policy,"" says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. T-Mobile's Legere, who long was vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory, while holding off on judging the president-elect's policies. Meanwhile another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that ""it's our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader."" It's possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry. All five FCC commissioners will see their terms expire during Trump's first term. CEOs of automakers, including Ford's Mark Fields, have also struck a conciliatory tone, partly because Trump has called for the repeal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has allowed the automakers to set up shop in Mexico tariff-free. Many CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop.  ""We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,"" said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney. CEOs and companies that try to bring people together are ""going to be the winners,"" says Dr. Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University's Lubin School of Business. ""That always works better from a brand perspective,"" he says. Wall Street, which donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, also now faces an administration that could provide both profit and peril. Trump has said he wants to roll back some of the regulations in the Dodd-Frank law that was passed after the financial crisis, a move that would benefit big Wall Street banks. But the Republican Party's platform also contains a provision calling for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Great Depression-era law that broke up big banks. There's talk of a massive, $1 trillion infrastructure program that could rely on tax credits to private funding sources. Many of those programs will require Wall Street's army of investment bankers and lawyers to help underwrite and finance.  ""The president-elect's commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform -- among other things -- will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm,"" said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to a transcript of a voicemail he sent companywide. In an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows ""the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face."" Trump's victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple's iPhones. In a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn't mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn't support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity. Cook didn't mention encryption, which he has previously argued is essential to protect consumers' privacy. But he added, ""While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed."" Microsoft's chief executive was more conciliatory. In a post on LinkedIn, the social networking site that Microsoft is buying, Satya Nadella wrote: ""We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday."" But Nadella added that Microsoft is committed to ""fostering a diverse and inclusive culture."" Facebook's Zuckerberg, who had previously criticized Trump's call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network.  ""I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,"" he wrote. ""This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line."" The most combative response came from the CEO at Grubhub, an online food delivery service based in Chicago. Matt Maloney said in an email to employees that he rejects Trump's ""nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics,"" adding that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign ""because you have no place here."" Maloney later backtracked in a tweet that said ""Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees -- even those who voted for Trump."" Other companies have taken the election and its aftermath as a marketing opportunity, most notably airlines. British Airways ran ads on Facebook urging people to visit London, using the tag line ""had enough of this house?"" under a photo of the White House. Air New Zealand ran ads on Instagram and elsewhere highlighting the results of the election and inviting people to visit New Zealand. Spirit Airlines promoted a 75 percent off sale for flights to Canada. ___ AP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this report from San Francisco.

(STF/AFP/Getty Images/file)  Hillary Clinton was not the only presidential candidate to lose to Donald Trump on Tuesday. Joining her were minor party and independent candidates, including Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Johnson and Stein were expected to perform exceptionally well for minor-party candidates -- and perhaps even to break through and establish their parties as viable alternatives in future elections. That didn't happen. Here are answers to five key questions about the performance of third parties in 2016. Did Johnson and Stein cost Hillary Clinton the election? We cannot know how Johnson and Stein backers would have voted if forced to choose between Clinton, Trump and staying home. It may be some time before we have the data we need to know for sure. But let's work with the data that we have.   [This is why Senate Republicans might not go nuclear]   First, in five states Trump won by a margin smaller than the combined Johnson/Stein vote: in Arizona (by 0.6 percentage points), Florida (1.6), Michigan (4.4), Pennsylvania (2.0) and Wisconsin (3.7). What if we add the entire Stein vote to Clinton's total in these states? This would have flipped the outcome in Michigan (16 electoral votes) and Wisconsin (10), and left Clinton just 19,234 votes short (as of this writing) in Pennsylvania (20) -- a margin she might have overcome without Johnson in the race. Adding the first two states to Clinton's column would give her 258 electoral votes, while Trump would have 280. Adding Pennsylvania would have put Clinton over the top, 278 to 260.   [Even in defeat, Clinton's campaign could still inspire young women]   But this projection rests on the unrealistic assumption that all Stein voters would have voted for Clinton. Probably some would have stayed home, skipped the presidential race or voted for another candidate. Second, the 2016 exit polls asked voters how they would have voted if forced to choose between the two major-party candidates. Based on those answers, in the five states identified above, Trump would have kept his lead in Arizona (48 percent to 44 percent) and Florida (48 to 46 percent). Clinton would have flipped Michigan (48 to 44 percent). In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Clinton and Trump would have tied at 48 percent apiece. In each case, the other respondents said they would have abstained from voting. Clinton might have won, based upon these data, but only by winning both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. If Trump held onto even one, he would have kept an electoral college majority. But we can't be certain that this year's exit polls were accurate. They led some pollsters to forecast a Clinton victory. If the exit polls were skewed in Clinton's direction by even one percentage point in Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, she would still lose in the electoral college.   [In record numbers, Latinos voted overwhelmingly against Trump. We did the research.]   How did Johnson and Stein do in 2016?  Gary Johnson won 3.3 percent of the national popular vote, and Jill Stein 1.0 percent (as of this writing). This is a dramatic improvement over 2012, when the same two won 0.99 percent and 0.36 percent, respectively. Johnson's showing is the best in Libertarian Party history. Stein's falls well short of Green nominee Ralph Nader's 2.7 percent in 2000. On the one hand, the Libertarians and Greens tripled their vote share from the previous presidential election and further established themselves as the most viable organized alternatives to the two major parties.   [Everything you need to know about the worldwide rise of populism]   On the other hand, Johnson and Stein never were serious threats to Clinton and Trump nationally or in any individual states. And they were far from the most successful minor party candidates in recent presidential history: George Wallace won 13.5 percent of the vote as the American Independent Party nominee in 1968, and Ross Perot won 8.4 percent as the Reform Party's nominee in 1996. (Perot also won 18.9 percent in 1992 as an independent candidate, and John Anderson won 6.6 percent in 1980 as an independent). Weren't Johnson and Stein supposed to do even better this year?  Many political observers thought this might be the year that a minor-party or independent candidate finally became a viable alternative in a presidential race. After all, Clinton and Trump had historically high unfavorable ratings for presidential candidates. Both were scandal-prone, from Clinton's FBI email investigation and embarrassing WikiLeaks revelations to Trump's tax records and treatment of women. Add to that voters' apparent disdain for the two-party system and ""politics as usual,"" and conditions would seem to have been ripe for a serious minor-party threat in 2016. Further, the Libertarian Party ticket of Johnson and Bill Weld, as we noted here earlier this year, appeared to be the most experienced minor-party presidential ticket in at least a generation. Both are former two-term governors who served as Republicans in reliably Democratic states -- Johnson in New Mexico, Weld in Massachusetts. Unlike many minor-party candidates, Johnson and Weld were on the ballot in all 50 states. Their message of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism seemed to appeal to disaffected voters in both parties.   [How rural resentment helps explain Donald Trump's victory]   Early polling even suggested that Johnson-Weld might earn the 15 percent support necessary to qualify for the fall's presidential debates. In the end, they didn't come close. Why didn't they do better?  Let's take this question in two parts: first, focusing on the structural disadvantages that Johnson and Stein faced; second, focusing on the weaknesses of their particular campaigns.   [Hate Trump if you want. But democracy requires respecting the winner's legitimacy.]   First, minor-party candidates are at a massive disadvantage in U.S. elections. Our electoral institutions are designed to ensure, although not mandate, a two-party system. Amanda Skuldt explained how in an excellent Monkey Cage piece. The short version is this: Most American elections award a single office to whichever candidate wins the most votes. This creates powerful incentives for parties to build the broadest possible coalitions to win an electoral plurality -- and for voters to choose among these coalitions in order to avoid ""wasting"" a vote on a candidate who will not win. Add a host of state laws limiting ballot access for minor-party candidates. Second, Johnson's and Stein's prospects considerably weakened over the campaign. Johnson was winning from 7 to 9 percent of the national electorate's support between mid-July and mid-September. That started to fall steadily in late September, to less than 8 percent just before the first presidential debate on Sept. 26 and below 7 percent just before the second presidential debate on Oct. 9. By Nov. 8, he was projected to win just 5 percent of the vote. But even that was too high: Johnson won only 3.3 percent of the national popular vote, suggesting that the polls had overstated his support throughout the campaign.   [Donald Trump's foreign policy sounds familiar -- but here's what's missing]   Similarly, Stein was polling at 2 percent, on average, at the end of the campaign, but won only half that in actual voting. She had been polling up to 5 percent in mid-July, before falling to 3 percent in late September and 2 percent in late October, according to the RealClearPolitics average. Why such a decline? It is tempting to blame the candidates' high-profile gaffes, such as Johnson's infamous ""Aleppo Moment"" and Stein's air travel embarrassments. Actually, the polling declines did not coincide with these or other gaffes, but with the presidential debates. Presumably, the binary logic of the two-party system kicked in and many voters chose what they considered the ""lesser of two evils."" U.S. minor-party candidates usually lose ground as campaigns end, probably for that same reason.   [This book helps explain the unexpected rise of Donald Trump]   What are the prospects for minor parties going forward? The Libertarian and Green parties had some success in 2016; in addition to tripling their vote share from 2012, both gained significant media attention via CNN town halls and television advertisements. Yet they faced challenges that go beyond those noted above, including a lack of federal matching funds, state ballot-access restrictions, and voters' willingness to vote for the ""lesser of two evils."" There may be different presidential candidates in 2020, but probably not different rules. If so, minor parties shouldn't expect the results to change, either. Christopher J.

(Paramount Pictures)  This post discusses the plot of ""Arrival."" And though I'm normally somewhat skeptical of plot warnings, ""Arrival"" is the rare movie that is better seen totally cold. Oscar season has its downsides, among them the fact that it means a host of terrific movies arrive all in a rush, straining the schedule of even the most dedicated filmgoer. But this year, that ordinarily vexed schedule has the upside of providing American audiences with both distraction and fodder as we process the results of a hugely consequential presidential election and attempt to re-position ourselves to face new realities. In these circumstances, I found myself outstandingly grateful for ""Arrival,"" Denis Villeneuve's excellent and unpredictable movie based on a short story by Ted Chiang about aliens who arrive at 12 locations on Earth, and Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the linguist who is tasked with trying to learn how to speak to the creatures who have parked their vessel in Montana. As Louise begins her approach to the aliens, who come to be known as Heptapods, ""Arrival"" explores all sorts of interesting ideas about the international order and cross-species communication that have plenty of relevance for our present moment. But it's not so much the alien plot of ""Arrival"" that makes it the perfect movie for this moment, though, like the best movies about extraterrestrial life, ""Arrival"" captures a sense of profound dislocation that resonates powerfully with the shock and reorientation that characterize so many Americans' response to the results of last week's presidential election. Instead, it's the film's twist: In the process of learning the Heptapods' language, Louise engages so deeply with them that she begins to perceive time differently. Throughout the movie, she has been periodically overwhelmed by what seem to be memories of her daughter Hannah (played at various ages by Jadyn Malone, Carmela Nossa Guizzo, Abigail Pniowsky and Julia Scarlett Dan), who has died of a rare disease. Were that actually the case, Louise would be in good company with all the women from cinematic history who have turned to space as a response to grief, or as a way to fulfill their roles as mothers. But ""Arrival"" is something more complicated. As we -- and Louise -- eventually learn, her mastery of the Heptapods' language is giving her access to glimpses of her own future, first involuntarily, and later in ways that she can control. The visions she's seeing of her daughter in which Hannah grows up, and in her teenage years sickens and dies, are not Louise's past. They're what is to come. And at the end of the movie, knowing that Hannah will die; knowing that Hannah's father, Ian (Jeremy Renner), will leave Louise once he learns that Louise was aware that Hannah would not live to adulthood, Louise faces her own future and proceeds into it bravely and unflinchingly. She loves Ian and parents Hannah with joy and passion. Despite recognizing the pain that will follow from those decisions, she makes them anyway, not because she intends to cause Hannah or Ian pain, but because she recognizes that beauty and goodness will result from her choices, too. There's nothing explicitly political about Louise's courage, and in fact, the most sharply political note in ""Arrival,"" an Alex Jones-like figure who rails against the Heptapods, is a misstep that detracts from the movie's powerful strangeness. But sometimes in moments of great trouble, the most powerful tonics aren't direct commentaries on the tragedies of the age. Rather, they're stories that take us out of our own circumstances and then return us to ourselves, fortified with the qualities we need to survive and thrive on our reentry. ""Arrival"" is the sort of movie that serves as a reminder of what art can do that politics cannot. That it arrived in theaters the weekend after the presidential election is fortuitous, not foreordained. It's not a take, it's not commentary, it's not about the specific pall that has befallen us. But ""Arrival"" transported me at a moment when I badly needed a reprieve, and left me determined to try to be a certain, better kind of person, no matter that the challenges before me are more quotidian than Louise's intergalactic leap. ""Arrival"" touched down, gently and beautifully, at precisely the time I needed it most."
