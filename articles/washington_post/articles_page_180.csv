"   The sobering Nov. 13 news article ""Trump is about to learn all of 'our deep secrets' "" reported that the responsibility to oversee covert federal operations seeking to avoid nuclear war, avert cyberattacks and thwart mass-scale terrorism has awed and humbled previous presidents. How will such knowledge affect President-elect Donald Trump? Surely his pre-inauguration briefings will include secret military plans regarding one of our darkest secrets: the growing security risks of economic and political destabilization from our changing climate.  The Pentagon has publicly acknowledged global warming as a threat multiplier; soon, Mr. Trump will know our military plans to respond as tropical diseases spread, water and food supplies dwindle and refugee populations expand as weather patterns transform and ocean levels rise. Perhaps the intelligence briefings will open the president-elect's mind to the ideas of progressive Republican Gifford Pinchot, who wrote in the 1940s: ""World-wide practice of Conservation and the fair and continued access by all nations to the resources they need are the two indispensable foundations of continuous plenty and of permanent peace."" Or perhaps Mr. Trump will continue to ignore the escalating threats of global climate change and, to our peril, learn nothing at all.  Julie Dunlap, Columbia                "

PAUL, Minn. -- A Minnesota police officer who shot and killed Philando Castile during a July traffic stop will be allowed to remain free as a manslaughter case against him proceeds, a judge ruled during a brief court hearing Friday. St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez was released on his own recognizance after an initial court hearing. Yanez was charged this week with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Castile, a 32-year-old black man who was shot during a July 6 traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights after he told Yanez, who is Latino, he had a gun and a license to carry. Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. On Wednesday, prosecutors said Yanez acted unreasonably and was not justified in using deadly force. Yanez did not enter a plea Friday, which is standard during initial court appearances, but one of his attorneys, Tom Kelly, said Yanez intends to plead not guilty. His next hearing is set for Dec. 19. Kelly said Yanez's defense team is disappointed in the charges and concerned by Ramsey County Attorney John Choi's statements that no reasonable officer would have acted as Yanez did.  ""We find those comments to be unnecessary beyond the scope of the criminal complaint and unfairly prejudicial,"" Kelly said. When asked if defense attorneys would seek to move the case to another jurisdiction, he said it was too early to tell. Yanez, 28, had been with the St. Anthony Police Department for four years. Kelly declined to discuss the facts of the case, saying the matter should now be resolved through the judicial process. He said the situation has been stressful but Yanez is ""a very strong individual with a good moral compass and he's holding up."" Supporters of Yanez attended the hearing. Some of Castile's family members also were in the courtroom. Nakia Wilson said she attended the hearing because she wanted to see the face of the person who killed her cousin. She said she was nervous and sad, and had difficulty describing how she felt after seeing Yanez.  ""I just want justice served for my cousin,"" she said. Tyrone Terrill, president of the African American Leadership Council, a community group in St. Paul, said Castile's death was senseless.  ""We were out there 30 minutes after he was shot. And to see the mental anguish and pain in our community -- I've seen grown men crying like I've never ever seen before,"" he said. ""To see the pain -- and for no reason."" Terrill, who also attended the hearing, commended prosecutors for bringing charges and said he wants to see Yanez behind bars.  ""He did not value Philando's humanity,"" Terrill said. ___ Follow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti .

Speaking in Washington, Santos said implementing the accord in the shortest time possible would prevent a fragile cease-fire from falling apart. His comments came after two rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia were killed in combat with security forces during a confusing incident now being investigated by United Nations-sponsored monitors. Santos announced a week ago that FARC agreed to modify the peace accord defeated in a referendum, but he had been cagey about how he intended to implement the deal. Officials said no decision had been made on whether the modified deal might be presented to voters in another referendum. Santos was addressing the Organization of American States after the hemispheric group endorsed the deal. The accord is intended to end a half-century-long conflict that has claimed more than 220,000 lives and driven almost 8 million people from their homes. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan on Friday upheld a lower court's decision that said Hawaii law prohibits counties from regulating agricultural matters. The cases stemmed from a decision by Maui voters to ban the cultivation and testing of genetically modified crops in 2014 and related movements on other Hawaiian islands. Kauai County had imposed pesticide notification requirements and mandated pesticide buffer zones, and Hawaii Island had enacted an ordinance banning open air testing of genetically engineered organisms, among other things. But the court held that the county laws are pre-empted by state laws that regulate potentially harmful plants.  ""We will continue to stand and fight with the people of Hawaii against these chemical companies, and part of that is going to be demanding action at the state level to protect the people and the environment,"" said George Kimbrell, senior attorney for the Center For Food Safety, which pushed for the bans. ""We're considering all legal options, including appeal."" Monsanto, which farms genetically engineered seeds to be used by farmers around the world, was part of a group that fought the Maui GMO ban. Monsanto Hawaii employs approximately 1,000 people on Maui, Molokai and Oahu, Dan Clegg, Hawaii business operations lead for Monsanto, in an emailed statement.  ""We're listening and we've heard the concerns some people have about GMOs and today's farming practices,"" Clegg said. ""Our commitment to ongoing dialogue with our neighbors doesn't stop today. We understand the responsibility we have to farm sustainably and to work collaboratively, and we welcome the opportunity to continue having conversations with members of the community."" A representative from the Hawaii Farm Bureau didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Forty-seven-year-old Wesley Cagle was sentenced Friday in Baltimore Circuit Court. He was convicted in August of assault and a weapons charge. Prosecutors say that on Dec. 28, 2014, Cagle and three other officers encountered 47-year-old Michael Johansen running from a building. Authorities say Johansen reached down after being ordered to show his hands, and two officers shot him. Prosecutors say that as Johansen was lying in the building's doorway, Cagle approached him and shot him once in the groin. Johansen survived and testified against Cagle. Both Johansen and Cagle are white. The police department said in a statement Friday that Cagle no longer works for the department. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Mexican Finance Minister Idelfonso Fajardo said Friday that he met with officials from five other signatories to the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore -- on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Lima, Peru. He says they agreed to forge ahead with the agreement regardless of what the new U.S. administration decides. It's unclear if they'll succeed. Under terms of the TPP agreement signed this year in New Zealand, the vast free trade agreement can only be implemented if it is ratified by at least six countries that account for 85 percent of the combined gross domestic production of the 12 TPP nations. ___ 4:20 p.m. Donald's Trump election has sparked concerns among some people of a U.S.-China trade war, but that hasn't so far led the International Monetary Fund to lower its forecast for the U.S. economy. In Lima, Peru, for the APEC summit, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde says that ""we're not talking about revisions downward at the moment."" The Washington-based international lender predicted last month that the U.S. economy should accelerate next year to 2.2 percent growth, from an estimated 1.6 percent this year. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Lagarde dodged questions about whether a wave of protectionism around the world and Trump's pledges to slap tariffs on Chinese goods would hurt global growth. But she said she hopes to find common ground with skeptics of globalization and work well with the incoming U.S. administration. She says she doesn't think ""it's a question of not having globalization -- it's a question of what globalization it will be."" In her words, ""We have been saying for a while that growth has to be inclusive, and while we have observed over the course of time that trade is a huge engine for growth, it has not been an inclusive engine because some people have been to the side of that globalization."" ___ 1:35 p.m. Officials from 21 nations have endorsed a report on the creation of vast free trade area encompassing Pacific Rim nations, including China and the U.S. The feasibility study into the so-called Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific had been ordered at the summit in Beijing two years ago. Its findings haven't yet been made public but were debated this week in Peru by trade officials from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and will be presented to leaders of the member nations on Saturday. Ministers in a statement Friday also rejected rising protectionism, which they said is holding back global economic growth. ___ 1:20 p.m. The presidents of Ecuador and China are celebrating expanding economic ties between their nations, jointly launching a Chinese-backed hydroelectric plant. The two set the plant operating from a remote control board in the Ecuadorean capital of Quito. The Coca Codo Sinclair plant has a capacity to generate 1,500 megawatts in the Amazon region province of Orellana. That's equal to 30 percent of the country's power consumption. China's Xi Jinping said Friday that Ecuador has become his country's ""most important partner for investment and financing, works contracts and cooperation in energy and resources"" in the Latin America-Caribbean region. Ecuadorean officials say Chinese projects have generated 14,000 jobs in the country. Both leaders are heading to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Peru. ___ 12:50 p.m. A small group of anti-globalization activists shouting ""Get Out Obama"" and ""TPP kills"" have been protesting near the convention center where an Asia-Pacific Economic summit is taking place. The 50 or so protesters are outnumbered by police, and they're being kept more than a mile (2 kilometers) from the secure venue where leaders from the 21-member organization are beginning to arrive.

A group gathered Saturday at Mexico City's Independence monument, expressing concern about a possible wave of deportations. School teacher Armando Osorio said Mexico simply is not prepared to receive a large number of deported migrants. He said the structural and labor conditions do not exist. He said it would add to the ""unrest"" that's already in Mexico. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters are marching in towns Saturday like Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. ___ 1:25 p.m. Several thousand anti-Trump protesters are marching in downtown Los Angeles, denouncing his campaign pledge to deport people who entered the U.S. illegally and his crude comments about women. Cheers, chants and flag-waving mark Saturday's procession, which stretches for blocks through the Civic Center. No arrests have been made even though the train of demonstrators occasionally snarled traffic. The mood seemed enthusiastic rather than angry. There are no reports of vandalism or fire-setting, which have marred previous demonstrations around the nation. ___ 11:55 a.m. Police have set up barricades in front of some of the most expensive stores in New York City as an anti-Donald Trump protest makes its way along Fifth Avenue. During the demonstration, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, who is a Trump critic, entered the lobby of Trump Tower with a camera crew in tow and asked to see Trump. He was denied. Moments later, Nigel Farage, the head of the ""Leave"" movement that propelled the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, also arrived and was allowed up. Trump frequently links his campaign to the ""Brexit"" movement. Farage would not say if he was playing a role in Trump's transition. ___ 11:45 a.m. Police in Portland, Oregon, say they have detained four people in connection with a shooting that left one wounded during a protest of President-elect Donald Trump. A news release says police believe the four are gang members. The man who was shot early Saturday while participating in a march is recovering and is expected to survive. Police say a shooter was in a vehicle on a bridge that spans the Willamette River and that there was a confrontation with someone in the protest march. A man got out of his vehicle and fired multiple shots before fleeing. Police say 17 people have been arrested in Portland since protests began. Police said Saturday that nine people have been booked into the Multnomah County Jail. Six others were given criminal citations, and two juveniles were released to their parents. Since Trump's election Tuesday, thousands around the country, spurred by fear and outrage, have taken to the streets in largely non-violent protests. ___ 10:50 a.m. About 2,000 protesters have been marching along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan shouting ""not my president"" and other slogans. The protesters rallied at New York's Union Square on Saturday before picking up steam and taking their cause into the street and toward Trump Tower. Fifth Avenue was crowded with protesters for blocks. Police lined both sides, following along on foot and on motorcycle, but the group remained peaceful. ___ 9:55 a.m. In Chicago, hundreds of people including families with small children chanted ""No hate. No fear. Immigrants are welcome here"" as they marched through Millennium Park, a popular downtown tourist attraction. Twenty-nine-year-old yoga teacher Sonja (SON'-yuh) Spray says she heard about the Saturday morning demonstration on Facebook and decided to join the protest over the election of Donald Trump. She carried a sign reading, ""WOMEN are NO JOKE."" Spray, who voted for Hillary Clinton in both the primary and general elections, says she has signed an online petition urging the Electoral College to elect Clinton. She says she's concerned Trump's election condones a view that women are ""playthings"" and his presidency will threaten civil rights and gay marriage. She says she's ""part of the reminder that we still have a say in our own country."" ___ 8:40 a.m. About 200 people have been arrested in Los Angeles after a mainly peaceful protest over the election of Donald Trump as president. Police say about 3,000 people took to the streets Friday night, winding up near City Hall after several hours of marching. Some waved American flags or carried signs reading ""Not My President."" Police began breaking up the protest at around 2 a.m. Saturday and arrested people for failure to disperse. Police tell City News Service that three juveniles were arrested during the march for throwing a bottle at a police officer, vandalizing a police cruiser and curfew violation. Thousands are expected to join protests throughout the weekend in L.A., San Francisco, Las Vegas and overseas. ___ 7:50 a.m. About 300 people protested Donald Trump's election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy by the German capital's landmark Brandenburg Gate. The peaceful protesters Saturday waved signs with slogans like ""Love Trumps Hate"" and ""Make Love, Not Trump."" Ahead of national elections in Germany next year, the anti-immigrant nationalist Alternative For Germany party, known as AfD, has been gaining support. One protester's sign read ""Germany: Don't make the same mistake in 2017, AfD=Trump."" AfD co-leader Frauke Petry applauded Trump's election, saying Friday it offered ""a historic opportunity to address erroneous global economic and social developments of the past decades."" President Barack Obama meets in Berlin next week with Chancellor Angela Merkel and several other European leaders, and is expected to confront global concerns about Trump's election. ___ 3:35 a.m. Police in Portland, Oregon, say a person has been injured in a shooting on a Willamette (wil-AM'-it) River bridge during a protest of President-elect Donald Trump. Authorities say the person has been taken to a hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries and police are looking for the suspect. They say the suspect was in a vehicle early Saturday morning on the Morrison Bridge and there was a confrontation with someone in the protest march. A police news release says the man got out of his vehicle and fired multiple shots injuring the person before fleeing, likely in his vehicle.

The Associated Press and other local media outlets identified several reports of racist incidents at schools since Tuesday, including a group chat that the Oklahoma student got involved with aimed at black freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania, Trump's alma mater. The chat contained ""violent, racist and thoroughly disgusting images and messages,"" and Penn is ""appalled"" its students were added to the GroupMe account,"" UPenn President Amy Gutmann said. Gutmann said UPenn police have been working with the FBI. She earlier said officials had increased campus safety and were ""reaching out to support the affected students."" University of Oklahoma President David Boren in a statement said the student has been temporarily suspended as the school investigates further.  ""It would appear this matter did not originate at the University of Oklahoma, but started elsewhere,"" Boren said in a statement. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, police are looking into a report of a man who threatened to set a Muslim student on fire with a lighter if she didn't remove her hijab on Friday. The incident apparently happened near the University of Michigan campus, according to Ann Arbor police Sgt. Patrick Maguire. He added that the department is ""investigating it actively ... and soliciting information from anyone who may have witnessed anything."" A crime alert issued by the university said the woman took off her hijab and left the area. Witnesses told police the man was white with an ""unkempt appearance"" and ""intoxicated with slurred speech."" A racial backlash also unfolded after the election of Barack Obama, America's first black president, in 2008. At the time, police documented alleged crimes, from vandalism and vague threats to at least one physical attack. Insults and taunts were delivered by adults, college students and even children. Anti-Trump protests have happened for several days in cities including Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago and New York. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The campaign to legalize marijuana achieved a major breakthrough, with victories in at least six states. In all, more than 150 measures appeared on statewide ballots in Tuesday's election. California, Nevada and Massachusetts approved measures legalizing the recreational use of marijuana, while Florida, Arkansas and North Dakota voted to allow pot for medical purposes. A recreational pot proposal lost in Arizona. The outcome of another in Maine was too close to call. Gun control was on the ballot in four states, including California, which already has some of the nation's toughest gun-related laws. Voters there approved a measure that will outlaw possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, require permits to buy ammunition and extend California's unique program that allows authorities to seize firearms from owners who bought guns legally but are no longer allowed to own them. Washington state approved a ballot measure that will allow judges to issue orders temporarily seizing guns from individuals who are deemed a threat. In Maine and Nevada, a group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent millions promoting ballot measures that would require background checks on nearly all gun sales and transfers. The measure was approved in Nevada but was rejected in Maine. With Congress unable to agree on an increase in the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, numerous states and cities have taken action on their own. In this election, Arizona, Colorado and Maine voters approved measures phasing in a $12 minimum hourly wages by 2020. In Washington state, where the minimum wage is $9.47 an hour, voters approved a measure raising that to $13.50 an hour by 2020. In Nebraska, voters reinstated the death penalty, reversing the Legislature's decision last year to repeal capital punishment. Nebraska has not executed an inmate since 1997. Ten men currently sit on death row. Overall, the results of the marijuana referendums were hailed as historic by legalization activists, given that California is the most populous state. Massachusetts became the first state east of the Rockies to join the movement. Florida, where the medical pot measure was backed by 71 percent of the voters, and Arkansas became the first states in the South with full-scale medical marijuana programs, which exist in 25 other states. Collectively, it was the closest the U.S. has ever come to a national referendum on marijuana, which remains prohibited under federal law.  ""These votes send a clear message to federal officials that it's time to stop arresting and incarcerating marijuana users,"" said Rob Kampia, executive director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project. The outcome will more than triple the number of Americans living in states where recreational pot is legal. The jurisdictions where that's already the case -- Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington state and the District of Columbia -- have less than 6 percent of the population. Nebraska was one of three states voting on capital punishment. California had two competing measures on its ballot, one to repeal its rarely used death penalty and the other to speed up appeals so convicted murderers are actually executed. The repeal measure was rejected; the reform measure received about 51 percent of the votes counted by Wednesday morning. Oklahoma residents approved a measure to make it harder to abolish capital punishment. It seeks to ensure the state has a way to execute prisoners even if a given method is blocked. Colorado voters approved a measure that will allow physicians to assist a terminally ill person in dying. That's already a practice in five other states. Coloradans defeated a proposal that would have set up the nation's first universal health care system. Among the other topics addressed by ballot measures: -- BILINGUAL EDUCATION: California voters repealed a nearly two-decade-old law that limited bilingual education in public schools. -- TAX HIKES: Oregon voters defeated a measure that would have imposed a 2.5 percent tax on corporate sales that exceed $25 million. Washington voters rejected a plan to promote cleaner energy by imposing a tax of $25 per metric ton on carbon emissions from fossil fuels such as gasoline, coal and natural gas. -- TOBACCO TAXES: Voters in Colorado, Missouri and North Dakota rejected proposals to raise taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products. Californians approved a measure that raises cigarette prices by $2 a pack and places new taxes on electronic cigarettes. --CONDOMS IN PORN: California voters rejected a measure that would have required actors to use condoms in all porn movies made in the state.

(Osservatore Romano/AFP/Getty Images  Pope Francis on Saturday condemned the political use of fear and the building of walls, describing the refugee crisis as ""a problem of the world"" and urging political leaders to do more, according to America magazine. The pope did not name names and did not refer to the upcoming U.S. presidential election, but he spoke about issues that have come up in the 2016 campaigns, including immigration and refugees. The speech, given in Spanish, included a quote from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""No tyranny can be sustained without exploiting our fears,"" the pope said, according to comments published by the Vatican Radio. ""Citizens are walled-up, terrified, on one side; on the other side, even more terrified, are the excluded and banished."" Fear ""is fed and manipulated,"" Pope Francis said. ""Because fear - as well as being a good deal for the merchants of arms and death - weakens and destabilizes us, destroys our psychological and spiritual defenses, numbs us to the suffering of others, and in the end it makes us cruel."" Pope Francis gave his remarks Saturday evening during a meeting at the Vatican with participants in the World Meeting of Popular Movements, a collection of grass-roots organizations that include the poor and the unemployed. The pope urged the defeat of ""false prophets who exploit fear and desperation, who sell magic formulas of hatred and cruelty or selfish well-being and illusory security,"" according to comments published by Catholic News Service.   [Care about religious freedom worldwide? One of the candidates would be a disaster.]   Francis said that mercy is the ""best antidote"" to fear, according to CNS. It works better than antidepressants, he said, and is ""much more effective than walls, iron bars, alarms and weapons. And it is free."" Trump has proposed building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep undocumented immigrants from entering the United States. After he visited the border during a visit to Mexico in February, the pope said that politicians who propose building walls instead of bridges are ""not Christian,"" leading to a scuffle with Trump. Vatican officials said later that the pope was not speaking about specific candidates. Trump has also proposed a ban on Muslims and refugees from countries experiencing terrorism. A newly named cardinal, Archbishop of Indianapolis Joseph Tobin, made headlines last year when he openly defied Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence's decision to try to block Syrian refugees from the state. Pence, who is Trump's vice presidential running mate, joined dozens of governors last year in objecting to the federal government's program to resettle refugees from Syria in the Unites States, citing security risks. The bishops, including Tobin, openly challenged the governors.   [Report: Melania Trump worked in U.S. without proper permit]   ""No one should be forced to flee his or her homeland,"" Francis said on Saturday, according to CNS. ""But the evil is doubled when, facing terrible circumstances, the migrant is thrown into the clutches of human traffickers to cross the border. And it is tripled if, arriving in the land where he or she hoped to find a better future, one is despised, exploited or even enslaved."" The Obama administration announced in September that the United States is planning to accept 110,000 refugees in 2017. A vice president at Catholic Relief Services said that aid organization welcomed the news, but that it was not sufficient enough to address ""the 65 million globally displaced people around the world right now."" On Saturday, Francis quoted from one of the sermons of King, the late civil rights activist. ""Hate for hate only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe,"" he said. Francis said politics is not the place for ""anyone who is too attached to material things or to the mirror, those who love money, lavish banquets, sumptuous houses, refined clothes, luxury cars."" Seeking power or money ""sullies the noble cause"" of politics as service, the pope said. ""Fight the fear with a life of service, solidarity and humility on behalf of the people, especially those who suffer,"" he said, according to CNS. ""Against the terror, the best remedy is love. Love heals all."" Want more stories about faith? Follow Acts of Faith on Twitter or sign up for our newsletter.
