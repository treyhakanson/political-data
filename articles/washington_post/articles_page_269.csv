While the nation has collectively grieved since the Oct. 13 passing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the government has also focused on eliminating online remarks it deems offensive to the late monarch, his queen or his heir-apparent, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. Thailand's lese majeste law, the world's toughest, makes defaming any of the three a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Since the king's death, Thailand has charged more than 20 people with making anti-royalty statements, requested deportations of suspects from at least seven countries and attempted to wipe out content it finds offensive from websites and social media.  ""The amount of content restricted in Thailand under these laws is absolutely of concern, particularly as the lese majeste provisions are used to stifle legitimate dissent, both through blocking and content removal,"" said Madeline Earp, who researches Asian internet censorship for the nonprofit Freedom House. The military says the lese majeste law is necessary to safeguard the monarchy and national security. Data compiled by the Ministry of Defense's support group and released to the AP shows that the government shut down 1,370 websites in October, more than the 1,237 shut down in the previous five years. Just two had been shut down in September. Thailand orders the country's internet service providers to block offensive websites. Users who click on them see only a government seal and a statement in Thai: ""This website contains content and information that is deemed inappropriate. It has been censored by the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society."" Deputy Prime Minister Prachin Chantong said the government has set up a team to quickly control online content.  ""Thais have been attacked by websites that twist the truth,"" Prachin said. The approach is different for Google, Facebook and other online and social media platforms based outside of Thailand. Prachin said he has contacted those companies and asked them to monitor and remove content that could insult the monarchy. Prachin said Google and Facebook agreed. Both companies dispute that, and say they are only responding to complaints brought to them rather than actively seeking content offensive to the monarchy.  ""We have never provided account information or content of any Facebook user to the government of Thailand, nor do we proactively monitor people's content or conversations for potential violations of local law,"" Facebook spokesman Tim Inthirakoth said after his company met with Prachin on Thursday. Google said that last year it removed 1,331 items at the request of Thai authorities, up from 74 items in 2014. Facebook said it had five requests related to criminal cases in 2015 and didn't produce data for any of them. Facebook and Google refused to release how many requests they've had since the king's death, saying they will publish that in their regular biannual online reports. Thailand has long censored online content deemed insulting to the monarchy, but has done so more frequently since a military coup ousted an elected government in late May of 2014. According to the Ministry of Defense data, the junta censored 974 websites in its first two years, more than three times as many as the prior government censored in its last two years. Thai authorities are thought to be particularly concerned with websites with content about Vajiralongkorn, the 64-year-old designated heir to the throne who lacks the popularity of his father. The public at large has long traded rumors about Vajiralongkorn's finances, hot temper and other matters. Three stormy marriages are a matter of public record. But critical news reports from abroad about Vajiralongkorn are commonly blocked in Thailand. Thailand remains somber in many ways more than a month after the death of Bhumibol, who was 88 and the world's longest-reigning monarch. Millions continue to dress in black or white every day, boisterous events have been canceled and mourners are flocking by the tens of thousands to pay their respects at the Royal Palace. Online, for the first 30 days many websites and Facebook pages were also without color. Even Google's trademark red, green, blue and yellow search box was, in Thailand, simply monochrome. Daphne Keller at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society said internet companies doing business in countries with laws restricting speech know they will be expected to comply with the rules. One common means of doing so without deleting lawful speech elsewhere is to offer country-specific versions of services, like YouTube Thailand, said Keller.  ""The company can then honor national law on the version of the service that is targeted to, and primarily used in, that country,"" she said. Emma Llanso, who directs the Free Expression Project at the Washington, D.C., based Center for Democracy and Technology, said internet companies have to grapple with how to respond when told to shut down websites.  ""This is a perfect example of the kinds of conflicts that make it difficult to protect freedom of speech in the digital age,"" she said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Washington Post's Chris Mooney breaks down what a Donald Trump presidency will mean when it comes to climate change. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)   The tweet has been referenced during a presidential debate and retweeted more than 104,000 times, and has drawn hundreds of replies. Now, President-elect Donald Trump's four-year-old Twitter claim that China created the ""concept of global warming"" to render U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive has elicited a response from the Chinese government. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin repudiated Trump's accusation on Wednesday, telling reporters at United Nations talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, that U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush started the global warming conversation by supporting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change during the late 1980s, according to Bloomberg News. Trump has not yet responded to Liu's statement. The panel originated in 1988 through a joint effort by the U.N. Environmental Program and the World Meteorological Organization when Reagan was in office. It has since published five comprehensive assessment reports that use findings from climate experts around the world to generate what its website calls a ""full scientific and technical assessment of climate change."" The panel was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, along with Al Gore, after releasing its fourth assessment. Trump's now-infamous tweet resurfaced during the first presidential debate on Sept. 26 when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton confronted Trump over his claim, although she did not explicitly mention his tweet.      During the first Clinton-Trump presidential debate on Sept. 26, Hillary Clinton accused Trump of believing that ""climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese,"" and Trump interrupted to object. (The Washington Post)   ""Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese,"" Clinton said. ""I think it's real."" Trump responded: ""I did not. I did not. I do not say that.""   [Al Gore offers to work with Trump on climate change. Good luck with that.]   Though Trump has since called his tweet a ""joke,"" his appointment of climate change skeptic Myron Ebell to head his Environmental Protection Agency transition has affirmed to some, including other climate change skeptics, that Trump does not take climate change seriously. Trump has also questioned the existence of global warming multiple times since his November 2012 tweet, calling it ""bulls--"" and claiming cold weather had forced ""hoaxsters"" to relabel global warming as climate change.   Brilliant news! Trump appoints Myron Ebell to head his EPA transition team. The Donald is serious about dumping climate hysteria. -- Roger Helmer (@RogerHelmerMEP) November 11, 2016   A ""We the People"" petition to remove Ebell from Trump's transition team reached nearly 100,000 signatures before the White House removed it from the site. Trump has also said he will get rid of the EPA and pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which scientists say would have major global ramifications. The D.C.-based think tank Climate Interactive told The Post's Chris Mooney that the U.S. emissions reduction pledge would account for more than 20 percent of the combined emissions cut among all countries in the accord. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who helped negotiate the Paris accord, said at the Marrakesh U.N. talks that the outgoing Obama administration plans to fight Trump's intent to withdraw. ""No one has a right to make decisions for billions of people based solely on ideology,"" Kerry said, via Bloomberg News. ""Climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue. It isn't a partisan issue for our military. It isn't a partisan issue for our intelligence community."" In his speech, Kerry also appealed to Trump not to make decisions based only on ideology or ""without proper input."" ""I ask you on behalf of billions of people around the world,"" he said.

Rick Porcello enjoyed the moment at his parents' home in New Jersey, surrounded by family, friends and a few bottles of wine. As for Justin Verlander, well, fuming supermodel Kate Upton brought the heat for her fiance. Teammates for five seasons in Detroit, the three right-handers topped the Cy Young Award talk Wednesday: Scherzer easily won the NL prize, Porcello edged out Verlander for the AL honor. Porcello, who led baseball with 22 wins for Boston and had a 3.15 ERA, won despite getting just eight of the 30 first-place votes from members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America -- the first time the AL Cy winner didn't get the most firsts. Verlander went 16-9 with a 2.40 ERA while leading the AL in strikeouts and other categories. He got 14 first-place votes, but didn't draw as much support across the board -- he was left off two ballots, too. LOS ANGELES -- Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Tuesday at the White House. Scully retired last month after spending his entire 67-year career in the booth for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He turns 89 on Nov. 27. Scully is one of 21 recipients of the Medal of Freedom announced Wednesday, including NBA Hall of Famers Kareen Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Jordan. HOUSTON -- Right-hander Charlie Morton agreed to a contract with Houston, giving the Astros two of the best groundball pitchers in the majors. Morton accepted a $14 million, two-year deal that includes annual salaries of $7 million and performance bonuses of $625,000 apiece for 12, 20, 25 and 30 starts each season. Morton, who ranks second in the majors among active pitchers in career groundball to fly ball ratio (2.48), joins a staff that features last year's American League Cy Young Award winner Dallas Keuchel, a lefty who leads the league in that category (2.84). NFL NEW YORK -- First-year eligibles LaDainian Tomlinson, Hines Ward, Jason Taylor and Brian Dawkins are among 26 semifinalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's class of 2017. Joining them as first-time semifinalists is tackle-guard Chris Hinton, who retired in 1989 but has made this cut for the first time. The other 21 candidates -- there was a tie for 25th in voting by Hall of Fame selectors as the list was trimmed from an original 94 -- all have made it this far in the past. Two coaches, Don Coryell and Jimmy Johnson, have made the semifinals. So has placekicker Morten Andersen, the NFL's career scoring leader. Previously nominated by the veterans committee was safety Kenny Easley, and by the contributors' committee were Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. The 2017 class will be selected on Feb. 4, the day before the Super Bowl. Between four and eight new members will be chosen. NBA DALLAS -- Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban says the team's decision not to stay at Donald Trump-branded hotels in New York and Chicago was made before the presidential election. The billionaire technology entrepreneur declined to elaborate on the decision, telling The Associated Press it ""was made months ago. Not recently."" Cuban was a frequent critic of Trump during the campaign and supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who lost to the Republican president-elect. ESPN, citing anonymous sources, reported that Dallas, Memphis and Milwaukee were among the teams that moved away from Trump-branded hotels in New York and Chicago. The network reported that the decision was made in part to avoid any implied association with Trump. NEW YORK -- Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy says he has used the term ""posse"" before, and it was always in regards to minorities. A day after LeBron James criticized Knicks President Phil Jackson for using the word in an interview to describe James' friends and business partners, Van Gundy was reflective when thinking about his own words, calling on people to be aware of their language and attitudes. COLLEGE BASKETBALL KENT, Ohio -- Kent State's players made their home opener memorable, and it had little to do with winning. In a sign of unity they hope catches on, the Golden Flashes invited fans onto the court to stand with them during the national anthem before their game against Mississippi Valley State. Moments before tip-off, Kent State's players went into the crowd and each of them asked a fan of a different race to join them while the school's ""Flasher Brass"" pep band performed the anthem. Kent State coach Rob Senderoff said the players approached the coaching staff with the idea. HOCKEY TAMPA, Fla. -- Tampa Bay Lightning captain Steven Stamkos has a lateral meniscus tear in his right knee and will be sidelined indefinitely. General manager Steve Yzerman announced the diagnosis after Stamkos returned home for further evaluation of the injury the two-time NHL scoring champion suffered Tuesday night in a 4-3 victory over the Detroit Red Wings. Stamkos, who last summer re-signed with the team that drafted him No. 1 overall in 2008 rather than testing free agency, scored his ninth goal against the Red Wings and leads the NHL with 20 points in 17 games. The six-time All-Star center grabbed the back of his knee and limped off the ice to the dressing room after colliding with Detroit's Gustav Nyquist along the boards. It's the third significant injury Stamkos has had over the past three years. CALGARY, Alberta -- Calgary Flames forward Johnny Gaudreau was scheduled to undergo surgery for a fractured finger. Gaudreau suffered the injury in Tuesday's 1-0 win over the Minnesota Wild. The team said a timeline for his return will be provided in the coming days. Gaudreau left Tuesday's game early in the third period after taking a slash to the hand. NEW YORK -- International Ice Hockey Federation President Rene Fasel said he had a ""good discussion"" Wednesday with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and NHL Players Association Executive Director Don Fehr about the world's top hockey players participating in the 2018 Olympics in South Korea. Bettman described the meeting as ""constructive and candid.""  ""Still lots of issues,"" Bettman wrote in an email to the AP. Fasel said his job is to raise funds for the players' transportation and insurance. The International Olympic Committee does not want to cover those costs as it has the previous five Olympics. Fasel hopes to persuade the IOC to financially support the NHL's participation. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  Something was missing on the Drudge Report on Thursday morning. There were stories about President-elect Donald Trump's awesomeness, the media's awfulness and even one about a ""BLACK MOB."" You know, the standard fare. But there was not a single article about Hillary Clinton. Did Trump even have an opponent in this week's election? Wasn't there an FBI investigation or two? Something about emails and a foundation? Oh, never mind. It's time for President Trump! As conservative news outlets bask in the glow of Trump's victory, many appear to be losing their once-ravenous appetites for probes and prosecutions of his vanquished political foe. It looks like the desire to ""investigate her from now until kingdom come,"" as The Washington Post's Abby Phillip put it on CNN early on Election Day, was predicated on the assumption that Clinton would win. After all, miring President Clinton in scandal could have been an effective way to undermine her agenda and set her up for defeat in four years. But what would be the purpose of dogging private citizen Clinton? The potential reward just isn't as great. Breitbart News has not written about the possibility of an email-related indictment under a new Justice Department or a prosecution stemming from the FBI's review of Clinton Foundation ties to the State Department. Neither has Laura Ingraham's Lifezette or Jim Hoft's Gateway Pundit. Sean Hannity didn't mention investigations once on his Fox News show Wednesday night. Hot Air and Newsmax noted White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest's refusal on Wednesday to discuss the idea of a presidential pardon, but neither site seems to be clamoring to ""lock her up."" On ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday morning, Rudy Giuliani -- who could be the next attorney general -- said, ""I don't like to see America become a country in which we prosecute people . . . about politics."" Giuliani wouldn't rule out the idea of continuing Clinton probes, but his post-election rhetoric was a far cry from his proclamation just a few weeks ago that the former secretary of state ""should be in jail."" In a notable break from the trend, the Daily Caller touted an ""exclusive"" Wednesday. Citing ""a former senior law enforcement official,"" Tucker Carlson's news site reported that ""all 10 FBI agents in the Little Rock field office who are assigned to public corruption cases are working full-time on the foundation."" If that is the case, or even if it's not, Clinton's legal scrutiny might not be over. The conservative media likely wouldn't object, of course, but they are not nearly as hungry for action as they were before Trump won the White House."

Larry Hogan has appointed Bill McMahon to be the new Howard County sheriff. Hogan announced the appointment Thursday. McMahon currently serves as acting director of the Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions. He also is director of the commission's Leadership and Development Institute. McMahon served as Howard County chief of police from 2006 to 2014. He is a 30-year resident of the county. He will replace James Fitzgerald, who resigned last month after an investigation found he created a hostile work environment by belittling staffers and making racist and sexist comments. The investigation also found reasonable cause that Fitzgerald discriminated against a lieutenant by retaliating against him through scheduling because he didn't support the sheriff's political campaign.

(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)  There's a rumbling among the political left that the unexpected election of Donald Trump might necessitate an unprecedented response: members of the electoral college bucking the rules to hand the presidency to Hillary Clinton. As it stands, Clinton holds a slim lead in the popular vote nationally, a function of the uneven way in which she won her electoral votes. Clinton did better against Trump in Texas and Arizona than President Obama did against Mitt Romney in 2012 -- but still doesn't get any of those states' electoral votes. In California, she did five percentage points better than Obama, earning 2.5 million more votes -- with lots more to be counted. But she still only gets 55 electors in the constitutionally significant voting on Dec. 19. The theory goes, then, that the electoral college vote shouldn't hew to the mostly winner-take-all tradition with which we're familiar. Instead, since Clinton got more votes, those electors should support her, where possible, and hand her the presidency. Is it possible? Theoretically. Will it happen? Ha ha ha ha ha no. Let's jump to the end.     As it stands, Trump leads Clinton in 30 states worth a total of 305 electoral votes. Clinton leads Trump in 20 and D.C., for 233. (Let's skip the Nebraska and Maine congressional-district electors for now.) She currently leads him by about 230,000 votes. One theory for how the election could be thrown to Clinton is by having electors in states that aren't legally bound to uphold the popular vote switch from Trump to Clinton. There are 25 states that mandate electors uphold the will of the electorate, meaning that there are 25 that don't. (D.C. has a mandate; Virginia has enough of one that we'll count it.) So in a state like Texas, which has no mandate, the 38 electors could, theoretically, all vote for Clinton. If they did, she'd have 271 electoral votes, and waltz into the White House. (We're just going to set aside the cranky people who've already said they don't want to vote for Clinton.) That's not super realistic, though. I mean, it's Texas. You think you're going to do that to Texas and not face repercussions? A more likely scenario is to take the electors in those 25 states and let them divvy up their votes however they want. (We call this the legal split in the chart above.) If we do that, the results change -- and Clinton still loses, 260 to 278. Well, since Clinton did well nationally, why don't we just divvy up every elector this way? (The total split.) If we do that . . . Trump does better, getting 279 electors to Clinton's 259. How is the margin so wide even with a proportional allocation all the way down? Simple. States Trump won he won by wider margins than the states Clinton won. On average (according to current totals), Trump got 48.8 percent of the vote in each state to Clinton's 44.7. In states Trump won, he won by an average of 19 points. In states he lost, he lost by an average of 17. That discrepancy adds up, even though many of those states are small with low electoral vote totals. What's more, divvying up across the board means that Trump gets electors in New York, New Jersey and California where he was otherwise shut out. Regardless, you can't do that. In half of those states, you're not allowed by law to vote for someone other than the winner of the state. Granted, it's very possible that the Supreme Court wouldn't uphold those laws if they were challenged, since the Constitution doesn't mandate that rule. (Read more here.) If we're going to travel to the boundaries of reality, though, let's at least take the path of least resistance. What is true is that the electors in those 25 states, where they're not bound by law, can vote for whoever they want. So the split in Texas doesn't have to follow the lines of the voting in that state. If someone could convince 38 folks to vote Clinton, there's no legal way to keep them from doing so. But the effect would almost certainly not be what the left intends. It would almost instantly spur a constitutional crisis, pitting a fairly small group of Clinton loyalists against Trump supporters who will feel -- justifiably -- as though they were robbed. Those Trump supporters would likely be joined by a substantial portion of Clinton backers who would prefer President Trump to the immediate collapse of the American government. None of this will happen. I strongly support the speculative gaming-out of political scenarios, but I also recommend that people leaven those flights of fancy with an acknowledgment of what will actually happen. Clinton came very close to being the president on two separate occasions. She will not be the president in 2017.

And itâ€™s about to get even uglier.	"   North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Roy Cooper, a Democrat, and his wife, Kristin, greet supporters during an election night rally in Raleigh. Cooper declared victory over Republican Gov. Pat McCrory on Wednesday, but McCrory is contesting the election.  (Gerry Broome/AP)  One of the most hotly contested races of 2016 is still being contested. And the North Carolina governor's race could drag on past Thanksgiving in an ugly way: The Democrat is declaring victory but the Republican incumbent is refusing to concede, and his campaign is raising the possibility of voter fraud. There could even be a recount. Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) has declared victory in his attempt to unseat embattled Gov. Pat McCrory (R). Cooper declared victory early Wednesday with a 5,000-vote lead over McCrory out of 4.6 million votes cast. That's a 0.5 percentage point lead, and it's small enough that McCrory isn't willing to concede until thousands of provisional, absentee and military ballots are counted and the election results certified by state election officials. In fact, on Thursday afternoon, McCrory's campaign announced they hired a lawyer and set up a legal defense fund in preparation to contest the results. North Carolina Republicans were aghast that Cooper could declare victory. The state GOP chairman, Robin Hayes, said in a statement that it was ""rude and grossly premature."" On top of that, McCrory's campaign is casting doubt about how the vote got tallied in a Democratic stronghold that, at the last minute, appeared to hand Cooper the election. Throughout election night, it was clear this race was going to be a nail-biter. As top-of-the-ticket races in North Carolina quickly got called for Republicans (Donald Trump won the state by four percentage points and Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican, won reelection), the lead between McCrory and Cooper switched back and forth pretty much every time a batch of results came in. McCrory had taken the lead when, just before midnight, 90,000 votes came in from the Democratic stronghold Durham County that boosted Cooper to what he claimed was victory. In Durham County, three county election officials had to count votes by hand after several of their data storage cards malfunctioned. When they finally submitted the county's 90,000 votes, McCrory's 60,000-vote lead evaporated to a 2,500 deficit. Cooper declared victory and McCrory cried foul soon after, according to the News & Observer, mentioning to supporters in a speech after midnight ""the sudden emergence of over 90,000 votes"" and promising to ""check everything."" ""To say we are a bit suspicious is an understatement,"" McCrory strategist Chris La Civita told The Fix on Thursday. Now, McCrory's camp is holding out to see if they can cobble together a path to victory from the thousands of absentee and provisional and military ballots that have yet to be counted. If the race is still close after that -- within 10,000 votes -- either side can call for a recount. But because we have to wait for all the votes to be counted and certified, a recount probably wouldn't happen until after Thanksgiving. (McCrory's campaign declined to comment on whether they'd seek a recount in that situation.) Democrats remain confident that they'll keep their lead when all the ballots are counted. And they think the claim that there might have been voter fraud in Durham County is ridiculous. For one, News & Observer's Virginia Bridges reported that election officials there said there was nothing to worry about. ""The total would have been the same whether it came in at 7 p.m. or it came in at midnight,"" Bill Brian, chairman of the Durham County Board of Elections (and a Republican appointed by McCrory), told Bridges.   [Pat McCrory just can't seem to escape the hot seat in North Carolina]   Durham County has had a history of election challenges -- faulty voting machines, a precinct opening late or being moved altogether. But Democrats point out that Tuesday's gubernatorial results from Durham are consistent with past elections, with about 75 percent of votes going for the Democrat and 20 percent for Republican. The North Carolina State Board of Elections will spend the next few weeks canvassing counties to double check the results. They'll officially certify the results in a public meeting Nov. 29 -- unless there's a recount, which will stretch things out. If Cooper wins, it will be a major coup for Democrats -- a bright spot in an otherwise dismal election year for them. Defeating a sitting governor is hard to do; before Tuesday incumbent governors had won reelection in 50 of the past 53 attempts. Cooper would also become just the third statewide Democratic candidate to win in a state Trump won. The other two were also governors -- Billionaire Jim Justice won the open gubernatorial seat in West Virginia even though Trump won the state by 42 points. And Gov. Steve Bullock won reelection in Montana even though Trump took his state by 22 points. But any victory lap for Cooper will probably be short-lived. Republicans kept their veto-proof majorities in both of North Carolina's state legislative chambers. (Nationwide, Republicans maintained their historic dominance of state politics at nearly every level.) McCrory was undoubtedly hurt politically this year by his decision to sign into law this spring a rushed bill limiting what bathrooms transgender people could use and blocking anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people. He became the face of the LGBT culture wars for it, and Cooper's camp smartly seized on the economic impact the law's fallout was having in the state. If McCrory loses, he'll be one of the only vulnerable, high-profile statewide Republican incumbents to fall in 2016."

On the final weekend of the presidential campaign, a pastor in Detroit spoke of voting and citizenship. In Philadelphia, the minister reminded congregants others had died for their chance to cast a ballot. The Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke to a few hundred people in front of City Hall in Tallahassee, Florida, before they marched a block over to the county courthouse to vote early. Along with women and Hispanics, African-Americans are seen as critical to Clinton's chances against Republican Donald Trump. However, early voting data from key states indicate turnout will not be as high this year as it was four years ago, when Barack Obama, the nation's first African-American president, was on the ballot. Sunday's efforts were aimed at minimizing that decline. Bishop T.D. Jakes, pastor of the Texas megachurch The Potter's House, tweeted on a red, white and blue backdrop: ""Make sure your voice is heard. Vote on Nov. 8.""  ""Preachers are trying to strike a moral nerve and somehow penetrate the fog of indifference and try to remind people what's at stake this year,"" said the Rev. James Forbes, retired pastor of The Riverside Church, in New York, which hosted a national get-out-the-vote telecast Sunday night called ""The Revival: Time for a Moral Revolution in Values.""  ""These are very crucial times to a nation with so much anger, so much anxiety about the future,"" Forbes said at the revival Sunday night. ""We must be very careful not to fall prey to the siren call of those who are peddlers of false hope, illusions and lies."" Forbes has been traveling the country to mobilize voters. He and other pastors have taken pains to emphasize they were not endorsing a candidate, but it was hard to mistake some remarks Sunday that signaled a deep opposition to Trump.  ""There are some folk in this country who think that to make this country great again, we've got to exclude folks,"" said the Rev. Mark Tyler, pastor of Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church, in Philadelphia, one of the first black churches in the U.S. ""We've always been great because we've always been open to strangers. If it was not for the goodness of the first Americans, there would be no America today."" Trump has made his own efforts to build support among black voters, saying their loyalty to the Democratic Party has not improved the safety of their neighborhoods nor the quality of their schools. ""What do you have to lose?"" he has said. However, polls have consistently shown Trump's support among African-Americans to be in the low single digits. The number of African-American voters has increased steadily: 12.9 million in 2000, 14 million in 2004, 16 million in 2008 and 17.8 million in 2012. In the last presidential election year, blacks for the first time voted at a higher rate -- 66.2 percent -- than did whites (64.1 percent), or Asian-Americans or Hispanics, with rates of about 48 percent each. Besides the absence of a black candidate on either major-party ticket, community leaders and others blame the lower turnout so far on voter suppression efforts, such as limits to early voting hours in some communities and challenges by individuals to voter registrations. A federal judge Friday ordered registrations to be restored in three North Carolina counties for what could be thousands of challenged voters. Underscoring the importance of black voters to her campaign, Clinton started her day Sunday with the largely African-American congregation of Mount Airy Church of God in Christ, in Philadelphia. The Rev. Leah Daughtry, chief executive of the Democratic National Convention, spoke across town at Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church. Worshippers clapped and cheered as Tyler, the Mother Bethel pastor, told them ""don't let there be any excuse"" for not showing up at the polls, even with a lingering public transit strike. ""Somebody died for you to have a right."" In Tallahassee, at the event with the mayor and local pastors, Jackson referenced civil rights leaders and the chaotic 2000 presidential election he contended was ""stolen"" on behalf of George W. Bush by the U.S. Supreme Court. Roz Booker, a black voter, said this election season has been a ""mess,"" but her ancestors had died for the right to vote and she had already cast her ballot. Booker described herself as ""anti-Trump,"" criticizing the Republican nominee for what she called ""promoting hate"" against minorities. At New Destiny Christian Fellowship, a predominantly black church in Detroit, the pastor spoke of being a ""good citizen"" on Election Day. Congregant Tiffany Gunter, who is voting for Clinton, noted that enthusiasm in 2016 was lower among African-Americans than in the previous presidential race. ""What Hillary Clinton has is experience. Is she perfect? Absolutely not. There are things about her that I wish were different, but I believe that she does listen and she can adapt,"" Gunter said. _____ Zoll reported from Amherst, Massachusetts. Gary D.

Anthony Harris took the microphone to deliver the opening prayer at a rally here for Hillary Clinton.  He looked out on the crowd of 3,000 in the high school gymnasium, waiting for the president to arrive. The feeling was different now than it had been eight years earlier, when Obama had just been elected and Harris led his congregation in prayer for the president. Then, there had been crying and cheering in his tiny storefront chapel and a sense that anything was possible.  Now, Harris, 47, took a deep breath. He hoped his words would rise above the anger and divisiveness of an election season unlike any in his lifetime. ""We pray that at the end of this political process we can learn to love each other, bless each other and trust each other,"" he told the crowd, but that noble sentiment did not survive the rally's first speaker.  Taking the microphone, Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) blasted Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a ""liar,"" a ""racist"" and a ""fraud.""     Obama was a symbol for healing America's racial wounds. His legacy will reflect a more complicated story. View Graphic     Obama was a symbol for healing America's racial wounds. His legacy will reflect a more complicated story.  ""Lock him up! Lock him up!"" the pro-Clinton crowd in the gym started to chant, echoing the anti-Clinton chants of ""Lock her up!"" that have become common at Trump rallies  ""I know people are frustrated,"" Harris recalled, thinking as he returned to his seat. ""But what does 'lock him up' even mean?"" In the week leading up to Election Day, the president will crisscross the country in an effort to help Clinton win the White House and safeguard his legacy. If those events are anything like last week's campaign stop in Las Vegas, Obama will be met by rowdy, cheering throngs eager to see him one last time before he leaves office. For many, who will wait hours in line to hear him speak, Obama's 2008 election represented one of the most hopeful moments in American politics in decades. He was not only the first African American president but a relative newcomer to national politics with a remarkable life story who promised to bridge the country's historic divides. ""If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer,"" Obama said that election night in Chicago's Grant Park. Today those words sound as if they came from a different era. Obama will close out his presidency at what is perhaps the least hopeful moment in American politics in decades, a time when the two major-party candidates have historically low approval ratings and are locked in a bitter and coarse election contest. For much of this year, Obama, like the people who pack his rallies, has puzzled over what happened. ""It's one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,"" he said at his State of the Union address in January. Obama's tone grew darker this past summer, following the killing of two black men by police in Minnesota and Louisiana, and the slaying of five Dallas police officers. ""It's hard not to think sometimes that the center won't hold and that things might get worse,"" he confessed. In other speeches -- many of them drowned out by the angry rhetoric from the campaign trail -- Obama has sought to describe the qualities he believes are needed to make American democracy work. He called for more empathy and an ""open heart"" in Dallas. At a Howard University commencement address, he emphasized compromise and tolerance. In Springfield, Ill., where his political career began, Obama made the case for campaign finance reform and an end to gerrymandering. ""We've got to build a better politics,"" he said, ""one that's less of a spectacle and more of a battle of ideas."" In Las Vegas, Obama tried another tack, blaming Republicans and the ""far-right media"" for the state of political disarray. ""They said I wasn't born here. They said climate change is a hoax,"" Obama told the crowd. ""They said I was going to take everybody's guns away . . . and impose martial law. . . . So people have been hearing it and they start thinking, well, maybe this is true. . . . Is it any wonder that they end up nominating someone like Donald Trump?"" Corey Friedl, a 66-year-old retiree clad in an Obama 2008 T-shirt, shared the president's sense of disappointment and outrage.  Eight years ago, when Obama promised the crowd in Grant Park that a ""defining moment of change"" had come to America, tears were streaming down Friedl's face. ""His words were more than inspirational,"" she said. ""They were a reality that I never thought I would live to see.""  The years since have been tough for her family and many of her friends. The billions of dollars spent bailing out Wall Street were not enough to save the small community bank where she worked as an executive assistant. ""All the money went to the big guys,"" she said. Only recently had she noticed the tourism economy in Las Vegas bouncing back. She had hoped that the election of the first black president would ease racial tensions. Instead, she said, it seemed as if Obama's presidency had ""brought out the racism that's in the country."" Her 45 minutes in the crowded gymnasium cheering for Obama offered a respite from the otherwise nasty election season. Obama, his shirt sleeves rolled up and his mood buoyant, hit the high points of his presidency: 15 million new jobs, incomes finally rising again, Osama bin Laden dead. ""We have made so much progress, despite the forces of opposition and discrimination, and the politics of backlash,"" Obama said as he finished his speech and rushed back to his limousine. Friedl, her legs sore from waiting in line for tickets, leaned on a cane as she walked out of the gymnasium. ""I am in love with him,"" she said of the president. ""He's just so inspirational."" Outside the high school gymnasium, the skies had darkened and a stiff desert wind sent campaign fliers, paper cups and plastic garbage cans hurtling across the parking lot. Rosie Dowd, one of the school janitors, scrambled to pick up the trash. She had been busy working during the president's remarks and had caught only fragments of his speech. But she said she remembered Election Day 2008 as if it had just happened. ""I was home in front of the television with my children -- planted,"" she said. ""I just screamed, 'Thank you, God. Thank you, God. That man is heaven-sent.' "" Her view of what came next was more sober. ""Living through the life I have lived, I know there's no such thing as pulling off everything,"" she said. Dowd blamed the country's faltering morals for its increasingly toxic politics. ""I see it every day in the schools,"" she said. ""Parents aren't doing their jobs at home."" Friedl blamed Trump. ""I call him Voldemort,"" she said, comparing him to the villain in the ""Harry Potter"" books.  On the car ride home after the speech, Friedl and her friends shared pictures from the rally and recounted the president's best Trump taunts.  This year, Friedl said, she will stay up until all the election returns are in and the next president has delivered a victory speech to the country. But she knows she will feel more relief than joy when it is all done. ""All of my friends and family are so ready for the country to move beyond this election,"" she said. ""Me, too. I'd rather feel hopeful than hopeless.""  "
