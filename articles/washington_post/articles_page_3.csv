But around when Mr. Meng was selected to head Interpol, the 190-nation police cooperation organization endorsed badly needed procedural changes to better protect against abuse of its notification system by countries attempting to press politically motivated prosecutions.  Interpol, based in Lyon, France, is a network of police forces, and its information sharing has often meant quick action against suspected terrorists, criminals and fugitives. But the organization has been strongly criticized in recent years for serving as the handmaiden to repressive regimes such as Russia, China and others who used the system to go after political foes, including dissidents, human rights activists, journalists and businessmen. A related problem has been the extreme difficulty faced by people who are wrongly included on Interpol lists and want to be removed from a designation that can have debilitating consequences to reputations and to the ability to travel. Interpol circulates what are called ""red notices"" at the request of a member country seeking to help catch a fugitive, and it also shares ""diffusions,"" which are less formal and are intended to request the arrest or location of a person, or to acquire more information for a police investigation. Interpol's constitution says it is ""strictly forbidden"" to intervene in political affairs, and that it must carry out its work ""in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."" But as the number of red notices has skyrocketed in the past decade, so have complaints about abuses. A nongovernmental organization, Fair Trials, based in Britain, charged in a study three years ago that Interpol's protections against abuse were ""ineffective,"" and declared just recently that it is ""too easy for countries to use Red Notices as political tools to persecute refugees, journalists, and activists beyond their own borders."" In recent years, Interpol has begun to respond to the complaints. A policy put in place two years ago has better shielded refugees. On Nov. 9, the group's General Assembly, meeting in Bali, Indonesia, backed reforms of its information systems. These will restructure the part of Interpol that handles requests for Red Notices and diffusions to make sure they are in compliance with Interpol's own rules, and also will help those who want to appeal or delete data in the system. While all the details are not yet clear, the steps are promising. Interpol's secretary general, Jurgen Stock, has repeatedly emphasized the importance of protecting human rights as well as law enforcement. Whatever views Mr. Meng brings from his experience in repressive China, he must not brake the Interpol reform effort, and should accelerate the pace of change. It is the right thing do to in principle, and also right for pragmatic reasons. Interpol will be strengthened if it spends less time issuing red notices for dissidents and more time in the pursuit of real criminals.                "

Today, two things about his victory seem to be in sharper focus: one, that Trump's victory might best be understood as the success of the country's first independent president, and second, that the Trump coalition may be even more uniquely his than President Obama's has turned out to be. Think again about how he prevailed. There are a handful of major events during a general election that give the nominees a chance to showcase themselves, their judgment and their vision. One is the selection of a running mate. Another is the staging of the conventions. A third is performance in the debates. Hillary Clinton did better than Trump on all three tests, though Trump's team believes the debates did not fall so decisively in her favor. Then there are the other factors that go into producing a successful candidacy. These include resources, the operations and mechanics of campaigning, and the skill with which candidates avoid mistakes and deal with the unexpected setbacks.  Clinton raised more money than Trump. She had a larger number of paid staffers on the ground in the battleground states. She ran more television ads by far. He created needless controversies throughout the general election, while her problems were far fewer. Only in the final days did he seem surer of himself. In other words, Trump came out the loser on virtually every aspect of how campaigns are usually evaluated. Yet today he is staffing his administration and Clinton is still absorbing the brutal shock of having lost a race she believed was hers.     In Donald Trump's Washington, there are many people vying for the President-elect's attention. The Washington Post's Robert Costa explains how Trump will seek advice during the transition. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)   Trump owes his success in part to the fact that he ran for president in an environment that favored change over the status quo. But his luck or genius goes beyond that. It has long been noted that the conditions have existed for an independent candidate to run a serious campaign for president. The level of dissatisfaction with Washington, the anxiety over the economy and the generally sour mood about the future provided the foundation for a campaign by someone from outside the system, who is tied to neither political party and with a promise to shake things up.  [Trump security picks point to hardline positions]  What has stood in the way of people running as an independent is that winning the presidency in a system that so clearly favors the two major parties is something of a hopeless cause. That's a big reason former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg decided not to run several times when he seriously explored the idea.  Trump took the elements of an independent candidacy -- the lack of clear ideology, the name recognition of a national celebrity and the personal fortune needed to fund a presidential campaign -- and then did what no one seemed to have thought of before. He staged a hostile takeover of an existing major party. He had the best of both worlds, an outsider candidacy with crosscutting ideological appeal and the platform of a major party to wage the general election. By the time he had finished, he had taken down two political dynasties: the Bush dynasty in the primaries and the Clinton dynasty in the general election. All through the campaign, one big question was whether 2016 would produce a new electoral map. Mostly this was an outgrowth of the idea that demography is destiny. This was shorthand for the hope among Democrats that changing demographics -- rising numbers of Hispanics in particular -- along with a growing proportion of the population with college degrees would move some states from red to purple and others from purple to blue. One example was the way the Clinton team saw Virginia and Colorado as two states that had moved toward the Democrats during the Obama years and now were securely in the party's column. They also saw an opportunity to win in Arizona this year and believed that Georgia would soon become a true battleground. Even bright red Texas looked more in play during the early fall. The flip side of this ""demography is destiny"" concept was that, for a time, the Republicans might have their best opportunity to change the map by focusing on a handful of Northern industrial states, all of which have older, whiter populations and lower percentages of college graduates.  But with the exception of Ohio, those states -- Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- were all part of what the Atlantic's Ron Brownstein long ago dubbed the ""Blue Wall."" The phrase was shorthand for states that as of 2012 had voted Democratic in six consecutive presidential elections. Despite the demographics, it seemed that wall would be too high an obstacle for Trump to surmount in this election, even though his messages on trade and immigration were tailor-made for voters in that region.  What happened was that this map of a new America came true only in part. Trump converted the portion of the map that was suddenly hospitable to his message, and Clinton failed to win the states that someday might lean more Democratic. The northern map was riper for picking by Trump -- barely, given the tight results in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- than the southern map turned out to be for Clinton.  For Republicans, the fact that Trump won the presidency while losing the popular vote should remain a concern. It was the second time in five recent elections that the GOP has gotten to the White House with fewer votes, as Clinton probably will emerge with a clear plurality and a raw vote margin significantly higher than Al Gore in 2000.  An analysis by Mark Gersh of the National Committee for an Effective Congress looked at the vote in 14 swing states vs. the rest of the country. Trump won the popular vote in those 14 states and got 142 of his electoral votes from them. In the other 36 states, he lost the popular vote by an even larger margin. He found the votes where he needed them. She did not. How did he do it? Take a look at Ohio. For years, the state has been a classic bellwether and, in the three previous elections, ground zero in the battle for the White House. This year it went to Trump by 8 points and shifted from its historical norm by the biggest margin in more than half a century.   [Thanks to Democrats, Trump's Cabinet could win easy Senate votes]  Mike Dawson, an expert on election statistics in Ohio, did an analysis of the vote last week for the Columbus Dispatch. What he found was that Trump's percentage was higher than that of Mitt Romney in 2012 in 83 of the state's 88 counties. Trump's percentage in rural southeast Ohio was the biggest since Herbert Hoover in 1928. In the Youngstown area, once reliable Democratic turf, Trump got 52 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent that Romney got in 2012. Ohio was not unique. Similar patterns existed in the other Northern industrial states. Yet in the three formerly blue states that Trump converted, Clinton might have won had she not suffered erosion among African American voters -- one key portion of the Obama coalition -- or prevented more white, college-educated voters from moving away from her and returning home to the GOP, the group her team saw as a key element of a new Clinton coalition. Trump redrew the map just as he redrew the rules for running a campaign. For those reasons alone, and despite all the controversy of his campaign and the earlier personnel appointments, he ought not to be underestimated and/or seen through conventional lenses. A personal note: We said a sad but joyful farewell this week to Gwen Ifill, the co-anchor of the ""PBS NewsHour"" and the moderator of PBS's ""Washington Week."" She was both colleague and friend, and one could not have asked for anything better in both. She broke barriers and earned through hard work and strength of character every journalistic award and accolade that came her way. She was a mentor and role model for scores of journalists -- some younger, many her contemporaries. She was the best of friends, loyal and vibrant and loving. And she had the greatest smile imaginable. She will be long remembered, and neither the light of her smile nor the example she provided all of us will ever be extinguished.  "

Jeff Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, is likely to rehash racially charged allegations that derailed his efforts to become a federal judge and made him a symbol of black-voter intimidation under the Reagan administration. The expected focus on Sessions' record on race, policing and immigration comes as the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has surged in prominence under the Obama administration. If confirmed, Sessions would have broad latitude to define how federal prosecutors across the country wield their powers and make changes to the Justice Department's priorities. Lawmakers and advocates expressed concern Friday that Sessions could sideline or undo the Obama administration's civil rights efforts, which have included investigations of police departments for unconstitutional practices and lawsuits meant to protect the rights of transgender individuals and black voters.  ""Given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say,"" incoming Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said he strongly supported Sessions, who he said ""has worked tirelessly to safeguard the public and to improve the lives of Americans from all walks of life."" Sessions' peers on the Senate Judiciary Committee will almost certainly delve into the Alabama senator's past statements on race. The panel's top Democrat, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, hinted as much on Friday, saying the ""American people deserve to learn about Senator Sessions' record."" Leahy voted against Sessions for a district judgeship when he last came before the Judiciary Committee in 1986. During that hearing, Sessions was criticized for joking in the presence of a Civil Rights Division attorney that the Ku Klux Klan was ""OK"" until he learned they smoked marijuana. He was also said to have called a black assistant U.S. attorney ""boy"" and the NAACP ""un-American"" and ""communist-inspired."" Gerry Hebert, a former Justice Department lawyer who worked with Sessions in the early 1980s, said he remembered Sessions making racially offensive remarks.  ""I filed all these things away thinking, 'God, what a racist this guy is,'"" Hebert said. Sessions, a former prosecutor, has said the racially charged allegations against him have been painful to him and an unfair stain on his reputation. He called the matter ""heartbreaking"" in a 2009 CNN interview and described the allegations as ""false charges."" In defending his record, Sessions is likely to point to his vote to confirm Eric Holder as the country's first black attorney general and to his co-sponsorship of the Fair Sentencing Act, which sought to reduce racial disparities in how black and white drug offenders are treated. When he was U.S. attorney in Alabama, his office investigated the 1981 murder of Michael Donald, a black man who was kidnapped, beaten and killed by two Klansmen who hanged his body in a tree. The two men were later arrested and convicted.  ""He couldn't have been more supportive of making sure we got convicted the murderers of the last black man who was lynched by the Klan,"" said former Justice Department attorney Barry Kowalski, who worked with Sessions. But ""those incidents don't obliterate the well-established record of hostility to civil rights enforcement in other areas,"" said Wade Henderson, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Sessions' civil rights record matters because, if confirmed, he would have oversight of a division that Holder has described as the Justice Department's ""crown jewel."" Sessions himself has said a ""properly exercised"" Civil Rights Division ""provides tremendous benefit to American citizens"" but should not be used as ""a sword to assert inappropriate claims that have the effect of promoting political agendas."" As attorney general, he'd have the power to depart significantly from the priorities of his Democratic-nominated predecessors. The Obama administration Justice Department, for instance, has opened 23 investigations of law enforcement agencies, including police departments in Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri, for unconstitutional practices and has reached court-enforceable consent decrees with many of them. It sued North Carolina over a bathroom bill it said discriminated against transgender individuals, and has challenged state voting laws that it said disenfranchised minority voters. As a supporter of Trump, who campaigned on law and order, Sessions is likely to pursue fewer civil rights investigations of troubled police departments. He may also elevate voter fraud as a priority, something the current Justice Department leaders see as negligible. In the mid-1980s, Sessions was criticized over the prosecution of three civil rights activists on charges of vote tampering in Perry County, Alabama. The activists, who included Albert Turner, a former adviser to Martin Luther King Jr., were acquitted. During his confirmation hearing Sessions defended the case, citing evidence of absentee-ballot tampering. Democrats and civil rights groups called it an example of the Reagan administration intimidating black voters. As a senator, Sessions criticized the Justice Department in 2009 for dismissing three defendants from a voting rights lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party after allegations of voter intimidation outside a Philadelphia polling place. The department's Office of Professional Responsibility found no evidence politics played a role in that decision. He's also defended the lawfulness of state voter identification laws. Policy differences aside, the Civil Rights Division is expected to continue enforcing civil rights laws, such as prosecuting police officers for egregious acts of violence.  ""The challenge for an incoming administration is always to make those policy changes without making law enforcement look like a purely political undertaking,"" said William Yeomans, who worked in the division for more than two decades. Otherwise, ""it hurts the legitimacy of the institution."" ___ Associated Press writer Eileen Sullivan in Washington and Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama contributed to this report.

It's the kind of place that business executive Donald Trump might enjoy -- and that President-elect Donald Trump says he abhors. It's the U.S. Senate, a place critical to enacting Trump's sweeping agenda of repealing the Affordable Care Act, overhauling the nation's tax code, renegotiating global treaties and spending potentially trillions of dollars to build roads and bridges. But few senators will agree with everything Trump wants and fewer actually understand the incoming president. The only one who does, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), is poised to serve as attorney general. ""Look, Donald Trump's never been in public office before. This is going to be a whole new experience for him, and we're all going to have to learn to adjust and grow from it,"" said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), the chamber's second-ranking Republican. Trump's on-again, off-again relationship with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has been under constant scrutiny, and even after Trump's surprise victory, many insiders focused on how the 70-year-old billionaire could work with the 46-year-old speaker. But if the recent past is any indication, the dynamic to watch could actually be between Trump, the self-described master negotiator, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming minority leader.   Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) speaks with reporters in the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 15, 2015. On Trump he warns colleagues, ""Don't stereotype him and be open-minded."" (Cliff Owen/AP)  An agriculture metaphor advanced by Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) -- who survived a tough reelection battle by sticking close to Trump -- may perfectly capture this brave new Washington. Blunt compared the fledgling power structure to a ""hybrid vigor,"" when animals are crossbred to create a superior species. ""You might have a hybrid vigor in the government that Trump brings, that wouldn't be there otherwise. And hybrid vigor is usually a good thing,"" he said, adding later that the McConnell-Schumer-Trump combination ""might be a really significant thing."" The old dynamic saw McConnell often pulling out last-minute solutions -- with the help of an elder Democratic statesman -- to myriad governing crises when the House lobbed an unpassable bill to the upper chamber. On the surface, things might not be that different. McConnell still controls a Republican Senate, and Democrats have the power to block objectionable pieces of the Trump agenda and Supreme Court nominees. Republicans could push through key pieces of Trump's platform by using fast-track rules for fiscal policy items -- though enacting other pieces would still require 60 votes in the Senate.  [President Trump's Cabinet picks are likely to be easily confirmed. That's because of Senate Democrats]  It's a situation similar to the first years of the Obama presidency, when a Democratic Congress and president muscled through many of their priorities despite a vow by McConnell to stop them and make Obama a one-term president.     Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Nov. 10 said he had a ""first-class meeting"" with President-elect Donald Trump. (The Washington Post)   But Trump's agenda -- which includes a big-spending infrastructure program and preserving Medicare and Social Security -- may find more support among Democrats than Republicans. And Democrats say, at least for now, that they will approach things differently. ""We will work with President Trump when he agrees with our positions and values, but when he goes against our values and our positions, we'll fight him with everything we have,"" Schumer said Friday in an interview.  [Schumer is focusing on the big prize: Senate majority leader]  The New York senator said that he has already spoken with Trump ""two or three"" times since the election in calls initiated by the president-elect. Trump aides didn't return requests for comment, and Schumer declined to specify what was discussed. He said Democrats are eager to work with a version of the president-elect that has yet to manifest itself -- a candidate who vowed to ""drain the swamp"" and upend the old ways of Washington and who as president-elect is interested in preserving key elements of Obamacare. Schumer said that he hopes Trump ""will not just hew to the hard-right line and realize that he won the election by attacking both the Democratic and Republican establishments. My greatest worry is that he'll just adopt a hard-right line. I think it would be bad for America and, frankly, make his presidency a flop."" McConnell, who aides said is in touch frequently with Trump or his top aides, vowed in recent days to ""address the real concerns of the American people, not go back and re-litigate what anybody on either side may have said during a very hotly contested presidential race."" McConnell said that he hopes to quickly take steps to repeal President Obama's health law, revamp the nation's tax system, install a conservative Supreme Court justice and fill other federal judicial vacancies. Energy is another priority of McConnell's -- he has urged Trump to rapidly approve the Keystone XL pipeline and to reverse Obama-era policies that Republicans consider a ""war on coal."" Everything on the Republican wish list is likely to face some measure of Democratic opposition. But pressuring Democrats will be easier in the next two years given the 2018 political map, when 25 of the 48 members of the Senate Democratic caucus face reelection -- including 10 senators from states that Trump won. Just eight Republican seats will be up for grabs. That dynamic means McConnell should be able to pressure several vulnerable Democrats to side with Republicans, including Sens. Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.) and Jon Tester (Mont.). Manchin sounds especially eager to cooperate with the new Republican president. Some Senate aides speculated that he earned a spot on Schumer's leadership team partly to assuage rumors that he might switch parties -- a charge that Manchin and senior Senate aides denied.  ""If President-elect Trump comes with good policies, I'm going to be 1,000 percent behind him. Okay?"" Manchin said. ""Maybe the rest of my caucus will not, but I'm going to find a pathway forward."" McCaskill, a vocal supporter of Obama and Hillary Clinton, remains more skeptical of engaging with Trump. ""The big question that none of us can answer right now is what role will Donald Trump's personality play in how he governs?"" she asked. ""Can he sublimate his natural tendencies to make it all about him, to work across the aisle on things that we agree with on, or to unite the Republican Party?"" McConnell and Schumer epitomize the old-school way of doing Washington business: Their first instinct is to enhance their side's chances at victory in the upcoming election. When pushed to the brink, they tend to craft complex deals averting massive crises, and their political calculations are aimed at flexibility in selling the deal to partisans. The classic example is the $700 billion bailout of big banks in 2008. Both senators played intimate roles in drafting the package, which at first failed in the House. While the overall package was very unpopular, it came with a few caveats designed to protect incumbents who voted for it -- all $700 billion, for instance, was not handed over at once, but instead came in tranches that Congress could impede. But that old-fashioned dealmaking may no longer fit Trump's Washington, and McConnell might be in the toughest spot of all. On Friday, Stephen K. Bannon, set to serve as Trump's top White House strategist, told the Hollywood Reporter that he is pushing the new president to adopt ""a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan."" Earlier in the week, McCaskill warned that Trump's support for infrastructure spending would ultimately cause more heartburn for Republicans given that they fought such costly measures during Obama's presidency. ""All we've heard from the Republicans is we can't do a big spending bill unless it's paid for, and I don't think Donald Trump is much interested in paying for anything,"" McCaskill said. ""He loves OPM -- 'Other People's Money,' including taxpayers'."" Schumer added that congressional Republicans would ""rue the day"" they try to repeal Obamacare. ""Why? Because all of a sudden they're realizing there's a lot of good things"" in the law, he said, citing Trump's openness to keeping protection for young people and those with preexisting conditions. ""There's no way to keep the good things without keeping ACA,"" Schumer said. Republicans ""are a dog who caught the bus.""  [Trump calls for short-term spending bill despite Senate concerns]  But Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who as a failed presidential candidate got to know Trump, warned fellow senators to tread carefully. ""Don't stereotype him and be open-minded,"" he said. ""You're missing who he is if you go in with a bunch of preconceived notions. He's one of the most charming people I've met. And he actually can be quiet and absorb stuff."" McConnell engaged very little with Trump during the campaign and for weeks avoided any public comments on him. Trump and Schumer are among the most media-savvy New Yorkers, but they don't have a close relationship. During an October interview, Schumer recalled that as a Brooklyn-area congressman in the 1980s and 1990s, he had little interaction with Trump. If the business executive ever called his congressional office, Schumer said it was probably about Trump Village, a six-building complex for middle-income New Yorkers that was built by the president-elect's late father, Fred Trump. During the 2008 campaign cycle, Trump hosted a fundraiser for the Democrats' Senate campaign arm, which Schumer chaired, and helped the party raise $230,000 at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. ""It was a usual fundraiser,"" Schumer recalled, describing the event as ""a good night"" for the party's coffers. ""People wanted to go to Mar-a-Lago, which was then a bigger deal than it is now,"" Schumer added. On Friday, Schumer said what he remembers most about Trump was ""landing at LaGuardia and seeing his big plane sitting there, and I realized, what a genius -- he paid the rent because it was like getting a great sign advertised because his plane said, 'Trump.'

Not this year, especially for many in the LGBT community, who are trying to decide whether to break bread with their family members who supported President-elect Donald Trump. That's because Trump and some of his closest advisers are widely seen as racist, anti-Semitic, misogynist and homophobic. This year the tough questions are: To boycott or not to boycott? And if you decide to sit down together, how do you protect yourself from any gloating or vitriol? ""I'm not so much scared to go home as I am dreading it,"" said Dustin Miller, a 29-year old gay man who messaged me this week when I asked Facebook readers for their holiday survival strategies in the wake of the election results. Minutes later I heard from a married lesbian and mom who comes from a Mormon family. ""I struggle not to be the one to push them away,"" she wrote, ""but this is bigger than just having a difference of opinion -- they are against a fundamental aspect of who I am."" Yes, Trump's election and the extremist positions he's trumpeted are in a category of their own.  Many of the Facebook messages ended with pleas for advice: ""Should I call them out on their views?"" ""Must I go?"" And my favorite, in the lighthearted bracket, ""Other than drinking myself stupid, any suggestions on surviving?"" It deeply saddens me that so many LGBT people need help getting through a holiday that symbolizes gratitude and community, but I'm not going to sugarcoat this election's impact on people of color, immigrants, women, the LGBT community and others. Sure, it helps (a little) knowing Trump's win doesn't represent the majority of American voters. (Hillary Clinton is currently ahead by 1.4 million votes in the popular count.) But it's dispiriting to think that more than 61 million Americans did choose him -- and next week, they're coming for dinner. While I know not everyone who voted for Trump is biased, one post-election tweet spoke a commonly held truth among many in my community:  ""Not all Trump supporters are racist, but all of them decided that racism isn't a dealbreaker. End of story.""      You can substitute ""homophobic,"" ""transphobic,"" ""xenophobic,"" or ""Islamphobic"" for ""racist"" and come to the same conclusion. Thus the raw, bloody feelings of so many in the LGBT community -- and now we're expected to serve up an attitude of gratitude along with sweet potatoes and green bean casserole? Conventional holiday advice tells us to suck up our differences and remember that family triumph over politics. In that vein, Judith Martin, who writes the Miss Manners column, reminded an audience in Kansas City after the election that ""if you can't restrain yourself to treat [others] with respect, how are you going to get along with anyone?"" For some of us, that's really challenging advice to follow because of how disrespected we feel by Trump and the GOP and how fearful we are of what's to come in a Trump administration. If that sounds familiar, you have my permission to take a pass on this year's family Thanksgiving. ""The best thing I've ever done was to skip the blood relations stress fest . . . and have a Thanksgiving with my queer friends and family,"" a friend suggested. Another solid option: Google your local LGBT center and see whether they're serving Thanksgiving dinner or need volunteers that day.  But if you decide to attend, go and be out and proud -- especially if you'll have an opportunity to be a role model for kids who might be present. ""You might be a lifeline to one of these kids,"" explained Lynn York, a fellow writer. ""Your ability to be present and to express your views in a civil manner -- that might be life-changing or maybe even lifesaving. That's worth a few hours of pumpkin pie and social torture.""  In the meantime, here are some other survival strategies:   Lean in: ""Use this holiday as an opportunity to learn something about the other side,"" Joseph Burgo, a blogger and gay psychotherapist, told me. If this election has taught us anything, it's about how little the two sides understand and respect one another, he added. I'd also add: Practice the art of listening, especially before you speak. Use friendly body language, make eye contact.   Rise up: Broach political topics, but practice civil discourse. ""Don't accuse relatives of being homophobic, transphobic, racist,"" advised GLAAD's Nick Adams. Calling someone out won't change their attitudes.   Step in: If anyone goes off the rails about the Supreme Court or ""religious freedom"" bills, change the subject and be prepared with a list of ""safe questions."" ""Uncle Maurice, congratulations on that new job -- tell us all about it."" It may feel awkward and obvious, but it's okay to redirect the discussion to prevent a nuclear meltdown.   Give up: If you know your table will be a fiery mix of blue and red, LGBT and straight, decide on a no-politics dinner and let your guests know ahead of time. Use humor to make your point. ""Can we please talk about something other than politics? Like, remember that time our house burned down? That was fun, right?'"" said Jennifer Boylan, a transgender advocate and professor.  Don't drink yourself stupid: Alcohol and politics are notoriously bad mixers. Try to have yourselves a Happy Thanksgiving -- and remember, there are only 206 weeks before the 2020 elections. See, that's something to be thankful for.   Email questions to Civilities at stevenpetrow@gmail.com (unfortunately not all questions can be answered).

(Javier Galeano/Reuters)  Now that it is clear that Hillary Clinton will win the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election by well over a million votes, we once again face the issue of the peculiar means by which Americans select their presidents. There is no question that the electoral college violates political equality because all votes are not equal. As a result, the electoral college sometimes denies the people their preferred choice for president, as in 2000 and 2016. But does the electoral college provide some benefits that might compensate for its shortcomings? The short answer is no. Indeed, two of the most prominent arguments in favor of the electoral college cannot withstand scrutiny. The electoral college does not prevent tyranny of the majority  The Framers were concerned about tyranny of the majority and therefore incorporated rules in the Constitution that require supermajorities in order to take action, such as the requirement for two-thirds of the senators present to ratify a treaty. Is the electoral college's violation of majority rule just another example? It is not. The Framers designed all but one of the Constitution's extra-majority provisions to enable minorities to prevent an action. The electoral college is different. It allows a minority to take an action -- that is, to select the president. It is the only device of its kind in the Constitution. Thus, the electoral college does not prevent tyranny of the majority. Instead, it provides the potential for tyranny of the minority. People sometimes think that, if not for the electoral college, a candidate could win by garnering an overwhelming number of votes in one region of the country, imposing that region's choice on the rest of the country. A quick look at the census shows that this is impossible. The electoral college isn't necessary to prevent this scenario. Does the electoral college ensure that the winner receives majority support from different social groups, thus protecting minority interests? No. In 2016, Donald Trump won a smaller percentage than Hillary Clinton among women, African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, voters ages 18 to 44, members of labor unions, those with an income under $50,000, college graduates and those with postgraduate educations, Jews, liberals and moderates, urbanites, and those living in the East and the West. It strains credulity to claim that Trump's vote represents concurrent majorities across the major social strata in the United States. What actually happened in 2016 was that the electoral college imposed a candidate supported by white male Protestants -- the dominant social group in the country -- over the objections not only of a plurality of all voters but also of most prominent ""minority"" interests in the country. The electoral college isn't necessary to maintain the two-party system  Some critics say that allowing voters to directly elect the president would splinter the two-party system. It would encourage many candidates to contest the general election, thus producing a winner with only a small share of the vote. This is also wrong. In a system of direct election, potential candidates risk their political futures by running against the official party nominees. And there is no compensation. You win nothing by coming in third. So there is little incentive to run. By contrast, the electoral college encourages third parties, especially those with regional bases, because by winning a few states they may deny either major-party candidate a majority of the electoral vote. You can come in third and still win a prize. Such a result was certainly the goal of Strom Thurmond in 1948 and George Wallace in 1968. Imagine giving these racist candidates leverage to negotiate with the leading candidates before the electoral votes were officially cast. Moreover, even without winning any states, Ralph Nader inadvertently distorted the vote and determined the outcome of the 2000 election. If Nader had not been on the ballot, Al Gore would have won both Florida and New Hampshire. Either victory would have put him in the White House. Some defenders of the electoral college seem to believe that direct election would require a runoff between the two leading candidates. But it's circular reasoning to argue that direct election will produce a plethora of candidates, which in turn will force a runoff, which in turn will encourage candidates to run. In fact, direct election would not produce more general election candidates than does the electoral college, and there would be no need for a runoff. Moreover, victorious presidential candidates under the electoral college -- including, most recently, John F. Kennedy (1960), Richard Nixon (1968), Bill Clinton (1992 and 1996), George W. Bush (2000) and Donald Trump (2016) -- have received less than a majority of the national popular vote about 40 percent of the time since 1824. We have not needed a runoff. More broadly, the electoral college is not the basis of the two-party system. Single-member districts and plurality election are, and the nation would be one electoral district under direct election. Thus direct election would not splinter the party system. Core arguments for the electoral college are based on faulty premises. The electoral college violates political equity and popular choice, but doesn't provide any compensatory benefits. Indeed, the electoral college has perverse consequences, exactly the opposite of those claimed by its defenders. Not only does it not protect us from tyranny of the majority but it actually allows tyranny of the minority. Similarly, not only does it not strengthen the party system but it actually provides incentives for fragmenting it. As Americans consider changing our election system, it is important that they have a clear understanding of the electoral college's actual consequences. George C.

Marcos's daughter, Imee, expressed relief after her father's interment at the heavily guarded cemetery in metropolitan Manila, which she said fulfilled his last wish. Enraged pro-democracy activists, however, stressed the decades-long debate over the ex-president's final resting place was far from over and protested across the metropolis. Bonifacio Ilagan, a left-wing activist who was detained and tortured during Marcos's rule, said the dictator was buried ""like a thief in the night"" in a stealthy fashion similar to when he suddenly placed the country under martial rule. A lawmaker considered asking the Supreme Court to exhume the newly buried Marcos.  ""It's very much like when he declared martial law in 1972,"" Ilagan told The Associated Press. ""This is so Marcos style. I want to rush to the cemetery to protest this. I feel so enraged."" Marie Hilao Enriquez, a former political detainee whose sister, a fellow activist, was raped and killed by policemen, wept upon learning the news.  ""Marcos died in the arms of his family"" but many Marcos-era activists remain missing after being allegedly abducted by state forces, Enriquez said at a protest. ""We are still searching for the victims' bodies, trying to find out where they buried the bodies."" Imee Marcos thanked those who ""were with us in hoping and praying for nearly three decades to see this day."" President Duterte, who gave the go-ahead for the burial, called for calm.  ""Hopefully, both sides will exercise maximum tolerance and come to terms with the burial,"" Duterte's spokesman, Ernesto Abella, quoted him as saying after the president landed in Peru, where he is attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. Military spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla said Marcos's remains were flown by air force helicopter from his northern Ilocos Norte hometown for burial at the military-run cemetery in Manila. Marcos's widow, Imelda, who was clad in black, and her children attended the simple ceremony along with dozens of relatives and friends. After landing at an air base, Marcos's remains were brought by a black limousine to the cemetery, where his flag-draped wooden coffin was placed on a caisson and later carried by military pallbearers to the gravesite, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla said. A 21-gun salute by military honor troops rang out during the burial ceremony.  ""We rendered the simplest of honors befitting the former president in compliance to the desire of the family,"" Padilla said. Asked why the burial was kept from the public, Padilla said it was the Marcos family's desire ""to keep it private."" Still, the burial shocked many democracy advocates and human rights victims who had planned protests nationwide Friday against Marcos's interment at the cemetery, where former presidents, soldiers and national artists have been buried, unaware that funeral plans were already underway. Burying someone accused of massive rights violations and plunder at the heroes' cemetery has long been an emotional and divisive issue in the Philippines, where Marcos was ousted by a largely nonviolent army-backed uprising in 1986. At the height of the political turbulence, Marcos flew to Hawaii, where he lived with his wife and children until he died in 1989. The powerful family has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and Imelda Marcos and two of her children eventually ran for public office and won stunning political comebacks. One son, Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr., ran for vice president earlier this year and lost by a slim margin. In 1993, Marcos's body was taken to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, where it was displayed in a glass coffin and became a tourist attraction. But his family fought for his remains to be transferred to the heroes' cemetery. Duterte, who took over the presidency in June, backed Marcos's burial at the cemetery, saying it was his right as a president and soldier. It was a political risk in a country where democracy advocates celebrate Marcos's ouster each year. About 2,000 protesters gathered late Friday at the site of the 1986 revolt that toppled Marcos. Some yelled, ""Marcos dictator, dig him up, dig him up."" Michaela Gotangco, a Catholic nun who stood in front of tanks with others to stop Marcos's forces from crushing that uprising, said the burial may herald a new era of political restiveness.  ""This is the start of many protests ... it's a very painful event,"" Gotangco said. Last week, the Supreme Court dismissed seven petitions, including from former torture victims, which argued that an honorable burial for the dictator was ""illegal and contrary to law, public policy, morals and justice."" Opponents planned to appeal the court decision within a 15-day period but were pre-empted by Friday's surprise burial. They said the Marcos family should be cited by the court for contempt. The court ruled that Marcos was never convicted by final judgment of any offense involving moral turpitude, adding that the convictions cited by anti-Marcos petitioners were civil in nature. While critics may reject Marcos as president due to his human rights abuses, the court said he cannot be denied the right to be acknowledged as a former legislator, a defense secretary, a military member, a war veteran and a Medal of Valor awardee.  ""While he was not all good,"" the 15-member court said, ""he was not pure evil either."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The appointment of Stephen K. Bannon to a top White House job was an act ""hostile to core American values,"" the group said. The more conservative Zionist Organization of America also mounted an attack. But its target was the ADL, which it accused of engaging in ""character assassination."" It has invited Bannon to speak at its annual gala in New York on Sunday. Most of the rest of the major Jewish groups in Washington, eager to maintain influence with a Trump administration and unsure about the extent of Bannon's ties to the white nationalist movement, have stayed silent. Among the country's leading Jewish organizations, Trump's election has provoked an unusual level of angst and uncertainty, widening the rifts among groups that have largely tried to stay out of partisan political fights. The debate has divided those who believe the Jewish community's support for Israel requires leaders to build good relations with the new president from those who argue that Jewish groups should speak out against views they see as anti-Semitic.  ""It has been disappointing to watch organizations in the American Jewish community avoid comment,"" said Ilan Goldenberg, a former member of the U.S. team working on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Obama. ""What's the point of building political influence if not for a situation like this?""     Before Stephen K. Bannon became a close adviser to Donald Trump, he hosted ""Breitbart News Daily,"" a radio show, on which he interviewed Trump nine times. The Washington Post's David A. Fahrenthold discusses what those interviews tell us about their relationship. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   For the moment, most Jewish groups -- especially those focused on the security of Israel -- are asking a different question. They are wondering at what point, if any, they will feel compelled to take a stand against Trump's connections to the alt-right movement, a far-right ideology that includes opposition to immigration and globalism. Those views have found a home in the Breitbart News empire, which was led by Bannon before he joined Trump's campaign. The movement has attracted support from white nationalists, although Bannon has said it is not racist. ""There are lots of questions and concerns and a lot I would like to say,"" said a senior executive of a group focused on the U.S.-Israeli relationship, who like some other Jewish organizational leaders, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. ""But I have a mission and a job to do, and I can't blow it up."" Other groups have taken a slightly more forward-leaning posture. The Israel Policy Forum, which has advocated for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, expressed ""deep concern"" about Bannon, describing him as ""someone who has purveyed ugly and divisive rhetoric."" ""At what point do you set aside the mission?"" asked David Halperin, the group's executive director. ""The challenge is: How do we balance our desire to wait and be a positive influence [on a Trump administration] versus expressing our concern when it is absolutely necessary?"" The uncertainty among Jewish groups reflects the contradictions of Trump, a 70-year-old political neophyte with little experience in foreign affairs and virtually no policy record. Some Jewish leaders, pointing to painful lessons of history, expressed discomfort with the rise of a populist figure who seemed to embrace authoritarian tendencies. Others objected to Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States as an unconstitutional religious test and decried as anti-Semitic a Trump campaign tweet that portrayed a red Star of David shape over a stack of $100 bills, an image that had origins in the online white-supremacist movement. But Trump has won accolades from some groups for his consistently strong support for Israel's security. Some of those views ""would seem to outflank even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,"" the Forward, a Jewish newspaper, recently opined. And many American Jewish leaders are heartened that Trump takes close counsel from Jared Kushner, his Orthodox Jewish son-in-law, and from his daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism.  ""Trump is pretty clearly not an anti-Semite -- look at his family, for goodness sake,"" said Eliot Cohen, a senior official in the George W. Bush administration who is an outspoken Trump critic and an Orthodox Jew. Some more politically conservative Jews were attracted to Trump's stances on social issues, such as school choice and freedom of religion. Many also were drawn to Trump for his fierce opposition to the Obama administration's deal to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The agreement was strongly opposed by the Israeli prime minister, who argued that it did not do enough to constrain Iranian aggression in the region or permanently dismantle Iran's nuclear program. Trump also has suggested that he would not pressure Netanyahu to halt West Bank settlement construction, a major point of contention between Israel and the Obama administration. Many of these supporters will judge Trump primarily through the lens of how he manages the relationship with Israel, said Nathan Diament, executive director of the Orthodox Union Advocacy Center. ""They will be looking for Trump and his administration to follow through,"" Diament said. But, as with many Trump policies, even the president-elect's staunch professions of support for Israel come with questions and contradictions. Trump's courtship of Russia, his intimations of support for the Syrian regime, and his suggestions that the United States should play a less-prominent role in the Middle East all could run counter to Israeli interests. ""Israel wants a strong United States in the region, not [an America] disengaged from it,"" said Dennis B. Ross, a senior adviser on the Middle East to Republican and Democratic administrations. In other instances, Trump has suggested that his policies regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and settlements might be negotiable. ""He talks about this being the ultimate deal,"" Ross said. The general confusion about Trump is straining relationships within the Jewish community. Some of the breakdowns are taking place along normal political lines, which have grown more pronounced as the country has become more polarized. In other instances, differences have sprung up between groups focused on the defense of Israel and those focused on combating anti-Semitism. The Republican Jewish Coalition has slammed the Anti-Defamation League as going too far in its criticism of Bannon and some of the Trump campaign's rhetoric, which the ADL said relied on classic anti-Semitic tropes. The ADL has defended its actions and vowed to call out anti-Semitism and racism. The controversy also has exposed the increasingly divergent worldviews and priorities of American and Israeli Jews. Many Israeli Jews view a Trump presidency through a ""pragmatic policy"" lens, focused on the security of the Jewish state, Halperin said. American Jews, meanwhile, are more worried about civil liberties and the people representing their country, he added. Chief among those groups counseling patience has been the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which has declined to comment on the Bannon appointment. So far, most other Jewish groups with influence in Washington have taken the same stance as AIPAC. That has left the ADL and its new leader, Jonathan Greenblatt, as the most outspoken critic of Trump's selection of Bannon. ""It is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the 'alt-right' -- a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists -- is slated to be a senior staff member in the 'peoples' house,"" Greenblatt said in a statement. Greenblatt, a former Obama administration official, has said that his stance is nothing new for a group that in earlier decades fought for civil rights in the South and took on the anti-communist crusader Sen. Joseph McCarthy during the Red Scare in the 1950s. Greenblatt took over the ADL from Abraham Foxman, whose view of the ADL's work was defined by his own history as a Holocaust survivor. Greenblatt, the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, is aiming to update the group without fundamentally altering its core mission. One view into how a Trump presidency might shape the group could come this week in New York when the ADL holds its ""Never Is Now"" summit on anti-Semitism. The two-day conference is to include several panels with topics drawn directly from the contentious election campaign, including a ""Conversation on Hate Online"" with prominent political journalists and a discussion of ""Pepe the Frog,"" an Internet meme popular with some white nationalists and some Trump supporters. One more sign of the times: The conference is expected to draw more than 1,000 people. ""We are turning people away,"" said Todd Gutnick, an ADL spokesman. "

Bannon -- who played a central role in Trump's victorious campaign -- is on leave from his role as chairman of the Breitbart website, seen by critics as a haven for white supremacists. / AFP PHOTO / DAVID MCNEWDAVID MCNEW/AFP/Getty Images  I will never again use the term ""political correctness."" Whatever rhetorical value the term may have once had is far more than offset by what has been unleashed in the name of resistance to it since the presidential election. I have made no secret over the years of my conviction that the sensitivities of individuals or members of various group should not be permitted to chill free speech on college campuses. I have the scars to show for speaking out against overdoing the idea of microaggression, the regulation of Halloween costumes and the prosecution of students for taking part in sombrero parties - all of which have struck me as ""political correctness"" run amok. But the events of the last week are giving me pause about that term and its usage and the complex issues underlying it. It's not that I now think speech codes are wise or that we should stamp out microaggressions wherever they are perceived. Rather, my reaction is to the way President-elect Donald Trump has been heard during the campaign and the terrifying events his election has set off. The widespread perception is something like this: Trump has vowed to ban Muslims from entering the country and to force deportation of Mexicans. He has ridiculed the disabled. He has accepted without criticism the enthusiastic support of the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups that were previously on the fringes of society. He has invoked standard anti-Semitic tropes in his political advertising. And he has made clear that he believes grabbing and groping women is appropriate behavior. Black students, gay students, Hispanic students, Muslim students, disabled students, female students - all of them now fear that the basic security and acceptance on which they relied is at risk. Help lines are flooded with calls. Those who seek to count hateful incidents report an upsurge. I cannot convince myself that that fear is irrational. Personal experience has brought home to me the pervasive change since the election. Painted swastikas have defaced the middle school that my twin daughters attended and the college another daughter now attends. At a different university where my daughter studies, all the black freshmen were sent emails with pictures depicting lynchings.      Donald Trump says the United States is too preoccupied with being politically correct. Here's how he bashes the idea of being too PC. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   In the face of all this, the President-elect and his staff condemn those who march in protest over his election but as of yet have not forcefully condemned those overt acts of racism, sexism and bigotry the election has stimulated. They have allowed, without adequate response and rejection, the celebration of victory to metastasize into something dark and evil. It is surely wrong to hold the President-elect personally responsible for all the words and deeds of all who support him. Equally, the President-elect has a moral obligation to stand up for tolerance and against intolerance whatever its source. The fight for academic freedom and for ideological diversity on college campuses should and will go on. But given what opposition to ""political correctness"" has licensed, it time to retire the term. More importantly, democracy does not mean electrocracy. Winning an election does not entitle one to upend our basic values. The refusal to tolerate blatant racism, bigotry and misogyny are beyond compromise. The first obligation of anyone currently in a leadership position is not to find common ground with our new President-elect now that the ballots have been counted and the election is over. It is instead to once again make it possible for all who live in our country to feel safe. Lawrence H. Summers, the Charles W.
