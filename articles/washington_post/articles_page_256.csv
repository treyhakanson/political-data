Rick Snyder in the wake of Flint's water crisis outlined several policy recommendations on Thursday. They include: -- screening all children for lead by the time they turn 1 and again between ages 2 and 3. -- requiring that a lead inspection and risk assessment be done when any house built before 1978 is sold or transferred, unless lead in the home has already been fully addressed. If lead hazards were found, abatement would be required at the point of sale or transfer. -- testing the dust, soil and water in homes built since 1978. The owner would be required to disclose the information to a future buyer or renter. -- creating a centralized data reporting system so that local public health agencies, schools, doctors and insurers can track testing rates and cases, including whether follow-up care is being provided. -- considering routine prenatal blood-lead screening for pregnant women. -- inspecting high-risk rental housing until it is deemed to be lead-free. -- boosting Medicaid reimbursement rates for local health departments' risk assessments and investigations. -- spending more to build criminal cases against property owners who do not remediate lead hazards. -- expanding soil testing programs and requiring sampling in high-risk areas before urban gardening efforts begin. -- requiring the disclosure of lead concentrations of 100 parts per million in consumer products, prohibiting lead in fishing tackle and wheel balancing weights, and creating an ammunition trade-in program. ___ Source: Child Lead Poisoning Elimination Board Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Everything from a Southern congressman's riveting memoir to a California woman's textured fantasy tale is finding favor with wide audiences. This year has bestowed graphic-novel fans with an embarrassment of pictorial riches.      ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye,"" by Sonny Liew (Pantheon/Pantheon)    The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye   By Sonny Liew (Pantheon)  The fictional title character, a cartoonist himself, is a deft framing device for viewing Singapore's culture and history through many crisp prisms. Liew keeps us fully awake to his intellectual ambition and political potency by unveiling a parade of shifting visual aesthetics -- with nods to such comics legends as Winsor McCay.         ""Cousin Joseph"" by Jules Feiffer (Liveright/Liveright)    Cousin Joseph    By Jules Feiffer (Liveright)  In this prequel to his acclaimed ""Kill My Mother,"" the 87-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist looks back to a detective noir of his youth. The palette is efficiently spare and the language is retro-colorful, often spoofing the very form it celebrates.       ""Ghosts"" by Raina Telgemeier (Handout/Handout)    Ghosts   By Raina Telgemeier (Graphix)  Telgemeier is best known to young fans for her keenly spun memoirs, including ""Smile"" and ""Sisters."" ""Ghosts"" represents a departure from memoir, though Telgemeier again draws from the personal to depict young courage amid change. Here, the realities of childhood disease meld readily with science fiction and spirituality. And if the book prompts classroom research into the history of indigenous California tribes, then all the better.      Hot Dog Taste Test     By Lisa Hanawalt (Drawn and Quarterly)  Hanawalt, one of the creative forces behind Netflix's ""BoJack Horseman,"" is also one of the funniest observational artists working today. Her latest collection spotlights a comic voice that is growing sharper and more engagingly offbeat, whether she is rendering ""snack realism,"" menstrual huts or plucky Icelandic ponies.    Last Look    By Charles Burns (Pantheon)    Through each work in this trilogy -- ""X'ed Out,"" ""The Hive"" and ""Sugar Skull"" -- Burns keeps us visually unnerved with surreal dreams meeting warped realities. The epic benefits from being collected here as a single set of inspired weirdness.      HANDOUT IMAGE: Three"" by John Lewis, Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell (Top Shelf /Top Shelf )    March: Book Three  By John Lewis and Andrew Aydin; illustrated by Nate Powell (Top Shelf)  The final installment in Lewis's civil rights trilogy completes one of the most powerful graphic memoirs ever. ""Book Three"" achieves Black Lives-era relevance by illuminating the '60s struggle with poignant resonance. From church bombings to Selma beatings, Powell's art never blinks in conveying the costs of the fight for voting rights. As a guiding light for rising generations, this Eisner-winning book belongs on every school library shelf. Winner of the National Book Award for young people's literature.     Mooncop    By Tom Gauld (Drawn and Quarterly)  This British cartoonist is a master of heightening humor through restraint. Here, the monochromatic moonscape matches the subdued blues of a lunar donut-muncher who can't get transferred off this rock. The story gathers wit over the slow-burning ride.        ""Patience,"" by Daniel Clowes (Fantagraphics/Fantagraphics)     Patience    By Daniel Clowes (Fantagraphics)      Science fiction and obsessive love converge in these pages with the heat of crossed laser rays. Clowes keeps us expertly in the dark, even as we stand in the psychedelic illumination of spaced-out discoveries. He has built a masterful fun-house of mirrors that keeps us moving forward.     Rosalie Lightning     By Tom Hart (St. Martin's)    The pain of losing a 2-year-old daughter seems beyond words. And yet Hart, in this heart-rending memoir, finds the words and pictures to convey the gaping sensory experience of his tragedy.        Sheriff of Babylon (Vol. 2): Pow. Pow. Pow     By Tom King and artist Mitch Gerads (Vertigo)    Baghdad's last cop works a murder case after America's invasion of Iraq. This grim and graphic subject matter is scripted with knowing nuance by King, a former operation officer with the CIA's Counterterrorism Center. The action is riveting, the characters compelling, and the art positively cinematic. ""War noir"" for the 21st century.

And the first for Inter's new Chinese proprietors. Plus Silvio Pioli's debut as coach of struggling Inter. Combined with the rise of Milan's youth-oriented squad after several difficult seasons, Sunday's match is being celebrated both as the end of an era and a time of new beginnings.  ""It seems like a different derby compared to the last several, in terms of interest, tickets, standings and the new developments in club ownership,"" Milan vice president Adriano Galliani said. Berlusconi, who purchased Milan 30 years ago, is expected to close a deal next month selling his majority stake in the club to a Chinese investor group that includes the participation of a Chinese state investment fund. While seven-time European champion Milan has not qualified for continental play for three consecutive seasons, the Rossoneri have seen a turnaround this season under first-year coach Vincenzo Montella. Relying on 17-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, 18-year-old midfielder Manuel Locatelli and forward M'Baye Niang, a relative veteran at 21, Montella has guided Milan to third place with a new sense of team unity.  ""After all these difficult years full of problems which I'm not going to list now, this might be the first time that we're re-establishing a close-knit group,"" Milan midfielder Andrea Poli said. ""We're on the right road and we've got to continue along this path."" Inter, meanwhile, is languishing in ninth place with just as many losses -- five -- as wins this season. Pioli, the former Chievo Verona and Lazio coach, was hired last week to replace the fired Frank de Boer. De Boer was hired less than two weeks before the season began following the unexpected resignation of Roberto Mancini, who reportedly wanted more control over the transfer market and clashed with Suning, the Chinese retail giant that took control of 70 percent of Inter in June.  ""Usually a coaching change brings good luck and the derby is often won by the underdog,"" former Inter president Massimo Moratti said. ""But it's not an easy job for Pioli. He's got a difficult match right away. But he's intelligent and he's been able to get his squads to play well."" Inter has a wide array of top-quality players -- such as Mauro Icardi, who tops the Serie A scoring chart alongside Roma's Edin Dzeko with 10 goals each, plus Croatia midfielder Ivan Perisic, Montenegro forward Stevan Jovetic and Italy internationals Eder and Antonio Candreva -- but the Nerazzurri were inconsistent and appeared confused under De Boer.  ""When there are changes it's never just the failure of a coach who is fired. It's also an alarm bell for the players,"" said former Milan standout Demetrio Albertini.  ""When you make a change it shakes things up. So Inter will have the advantage of having a new coach and the players will want to prove themselves,"" Albertini added. ""Qualitatively, they're extraordinary players but they haven't shown their value yet this season."" When Mancini returned to Inter in November 2014, the derby was also his first match back in charge. The game ended in a 1-1 draw. In a move linked to Inter's past, the club's former defender Walter Samuel was hired as one of Pioli's assistants. Samuel scored when Inter won the derby 1-0 four years ago.  ""That's a great and useful move,"" Moratti said. ""We needed him."" ___ Andrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/asdampf Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It was her first public event since conceding the presidential election to Donald Trump. (Photo by Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: The economy is Donald Trump's strongest issue, and the post-election conversation has given short shrift to how significant of a factor it was in his unexpected victory. A new Washington Post poll finds that 59 percent of Americans are somewhat or very confident that the economy will improve under President Trump's watch, and 52 percent say they think their standard of living will improve. These numbers are remarkable when you consider that smaller numbers of people believe he will be effective at governing. And just 29 percent in the survey believe he has a mandate. Other surveys since the election have shown a spike in consumer confidence driven by a feeling that Trump might be able to boost growth and create jobs. According to the exit polls last Tuesday, 52 percent of voters said the economy is the most important issue facing the country. The next closest issue was terrorism, at a distant 18 percent. Trump had a somewhat narrow advantage on ""who would better handle the economy,"" 49 percent to 46 percent, but he won nearly every one who chose him on that question. About one-third of voters in the exit polls said the economy is in good shape. Hillary Clinton won three-quarters of them. But nearly two-thirds said the economy is in poor shape, and Trump won more than six in 10 of that larger group.    Donald Trump wears a coal miner's protective hat during a speech in West Virginia. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)   -- The elites took Trump literally but not seriously. Voters took Trump seriously but not literally. Reporters focused a great deal on Trump's proposed Muslim ban, border wall and desire to pull out of NAFTA. Many of Donald's supporters never believed he would actually follow through on these plans. They paid more attention to his promise to create 25 million new jobs in the next decade and his guarantee that the GDP will grow at least 3.5 percent per year when he's president. Ultimately, a lot of Trump supporters took a more generalized view that he is a change agent who has big plans to fix an economy that they think has left them behind. Democrats relentlessly attacked Trump for his offensive comments about women and Latinos. When they talked about the economy, it was usually more to fault him for making his products overseas and for not paying his vendors than trying to persuade voters he is actually not a very good businessman. (There was more talk about his bankruptcies during the primaries than the general.) A lot of white male voters who are living paycheck to paycheck didn't care about what Trump called ""locker room talk"" on the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" video or the dozen women who came forward to accuse him of sexual assault.    Clinton supporters watch election returns at the Javits Center last Tuesday. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)   -- Celinda Lake, the renowned Democratic pollster, is very angry that her party failed to lay out an economic vision to contrast with Trump's. During an afternoon symposium at Gallup's headquarters in downtown Washington yesterday, where dozens of experts on public opinion gathered to discuss the lessons of the election, Lake noted that Clinton's standing on questions about the economy kept slipping during the final weeks. ""Why would the Democrats stubbornly not have an economic message?"" she said. ""Sixty-seven white papers don't make an economic message. Thirty-seven bills you're going to introduce in the first 100 days do not make an economic message. What we as Democrats really have to deal with is the fact that we didn't have an economic message. ... Someone at a meeting I was just at said, 'Well, this was the biggest con ever.' Maybe. But one of the things we know in our business is that facts don't matter. If the facts don't fit the frame, people reject the facts - not the frame. ... When we sound like we have a tin ear, we end up with Donald Trump as president."" (She also argued that racism and sexism worked against Clinton.)    Barack Obama waves upon his arrival to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Chancellery in Berlin a few minutes ago. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)   Lake, who has worked for a long list of blue-chip Democratic clients, fretted that Trump will do a better job than Barack Obama at creating the sense of forward progress on the economy. She said one of her ""everlasting disappointments"" with the lame-duck president is that, ""He didn't do the Roosevelt thing. He didn't engage in an ongoing dialogue about where we are and where we're going. ... In your deafening silence, you sound like you don't get it. ... Ironically, I think Trump might do more of that."" ""If Democrats don't have something to offer on the economy, we're not going to win elections,"" she added. ""That's probably the single biggest thing we have to focus on. ... You want to know who is going to win in 2020? Look at your crystal ball, and tell me who is ahead on the economy!"" There is irony that Trump won because of concerns about the economy and a yearning for change, the same mentality that in 1992 allowed Bill Clinton beat an incumbent who voters considered more qualified and experienced. Lake recalled a focus group that she conducted for Bill when he was president. She asked a voter in Los Angeles about a line he was using in his stump speech about how many millions of jobs had been created since he took office. ""I know. I have three of them,"" the woman replied. When Lake recounted that story to the president, he began stressing that more needed to be done to create good-paying jobs. ""The candidates live in a pretty rarefied world. They don't encounter real people that much,"" she told the group of pollsters. ""We provide a lot of that function.""    Bill Clinton arrives at The New Yorker Hotel last Wednesday for his wife's concession. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- But there are real tensions within the Democratic Party about what exactly the right economic message is. Everyone agrees inequality is bad, but how do you solve it? Many coastal, technocratic Democrats support trade. But lawmakers from the Rust Belt do not. The Trans-Pacific Partnership was a top Obama priority, of course, and Clinton felt compelled to flip-flop and come out against it during the primaries. Jim Kessler and Jon Cowan, moderate Democrats who run the Third Way think tank, say that the party must emphasize more jobs, not just fairer jobs. ""The income disparity in the United States isn't about the one percent versus the other 99,"" they write in an op-ed for The Post. ""This thinking has led Democrats astray. The truth is that one-third of adults are economically secure and getting wealthier year by year. This is the upper-middle class that economist Stephen Rose found doubled in size and share of national wealth since 1979. The other two-thirds, however, are scared to death. The basic bargain of doing your part, doing your best and living a life of dignity and comfort has been shattered for these people. They don't want handouts. They want work that provides a living, a career path and a sense of purpose."" President Obama waded into the debate during a speech in Athens yesterday, arguing that ""the current path of globalization needs a course correction"" while also stressing that there is no turning back from an interconnected world. ""In the years and decades ahead, our countries have to make sure that the benefits of an integrated global economy are more broadly shared by more people, and that the negative impacts are squarely addressed,"" he said. (Juliet Eilperin filled more from Greece.)    A map showing relative vote change from 2012 to 2016 (Via Liam Donovan)   -- In 2016, the economy was especially important to the blue-collar, non-college-educated whites who handed Trump the election. He made meaningful inroads with traditionally Democratic voters who earn less than $50,000 a year, are members of unions and attended ""some"" college but did not graduate. Ten states saw a swing of five points or more toward Trump compared to Mitt Romney in 2012. Working class whites made up a plurality of the electorate in eight of these states, former Republican operative Liam Donovon notes in a blog post he self-published yesterday. On the surface, Trump only outran Romney by six points among working class white voters (67 percent to 61 percent). But Romney's gains with this group were disproportionately located in the South, while Trump's gains came in the Rust Belt. Clinton herself last weekend blamed FBI director James Comey's two letters for the late movement against her. But polls show that many of the people who broke for Trump late were primarily motivated by economic concerns. According to the exit polls, voters who made up their mind in the final week broke for Trump by just a five point margin. ""A modest advantage, though not nearly enough to swing the election,"" Donovan notes. ""But in the states where it mattered, the picture was very different. In Michigan, late deciders favored Trump by 11 points. In Pennsylvania, Trump carried them by 17 points. And in Wisconsin, a state few saw as truly in play, the fence-sitters--fully 14 percent of voters--broke for Trump nearly two to one.""    A pro-steel sign on a fence just outside the entrance to the coke plant in the battered city of Clairton, Pennsylvania. Trump crushed it in places like this. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)   -- Trump performed best in places where the recovery has been slower than the national average and where jobs are most at risk in the future. ""Places with higher unemployment rates were no more likely to vote for Trump than those with lower rates,"" economist Jed Kolko calculated for FiveThirtyEight. ""Unemployment, however, is a crude measure of a local economy. Counties with weaker job growth since 2012, for example, were more likely to support Trump; the same is true for places with lower average earnings among full-time workers. ... Trump beat Clinton in counties where more jobs are at risk because of technology or globalization. Specifically, counties with the most 'routine' jobs -- those in manufacturing, sales, clerical work and related occupations that are easier to automate or send offshore -- were far more likely to vote for Trump."" -- A forecasting model created by Yale economist Ray Fair, based on GDP growth and inflation, suggested strongly all year that the opposition party would win the November election. ""If GDP growth is robust, job creation will keep up with the population and workers will be happy. If inflation is restrained, consumers will be happy. So a combination of robust growth and restrained inflation will make voters feel happy about the economy. Happy voters will vote for the incumbent party -- and vice versa,"" Brad Schiller, an emeritus professor of economics at American University, explains in an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times. ""Simply put, Clinton lost because the economy under President Obama did not perform well enough to meet Fair's thresholds of happiness. Economic growth was anemic for nearly all of the last eight years. ... In the Fair model, GDP growth in the three calendar quarters prior to the election is critical ... And on that count, Clinton lost a lot of votes; GDP growth was a paltry 0.8% in the first quarter of this year, 1.4% in the second and 2.9% in the third."" -- Republican pollster David Winston, who advisers House and Senate Republican leaders, thinks the key indicator was really the number of voters who felt that their children will not be as well off as them. ""This was not an angry electorate; this was a frustrated electorate,"" he said during yesterday's session at Gallup.    Hillary leaves the stage after speaking last night. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)   -- Another emerging narrative: The Clinton campaign was too cocky about the strength of its data and field operations. From the Huffington Post's Sam Stein: ""In Michigan alone ... state party and local officials were running at roughly one-tenth the paid canvasser capacity that John Kerry had when he ran for president in 2004. Desperate for more human capital, the state party and local officials ended up raising $300,000 themselves to pay 500 people to help canvass in the election's closing weeks. One organizer said that in a precinct in Flint, they were sent to a burned down trailer park. No one had taken it off the list of places to visit because no one had been there until the final weekend. A similar situation unfolded in Wisconsin ... [where its] state office and local officials scrambled to raise nearly $1 million for efforts to get out the vote in the closing weeks. Brooklyn headquarters had balked at funding it themselves ... pointing out that Clinton had never trailed in a single poll in Wisconsin."" -- The 2020 presidential campaign might wind up playing out in very different swing states than 2016. Texas wound up being closer than Iowa! Georgia and Arizona were both closer than Ohio! And Minnesota was closer than Nevada. (Phil Bump made a state-by-state chart.) -- In Clinton's defense, she received somewhere around one million more votes than Trump. Democrats have now won the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections.

""There have been a few times this past week when all I wanted to do is just to curl up with a good book or our dogs and never leave the house again. The divisions laid bare by this election run deep, but please listen to me when I say this: America is worth it, our children are worth it.

From Reuters: In the hours before Trump's scheduled meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japanese officials said they had not finalized when or where in New York it would take place, who would be invited, or in some cases whom to call for answers. ""Japanese and U.S. officials said on Wednesday the State Department had not been involved in planning the meeting, leaving the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled far in advance still to be determined. 'There has been a lot of confusion,' said one Japanese official. While world leaders sometimes hold loosely planned bilateral meetings at regional summits, it is unusual for foreign leaders to hold high-level diplomatic talks in the United States without detailed planning.""    WHO'S IN THE MIX FOR THE BIG JOBS? -- The transition team announced that Trump met with several advisers and candidates for administration positions yesterday, including: Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, investor Steve Feinberg, Success Academy Charter Schools chief executive Eva Moskowitz and Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas. Communications Director Jason Miller did not elaborate on which people are candidates to join the administration. Price is considered a candidate to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Miller declined to speculate on the timing of announcements, saying that ""the president-elect is going to get this right"" and that names would be put forward ""when Trump [is] ready.""

They spend the day sitting on a row of metal benches set up across from the elevators, watching who is coming and going, interviewing possible Cabinet members and trying to keep tabs on the president-elect, who rarely leaves. There are rules of decorum: no sitting on the ground, and no putting your feet on the benches or standing on them to take a photograph. Throughout the day, there [is] a parade of men in suits who [look] important, creating a never-ending game of 'Guess Who?' for the gawking media and actual gawkers."" -- Nikki Haley, who has no foreign policy experience, is now being mentioned as a possible contender for secretary of state. The Post and Courier reports the South Carolina governor, a former Marco Rubio backer who once said Trump represented ""everything a governor doesn't want in a president,"" has a meeting at Trump Tower today. Meanwhile, South Carolina Lt. Gov Henry McMaster said he had also been in contact with the Trump transition team and has emerged as a possible choice for attorney general. -- Irony alert one: Trump ran as an outspoken critic of Common Core education standards (which he often called ""a total disaster""), but now he's considering two people who have been outspoken cheerleaders of them to run his Department of Education. Spokesman Jason Miller said during an MSNBC interview that Trump is considering Michelle Rhee and Eva Moskowitz. (Valerie Strauss) -- Irony alert two: Rudy Giuliani, a leading candidate to run the State Department, has a long record of defending and advocating for undocumented immigrants as mayor of New York City - putting him directly odds with Trump on immigration. From CNN's Andrew Kaczynski: As mayor, Giuliani even went to court to protect them from being reported to the federal government. ""Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are undocumented aliens,"" Giuliani said in 1994. ""If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair."" And in a 2001 interview: ""The city of New York, quite frankly, is quite tolerant of undocumented immigration and this shouldn't surprise you because I've been the mayor for a long time and outspoken on this issue, even nationally, I happen to agree with that.""

Clapper made the announcement during a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. (Politico) -- ""Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn was still being mentioned as national security adviser, although some with transition connections said his stock appeared to be falling as others questioned his potential effectiveness in the job,"" Karen DeYoung writes. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, mentioned as a possible CIA director, is a transition adviser but is ""not interested in a post,"" a congressional aide said. Meanwhile, former congressman and committee chairman Pete Hoekstra said he told transition team members ""he'd be more than happy"" to discuss a role if they have one for him. -- Frank Gaffney, a far-right, anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist who was described in various news reports this week as a ""Trump transition adviser"" and floated as a pick for a national security job, said he had ""not been contacted by anyone from the team.""

(Reuters/Carlo Allegri)   INSIDE TRUMP'S ORBIT -- HOW WILL HE GOVERN? -- ""As Trump assembles his White House, he is reimagining the traditional staffing chart in the mold of his personality, with a group of aides and outside confidants expected to have direct lines to the Oval Office. ""As with all things Trump, there are always people in his ear, including peers such as Carl Icahn, Andrew Beal and Tom Barrack, and casino magnates Phil Ruffin and Steve Wynn,"" Philip Rucker and Robert Costa report. ""Trump sees himself as the straw that stirs the drink,"" said Tony Schwartz, co-author of Trump's 1987 memoir, ""The Art of the Deal."" ""He has almost no interest in the details of how things happen, but he has an intense interest in being the decision-maker."" -- Rucker and Costa write that an unusual power grid is emerging in a capital city used to a hierarchical structure: ""Trump is presiding over concentric spheres of influence, designed to give him direct access to a constellation of counselors and opinions. Such an approach also risks bringing confrontation or even paralysis as feuding factions work to further their own goals, edge out adversaries or distract Trump -- as happened more than once during his presidential campaign.""    Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner walk with their daughter in midtown. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   CHOOSE YOUR NEWS: -- The Wall Street Journal's Monica Langley reports that Jared Kushner could get a critical White House role - and is mulling the prospect of being ""senior adviser"" or ""special counsel."" ""Taking a high-level government post would come at a cost. To address potential conflicts of interest with his real-estate business, which has closed some $14 billion in deals under his leadership, Mr. Kushner's lawyers are exploring options of possible 'structures.' One option would be a blind trust over which he would have no control or access. He would agree to suspend receiving any income or distribution from his real-estate and media holdings ... It isn't clear whether a federal anti-nepotism law that bans appointing a relative to a job in an 'agency' applies to the White House, and Mr. Kushner has indicated he would avoid the issue by not taking pay for any White House work."" He is also weighing the option of maintaining an ""influential role"" informally. -- The New York Times says neither Kushner nor Ivanka Trump will seek a security clearance after all. Sources in his world insist that no such request was made. Meanwhile, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway brushed aside questions on whether it was a conflict of interest for Trump's children to play a role in his transition when they will also be running his businesses. ""You're presuming that they're doing certain things that they should not be doing,"" she told reporters. And Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, asked for details on the son-in-law's exact role in a letter to Pence, per Politico. -- ""To understand the Trump presidency, we must decipher Ivanka,"" Monica Hesse writes: ""Ivanka is the fairest of them all, but she also seems like the steeliest, the kind of person who might bring a stiletto to a knife fight. ... 'What clandestine operation is Ivanka going to run?' [CNN's Dana Bash joked.] All the operations, Dana. We can't shake the feeling that Ivanka is the key to this all. The mystery of Ivanka is that she always does seem to be running some kind of clandestine mission -- blowing some kind of dog whistle or bleating some kind of Morse code, or becoming the attractive vessel into which both parties poured their own hopes and dreams. Could Ivanka be reasoned with? wondered the commenters who viewed her father as too unpredictable and were seeking reassurance. Was Ivanka the one secretly running the whole show?"" -- Very smart frame: Trump's revolution happened so suddenly that it raced ahead of itself, winning without having any of the plans and personnel that actually operationalizing Trumpism would require, Ross Douthat argues. ""Every administration tends to have ideological divisions, to rely on an old guard of party people alongside its newcomers ... But in this case, there is really no Trumpist new guard at all ... no roster of elected officials who rose to power promising to Make America Great Again, no list of policy thinkers who have spent the last decade dreaming of tariffs and mapping out Keynesian infrastructure projects and planning for a detente with Moscow. Instead, Trump campaigned surrounded by politicians, operatives and surrogates whose only real commonality was opportunism. Back when he seemed likely to lose the election handily, this was a reason to wonder about his movement's staying power -- would [Newt Gingrich, Ben Carson and Sean Hannity] really remain European-style populist nationalists once their patron was defeated? But now that he's won, it raises a different question: Can Trumpism survive a Trump administration?""    Sen. Chuck Schumer speaks to reporters after the Senate Democrat party leadership elections. (Reuters/Carlos Barria)   THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD IN THE CAPITOL: -- Chuck Schumer was unanimously elected as Senate minority leader on Wednesday, replacing outgoing Harry Reid. From Ed O'Keefe and Mike DeBonis:  Dick Durbin will serve as party whip and Schumer's chief deputy, the same position he has held under Reid. Patty Murray will be the third-ranking Democrat, forgoing a challenge to Durbin but assuming a new title of assistant Democratic leader. In a nod to his party's progressive wing, the New York senator added Bernie Sanders to a junior role in a newly expanded 10-person leadership team. (Meanwhile, Sanders said he still plans to identify as an independent.) Schumer also nodded to the moderates in his caucus by putting Joe Manchin on the 10-person team. Tammy Baldwin will be the first openly lesbian senator to hold a leadership role.  -- Republicans unanimously re-elected Mitch McConnell as majority leader. He faced no public challenges to his leadership. -- Expect heavy scrutiny for Trump's SCOTUS picks: Dianne Feinstein, who will replace Pat Leahy as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, made crystal clear that Trump's nominees will go under a microscope. ""After the unprecedented and disrespectful treatment of Merrick Garland -- a moderate judge who should have been quickly confirmed -- the committee will pay very close attention to proposed nominees to ensure the fundamental constitutional rights of Americans are protected,"" the senator said, according to Mike DeBonis. Her selection is historic: Elected in the year of the woman, which was a response to Anita Hill's poor treatment by the all-male Judiciary committee, Feinstein is the first woman to be chair or ranking member. -- A group of rebellious House Democrats is now attempting to woo Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) to challenge Nancy Pelosi for minority leader. From Politico: ""Crowley, 54, almost certainly would not be able to beat Pelosi, who claims overwhelming backing to remain in the post. But if he ran against her, it would be a blow to Pelosi, who has faced serious dissension within Democratic ranks since the party's poor showing in the election. Pelosi, 76, has not faced any real threat to her hold on power in the last half-dozen years, especially from someone like Crowley, who is widely liked and respected within the Democratic Caucus.""

""We just had a 'drain the swamp' election,"" he said. ""Let's not just turn around and bring back earmarks two weeks later."" (CNN) FILIBUSTERS: With the GOP holding just a 52-seat majority next year, it would take only two defections to stop the Senate from going totally nuclear. And at least one key Senate Republican is expressing reservations about the idea. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) yesterday came out strongly against ending the filibuster: ""Are you kidding?"" the most senior member of the GOP said with some vehemence, according to the Huffington Post. ""I'm one of the biggest advocates for the filibuster. It's the only way to protect the minority, and we've been in the minority a lot more than we've been in the majority. It's just a great, great protection for the minority.""  -- ""Intraparty fratricide looms,"" Post columnist Dana Milbank argues: ""On Wednesday afternoon, House Republicans from the hard-line Freedom Caucus assembled for the first time since the election for the monthly 'Conversations with Conservatives.' In one hour, they served up enough intra-GOP disputes to last four years. They differed with [Trump] on a massive infrastructure bill ... They split with Senate Republicans, and potentially with Trump, on whether to repeal Obamacare ... They warned Trump, and Ryan, that they would rebel against any attempt to increase spending before Trump takes office. They took positions at odds with Trump on entitlement programs and split with fellow House Republicans on returning lawmakers' ability to fund pet projects through earmarks. For eight years, they were unified in opposition to President Obama. They were lockstep in opposition to [Clinton's] candidacy. But while it's relatively easy to oppose, they're discovering it's rather more difficult to govern.""    Lindsey Graham walks around the Capitol yesterday. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)   WASHINGTON ADJUSTS TO TRUMP: -- As Trump continues to stoke concerns that he will pursue warmer relations with Putin, Republican members of Congress - including allies of the president-elect - have begun moving to ensure their tough line against Moscow will be held. From Karoun Demirjian: On Tuesday, the House passed a bill imposing mandatory sanctions on anyone who financially, economically or technologically supports Syria's government in the civil war there -- a category that chiefly includes Russia and Iran."" And Sen. Lindsey Graham promised ""a package that would help our Eastern European allies better deal with the threats they face from Russia,"" including broad defense aid ""to make it harder for Russia to advance beyond where they are today."" Graham also said he hoped to hold ""a series of hearings about Russia's misadventures throughout the world,"" focusing on propaganda in the Baltic states, aggressive behavior in Georgia and Ukraine, and Moscow's track record of cyberattacks on U.S. allies and, recently, on the United States itself. -- Tax reform tops agenda, but might not be so easy. From Kelsey Snell: ""Signs are already emerging that it could be one of the first Republican policy fights during the Trump administration with Senate Republicans advocating a more methodical and bipartisan approach than their GOP colleagues in the House. 'I don't think it can be done except in a bipartisan way,' Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) told reporters on Wednesday. Senate Republicans this week said the party needs Democratic support to help move the legislation through the upper chamber and to then, more importantly, ensure it has a chance to be a long-lasting policy, arguing President Obama's signature achievements, such as the Affordable Care Act, are now under threat of repeal because they passed without any GOP support. 'That's one lesson of the Obama administration,' said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). 'If you do things purely on the party line then its unsustainable.'"" -- AT&T officials are wondering whether Trump will actually follow through on his campaign-trail promise to ""crush"" their $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. (Wall Street Journal A1) -- Congressional Democrats, divided and ""struggling for a path from the electoral wilderness,"" are constructing an agenda to align with many of Trump's proposals that put him at odds with his own party. From the New York Times' Jennifer Steinhauer: ""Democrats ... face a profound decision after last week's stunning defeat: Make common cause where they can with Mr. Trump to try to win back the white, working-class voters he took from them, or resist at every turn, trying to rally their disparate coalition in hopes that discontent with an ineffectual new president will benefit them in 2018. [Now] on infrastructure spending, child tax credits, paid maternity leave and dismantling trade agreements, Democrats are looking for ways they can work with [Trump] and force Republican leaders to choose between their new president and their small-government, free-market principles. What is not clear is whether Mr. Trump will hew to his stated agenda or turn it over to Republican lawmakers who seek a far more traditional conservative program."" -- Joe and Jill Biden hosted Pence and his family for a get-together and lunch at the Naval Observatory, where the outgoing vice president pledged to be available to Pence ""24-7"" after leaving office. Biden, who said the two discussed foreign policy matters during their time together, also told reporters he was not worried that the incoming administration would dismantle the legacy he and Obama forged over the past eight years. ""I think there's a lot of things that were done where [people] can reach some accommodation,"" he said. ""It's a whole new world."" (Juliet Eilperin) -- Many pundits are, like Obama and Biden, convinced that Trump won't actually roll back what the administration has achieved. Frank Bruni is the latest example in today's Times: ""My hunch? If some crafty Democrat drafts legislation to keep the Affordable Care Act as is but rechristen it Trumpcare, he'll sign the bill in a nanosecond. He's a man in thrall to ego, not policy. President Obama is betting on that. He's suddenly professing faith in Trump -- or, rather, playing a fascinating mind game in which he endeavors to save his legacy by complimenting Trump into compliance."" -- Fifteen journalism groups penned an open letter to Trump after the president-elect ducked his protective press pool to dine in Midtown Manhattan with his family. ""The role of the press pool is critically important to our country, whose citizens depend on and deserve to know what the president is doing,"" the letter reads. As Dan Rather noted in a Facebook post: ""Every President in recent memory has traveled with the press pool. It is there for a reason. [Trump] is no longer a private citizen. His actions and whereabouts effect all of us. If news breaks around him or involving him, it is the public's right to know about it. That is the nature of democracy. There are certain norms about the press and the presidency that are there for a reason ... And the early signs from Trump are worrisome.""    A matryoshka doll with Trump's face is being sold by a street vendor in Kiev, Ukraine. (Roman Pilipey/EPA)   THE WORLD IS WATCHING: -- ""Ukrainians worry they're the big losers in the U.S. election,"" by Andrew Roth: ""Vitaly Sych, the editor of the Ukrainian weekly Novoye Vremya, had readied a profile for only one candidate, Hillary Clinton, to run once the results came in on what he called 'the most closely watched U.S. election by Ukrainians' of all time. Then came the bombshell that echoed all the way from the Potomac to the Dnepr. If Russia was rooting for a Trump victory on election night, it stands to reason who wasn't. 'The big loser of the election is Ukraine,' tweeted Michael McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Moscow.  But one week after the election, the truth is that nobody here in government wants to discuss the things Trump said about Ukraine. Necessity, in this case, dictates thick skin and a timely bout of amnesia, as Kiev looks to make its case to the president-elect and his Republican Party.  [And] wishful thinking aside, Ukrainian officials are looking to tamp anxiety about a Trump term. ""I am certain that his ego will drive him to show who is in charge,"" said [parliament member] Victoria Voytsitska. ""The rhetoric about Russia? I believe it was just to be different from the usual. In reality, he will start to show the muscles of the great country."" -- President Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel together delivered a rebuttal to the coming era of Trump, issuing a joint plea for more transatlantic cooperation on everything from security to climate change to the defense of a kinder, more inclusive world. From Anthony Faiola: ""On his last overseas trip as president, Obama is currently meeting with Merkel, a centrist leader who observers see as the heir apparent to his legacy as the leading global advocate of liberal democracy. Ahead of a joint appearance later Thursday, the two penned an op-ed piece recognizing the painful side of freer trade along with a sober reality check. The two leaders never mention Trump by name. But their statements appeared to serve as a point-by-point refutation of some of the president-elect's most contentious foreign policy pledges.""

Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) has never won reelection in his San Diego/Orange County district with less than 58 percent of the vote. But Issa is now leading his Democratic challenger, Doug Applegate, 51 percent to 49 percent. The San Diego Union-Tribune says Issa is ahead by 4,630 votes, but the race isn't being called until tens of thousands of provisional ballots from the Orange County area are counted. Rep. Ami Bera's (D-Calif.) 83-year-old father was sentenced to a year in jail just three months before the election for illegally funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to his son's congressional campaigns. But the congressman's Republican challenger, Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones, had his own legal troubles when a deputy accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Bera leads Jones by just 2,583 votes out of more than 205,000 cast. Officials are trying to count 195,000 outstanding ballots. Republicans are confident enough that Jones in at new-member orientation in Washington this week. On election night, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) declared victory in one of the most hotly contested races of 2016. But Gov. Pat McCrory (R) isn't giving up. He is waiting on thousands of provisional ballots to be counted, and his team is suggesting there may have been mistakes -- even voter fraud -- in a key Democratic county. -- Martin O'Malley dropped out of the race for DNC chair, as Elizabeth Warren threw her support behind Rep.

In September, auditors reported that the comptroller's office sent $8.7 million to the wrong Montgomery County municipalities. But media outlets report that Comptroller Peter Franchot told lawmakers Wednesday that his office found another $12.7 million has been misdirected since 2010 and the problem affects nearly every municipality in the state. In coming days, 89 cities will receive checks, some totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Another 83 cities must repay money they received in error. The comptroller's office collects taxes for towns and cities, but some taxpayers were classified in the wrong taxing districts. The comptroller's office is working to fix the problem with its tax-processing software. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Rowling's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them,"" set in the wizarding world and starring Eddie Redmayne. (Warner Bros. Pictures)   Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (Pg-13) Age 12+ Delightful but dark Potter prequel is more grown-up. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a prequel to the Harry Potter movies. Based on J.K. Rowling's original story, it takes place in 1920s New York City and follows Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a magizoologist and author of a Hogwarts textbook that catalogs magical creatures. As per usual in the Potter saga, you can expect plenty of fantasy violence, some of which ends in deaths (a couple are pretty gruesome). There's also mass destruction, although the property destroyed is magically fixed, and the minds of the No-Maj (""no magic"") folks are always erased. Wizards engage in wand battles, two wizards are sentenced to death and nearly killed, and an out-of-control form of magic nearly destroys whole swaths of Manhattan. A character's mother beats him with a belt (welts, cuts are shown on his hands). One scene takes place in a speakeasy, where adult characters order drinks, and there's a bit of light romance between couples that ends in goodbye kisses, longing looks and brief caresses. Unlike the original Harry Potter movies, the main characters here are adults, and the story is much more of a grown-up suspense/thriller than a kid-centric adventure. But themes and messages include curiosity, compassion and courage, and the main characters are all strong role models. (133 minutes) A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving (g) Streaming/DVD Age 4+ Classic Turkey Day special for young and old. ""A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving"" is an annual favorite in many families. While the story promotes friendship, generosity and gratitude, there are some comic pratfalls. (Watch out for that football, Charlie Brown!) And some characters (especially Lucy) use the words ""stupid"" and ""blockhead,"" which could be problematic for parents of younger kids who like to mimic everything they hear. On DVD (and ABC's Wednesday broadcast), the more well-known classic is usually paired with ""The Mayflower Voyagers,"" a 1988 Peanuts special that offers a more-or-less factual account of the Mayflower voyage. It doesn't sugarcoat the death and sickness that many of the Pilgrims faced. Also, Pilgrims are shown with muskets, and Native Americans are shown with spears. (60 minutes)  Via Amazon Video and iTunes. Also on ABC on Wednesday at 8 p.m.      Ben Whishaw voices the titular orphan bear in ""Paddington."" (The Weinstein Company)  Paddington (Pg) Streaming Age 6+ Charming story about beloved bear has some scares. ""Paddington"" is based on the classic children's book by Michael Bond, ""A Bear Called Paddington."" After an earthquake destroys Paddington's home and kills his uncle, the orphan bear (voiced by Ben Whishaw) stows away alone on a ship with only his red hat, beat-up suitcase and jars of marmalade with him in the hopes that someone will help him once he gets to London. The idea of him taking the journey on his own might worry some children, but he's quickly taken in by the Brown family. Paddington gets into some dangerous mischief -- which might delight some kids and scare/upset others -- including flooding a bathroom, chasing a pickpocket, fleeing a fire and eventually being kidnapped by a cruel, cold taxidermist (Nicole Kidman), who wields a dart gun and sharp implements. The Browns' aunt helps rescue Paddington by doing shots of whisky with a security guard until they're both drunk, and there's a gross-out scene in which Paddington cleans out his ears. Expect some flirting, a passionate kiss between the Browns, and language along the lines of ""good lord"" and ""shut your pie hole."" But Paddington is very sweet, polite and good intentioned, and the Brown family is adorably imperfect. ""Paddington"" is charming in many ways and touching in others. (95 minutes)  Via Netflix streaming, Amazon Video, iTunes, YouTube and Google Play.        The life of high school junior Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) becomes even more awkward when her all-star older brother Darian (Blake Jenner) starts dating her best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson). (STX Films)    The Edge of Seventeen (R) Age 16+ Excellent acting in poignant, mature coming-of-age story. ""The Edge of Seventeen"" is a high school dramedy about an awkward teen (Hailee Steinfeld). The swearing, sexuality and themes make it appropriate for mature high schoolers and up. Frequently used language includes ""f---,"" ""s---,"" ""ass,"" ""d---head"" and more, and the sexual content includes a social media message that lists out graphic things the main character would like to do with -- and to -- her crush. There are also a couple of scenes of teens making out and in bed. One scene briefly appears to border on nonconsensual sex: A girl asks whether a guy wants to have sex, then says she was kidding when he takes her seriously. Teens drink alcohol at parties and at home (no adults are present), sometimes to the point of throwing up. The main character lost her father four years before the movie's events take place. Despite the strong language and underage substance use, the movie actually encourages communication and could open the door for thought-provoking discussions between parents and teens.

Welcome to what locals are now calling Putinovo (Putin's Village in Serbian). The tiny settlement of about a dozen houses -- called Adzince for centuries -- is scattered among the dense greenery 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Belgrade. Villagers made their decision about two weeks ago at an inn over shots of local plum brandy.  ""Putin is an excellent statesman,"" said Milutin Petrusic, a 67-year-old resident. ""Putin is doing a lot for our people ... we believe he deserves this."" The name Adzince is of Turkish origin and is no longer suitable, Petrusic declared. The move reflects a widespread mood in Serbia, where many view Putin as a hero and Russia as an ally and a friend. The two Slavic nations have traditionally close ties and share common Orthodox Christian religion. Although Serbia's government wants to join the European Union, many Serbs actually admire Putin for what they view as his resistance to U.S. and Western global domination. Many also feel the West backed Serbia's enemies during the 1990s Balkan wars, when the country was bombed by NATO to stop the fighting in Kosovo. In Adzince -- close to the Serbian border with Kosovo -- locals are thankful that Russia has sided with Serbia in its rejection of the former Serbian province's 2008 declaration of independence.  ""Putin always defends Serbs and Serbia,"" said Malisa Petrusic, a 63-year-old relative. ""We wanted to thank him."" And so they did. A wooden sign pointing the way to the village up a dirt road already reads ""Putinovo,"" even though the name change still has not been formally approved by municipal authorities. Locally-produced fruit brandy has also been dubbed ""Putinovka."" Villager Goran Radosavljevic wore a T-shirt with the Russian president's image as he proudly showed wooden barrels filled with ""Putinovka."" The Petrusic cousins say almost the entire village has supported the name change, which they hope will attract visitors and revive the area's muddy isolation. Half-empty during the winter, Adzince resembles other remote rural areas in the Balkan country, worn out and impoverished during the decades of crisis that followed the Balkan wars. Once a self-sustaining hamlet, Adzince was rich in cattle and agriculture. Now it is home mostly to elderly people who survive on meager pensions with a few goats and pigs, their houses crumbling for lack of care. Villagers still have to submit a formal request to rename Adzince to the local council, but they say that takes money they don't have.  ""This is Putinovo and will remain Putinovo,"" Malisa Petrusic said. ""So be it."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Trump's attorneys said he will be too busy with the presidential transition to participate in the Nov. 28 trial involving his defunct real estate seminar program, Trump University. They asked that the trial be postponed until February or March, after he has taken office. They made their request before Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the jurist Trump harshly criticized during the campaign as biased because of his Mexican heritage. Curiel expressed concern about the wisdom of a delay given that Trump will assume the presidency Jan. 20. Curiel said he will probably issue a ruling by Monday. The hearing came just two days after Trump's victory, reflecting the continuing legal challenges facing an incoming president whose businesses are the subject of multiple pending civil suits.      ""My job was to sell, sell sell,"" says former Trump University instructor James Harris, who explains the inner workings of the company, detailing high pressure sales tactics and the battle for profit. (Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)   ""We're in uncharted territory,"" Trump attorney Daniel Petrocelli told Curiel, noting that never before has a U.S. president or president-elect come to court under similar circumstances. Later, Petrocelli told reporters that holding a trial during Trump's presidency would be better than during the intensive transition period. He called the case a ""very difficult circumstance for a sitting president -- more so, I would say, for a president-elect, because he's turning, right now as we speak, to a mountain of challenges in front of him, to get himself up to speed."" The California Trump University case is one of two class-action fraud suits filed by former customers of the real estate seminar program. The former customers say they were misled by advertisements promising that Trump had hand-picked instructors for the program and that they would learn Trump's personal tricks for real estate success.   [Donald Trump said 'university' was all about education. Actually, its goal was: 'Sell, sell, sell!']   Trump has said in depositions that he did not choose the instructors, many of whose names and faces he could not recall.         1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flared up across the country as opponents of President-elect Donald Trump expressed dismay with the election results, underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting a fractured country.

Nov. 16, 2016  People march in Los Angeles to protest the appointment of former Breitbart News head Steve Bannon as White House chief strategist. David Mcnew/AFP/Getty Images  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        Trump has said most customers were satisfied with the experience, citing positive customer surveys submitted by seminar attendees. His attorneys have predicted that he will prevail in court.  Trump University became an issue in the campaign when Trump's rivals in the Republican primary and later Democrat Hillary Clinton cited it in attacking Trump as a scam artist. Trump vehemently defended the business during campaign rallies. His attack on Curiel became a symbol of his tendency to lash out at people, and it drew sharp criticism, including from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who termed the allegation the ""textbook definition of a racist comment."" Trump also said during the campaign that he looked forward to the trial. ""They ought to look into Judge Curiel, because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace,"" Trump had told supporters at a rally in San Diego in May. ""Okay? But we will come back in November. Wouldn't that be wild if I am president and come back and do a civil case?""  [Trump's personal, racially tinged attacks on federal judge alarm legal experts]  From the bench Thursday, Curiel appeared unruffled by the unusual nature of the hearing, patiently engaging with both sides and referring to Trump respectfully as ""the president-elect.""  Curiel proposed potentially having Trump testify by video to make the trial easier on him, but also urged that he settle with former students suing over the real estate seminars. Though Trump has boasted that he never settles lawsuits, Petrocelli, an attorney for Trump, expressed interest: ""I can tell you right now: I am all ears, your honor,"" he said. Petrocelli told reporters later that a trial risked further inflaming post-election tensions in the country. ""This has been a gut-wrenching campaign, as everybody knows, and the nation is just beginning the long healing process,"" he said. ""And I think the last thing we need right now is to have a trial about events that occurred six years ago or seven years ago, in which Mr. Trump -- President-elect Trump -- is a personal defendant in matters completely unrelated to the momentous obligations that he now needs to deal with."" Also Thursday, Curiel rejected a request by Trump's attorneys to prohibit the jury from hearing about Trump's campaign-trail comments, including his attacks on the judge. Curiel called the request vague but said he might bar specific testimony at trial. Trump's attorneys argued that his campaign speeches, tweets and other public statements were ""irrelevant"" and ""highly prejudicial."" They also asked Curiel to exclude discussion of other negative topics that came out during the campaign -- including allegations about his ""personal conduct,"" and information about how Trump ran his personal charity, the Trump Foundation. A president is not shielded from civil litigation for actions taken before he took office or unrelated to his presidential duties, a precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1997 in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit filed against then-President Bill Clinton. Clinton was required to sit for a deposition in the matter but he settled with Jones before the case reached trial. But the court also said a trial judge, in scheduling, may show some deference to a president's demanding schedule and the burdens of the office, said Duquesne University President Ken Gormley, who wrote a book on the Clinton case. Gormley said there were few historical parallels for Trump's legal entanglements because no president has been so immersed in the world of business before his election. ""You just have to start from the proposition that he's like any other citizen for this purpose,"" Gormley said. ""People have claims against him, and those preexist him being in office. There seems to be no question they can proceed."" Among other suits, Trump faces litigation in connection to celebrity chef Jose Andres, who halted plans to open a restaurant at Trump's new hotel in Washington over the Republican's claim that many Mexican immigrants are criminals and rapists. Trump University also faces a separate action in New York filed by state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. A court of appeals in New York ruled in March that the case could proceed, but Trump's attorneys have appealed the ruling. Trump has said he will win in court and then restart the program, which has not been in operation since 2010.  "
