Among other things, investigators found that former CFO Patrick Miller used taxpayer money to make payments of more than $20,000 and $32,000 to the Indian River Volunteer Fire Company and to a local Boys and Girls Club while he served as board president of those organizations. Auditors also found that Miller requested state accounting system login information from his subordinates so he could begin financial transactions using their credentials and then approve those transactions using his own credentials. Most of the money paid to the fire company was for an all-terrain vehicle used by the Sussex Central High School athletics department. Investigators said Miller purchased the vehicle on behalf of the fire company and sold it to the district for $4,565 more than the fire company paid. Money given to the Boys and Girls Club involved funds from a federal grant intended for special education and related services for children with disabilities. Auditors also found inappropriate or questionable purchases of gifts and food, and a lack of documentation to account for employee salaries. The report covered the period from July 2011 to June of this year.  ""For the entire period of our investigation, the district lacked formal policies and procedures for any of their financial processes. Not only did the district lack appropriate oversight and internal controls to prevent and detect financial improprieties, the blind faith placed in the CFO allowed him to create an environment ripe with intimidation tactics, favoritism, and nepotism,"" the report said. Miller was put on paid administrative leave in April. He subsequently resigned effective June 30. Miller previously served as business manager for the Brandywine School District in New Castle County. He resigned from that position in 1998 and later pleaded no contest to tampering with public records. Indian River officials have not disclosed what led to the state audit or Miller's resignation. They scheduled a news conference Friday to respond to the report.  ""The Indian River School District has submitted its response to the state auditor's preliminary findings but has not yet reviewed the auditor's final report or Mr. Wagner's remarks concerning the special investigation,"" district superintendent Susan Bunting said in an emailed statement Thursday. In a written response included in the audit report, district officials said they have hired an experienced and ""well-reputed"" director of business. They also said they are closely examining all spending and will ensure that funds are ""more prudently expended"" in the future. The audit report was released as Indian River district residents prepare to vote Tuesday in a referendum in which the district seeks a tax increase of 49 cents per $100 of assessed property value to raise an additional $7.35 million in local revenue.

But experts say the footage from a squad car camera was probably a bigger factor in prosecutors' decision to charge the officer with manslaughter. And that footage, which has not been made public, is still no guarantee that Jeronimo Yanez will be convicted, as other police shootings have shown.  ""There have been cases that had video that resulted in either an acquittal or a hung jury, so sometimes the video may raise more questions,"" said Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University who tracks fatal police shootings. ""It's very hard to convict in these cases."" Since the beginning of 2005, a total of 78 officers in the U.S. have been charged with murder or manslaughter. Of that number, about a third of the defendants were convicted -- 14 by juries and 13 through guilty pleas, Stinson said. Of the 18 police officers charged with murder or manslaughter last year, at least 11 cases involved video evidence, he said. Some of those cases are still pending, including the one against Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke, who was charged last year with first-degree murder in the 2014 killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Van Dyke was charged the same day the city, under judge's orders, released dashcam video that showed he shot the teen 16 times. Video does not always lead to a conviction. The trial of Ray Tensing, who was charged with murder in the 2015 death of Sam Dubose near the University of Cincinnati campus, ended with a deadlocked jury and a mistrial, despite video from Tensing's body camera. In the Minnesota case, Yanez was charged Wednesday with second-degree manslaughter, which carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence, and other counts. Prosecutors say he shot the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker seven times in July after Castile told him he was armed and had a license to carry. Prosecutors concluded that the situation did not call for deadly force. They said the charges were based on evidence that included squad car video and conflicting statements from Yanez. Yanez turned himself in Thursday, was processed and released. He is expected to make his first court appearance Friday. One of his attorneys, Earl Gray, said he had not read the charges but ""we weren't hired to plead guilty. We were hired to go to trial."" Another defense attorney, Tom Kelly, has previously said Yanez reacted to the presence of a gun. Some of the video shot by Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, could be relevant because it might provide context or back up witness statements, said Jeff Cramer, a former federal prosecutor and managing director of the Berkeley Research Group in Chicago. But Cramer predicted the dashcam video will be more revealing.  ""Video does give prosecutors the ability to bring stronger cases, and it gives jurors the ability to see what happened,"" Cramer said. Based on information that's been publicly released about the case, Cramer said, it seems Yanez would be hard-pressed to articulate a reason for drawing his weapon and firing. He noted that Yanez gave different statements on the night of the shooting than he did to investigators later.  ""The officer didn't wake up that day saying, ""I'm going to kill somebody,'"" Cramer said. ""This is just a tragic incident ... but this one could have been avoidable. I'm not sure what else Philando Castile could have done."" Lee Berlin, a criminal defense attorney in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and a former state prosecutor, said the video provides important context for the jury, and the combination of video with witness testimony is powerful. Still, he said, these cases are tough.  ""I would much rather defend this case than prosecute it,"" he said, adding that the video streamed by Reynolds showed an officer who was clearly distraught but maintained a position of authority.  ""It all comes down to what that officer saw at a particular time"" and whether ""a reasonable officer"" would have done the same thing, Berlin said. He said a defense attorney would need only to plant a reasonable doubt with jurors and to show that Yanez was afraid. The multiple shots fired by Yanez show the ""real palpable fear and concern he must've had,"" according to Berlin. That said, when Castile told Yanez he had a permit to carry a weapon, that should have been a signal that Castile was not a felon, Berlin added. But if Castile made any move that was not authorized by Yanez, it would be tough to find fault with Yanez's actions.  ""I have no idea,"" Berlin said, ""what he actually saw in those brief moments."" ___ Follow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti .

State Rep. Jason Spencer came under fire from the American Civil Liberties Union and Muslim advocacy groups who called his proposal a veiled attempt to ban Muslim women from wearing scarves and other religious headgear that covers their faces in public -- just as the law has prohibited Klan members from wearing masks during rallies and marches on public property.  ""It is a naked and despicable attempt to exploit the current wave of anti-Muslim sentiment by targeting Muslim women,"" Heather Weaver, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said Thursday. Spencer said the bill he introduced for next year's session of the Georgia Legislature would simply be ""adding clarity"" to a law passed decades ago to safeguard against what he called ""threats from masked terrorists."" And he insisted he wasn't targeting any specific group. But by Thursday evening Spencer announced in a statement posted on the Georgia House website that he was withdrawing his proposal ""due to the visceral reaction it has created."" He confirmed the decision in an email to The Associated Press.  ""While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created,"" Spencer's statement said. ""My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety."" One thing neither side mentioned amid the controversy: Georgia's highest court has narrowly interpreted the 1951 law to apply only when one wears a mask to intimidate others. Spencer's bill made no mention of Islam or religious garments, but it clearly took aim at women. Although the existing law states that a person commits a misdemeanor ""when he wears a mask"" or other face-hiding garment on public property, Spencer's version would amend it to read ""he or she."" The proposal also would have banned people from wearing anything that conceals their faces in photographs used for Georgia driver's licenses and other official state IDs -- something the Georgia Department of Driver Services already prohibits.  ""It makes it clear the law is targeted at people of faith, especially women who wear face veils,"" said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, executive director of the Georgia chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations. ""This is a slap in the face of Georgia Muslims."" Aisha Yaqoob, executive director of the Georgia Muslim Voter Project, said the lawmaker's proposal came at a frightening time considering ""the rhetoric we saw during the election season."" Known as the ""Anti-Mask Act,"" the original law was approved 65 years ago when masked Klansmen used threats and violence to intimidate blacks and other minority groups in Georgia. Supporters of the law argued masked hoods allowed Klan members to terrorize in anonymity. Victims of Klan violence could rarely identify their attackers for prosecution. That law has never been used to stop people from covering their heads or faces for religious reasons. And it doesn't look like that would have been allowed even if Spencer's bill became law. In 1990, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected a suing Klan member's argument that the anti-mask law ""criminalizes a substantial amount of innocent behavior"" such as wearing a ski mask in the winter or wearing sunglasses. In upholding the anti-mask law, Georgia's high court ruled it applied ""only to mask-wearing conduct"" that ""provokes a reasonable apprehension of intimidation, threats or violence."" Under the court's narrow interpretation, the lawmaker's proposed changes wouldn't apply to Muslim women ""because they're not wearing their gear to intimidate anybody,"" said Michael Perry, a law professor at Emory University who specializes in constitutional law and religion.  ""The only effect there of adding 'she' is it makes clear what was already known -- that the law applies to female Klan members as well as male Klan members,"" Perry said. Spencer's proposal to prohibit face-covering garb in driver's license photos was essentially redundant. The Georgia Department of Driver Services allows people to wear religious headgear in their photos -- but its rules say any headscarves or other coverings must be adjusted to make the entire face visible.

A lack of affordable housing and growing problems with opioid addiction are fueling the problem in many cities in the West, experts said Thursday.  ""There's so much that we can be proud of out there in terms of progress,"" said Julian Castro, secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in a conference call about the department's report Thursday. But on a recent cold night in Washington D.C., Castro counted 10 people who spent the night on park benches outside, and he said there are similar scenes in every community across the country.  ""Men and women like them aren't just visible reminders of public policy challenges,"" Castro said. ""They're human beings who deserve a permanent home to call their own."" In Hawaii, where homelessness has been increasing, Gov. David Ige's administration has used money made available after Ige declared a state of emergency to accelerate the development of affordable housing and shelters. Honolulu banned sitting and lying down on sidewalks in parts of the city including the tourist hotspot Waikiki, and Hawaii is investing time to ensure that along with enforcing bans and developing housing, there are integrated services, said Scott Morishige, Ige's homelessness coordinator.  ""It's not enough to just do enforcement actions on public lands without services to help people get connected to shelter or to longer term housing,"" Morishige said. ""You don't want to just move people from one area to another."" Across the country, there were nearly 550,000 homeless people counted in 2016, according to the report. Homelessness declined 14 percent nationwide since 2010, the year President Barack Obama launched Opening Doors, a program urging communities to have a plan in place to prevent and reduce homelessness. During that time, veteran homelessness fell 47 percent. Officials hope communities apply what they've learned helping veterans to other groups with high rates of homelessness. New York City had the highest number of homeless people, followed by Los Angeles, Seattle and San Diego, according to the report. San Francisco, San Jose and Las Vegas also were high on the list.  ""We have seen spikes in unsheltered homelessness along the West Coast,"" Castro said.  ""Part of it is related to rental affordability,"" Castro added, speaking about Los Angeles. ""We have seen rents spike significantly."" The federal government released the numbers after volunteers across the country counted homeless people in their local areas. The volunteers fanned out across communities in January, interviewing people they found living outside, on the street, in shelters or in transitional housing. Some advocates for the homeless feel the volunteer-run count underestimates the total, because many homeless people aren't reached or they don't want to admit to being homeless.

Alito Jr. on Thursday said free speech and religious liberty hang in the balance at the Supreme Court and warned of other issues along the ""constitutional fault lines"" that might confront the divided justices. A little more than a week ago, it seemed those issues would come before a court with a liberal majority for the first time in nearly half a century. Instead, the election of Donald Trump is likely to mean a restoration of the conservative majority that prevailed before the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February.  [Trump victory has enormous consequences for Supreme Court]   In a speech before the conservative Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention, Alito did not mention the election or the vacancy on the court. But he listed the issues that concern him, including gun rights and alleged overreach by government agencies, and said they should be answered with this thought in mind: ""What would Scalia do?"" That is pretty much the theme of the three-day conference that opened Thursday. Scalia was an early supporter of the Federalist Society, which supports a conservative view of the Constitution and has been an active participant in advising Republican presidents on filling the federal judiciary. The society, along with the Heritage Foundation, helped produce a list of potential nominees from which Trump says he will make his Supreme Court choice. Nine of the 21 people on the list have been participating in the conference.  The mood was jovial. An organization that has been on defense for the past eight years -- a home to those mounting legal challenges to President Obama's policies -- is ready to play offense again. Alito steered clear of any direct mention of that. But he noted that some of the issues that most concerned him were decided by 5-to-4 majorities and said the ""constitutional fault lines"" were dangerous places. ""Sometimes the earth starts to tremor and people get worried about what's coming,"" Alito said. In District of Columbia v. Heller, for instance, the court decided in 2008 that ""the Second Amendment actually means what it says,"" Alito said, and protects an individual right to own a firearm for self-defense. But Justice Stephen G. Breyer's dissent in the case ""provides a road map for denaturing Heller without actually overruling it,"" Alito said. Likewise, Alito said he was alarmed that more than 40 senators were willing to amend the Constitution to overturn the court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, which held that restrictions on corporate and union political spending violated free-speech rights. ""What would that amendment do?"" Alito said. ""It would have the effect of granting greater free-speech rights to an elite group -- those who control the media -- than to everybody else."" Religious freedoms, Alito said, are ""in even greater danger."" Quoting ""the latest recipient of the Nobel Prize for literature,"" Bob Dylan, Alito said, ""It's not dark yet, but its getting there."" Alito objected to the court's decision in June not to review a requirement in the state of Washington that pharmacies dispense emergency contraceptives to women. It was challenged by pharmacists who said that they considered some of the drugs to be tantamount to abortion and that dispensing them violated their religious beliefs.  [Supreme Court won't hear challenge from pharmacists over contraception]  Alito said he missed Scalia in ways that transcend the court's jurisprudence. In the court's arguments and conferences since February, Alito said, ""there has been a palpable emptiness in the room. Something vital is obviously missing."" After speaking to the Federalist Society chapter at Columbia University, Alito said, he was given a T-shirt that read ""WWSD,"" a play on the popular Christian slogan ""What would Jesus do? ""At the time, it struck me as slightly sacrilegious,"" Alito said, adding, ""Now the question is real."" "

The regent in question, media mogul Norman J. Pattiz, sat silently and voted in favor of the new standards, which were unanimously approved Thursday during a two-day UC Board of Regents meeting in San Francisco.  ""Pervert!"" shouted out one heckler from the public gallery, when Pattiz spoke on an unrelated subject. Under the new policy, all regents are now required to take the university's training program in sexual harassment prevention, as do employees at UC's 10 campuses. Regents can also now face sanctions if they violate the university's sexual harassment or ethical conduct codes -- in their public as well as private lives. It was not yet clear if Pattiz could face disciplinary measures retroactively for a violation of the new sexual harassment policy, said UC spokesman Ricardo Vazquez. Pattiz is the founder of America's largest radio network, Westwood One, and CEO of Courtside Entertainment Group, which produces radio shows and podcasts. In May, he entered a Los Angeles studio where comedian Heather McDonald was taping a podcast commercial for a memory-foam bra. She flubbed some of her lines, and Pattiz asked: ""Can I hold your breasts? Would that help?"" and showed his hands, saying, ""These are memory foam."" McDonald went public with the recording last month, prompting outrage and calls for the Board of Regents to take action. Pattiz told the Los Angeles Times that he ""deeply regrets"" the comments. At the time, the Board of Regents chairwoman Monica Lozano issued a statement calling Pattiz' actions ""inappropriate and highly offensive"" but said the board's policies did not specifically address the behavior of members while they're not engaged in university business.  ""I intend to bring forward new policies that will remedy this,"" Lozano said in her statement last month, adding that the board could not tolerate behavior that violates the university's ethical policies. Pattiz was not immediately available for comment, but on Wednesday publicly stated that he had already begun the sexual harassment training program, Vazquez said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016   Sure, the president-elect reflexively dismissed the protests as small, but the response is otherwise the sort of graciousness that one expects of the person next in line to lead the country: We may disagree, but we respect each other's position. As his fourth tweet since winning the presidency and as his first tweet addressing the tensions that the election prompted, Trump's words suggest a possible shift in how he will now deal with his opponents. The only problem is that his third tweet since winning the presidency suggested precisely the opposite. Nine hours earlier, Trump tweeted this.   Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016   It's hard to reconcile those two statements. The latter of the two above is the more important one. It was Trump's first-pass response to the anger in the streets at the base of Trump Tower. It was an example of what Trump's detractors feared they would see from him in the White House: an aggressive, misleading response to something that could be better handled with caution and empathy. How do we know it could be better handled in that way? Because in the light of the new day on Friday, Trump himself -- or whoever is powering @realdonaldtrump at any given moment -- tacitly acknowledged it could have been handled better by issuing the new tweet. It's important to note that the earlier tweet was both factually inaccurate and bafflingly incendiary. There's this long-standing idea that Democrats pay people to protest, an idea reinforced this year by a heavily edited video from James O'Keefe in which individuals discuss sending agitators to Trump rallies. When Trump argued that Democrats were paying people to cause disturbances at his rallies, PolitiFact rejected the idea.      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump echoed allegations that surfaced in an undercover video released by conservative activist James O'Keefe's group Project Veritas Action, during a rally on Oct. 18. He said that, ""the Democratic National Committee is sending protesters in here, paying 'em $1500."" (The Washington Post)   I observed the first Trump Tower protest on Wednesday evening as part of The Post's coverage. There were thousands of people crowding Fifth Avenue from 54th to 57th streets. Most were young people, heavily women and people of color. I can't say specifically that no one in the crowd was being paid to protest, but anyone making such an investment would have been wasting money. What brought them into the streets was alarm at Trump's stated positions on immigration and refugees, as well as his comments about sexually assaulting women. There are any number of reasons that tens of millions of people voted against Trump. If 1 percent of those people were so mad that he won that they'd take two hours to protest, that's a crowd of 600,000, protesting for free. It's worth remembering that, in the wake of the 2012 election, Trump called for protests in the streets, since he was under the incorrect assumption that Mitt Romney lost the electoral college vote despite winning the popular vote. ""The phoney [sic] electoral college made a laughing stock out of our nation,"" he wrote in a series of tweets. ""The loser [won]! We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!"" Romney actually lost both votes; that split between winning the popular vote but losing the electoral one instead applies to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. (I would also add that hiring people to show up for a political event is a charge that was leveled at Trump himself after his campaign kickoff. A firm he'd worked with in the past solicited actors to show up and wear shirts in support of his candidacy for a flat $50 in compensation.) Perhaps more alarming than dismissing the protests as manufactured outrage was Trump's transition of the blame onto the media. Trump has run from the outset as an antagonist to the media, blacklisting outlets (including The Post) and threatening both lawsuits and a loosening of libel laws to exact revenge for coverage he doesn't like. He successfully leveraged skepticism of the work of the media to sow doubt about the revelations that were made about his history and intentions. Within the 140-character constraints of Twitter, it's not clear how he sees media ""incitement"" working, but, coupled with his hesitance to embrace the standard media pool that is meant to detail what the president is doing, it suggests that Trump will continue to leverage anti-media hostility while in the White House. Trump's behavior over the course of the campaign has indicated a disinterest in the self-constraining norms that have been a feature of American politics for decades. If Trump continues to undermine past practice in ways that put the democracy at significant risk, the media plays an important role in holding him accountable. That Trump is apparently continuing to try to undermine the media makes that more difficult. If the public is asked to pick between siding with Trump or siding with the news media on an issue of historic import, whom will it pick? Even setting all of that aside, it's stunningly petty for a person who was literally just elected president of the United States to call protests in several cities ""unfair."" You're about to become the most powerful person in the world. That is not a position that engenders blanket acquiescence. It is no longer the time to opine on Twitter with every petty thought that comes to mind. Trump may not have changed, as that first tweet makes clear, but Trump's place within the world has. Someone close to him needs to recognize that. Well, again, someone clearly did. That second tweet is so jarringly at odds with the first that it's clear that some ally impressed upon him the importance of refining his words. I'm not in the habit of offering advice to presidents, but I will here. What the protesters in the streets worry about, Mr. Trump, is that you will be the president you told your supporters you would be, without moderation. Telling the protesters to go away and telling your base that the protesters are insincere will not resolve their concerns and frustration. Demonstrating that you appreciate those concerns as valid to whatever extent you can is an important first step. So, at the very least, delete that contradictory first tweet? At the very least."

What might he have made of Donald Trump's rise to the Republican nomination, and the Republican Party's capitulation to a candidate who appeared to have no real investment in its stated values or the maintenance of its congressional majorities? How sharply would he have captured Trump's use of dog whistles and his son's flirtations with white nationalism? But as we went through Block's archives with the help of the Herb Block Foundation -- which was kind enough to allow us to reprint these cartoons, some of which predate Block's 55-year tenure at The Post -- we realized that, over decades of puncturing homegrown demagoguery, Block had shown us exactly how he would have handled the 2016 race. Whether he was skewering Father Charles Coughlin's tendencies toward fascism, drawing the Republican elephant run ragged by Sen. Joseph McCarthy, or savagely mocking the gauzy nostalgia in Bob Dole's speech accepting the 1996 Republican nomination for president, we know exactly what Block would have made of Trump's claims that ""I alone can fix it,"" and his push to ""make America great again."" And we didn't even really have to guess how Block, who died in 2001, might have drawn Trump. That's because on a number of occasions, he did. April 18, 1935: ""The Crown Jewels"" Always suspicious of messianic figures, Block described legendary Louisiana politician Huey Long as the more subtle of ""a couple of pretty reckless demagogues,"" when compared to Coughlin, known as the ""Radio Priest"" for his broadcasts that drew millions of listeners. In this cartoon, Block implied that Long was using his populist redistribution program Share Our Wealth, which he presented under the slogan ""Every Man a King,"" to consolidate his personal power in the state. Trump's run for president has spurred new considerations of populism as a force in American political life. -Alyssa Rosenberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  August 25, 1936: ""Father Knows Best"" Father Coughlin originally supported President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, but eventually turned against it, launching the National Union for Social Justice, which called for among other things, extensive monetary reforms, nationalization of certain resources and a living wage. Here, Block expressed his concerns about the concentration of power in a single individual, ideas that are newly relevant today as Republicans grapple with who will claim ownership of their party after Election Day. -Alyssa Rosenberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  October 7, 1936: ""The Spoken Word"" In his memoir, Block wrote that Coughlin ""seemed to preach a kind of home-grown fascism laced with antisemitism [and] was virulent in his attacks on the Roosevelt administration."" In a 1936 speech in Cincinnati that has chilling echoes in calls to take up arms if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, Coughlin declared: ""When the time comes in 1940 when there is only one party and a dictatorship, I shall be the one to ask you to put aside your ballots and use bullets. . . . God's philosophy was to increase and multiply. Roosevelt's is decrease and destroy. Therefore I call him anti-God and a radical."" -Alyssa Rosenberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  March 29, 1950: ""You Mean I'm Supposed To Stand On That?""    (The Herb Block Foundation)  In this cartoon, Block coined the term ""McCarthyism"" to refer to a national hysteria about the spread of communism, and the way it was stoked by politicians, most notably Wisconsin Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy, for political gain. All that would be necessary to update this cartoon for contemporary events, and for the Republican Party's current teetering on a precarious ideology, would be to switch out the politicians, and to change the label on the barrel to ""Trumpism."" -Alyssa Rosenberg April 22, 1950: ""Stop Ganging Up On Me!"" Sometimes, the demagogue's worst enemy is his own words. Here, Block shows McCarthy trailed by earlier versions of himself holding signs containing a variety of promises and absurd factual statements, such as the constantly shifting number of communists he alleged had infiltrated the State Department, that he made during his ugly rise. Like when Trump attacks the press for calling him on his brazen lies, such as his claim that he never favored the Iraq War, McCarthy's reaction is to deny or take offense. To those who play on fears and encourage hysteria, a recitation of simple facts can be humiliating. -Stephen Stromberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  September 12, 1952: ""Nothing Exceeds Like Excess"" Though he had stoked controversy for years, McCarthy in September 1952 was on his way to reelection in the Republican bastion of Wisconsin. Block skewers the hypocrisy of McCarthy voters who claimed to ""believe in decency,"" yet, when they had a chance to back up their stated beliefs with actions, instead rationalized their embrace McCarthy's dirty politics. Block does not spell out the excuses people used for voting McCarthy, instead representing their rationalizations with long dashes. This imagery suggests that there is no excuse for supporting McCarthy; his indecency fundamentally disqualified him, no matter one's party or ideology. This year, the Republicans who have not embraced Trump enthusiastically have mostly made peace with a man who stands against what so many of them claim to be. ""Politics can be a battle of ideas, not insults,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said -- a few months before endorsing Trump, a man who embodies the opposite view. -Stephen Stromberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  February 28, 1954: ""We've Got To Avoid A Split With Him"" As Block could tell you, Trump's call to disengage from trading and defense relationships is not strikingly new so much as a callback to protectionist sentiments and anti-foreign suspicions that have traced their way through U.S. history -- and, at times, dominated it. An internationalist, Block attacked over and over again those who accumulate political power by inflaming divisions among nations rather than promoting engagement with them. Backers of McCarthy opposed crucial international institutions such as NATO and the Marshall Plan. Here, Block criticizes President Eisenhower for standing by while McCarthy inflamed a paranoid, shortsighted nationalism that saw many enemies and few friends outside of U.S. borders. -Stephen Stromberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  March 4, 1954: ""Have A Care, Sir"" McCarthy achieved political prominence by savagely attacking people, such as George C. Marshall, a mentor of Eisenhower's whom McCarthy unfairly suggested was responsible for handing China over to Mao Zedong's Communists. But when it fell to Eisenhower to renounce McCarthy, the president offered extremely restrained criticism -- much like Ryan objecting to Trump's racist appeals but nevertheless endorsing him. In a widely noted news conference on March 3, 1954, held in the midst of McCarthy's attacks on the Army, Eisenhower did not even mention the senator's name in his defense of Army officials. Block depicts Eisenhower unsheathing a useless feather to challenge McCarthy, who wields a well-used meat cleaver, illustrating the absurdity of pulling one's punches when the threat is so grave; unwarranted restraint disrespects oneself and one's constituents. Eisenhower, the famous general, brought the wrong weapon to a fight. -Stephen Stromberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  March 7, 1954: ""Relax -- He Hasn't Got To You Yet"" Block repeatedly speculated that Eisenhower avoided conflict with McCarthy for political, not principled, reasons. Here, ""White House 'strategists'"" encourage Eisenhower to sit back as McCarthy knifes the Army, after having already killed the State Department. Though the president is next in line, the strategist seated next to him advises Eisenhower to ""relax -- he hasn't got to you yet."" Much like Trump, who has attacked a variety of government officials, fellow Republicans and private citizens, McCarthyism generated an ever-growing list of enemies to perpetuate the sense of shock and conspiracy on which the hysteria fed. Appeasing McCarthy, Block counseled, was ultimately self-defeating. Block also illustrates viscerally McCarthy's assault on national institutions -- casualties to his campaign of self-aggrandizement that no one in a position of responsibility should have sat by and watched. -Stephen Stromberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  October 7, 1954: ""Carry On, Lads"" In this cartoon, a disgraced McCarthy passes the baton -- or, in Block's imagery, his signature paintbrush covered in tar -- to Vice President Richard Nixon (R), an outspoken anti-communist, and Sen. William E. Jenner (R-Ind.), one of McCarthy's chief defenders in Congress. Block argues that those associated McCarthy did not have clean hands -- and that the fall of McCarthy did not signal the end of McCarthyite paranoia as a force in American politics. It remains to be seen whether Trump will suffer a McCarthy-like fall and whether those who associated with him this election year -- or, indeed, the GOP writ large -- will continue to embrace his demagogic populism afterward. -Stephen Stromberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  December 12, 1954: ""You Sure You Don't Want To Run Away From Home?"" In this cartoon, the exhausted, battered elephant of the Republican Party surveys the destruction Sen. Joe McCarthy has wrought on the party. But rather than disciplining him, the elephant hopes McCarthy will take himself and his antics elsewhere. At a moment when the Republican Party, which has seen many of its leaders and institutions insulted by its own nominee, seems to be looking forward to a post-Trump future, Herblock's cartoon serves as a reminder that it's not so easy for an institution to clean house. -Alyssa Rosenberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  September 8, 1963: ""I Don't Want Any Inside Interference!"" Here, Block turned Alabama Gov. George Wallace's words about maintaining segregation and request that the state ""be allowed to handle state and local affairs without outside interference"" against him, suggesting that Wallace couldn't fairly claim to represent the wishes of his entire state. By painting Wallace as a Napoleon figure, Block suggested his autocratic tendencies. And in showing Wallace turning on other white Alabamans in positions of power, Block captured a characteristic that was not unique to Wallace: the way demagogues tend to label those who disagree with them as traitors or otherwise illegitimate. -Alyssa Rosenberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  February 11, 1968: ""We'll Let The Overcoat Out All The Way, And The Robe Will Hardly Show At All."" When Wallace ran for president in 1968 as the nominee of the American Independent Party, he didn't exactly shed his segregationists policies, though he did dress them up in the facade of ""law and order"" that's made a resurgence in the 2016 election, and made inroads among Northern blue-collar workers. This year, the question of mainstreaming racism and dressing it up in respectable political clothes remains distressingly relevant. -Alyssa Rosenberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  September 11, 1968: ""The Apt Pupil"" McCarthy's pail of tar and black paintbrush returned in the 1968 presidential election, this time in the hands of Spiro Agnew, a one-time supporter of GOP moderate Nelson Rockefeller who would go on to attack the press, antiwar protesters and others on behalf of President Nixon, for whom he served as vice president. Here, Block suggests that Agnew learned this style of politics from Nixon, who looks on with glee as Agnew paints ""Humphrey is soft on communism and soft on law and order,"" on a wall. Nixon's ""law and order"" message was racially tinged -- and it has been enthusiastically reused by Trump. -Stephen Stromberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  June 22, 1990: ""Trump Tower"" To an extent, we do not have to guess at what Block thought about Trump. In 1990, he drew what should be among the definitive assessments of the real estate tycoon, showing Trump attempting to balance a sky-high stack of papers, some of which are labeled ""debts,"" ""loans,"" ""bonds"" and ""interest."" It would only take so long for ""Trump Tower,"" as Block labeled the stack, to topple over; the Trump Taj Mahal casino declared bankruptcy in 1991, the first in a string of Trump bankruptcies in the years since Block drew this cartoon. Trump's cartoonish bravado survived the collapse, apparently unscathed. -Stephen Stromberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  December 7, 1994: ""History Student"" Block's career spanned generations of American demagogues. Here he draws a direct line from the incoming speaker of the House at the time, Newt Gingrich, and McCarthy, as the latter's signature tar spurts out of Gingrich's sign. Gingrich said on ""Meet the Press"" in 1994 that he ""had a senior law enforcement official tell me that in his judgment, up to a quarter of the White House staff, when they first came in, had used drugs in the last four or five years."" This same sentence could have been uttered by McCarthy himself before the House on Un-American Activities Committee -- it is an unverifiable an underhanded attack that is supposed to pass as fact. Now Gingrich advises Trump, who so often uses this strategy to generate ""evidence"" for his claims, as when he said that his talks with unnamed border agents justify his immigration plans. -Stephen Stromberg     (The Herb Block Foundation)  August 23, 1996: ""Let Me Be The Bridge To A Time of Tranquility . . . I Know Because I Was There"" This cartoon, a savage riff on Bob Dole's acceptance speech at the Republican convention in 1996, portrays the ""time of tranquility"" Dole claimed to long for as a world where women would have to seek out illegal abortions. ""Time of tranquility"" is more poetic phrasing than ""Make America Great Again,"" but Block's point applied 20 years ago, and it applies again: what is nostalgic for some has terrifying consequences for others. -Alyssa Rosenberg    (The Herb Block Foundation)  October 31, 1999: ""Said Alice . . . 'It's The Stupidest Tea-Party I Ever Was At In All My Life' "" Shortly after Donald Trump declared his candidacy for the Reform Party's presidential nomination, pledging to spend $100 million of his own money to win ""the whole megillah"" and naming Oprah Winfrey as his ideal running mate, Herblock drew Trump as the Mad Hatter at tea with Ross Perot, the party's standard-bearer in the previous two elections, and Pat Buchanan, who would go on to claim the Reform Party nomination. Trump dropped out of the race in February of the next year, but not before raising one of the issues that would become the signature of his 2016 campaign for the White House: trade. One difference? Running against Buchanan, Trump made an issue of his opponent's isolationism, particularly Buchanan's comment that Nazi Germany wasn't a credible threat to the United States. At the time, Trump declared of Buchanan ""Look, he's a Hitler lover. I guess he's an anti-Semite. He doesn't like the blacks, he doesn't like the gays, it's just incredible that anybody could embrace this guy."" This year, as white nationalists and anti-Semites have embraced the Trump campaign, Trump has expressed less concern about bias. -Alyssa Rosenberg    (The Herb Block Foundation) "
