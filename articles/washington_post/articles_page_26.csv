He also talked to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, whom he has called his political idol. Duterte first met Xi in a state visit to Beijing last month, where their governments forged mostly trade and economic accords. They also discussed longstanding territorial disputes in the South China Sea. After his China trip, Filipinos were allowed back to fish in the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which Chinese coast guard vessels have guarded since seizing the rich fishing area in 2012. In their meeting in Lima, Duterte told Xi that ""we will cooperate with you."" He added: ""With my thrust of an independent foreign policy, we will find ourselves mutually agreeing in so many things and align our foreign policy towards the development of Asia, strengthening of ties among the countries in the region, with China leading the way in the economic development."" ___ 5:50 p.m. APEC summit host Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has managed to win a smile from the normally stern-faced Vladimir Putin by speaking to the Russian president in a foreign language the two leaders share: German. With cameras rolling at the start of their one-on-one meeting, Kuczynski asked the Russian leader: ""In what language should we speak?"" Putin suggested the two speak in their native languages and use translators. Kuczynski replied, ""But you speak German."" That got a gleeful Putin to say, in fluent German, ""Then we can speak Deutsch, if you prefer."" Putin worked for the KGB in East Germany before the collapse of the Soviet Union, while Kuczynski is the son of Jewish doctor from Germany. ___ 5:30 p.m. Peru's almost octogenarian president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, has had his first experience with virtual reality, trying it out during the annual meeting of the 21-nation Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Lima. As he emerged groggy-eyed, he told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: ""I didn't like the Tyrannosaurus Rex."" Kuczynski tried out Facebook's Oculus Rift virtual reality device headset in which dinosaurs, debris and crashing cars jump out at the participant. It was an ""incredible"" experience, according to Kuczynski, who is better known for more sedate tastes like playing the classical flute and reading history books. A video of the encounter posted by Kuczynski's office on his social media site has gone viral, attracting more than 368,000 views. That is the most replays of any video provided by the president since he took office in July. Afterward Kuczynski and Zuckerberg posed for a selfie, with the Facebook founder promising to help Peru boost internet connectivity in far-flung, rural parts of the South American country. ___ 5 p.m. And they're off to Vietnam. President Tran Dai Quang of Vietnam closed a meeting of business leaders in Peru by inviting them to his Southeast Asian nation in 2017 for the next meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum nations. Leaders from APEC's 21 nations have finished their speeches for Saturday and will gather later for a dinner at a downtown Lima park. But with the closure of the APEC CEO summit, most leaders will hide themselves in bilateral meetings and Sunday's closed-door sessions. ___ 12:15 p.m. New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key says that if Donald Trump tries to withdraw the U.S. from trade deals, he shouldn't expect the rest of the world to follow suit. Speaking to business leaders, Key said he had sensed ""tremendous despair"" among attendees of the APEC summit about Trump's position on trade. He said it's still possible to save the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by the Obama administration by introducing cosmetic changes making it acceptable to the incoming U.S. president or crafting a more limited pact among willing signatories that leaves out the U.S.  ""Even if the United States doesn't want to engage in free trade, President Trump needs to know other countries do,"" said Key. ___ 12 p.m. Mexico's president is taking a cautious approach to Donald Trump's pledges to break up the North American Free Trade Agreement and build a wall to keep out millions of Latino immigrants. Addressing business leaders at APEC, President Enrique Pena Nieto refused to antagonize the incoming U.S. president even as he strongly defended trade between the two countries. He said the United States and Mexico ship to each other $1 million worth of goods every minute, generating benefits to companies and workers on both sides of the border that must not be jeopardized.  ""In the face of Trump's positioning, we're now in a stage of favoring dialogue as a way to build a new agenda in our bilateral relationship,"" Pena Nieto said. ""Mexico, like the entire world, is about to initiate a new stage with the U.S. and in commercial terms we want to give the right value to this strategic relationship between Mexico and the U.S."" ___ 10:30 a.m. China's President Xi Jinping is calling for a free trade agreement across the Asia-Pacific region to promote more equitable global growth. Xi made the forceful call against protectionism in a keynote address to business leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Peru on Saturday. Xi said that China has contributed to 40 percent of global growth since the global financial crisis. China's economy is now cooling as it seeks to rebalance growth away from exports to more domestic sources of growth, but it remains an engine of global growth. Xi said that more than 700 million Chinese tourists will fan out across the globe in coming years and the country will invest billions abroad. Still, he said the measure of globalization has to be an improvement in peoples' lives and a reduction of poverty. He said a proposed free trade area encompassing all 21 APEC members can contribute to that goal. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Salt Lake Area Restaurant Association plans to hire a lobbyist to push the change during the legislative session starting in January. Association President Tamara Gibo told The Salt Lake Tribune (http://bit.ly/2fPurGl) that the 2009 law impacts new businesses more than others that were grandfathered in. Owners are concerned about costs and safety for employees who go unobserved behind the barriers.  ""Business owners want to be able to monitor employees, make sure they are not drinking on the job or using the meters improperly,"" she said. Dan Jones & Associates recently polled 823 voters and found 45 percent oppose the walls while 40 percent favor them. About 43 percent of active Mormons are at least somewhat in favor of the change. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has helped knock down efforts to repeal the Zion Curtain law, which is named in reference to the teetotal guidance from the Mormon church.  ""Yes, we are looking at the issue,"" said Sen. Jerry Stevenson, R-Layton.  ""We want something that will work for everyone,"" he said. ""We don't want to put forth a piece of legislation that creates more problems."" ___ Information from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

For Obama and world leaders it’s Trump	" LIMA, Peru -- Trying to tie up loose ends of his foreign policy agenda, President Barack Obama on Saturday instead found world leaders more focused on someone else: President-elect Donald Trump. Global hand-wringing over America's next president has taken much of the wind out of Obama's final overseas trip. Adopting an altruistic tone, Obama has offered frequent reassurances that the U.S. won't renege on its commitments. Yet he's been at a loss to quell concerns fully, given new signals from Trump that he intends to govern much the way he campaigned. Obama's visit to Peru, the last stop on his trip, has brought those concerns to the forefront: Much of Latin America is on edge about a potentially dramatic shift in U.S. immigration policy under Trump. And Asian leaders gathered in Lima for an Asia-Pacific economic summit are trying to game out what Trump's presidency will mean for trade with the world's largest economy.  ""We're going to have a busy agenda,"" Obama said as he sat down with leaders of countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the sweeping free trade deal with Asia that Obama painstakingly brokered. It was unclear whether their agenda was really as busy as all that. Vehemently opposed to the Pacific agreement and similar deals, Trump has vowed it won't be ratified on his watch. In an acknowledgement of that political reality, the White House has stopped actively lobbying Congress to try to pass it. In fact, Obama didn't mention the trade deal at all as reporters were allowed in briefly for the beginning of his meeting with TPP nations, which include Mexico, Chile, Japan, Australia and Vietnam. Instead, Obama called it a useful occasion to talk about creating jobs, opportunity and prosperity. To be sure, any president would have less to discuss with other leaders in the final months than when years of governing stretch ahead. Obama's typically jam-packed schedule on foreign trips has been notably lighter on this trip, with long stretches of downtime. Yet Trump's election, with the sharp shift in approach it's expected to bring, has put a spotlight on Obama's lame-duck status. Obama has made it a tradition to attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. His attendance this year was designed to reinforce the importance of that venue, even though it's unlikely at this stage of his presidency he will secure any new major agreements with other countries or shift direction in any major ways. His visit also offered a chance for a round of farewell meetings, including with President Xi Jinping of China, a sometimes U.S. rival. Xi commended Obama for ""active efforts"" to grow U.S.-China ties. Obama, with just a hint of nostalgia, noted it was their last meeting, and called the two countries' relationship the most consequential in the world. Before returning to Washington on Saturday, Obama will sit down Sunday with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Obama's chief antagonist on the world stage, was also in Lima, but the White House did not expect them to have any substantive interaction. By this point, Obama has come to terms with the fact that his remaining weeks in office will be overshadowed by the provocative businessman who soon moves into the home Obama's family now occupies. In Greece and Germany, the first two stops on his trip, Obama was similarly trailed by questions about Trump and whether he'll really follow through with threats he leveled during the campaign, such as potentially refusing to defend NATO allies who don't pay enough of the alliance's costs. Obama's message to young leaders at a town hall-style meeting in Lima was sanguine: ""Don't assume the worst.""  ""I think it will be important for everybody around the world to not make immediate judgments, but give this new president-elect a chance to put their team together, to examine the issues, to determine what their policies will be,"" Obama said. ""How you campaign is not always how you govern."" So far, while Trump has vowed to run a unifying administration, he's given few indications he plans to abandon his campaign promises. Those hoping for a more moderate Trump 2.0 have been disappointed by his first selections for top jobs: Rep. Mike Pompeo, a fierce critic of Obama's Iran deal, for CIA director; retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, an advocate for closer ties to Russia and a more militant response to Mideast extremism, for national security adviser; and Sen. Jeff Sessions, an immigration hardliner, for attorney general. Trump's protectionist stance on trade was clearly on the minds of other leaders attending the economic conference. Xi, speaking before his meeting with Obama, made an impassioned call against protectionism as Chinese state media said Trump's trade-bashing could drag the world into ""deeper economic distress."" Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto defended his country's trade relationship with the U.S., but took a cautious approach to Trump's pledge to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.  ""In the face of Trump's positioning, we're now in a stage of favoring dialogue as a way to build a new agenda in our bilateral relationship,"" Pena Nieto said. ___ Associated Press writers Darlene Superville and Joshua Goodman in Lima, and Calvin Woodward, Nancy Benac and Kevin Freking in Washington, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

3	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/19/alt-right-leaders-praise-sessions-as-attorney-general-pick/	Alt-right leaders praise Sessions as attorney general pick	"   Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, visits Trump Tower in New York on Thursday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Richard Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute and popularizer of the term ""alt-right,"" told reporters in Washington on Saturday that Donald Trump could achieve some of the white nationalist movement's goals by making Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) his attorney general. ""Jeff Sessions is someone who is not alt-right but seems to see eye-to-eye with us on the immigration question,"" Spencer said. ""The fact that he is going to be at such a high level is a wonderful thing. What Jeff Sessions is not going to do, in terms of not prosecuting federal diversity and fair housing, I think is just as powerful as what he might do."" Sessions, who was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 after the Senate heard testimony about his criticism of the NAACP, has been a resilient foe of the Obama administration's housing and legal priorities. He led a group of Republicans opposing the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing plan, which encouraged more development of public housing and transportation in cities. At his 1986 hearing, he admitted calling the Voting Rights Act ""intrusive legislation,"" and since the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision he has dismissed calls for a restoration of the act's pre-clearance provision.   [Trump signals intent to keep hard-line promises with choices for senior national security posts]   Spencer made the remarks at an afternoon news conference in a ballroom of the Ronald Reagan Building, where NPI had gathered more than 100 activists for a postelection conference. The ""ask anything"" presser began with a request for journalists not to photograph attendees without express permission, and for the news media to stand up when alt-right figures were harassed by protesters or banned from social media. ""Twitter has much more power than any government on earth,"" Spencer said. Over the next hour, journalists sat in front of Spencer and other alt-right figures to ask questions. The conference attendees sat behind them, jeering the names of outlets such as NPR and Mother Jones. One attendee could be heard shouting ""Lugenpresse"" (""lying press""), a German insult inspired by the Nazis, as one reporter repeatedly asked if ""alt-right"" was just a way to rebrand racism.   [How Jeff Sessions went from fringe figure to mainstream Republican]   ""Trump was called a racist for the entire campaign, and it didn't have an effect,"" said Kevin B. MacDonald, a California academic widely read on the alt-right. ""That's one of the big pluses here."" ""When Glenn Beck is crying and calling you a racist, it's kind of fun,"" Spencer said. Spencer said the alt-right had been a ""head without a body"" before the Trump campaign, and the campaign arrived as a ""body without a head."" Spencer promised that the alt-right would propose six policy ideas for the Trump administration in coming months, and the first was a 50-year moratorium on immigration, with white Europeans as the only group allowed to attain new citizenship. Pressed by reporters, Spencer could name only a few allies in Congress -- such as Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) -- who might get on board with such a major policy shift. More promising, in the short term, were Trump selections such as Sessions and, as chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, of the far-right website Breitbart News. ""Breitbart didn't get sucked into the drain of Never Trumpism and saw the promise of populism,"" Spencer said."

Yang Xiuzhu arrived in Beijing after spending 13 years on the run in countries across Asia, Europe and North America. A former deputy mayor in the eastern city of Wenzhou, Yang, 70, is wanted in China for allegedly embezzling more than $40 million. She had sat atop the list of China's 100 most-wanted graft suspects who Beijing has asked Interpol to help apprehend. Yang was immediately taken into custody after being led off a plane by a pair of policewomen. After passing through immigration, she was led into a room where she heard the charges against her read out by a prosecutor and signed a charge sheet. The entire process was broadcast live on state television. The Communist Party's anti-corruption watchdog says it has taken custody of 37 of the 100 most-wanted graft suspects since launching its ""Sky Net"" campaign to apprehend them in April 2015. They include both Yang and her brother, businessman Yang Jinjun, who is suspected of graft and bribery and returned to China late last year. China has also stepped up international law enforcement cooperation to combat possible terrorist threats and fraudsters who target Chinese over the internet and by mobile phone from countries as far flung as Tanzania and Armenia. A Chinese police official was elected president of Interpol last week, setting off alarm bells among rights advocates who worry about abuses and a lack of transparency within China's legal system. They're also concerned about the potential misuse of the police organization's resources to attack Beijing's political opponents. U.S. and Chinese diplomats and law enforcement representatives plan to meet in Beijing next week to discuss fighting transnational crime through the China-U.S. Joint Liaison Group on Law Enforcement Cooperation. With Chinese investigators closing in, Yang Xiuzhu fled first to Hong Kong in 2003, then Singapore, France, the Netherlands and Italy, said the party watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. After her asylum requests were turned down, she fled again to the U.S. in 2014 and filed another petition for asylum, it said. Authorities used law enforcement and diplomatic efforts to keep the pressure on Yang, and also assured her that she would receive relatively lenient treatment if she turned herself in, the commission said. Eventually, she withdrew her asylum application and returned to China, the commission said. Media reports also said Yang was in declining health and she hoped for better medical care in China. The U.S. and China have no extradition treaty so officials requested her return through the Joint Liaison Group, providing evidence that aided in her detention in late 2014, and the freezing of her assets, the commission said.

Putting Wilders on trial ""is based on a thorough analysis of the law, the specific circumstances of this case and the use of all the expertise of the prosecutor's office,"" prosecutor Wouter Bos told a three-judge panel. ""Nothing more, nothing less."" Wilders, whose Freedom Party is riding high in opinion polls ahead of parliamentary elections in March, is refusing to attend the trial, labeling it a political witch hunt. The trial centers on comments Wilders made before and after Dutch municipal elections in 2014. At one meeting in a Hague cafe he asked supporters whether they wanted more or fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands, sparking a chant of ""Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!""  ""We'll take care of it,"" he replied, in a video recording played in court. Bos said that the trial ""touches on the foundations of society because two fundamental values are struggling for primacy, fundamental values of our free and democratic society: The ban on discrimination and the freedom of expression."" But he added, ""freedom of expression is not absolute. It goes hand-in-hand with obligations and responsibilities."" In a statement read in court by his lawyer earlier in the trial, Wilders defended his comments, saying, ""It is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country."" Prosecutors are expected to make their sentence demand on Thursday, before Wilders' defense lawyers make their closing statement. Wilders faces a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment if convicted of insulting a group based on race, and inciting hatred and discrimination. However, prosecutors say courts mostly sentence people convicted of such offenses to a fine or community service order. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In his first extended remarks on the election that pounded his party and his legacy, Obama sought to reassure an anxious world and nation about his successor's commitments to alliances, at times appearing almost sanguine about a future Trump administration. Although he would not explicitly say Trump was qualified for the office, he said he believed the first-time officeholder would do his best to unite the nation, calling him pragmatic. He refused to wade into a political firestorm over Trump's decision to name a far-right conservative media mogul as a top adviser. And he expressed hope that the weight of the presidency will force Trump to overcome his shortcomings.  ""He has won. He's going to be the next president and regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up,"" Obama said. ""And some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history, those are ones that hopefully he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people."" Obama's refusal to criticize his successor was a 180-degree reversal from the rhetoric of his campaign takedowns. Only a week ago, as he campaigned for Hillary Clinton, Obama said Trump was ""woefully unprepared for the job"" and couldn't ""handle the nuclear codes."" Obama's latest remarks bore little resemblance to the calls for resistance coming from other Democrats and many of Obama's supporters. As they come to grips with Trump's surprising win, many Democrats have seized on a call not to accept or ""normalize"" the actions of a man who ran a divisive campaign that included charges of racism, sexism and other offensive rhetoric and actions. But Obama, who was the target of some of that rhetoric, has embraced the role of national hand-holder. Both in private and in a brief statement last week, Obama has suggested that Democrats should buck up and move on. He's cast Trump's election as in line with the usual zig and zag of politics. On Monday, as he prepared to embark on a three-nation trip abroad, Obama went so far as to vouch for Trump and his foreign policies. Although Trump campaigned as a harsh critic of NATO, Obama said Trump sounded a different note when they met in the Oval Office last week. Obama said the Republican ""expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,"" including ""strong and robust NATO"" partnerships.  ""There is enormous continuity ... that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order around the world,"" Obama said. Relationships and policies go beyond presidents, he said, adding that military officials, diplomats and intelligence officers would cooperate with their foreign counterparts as before. Obama acknowledged he had offered advice to Trump, saying he emphasized the need to shift from campaigning to governing, and the importance of resetting the tone after a contentious election.  ""I don't think he is ideological,"" Obama said. ""And that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction."" Obama suggested he would continue to offer his advice. He said he would urge Trump ""to think long and hard"" before making good on his promise to upend Obama's program that deferred deportation for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants who came to the country illegally as children. Asked about one of Trump's most contentious moves since his triumph, appointing Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior adviser, Obama said it was up to the president-elect to appoint a team.  ""It's important for us to let him make his decisions,"" Obama said of the choice of Bannon, a man celebrated as a force for the far right. But adding a hint of worry, Obama said he counseled Trump: ""It's really important to send some signals of unity."" Whereas Obama hailed Trump's ""impressive"" ability to speak to voters, he also delivered a subtle critique of Clinton's campaign. He said Democrats must broaden their focus beyond just swing states after an election that left the Senate and House in Republican hands, as well as most of the nation's governor's mansions. He rejected the idea that demographic advantages would lead to all-but-assured victories for the party, saying it must rebuild at the local, state and national levels.  ""We're going to have to compete everywhere,"" he said, reflecting on his own 2008 win in Iowa, a state that went for Trump this time. ""We're going to have to show up everywhere."" Clinton kept a relatively light campaign schedule until the final weeks of her campaign, mostly attending smaller events in battleground states. Her campaign focused heavily on motivating the Democratic base of female and minority voters, rather than swaying independents. ""Good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them,"" Obama said. While Obama is in Germany, Greece and Peru, he said his team would accelerate efforts to ensure a smooth transition to the Trump administration. He stressed that he would try to strengthen the American economy over his final two months, and all but acknowledged he would not take any dramatic action to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in his final weeks in office.  ""One of the things you discover about being president is that there are all these rules and norms and laws and you got to pay attention to them. And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms, and that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming president,"" he said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

""You're allowed to mope for a week and half maybe two,"" President Barack Obama told Democratic National Committee members on a conference call. ""But after that we've got to brush ourselves off and get to work."" The party has entered a period of soul-searching, as Democrats try to chart their direction in the Donald Trump era. An ascendant liberal wing is pushing for a serious shift toward an economic populist message that could win back white working-class voters who backed Trump. Party activists, donors and politicians are also advocating for significant changes in leadership, with a group of younger House members trying to postpone leadership elections in an effort to force a discussion about the direction of the party.  ""There's a general feeling that the Democratic Party itself needs some serious reform and has grown very distant from the kind of communities it represents,"" said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy Democratic donors who gathered in Washington for a three-day strategy session this week. The DNC, the last bastion of party power in Washington, is emerging as another battleground. Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison announced his candidacy to be chairman of the organization on Monday afternoon, joining a crowded field of candidates that includes former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who was party chairman during the administration of then-President George W. Bush. After losing the White House and Congress -- and likely the ideological tilt of the Supreme Court -- the Democrats' new chief will be one of the party's most visible faces in politics, making the role a far more influential post than it was during the Obama administration. Around a dozen Democrats' names have been publicly floated to succeed interim chairwoman Donna Brazile. Ellison, a prominent progressive and the first Muslim elected to Congress, has emerged as an early leader, attracting support from Senate leaders and liberal activists. DNC National Finance Chairman Henry Munoz III said he's ""seriously considering jumping into the race,"" arguing that the conversation about the party's future must include representation for Latinos, a growing demographic group. Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison have also said they're considering bids. The contest comes at a time of deep unrest for the party. Anti-Trump protests continued this weekend and post-election polls showed a significant minority of Clinton backers question the legitimacy of Trump's win. The future looks even grimmer. In two years, Democrats will be defending about two dozen Senate seats, including at least five in deep-red states. That election could hand Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a filibuster-proof majority, further clearing the way for a conservative policy agenda. Obama's call followed a press conference where Obama delivered a subtle critique of Clinton's campaign, pushing back on the idea that demographic advantages would lead to all-but-assured victories for the party and stressing that Democrats must rebuild on every level. Clinton kept a relatively light campaign schedule until the final weeks of her campaign, focusing heavily on motivating the Democratic base of women and minority voters, rather than swaying independents.  ""We're going to have to show up everywhere,"" he said, reflecting on his own 2008 win in Iowa, a state that went for Trump. Clinton, meanwhile, held her own call with House Democrats on Monday afternoon. She urged the members not to be ""discouraged or divided,"" according to a Democrat on the call.  ""Heartbreaks don't heal overnight and this one won't,"" she said. ___ Associated Press Congressional Correspondent Erica Werner contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

" WASHINGTON -- Demonstrators upset over the election of Donald Trump have marched in cities around the country over the past week, and some are making plans to be in Washington for his inauguration Jan. 20. But whether marches will become a movement is an open question. At this early stage, the protesters who have taken to the streets to brand Trump a bigot and a sexist and chant ""Not my president!"" appear to be mostly venting their frustrations and do not seem to have coalesced behind overall leaders or a common set of demands. Columbia University professor Todd Gitlin, who as an early leader of Students for a Democratic Society helped organize an anti-Vietnam War demonstration that brought thousands to Washington in 1965, said the anti-Trump protests by themselves ""are not the makings of a movement.""  ""A movement requires that clusters of people take responsibility for creating vehicles that can carry through, focus energy, develop priorities, strategize, recruit, figure out how to govern themselves,"" Gitlin said. For that to happen, a critical mass of protesters has to ""transform their mindset from protest into successful politics, which is much less exciting,"" he said. Gitlin said that means ""dirtying our hands in winning local and state battles which are instrumental to changing the national balance."" On Monday, hundreds of students decrying Trump's election walked out of schools in Denver, Los Angeles and Silver Spring, Maryland, after a weekend in which thousands of people demonstrated around the country and scores were arrested. Protesters threw rocks at police in Indianapolis and hurled bottles and other objects in Portland, Oregon. Marchers have also converged on Trump Tower in New York, the president-elect's transition headquarters. Among other things, the demonstrators have condemned Trump's behavior toward women and his stand on immigration and civil liberties. Ralph Young, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia who teaches a course on dissent in America and has written two books on the topic, said it is too early to predict what the marches might become. Once Trump becomes president and starts making policy decisions, that could crystalize opposition and focus people's attention on certain issues, he said. If the anti-Trump demonstrations are going to become a movement, they also need leaders who can articulate their grievances, he said. That's one thing the Occupy Wall Street movement against economic inequality never really achieved -- a proper organization, Young said. Jamie Henn of the group 350, which organizes protests to fight climate change, said liberal activist groups are still scrambling to figure out how they will push back against a Trump presidency.  ""There is definitely stuff coming together and being planned that looks like the messy process of everyone and their mother throwing up something on their Facebook page,"" Henn said. Henn said liberals haven't seen the need for this level of mobilization since the run-up to the Iraq War. But activists remember glumly how little a dent their big marches against the invasion made then, and may use different tactics this time. Some groups are already trying to come together, though there are differences of opinion, said Greg McKelvey, a protest organizer in Portland, Oregon. McKelvey said demonstrators are trying to organize with counterparts in New York; Washington; Austin, Texas; Oakland, California; Boston; and a few other cities. Some activists want to prevent Trump somehow from becoming president, while others feel that's inevitable and instead want to insulate their communities from his policies, McKelvey said. He said his group, Portland's Resistance, aims to make sure city and state governments are working on issues such as limiting climate change, pushing for better health care and dealing with racial disparities in policing. Trump's election has made activists out of people who haven't been part of any organized demonstrations before. Olivia Antezana, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Maryland at College Park, had never been to a demonstration before creating and promoting a ""Not My President"" event on Facebook. By Monday afternoon, 18,000 people had indicated on Facebook that they would be going to the event in Washington on Inauguration Day.  ""I will say I certainly underestimated it,"" Antezana said. Still, Antezana said she is not sure what she will do after the demonstration she is planning is over. She doesn't plan to join a political campaign, she said, though she would like to keep up with activism. Right now, she said, she has another priority: school. ___ Associated Press writers Sarah Brumfield in Washington; Nicholas Riccardi in Denver; and Andrew Selsky in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Jessica Gresko on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jessicagresko.
