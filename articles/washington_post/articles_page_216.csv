But it appeared that disgraced former lawmaker Joe Morrissey was out of the running, placing a distant third in the popular vote. Pre-election polls had shown Morrissey leading, but he was plagued by a number of sex scandals, including a legal client's recent claim that he made unwanted sexual advances. Former Secretary of the Commonwealth Levar Stoney led the popular vote and former leader of an economic development organization Jack Berry was in second place. But a candidate must win five out of the nine council districts to avoid a runoff election. Stoney led in five districts, but one of them by fewer than 300 votes without absentee ballots being counted. The top two candidates in the popular vote go to a runoff in December. ___ 10:40 p.m. Hillary Clinton has won the presidential contest in Virginia -- the home state of her running mate, Tim Kaine. The Democrat beat Republican businessman Donald Trump in the swing state to pick up 13 electoral votes on Tuesday. Clinton was favored to win Virginia, which Kaine represents in the U.S. Senate. The vice presidential candidate previously served as governor of Virginia and mayor of Richmond. Current Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is also a close friend of the Clintons. Clinton's victory marks the third consecutive Virginia presidential win for Democrats. President Barack Obama took the critical swing state in both 2008 and 2012 after several years of Republican victories. ___ 9:50 p.m. Freshman Republican Barbara Comstock has won re-election in Virginia's 10th Congressional District, fending off a strong challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett. The Comstock-Bennett race was the most closely watched congressional race in Virginia; Comstock started off with an advantage but many analysts rated the contest a tossup in the campaign's final weeks. Comstock emphasized her clout with the GOP's House leadership and took steps to distance herself from presidential nominee Donald Trump. Bennett, a real estate developer, was making her first run for public office. The 10th District stretches from the wealthy suburbs of McLean inside the Capital Beltway out west to Winchester. ___ 9:40 p.m. Democrat Donald McEachin has won election in Virginia's 4th Congressional District, giving Democrats control of a seat that has been in Republican hands since 2001. McEachin, a state senator from the Richmond area, defeated Republican Mike Wade, the sheriff in Henrico County. While the 4th District has long been represented by a Republican, McEachin's election was no surprise. The district boundaries were altered significantly after a panel of federal judges ruled that black voters had been wrongly packed into a neighboring district. The redistricting made the 4th District, which stretches from the Richmond suburbs to parts of Hampton roads, significantly more friendly to Democrats. The district had been represented by Republican Randy Forbes, who tried unsuccessfully to run in the 2nd District after the new boundaries were drawn. ___ 8:25 p.m. Republican Scott Taylor has won election in Virginia's 2nd Congressional District, defeating Democrat Shaun Brown. Taylor, a former Navy SEAL and state delegate from Virginia Beach, will succeed moderate Republican Scott Rigell, who decided not to seek a fourth term. Taylor's most significant challenge came in the primary, where he defeated Randy Forbes, a sitting congressman who tried to move from the 4th District to the 2nd District after a court-ordered redistricting erased the GOP's edge in his own district. The Democratic candidate -- Brown, a community activist from Newport News -- was the only Democrat who filed to run for the seat. ___ 8:15 p.m. Virginia's incumbent congressional representatives have made a strong showing in Tuesday's election. The Associated Press has declared incumbents in seven districts the winners of their races. In the 1st Congressional District, Republican Rob Wittman won another term, defeating Democratic challenger M.D. Rowe and Glenda Gail Parker, an independent. In the 3rd District, Democratic Bobby Scott defeated Republican M.L. ""Marty"" Williams. In the 6th District, Republican Bob Goodlatte beat Democrat Kai Degner. In the 7th District, Republican Dave Brat defeated Eileen Bedell. In the 8th District, Democrat Donald Beyer beat Republican Charles Hernick and independent Julio Gracia. In the 9th, Republican Morgan Griffith defeated Democrat Derek Kitts and independent Janice Allen Boyd. Incumbent Gerry Connolly, a Democrat who was unopposed, took the 11th District. ___ 8:10 p.m. Republican Tom Garrett has won the open seat in Virginia's 5th Congressional District, keeping the seat in GOP hands. Garrett, a state senator from Buckingham County, defeated Democrat Jane Dittmar, the former chair of the board of supervisors in Albemarle County. The district stretches from Fauquier County on the edge of northern Virginia through Charlottesville and down to much of southside Virginia. It has been represented since 2011 by Republican Robert Hurt, who opted not to seek re-election. The race drew national attention when a gun-toting supporter of Donald Trump carried out a one-man protest outside a Dittmar campaign office. Gun-rights supporters criticized Dittmar after one of her campaign volunteers called police in response to the man's presence. ___ 5:45 p.m. The head of Virginia's Department of Elections says complaints about problems at the polls have so far not been any greater than in previous years. Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortes said at a news conference Tuesday evening that among the ""isolated issues"" were long lines in Richmond, Chesapeake, Prince William, Spotsylvania and Staunton. He says elections officials are monitoring the lines and reminds voters that anyone in line by the time polls close at 7 p.m. will be able to vote. Cortes says several precincts in northern Virginia's Fairfax County didn't properly load their electronic poll book data, so some people who likely were registered weren't showing up. He says those people were given provisional ballots and the elections office will work quickly to process them. He says the department also got complaints from some voters who had registered at Department of Motor Vehicle offices but weren't on the rolls. Cortes says that happens every election and an audit process is in place to confirm who registered and process their provisional ballots. ___ 3:50 p.m. An election official in Virginia's most populous county says some poll workers were inappropriately asking voters for their driver's licenses instead of the other forms of identification they presented. Fairfax County General Registrar Cameron Sasnett says the poll workers were reminded that numerous forms of ID are accepted at Virginia polling places. He says no voters were turned away. Sasnett says the confusion arose in part because the county is using new devices that can scan driver's licenses and look up voters more quickly. He says he knows of at least two polling places where the problem occurred. ___ 1:45 p.m. Virginia elections officials say there have been scattered problems at polling places in the state, but nothing major. Virginia Department of Elections spokeswoman Dena Potter says police were called after two voters started yelling at each other in Chesterfield County. She says officers resolved the issue and no one was arrested. Potter says there was a display issue with electronic voting machines in Nottoway County. After voters made their choice for president, the selection was displayed under the header ""U.S. Senate."" She says the votes were still counted accurately despite the inaccurate display. Potter also says there have been long lines because of high turnout at some polling places, including in Richmond. ___ 8:15 a.m. Tim Kaine is not letting the biggest election of his life get in the way of his Tuesday routine. After voting at 6 a.m. and doing a round of national morning TV shows, Kaine met a group of friends for breakfast at the City Diner in Richmond. Kaine and his friends try to meet every Tuesday at the diner, a few miles from his home. The U.S. senator and former Virginia governor was greeted with cheers as he walked into the restaurant. ___ 6:15 a.m. Tim Kaine has cast his ballot for president in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia. The Democratic vice presidential nominee and his wife, Anne Holton, voted shortly after polls opened at 6 a.m. at a retirement community near their home. Kaine was cheered by supporters waiting in line. After voting, he spoke to reporters where he encouraged Americans to vote and said that if elected, he and running mate Hillary Clinton would try and bring the country together.  ""The sign of a vigorous democracy is one where a lot of people participate,"" Kaine said. ___ 5:30 a.m. Virginians are deciding whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump will win the swing state's 13 electoral votes, and voters also will weigh in on several crucial congressional and mayoral races. Leading to Tuesday, polls have shown Clinton leading Trump in Virginia, which is the home of her running mate Tim Kaine. Kaine represents Virginia in the U.S. Senate and previously served as mayor of Richmond and governor of Virginia. Other key races to watch include the battle for Virginia's 10th Congressional District, where freshman Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock is trying to fend off a serious challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

3	https://www.washingtonpost.com/ad683c38-a619-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	DC voters consider statehood, former mayor’s comeback	" WASHINGTON -- The long-shot effort to make the District of Columbia the nation's 51st state marked a milestone and suffered a major setback, Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged Wednesday as she discussed her mixed feelings about the election of Donald Trump and a Republican Congress. Nearly four of every five voters in the nation's capital gave their support to a statehood referendum on Tuesday. The District also voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, who won its three electoral votes with just over 90 percent of the vote. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 12-to-1 in the nation's capital, and most Republicans oppose statehood for both Constitutional and practical reasons: Making the District a state would dramatically shift the balance of power by all but guaranteeing two new Senate seats for Democrats. Still, city leaders hoped that a Democratic president and gains by Democrats in Congress would make the climate more favorable for statehood.  ""Part of our strategy was to be ready when we had like-minded people elected in the White House and in the Congress,"" Bowser said. ""We are prepared for that day when it comes."" Bowser said Trump would have to work to mend relationships in a city where 93 percent of voters wanted someone else to be president. Hillary Clinton also won Maryland and Virginia, and the immediate suburbs of Washington in both states are Democratic strongholds.  ""Many of our residents are anxious, are angry, and are hurting,"" Bowser said. Bowser, too, has been vocal about her dislike of Trump. She called his comments about immigrants ""idiotic,"" and while she attended the groundbreaking of his Washington hotel, she skipped its grand-opening festivities. However, she said she would welcome him to his new home and attend his inaugural festivities. Michael D. Brown, one of the city's elected ""shadow senators"" -- who are essentially unpaid lobbyists for statehood -- said advocates should alter their approach after the Republican triumphs.  ""We need a nationwide PR plan, because we need to take our fight to the people,"" Brown said, urging the city to make a major funding commitment to its advocacy efforts. Bowser said the city needs to debate how much money should be poured into that effort. The other shadow senator, Paul Strauss, pointed out that Vice President-elect Mike Pence was one of a few Republicans who supported a 2009 bill to give the District's delegate to Congress a vote on the House floor. Trump, too, has said that while he doesn't support statehood, a vote in the House for the District ""would be OK."" With the statehood referendum, voters endorsed a draft constitution that would have the city's 670,000 residents electing a governor, not a mayor, and a 21-seat state legislature instead of a city council. The constitution includes borders for the proposed state, with the White House, the Capitol and the National Mall carved out as a separate federal enclave. Congress could admit the District into the union simply by voting to approve the document. Despite its bleak prospects, Bowser and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said they would respect the will of the voters and submit it to Congress for consideration. ___ Follow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols.

Vote anyway.	" To my fellow millennials: Yeah, I know, you're scoffing at this salutation. I'm on the older side of our generation, which has been repeatedly redefined downward to represent an ever-younger, increasingly manbunned, microaggressed group of whippersnapchatters. ""Millennial"" used to refer to a specific cohort born between about 1980 and the mid-'90s; now it's just a generic slur meaning ""any annoying person younger than I am."" Still, I beg you, lend a slightly older lady your valuable, monetized eyeballs. For decades, get-out-the-vote efforts targeting people like you (us, rather) have harnessed the rhetoric of adolescent rebelliousness. It's about rocking the boat (or ""rocking the vote""), overthrowing the system, sticking it to the man, burning it all down. The youth vote mobilization machine has generally tried to resuscitate the political spirit of the '60s, when activism was viewed as a form of insubordination against parents and stodgy parent-like compatriots. Over the years, youth get-out-the-vote ads have come close to desecrating the American flag. They have included felony-decorated musicians, foul-mouthed actors and sexed-up socialites. They have served up a peculiar mix of cynicism and optimism, in which a better future can be achieved only by tearing down and replacing the useless, rigged, self-dealing systems and leaders of the present. It's all an attempt to rechannel the presumed anarchical, mutinous instincts of young people into a more socially productive ""political revolution"" -- to use Bernie Sanders's preferred term. This core theme of youth mobilization campaigns has persisted, election after election, regardless of who's running for office, and even as new and differently complected cohorts aged into and out of the ""youth"" demographic. The constant is understandable: Rebelliousness is the timeless idiom of youth. Which is why this year, the messaging machine is struggling to motivate young voters. How can you inspire millennials to vote when our primary political vessel represents not volatility and upheaval, but boring stability? Not rocking the boat, but keeping it from crashing into an iceberg? There is, of course, a burn-it-all-down candidate on the ballot next week, one who fits more easily into the usual youth GOTV rhetoric. But our generation, by and large, despises him.  Donald Trump has a 76 percent unfavorable rating among voters younger than 30, according to a recent Harvard Institute of Politics poll. According to other surveys, large majorities of us believe he embodies or appeals to bigotry, racism and bias against women. About 6 in 10 say his comments about women alone disqualify him from the presidency, according to Reuters/Ipsos. On the other hand, the institutionalist candidate whose policy preferences are actually closer to our own, and who pledges to build on progress made by Barack Obama, has struggled to inspire us. That same Harvard youth poll also found that a slim majority -- 51 percent -- of young people view Hillary Clinton unfavorably. Millennial enthusiasm for her runs thin, particularly relative to liberal change-messengers such as Sanders and Obama. ""Steady as she goes"" is hardly a compelling campaign slogan for any age group. But it is an especially poor fit for the insurrectionist, get-out-the-vote rhetoric usually used to woo young people to the polls.     The latest Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll shows Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a dead heat nationally. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Some young voters have expressed support for third-party candidates, though millennial support for Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein has eroded over the past month or so. The greater danger right now is that millennials won't vote at all. We will express our political frustrations with the system not by trying to upend it -- as so many get-out-the-vote efforts of eras past urged us to do -- but by abstaining altogether. And our collective abstention is exactly what could stand between a stable, prosperous, peaceful world order and something else entirely. We millennials now match boomers as the largest share of the electorate; our votes can swing, and indeed  have swung, elections, if only we show up.  I keep thinking of YouGov's viral analysis on Brexit votes, showing that those who had to live longest with the decision -- i.e., young people -- were most likely to vote ""Remain."" And yet youths also had the lowest voter turnout rates of any demographic. So ""Remain"" lost.   Take a lesson from our British cousins, my fellow American millennials. A vote for keeping it together may be less cathartic than a vote for burning it all down. But it's better than not voting at all.
