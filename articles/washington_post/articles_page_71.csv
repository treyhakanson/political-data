But he can’t succeed without transparency.	"      President-elect Donald Trump has had an up-and-down relationship with the media for a long time, but spent much of the campaign calling the press ""crooked"" and ""rigged."" The Fix's Peter Stevenson explains what his relationship with the press might look like going forward. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   President-elect Donald Trump did something unusual last week, barely a day after he'd won. On Thursday, according to the Associated Press, he ""refused to allow journalists to travel with him to Washington for his historic first meetings"" with President Obama and congressional leaders. It wasn't an anomaly. This week, he did it again: On Tuesday evening, he took his family to dinner in New York without informing a press pool or allowing reporters to trail along and wait outside the restaurant. To those who don't follow politics and the media closely, this might sound inconsequential. But it's an enormous departure from a long-standing practice -- one meant to ensure the public is kept informed as to what its leader is doing. Trump has now broken with that tradition, choosing opacity over transparency. But that's not all. The AP also reported last week that when ""Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a congratulatory telegram to Trump on Wednesday, Moscow spread the word. A phone call with British Prime Minster Theresa May was announced in London. The pattern was repeated for calls with leaders of Israel, Egypt, South Korea and Australia."" The fact is that Americans are learning of their president-elect's activities from foreign governments and by happenstance, not from Trump himself or the journalists who cover him. We're clearly going down an unfortunate path here. Trump has an opportunity, and he's about to blow it. In fact, this is what I most feared earlier this year when I joined other national security professionals in opposing Trump, even though I am a lifelong Republican and former appointee in the George W. Bush administration.   [The Trump campaign's war on reality made me question what I saw]   Anger at the political establishment -- from both parties -- has roiled millions of Americans. They want to change the way Washington works. On that, I agree with them. The only way we're going to get there, however, is if the next president embraces transparency as a cornerstone of his administration. When millions of Americans have little confidence in their own government -- as is the case today -- transparency becomes a necessity. Trump can still lead this change. Obama led a noble, and modestly successful, effort to make government more transparent in 2009. But within a short time, it was clear he would fall far short of his lofty goal of becoming ""the most transparent administration in history."" In many ways, the Obama administration quickly became as secretive as previous administrations. In some ways, it became more secretive. The controversial classification of drone strikes may serve as one example. So how can the Trump administration correct its early mistakes with regard to transparency?   [The outsized role of the press in the Trump administration]   First, Trump must understand the important role of the news media and its role as a vital Fourth Estate in a strong democracy -- although it appears he may be failing to do that. This is something we worked very hard to embrace during my time leading the Office of Public Affairs inside the Defense Department. When I took over in 2008, our relationship with the news media was certainly strained. But when we met with controversy, I insisted that we not shy away from granting media access. It was often difficult, but it was the right thing to do. For example, even when faced with stiff criticism from certain quarters, we successfully lifted the ban on news coverage of the transfer of U.S. service member remains at Dover Air Force Base. I also fought to allow news organizations access to the trials at Guantanamo Bay. With the support of then-Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England, we did our best to create an environment where the media had about the same access there that they would have at a trial on a U.S. military base. This was something the American people needed to see. Those are just two examples. But they serve to show why Trump should immediately provide his traveling press corps more access -- because leaving them behind on trips keeps Americans in the dark. And that's unacceptable in a turbulent world where any crisis can unfold at any moment. The public must know how the president is responding. Likewise, leaving people to learn about his activities from foreign leaders is, frankly, outrageous. This is an easy fix. Every president has done this. And there's more he should do. Trump should insist that the agencies he inherits comply quickly with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. To boot, he should enlist the help of the Republican-controlled Congress to support stronger language for FOIA laws. He should also hold more news conferences. Earlier this year, the media criticized Hillary Clinton for her failure to hold a news conference for 278 days. That criticism helped persuade her to begin taking questions from the media on a regular basis again. But now, Trump himself has gone almost 115 days since his last news conference. And while some of Trump's supporters have suggested that his very active Twitter account serves as a replacement for news conferences, this couldn't be further from the truth. He must answer questions on the terms of reporters, in public. That's an important distinction. These will be especially important in the lead-up to inauguration, as the public demands to know the names and qualifications of potential Cabinet selections, along with his near-term policy objectives. Lastly, he should vocally commit to ensuring press freedoms and protection for his traveling press pool. The fact is that reporters covering his campaign events were often harassed by supporters. Again, while this is unacceptable, it's also an easy fix. On my first day on the job at the Pentagon, I asked then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates for his ""commander's guidance."" He replied: ""Help me break down the blast walls that go up around this place whenever we have bad news."" I took that to heart. During my time there, I can't recall a single instance where Gates didn't take my recommendation to talk to a reporter. That doesn't mean every reporter got their interview every time they asked. But we were accommodating as often as the secretary's demanding schedule allowed. He clearly believed in the principle of maximum disclosure with minimum delay. Trump should heed that lesson. If he intends to follow through on his mandate for change, he'll make an effort to be better than his predecessors on transparency. That's how he can rebuild the confidence Americans have lost in their leaders. But, as president, he has to lead. He has to set the right tone. And he needs to do it quickly if he expects his agencies to follow suit. Let's hope he does."

(Gary Tramontina/Bloomberg)  Environmentalists are terrified of a Trump presidency. So are climate campaigners. But some observers say Trump's peculiar campaign promises -- and in particular, his pledge to help rescue the ailing coal industry -- could, ironically, help to deliver one of the key missing pieces that researchers say is needed to fix climate change. That piece is called ""carbon capture and storage,"" or for short, CCS. It actually refers to a nascent bevy of technologies that would allow for the stripping of carbon dioxide from various industrial processes, ranging from steel manufacturing to coal burning, and then sequestering it beneath the ground. In many cases, the pure streams of carbon dioxide can actually be used to help push more oil out of the earth in a procedure called ""enhanced oil recovery,"" potentially improving the economic value of the entire process. ""If coal is to have a future, it needs to have CCS,"" said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman who has tried to convince fellow conservatives that climate change is the real thing. Yet CCS has been struggling in recent years. The Energy Department has withdrawn funding from several massive projects, and the Kemper project in Mississippi, being managed by the large utility Southern Company, has been faulted for cost overruns. Currently there are 38 major projects underway around the world, including three in the United States that are just about to come online. But renewable energy has received massively more investment than CCS in recent years, notes a recent report from the Global CCS Institute. None of that, however, changes the fact that CCS is a technology that is believed to be essential to battling climate change, not only because it can take the climate bite out of coal but because it can also strip carbon from many other industrial processes, like the production of ethanol, cement, and steel. August bodies like the International Energy Agency and the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have underscored this conclusion. Indeed, there are visions of pairing CCS together with biomass burning, and thereby creating a ""negative emissions"" technology called ""BECCS"" (bioenergy and carbon capture and storage) that would burn plants or trees for energy, capture and bury the resulting carbon dioxide, and then let subsequent plant regrowth stow away even more. The result would be a net subtraction of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. None of this would necessarily be the impetus for Trump, of course. Rather, CCS could play into his oft repeated pledge to save the coal industry. In this case, by lowering the climate impact of coal burning, CCS could help save it from environmental regulations, as well as a from broader business and investment decisions anticipating those kinds of regulations. And it could do so not just in the U.S., where coal may not be able to make much of a rebound, but around the globe. Or as Benjamin Sporton, the chief executive of the World Coal Association, recently put it in a statement, ""It's essential that we recognise that accelerated carbon capture and storage (CCS) development and deployment is critical to meeting the Paris Agreement climate goals. CCS is safe, reliable, cost-effective, and efficient - reducing emissions from coal power production by up to 90%."" On the campaign trail, Trump certainly didn't articulate any detailed pro-CCS policies. But he did allude to ""clean coal,"" which is tantamount to the same thing. ""I frankly am optimistic about what a Trump administration will do for carbon capture,"" said Jeff Erikson, general manager for the Americas of the Global CCS Institute, although he cautioned that it was ""too soon to tell."" But Erikson said if Trump wants to exploit domestic energy resources, CCS makes a great deal of sense. ""The technology can be exported to other countries, so it puts the U.S. in the position of really creating...a new tech industry,"" he added. The most obvious way to support CCS is through research funding. The Department of Energy has already been doing that. Presumably that's something Trump's administration would continue. But it's only the beginning of what's possible. Advocates point in particular to a provision in the tax code called 45Q, which currently provides a $20 per ton tax credit for injecting CO2 underground ""in secure geological storage,"" and a $10 per ton credit for injections that lead to enhanced oil recovery, followed by underground storage. But these credits could be raised substantially, notes John Thompson, who heads the fossil transition project at the Clean Air Task Force, and that would probably be very effective in incentivizing the industry. ""It's more U.S. oil, it's oil that displaces what would have come from overseas, and by the way, it also has a climate benefit,"" Thompson said. The other problem is that 45Q has a cap: The credits can only be gained for 75 million tons of stored carbon dioxide in total, of which at least 35 million have been claimed so far. That's a lot of CO2, but considering the scale of what's required to start fixing climate change, it's actually still only a beginning. Legislation has already been proposed to enhance 45Q while also raising the size of its credits substantially, and support has been pretty bipartisan. Sponsored by senators Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), it has eight Republican co-sponsors, including majority leader Mitch McConnell. In an interview, Heitkamp said she thought the legislation could potentially advance between now and the end of the year. And she emphasized that one goal is building a technology that the U.S. can export to countries that are going to be burning coal no matter what -- but where some of the emissions might still be reduced with CCS. ""People who think that the United States of America taking single action without developing technologies will solve what they perceive to be a climate problem globally, that's just a formula for failure,"" Heitkamp said. It's not hard to see Trump and his Republican allies in Congress supporting legislation like this. However, there are more sweeping policy changes that the United States could install that would further advantage CCS -- but that might not be as politically palatable. Taxing emissions of carbon, or regulating them through a policy like the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, would further help CCS to compete in the marketplace. Basically, it would make the competition tougher for its energy sector rivals that emit more CO2. However, politically, these seem far less likely to garner Republican support (Trump has pledged to reverse the Clean Power Plan). It's important to acknowledge there's also resistance from some environmental groups to CCS. Blasting the Kemper Project in Mississippi and also legislation like Heitkamp's that could provide it with a tax boon, Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Lukas Ross recently stated, ""This disaster is billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule. Kemper is a stark reminder of why carbon capture and sequestration is a waste of our tax dollars and a false solution to the climate crisis."" But again, many scientists and energy wonks focused on the climate problem feel differently. In 2014, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted that when it comes to simulations of the future of our energy system and the amount of climate change that it brings, ""Many models could not limit likely warming to below 2degC if bioenergy, CCS and their combination (BECCS) are limited."" Trump's pledges to rescue coal by battling domestic environmental regulations may not give the industry the lift it hopes, because market forces have been the real problem for companies. But in looking to the future, advancing CCS could actually make a difference for the climate and the industry."

(Steve Helber/Associated Press)  There has been plenty of talk this month about media blind spots and coastal elitism, about Twitter echo chambers and what happens when America pulls a big ol' surprise on its pundit class. I know, I know, stick to sports. But after years of immersing myself in the Redskins name debate, this all felt more than a little familiar. The comparison isn't perfect, and the stakes of a presidential election are a bit grander than those of an NFL branding debate. But I think there are real similarities, and perhaps a few lessons for the media. How staying tight with your own like-minded set can make it harder to sense what's happening outside that bubble. How things that seem obvious and indubitable in Northwest D.C. or Brooklyn could play a bit differently elsewhere. How calling someone a racist might feel accurate, but might not be the most persuasive tactic for rallying support. Ditto with insisting that you're on the right side of history. And how a wave of media and celebrity unanimity in a contentious debate not only doesn't guarantee success, but in fact might have the opposite effect. That last thought is particularly resonant this week, with the Redskins starring on ""Sunday Night Football."" Because the most polarizing moment of the entire Redskins name debate might have been during a 2013 ""Sunday Night Football"" broadcast, when Bob Costas joined the then-growing chorus of voices calling for a name change. ""It's an insult, a slur, no matter how benign the present-day intent,"" he said, in halftime remarks that were covered by just about every sports outlet in the country. Was this Daniel Snyder's Walter Cronkite moment? It felt that way in real time. In retrospect, it appears close to the opposite. Defenders of the name still cite Costas as a prime example of what they are fighting against: a late-coming outsider without a real stake in the game. An out-of-touch blowhard trying to tell them how they should think and what they should believe. A know-it-all elitist dictating for the simple masses what is right and what is wrong. Just look at some of the comments on our initial Costas story. ""It's like an English class competition with these guys, who can find the most soaring rhetoric, the most self-righteous ways to justify their cause of the moment,"" one dissenter wrote. ""Costas must think he will be part of the 'in group' with a seat at the table of the elites,"" another wrote. ""Dan Snyder, continue to stand your ground."" ""Costas and his merry band can rant on all they want,"" a third wrote. ""Danny Snyder deserves credit for ignoring the PC Posse and malcontents and effectively telling them to . . . whatever."" ""Dan Snyder -- Be nice but as Churchill said 'Never give in,' "" a fourth wrote. ""Now we all know Dan Snyder is far (far, far, far, infinity) from perfection,"" a fifth wrote. ""However, all Redskin fans can relate to the love of our team, and team name. . . . Give credit to Dan Snyder for standing up for it."" How many minds did Costas change? And how many others did he convince to do the unthinkable: defend the oft-loathed team owner. Sure, many mocked and detested Snyder's hard-line stance, but has he ever been as loved by hardcore fans as when he refused to back down from people such as Costas? Think now of that widely-shared post-election piece by CBS News's Will Rahn, who reflected on the ""unbearable smugness"" of the political press, and how ""profession-wide smugness and protestations of superiority"" have lessened the media's power. Think of how Trump never backed down from his attackers and instead picked fights with his critics -- his version of Snyder's ""NEVER -- you can use caps."" ""The more they try to attack him, the more we love him,"" one Trump supporter told the BBC, and to a lesser degree that happened with Snyder. Both men remained unpopular, but the notion that they were under attack seemed to generate some level of sympathy. Because it wasn't just Costas going after the team name. It was ""The View"" and ""The Daily Show,"" ""South Park"" and the ESPYs, Peter King and James Brown, Larry King and Terry Bradshaw. It was the local newspapers that stopped using the Redskins name, and The Washington Post's legion of anti-name columns. At least five Post sports columnists either spoke out against the name or stopped using it, as did at least two Metro columnists, a Kids Post columnist, at least four op-ed columnists, several guest contributors and the paper's editorial board (repeatedly). Which reminds me again of the election: of Beyonce and Springsteen, of LeBron and Lena Dunham, of John Oliver destroying Trump and Samantha Bee disemboweling him, of the overwhelming array of newspapers that endorsed Clinton, of the Quinnipiac University poll that found almost 9 of 10 Republicans believed that news organizations were biased against Trump, of the Washingtonian headline about how The Post didn't employ a single pro-Trump columnist. Even members of the conservative intelligentsia (Charles Krauthammer, Kathleen Parker) crossed over to the progressive path on both issues, leaving blunter voices (Sean Hannity, Sarah Palin) to stand up for the other side. And instead of settling the matter, the elitist consensus led to at least some hopes of a comeuppance. ""BUT THE INTERNET AND BOB COSTAS TOLD US THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE OUTRAGED BY THIS!!!"" one happy Redskins defender wrote after a 2016 Washington Post poll found that most Native Americans were not offended by the team name. ""As Trump cleared each hurdle during the campaign, and I saw how the media, the establishment and celebrities tried to derail him, my hope began to grow that I would be able to witness their collective heads explode when he was successful,"" one Trump supporter told The Post. ""Tuesday night was beyond satisfying to watch unfold."" ""The liberal media's made-up controversies divide our country,"" Palin said of the Redskins debate. ""After months of going back and forth, I decided to listen to [Trump] directly and not through minced and filtered quotes from the mainstream media,"" another Trump supporter told The Post. ""You people in the media, and the little circle of elite know-it-alls from D.C., are breathtakingly stupid,"" a Redskins defender wrote on another anti-Redskins staff editorial. ""Surprise! There is a whole other part to this country outside of your newsroom walls that actually thinks differently from the mostly liberal ideas that most news outlets put out there,"" a Trump supporter told the Guardian after the election. The issues actually converged, with Trump speaking out in defense of the team name, Hillary Clinton advocating a change, and a pro-Trump super PAC running local ads about their disagreement. ""I'm no fan of Trump, but if you wanted to understand why he is on the rise, you could do a lot worse than reading this article,"" wrote one Post commenter on a Redskins name story, months before the election. No, the issues aren't identical, starting with the fact that a large majority of Americans say they support the Redskins name, while a minority of registered voters supported Trump. My liberal friends might argue that Trump winning an election and the Redskins triumphing in the polls doesn't mean history won't ultimately be on their side. I just remember the years of arguments I've had with Redskins defenders, people with whom I might not ordinarily debate serious societal issues. They saw a concerted and outrageous media effort to tip the scales. They insisted that my friends -- who just about uniformly believe the team's name should change -- are out of touch. (My local precinct went 86 percent for Clinton, and I'd guess a vote on changing the team name in upper Northwest wouldn't be terribly different.) They told me that media Twitter wasn't the real world, that it created a phony idea of consensus for a stance that wasn't actually ascendant. And they argued that a politically correct onslaught from big-city elites would only strengthen their convictions. On that last score, anyhow, they may have had a point."

The moves, among dozens under consideration from his transition team, follow an intense and extended backlash from Trump's decision on Sunday to appoint Steve Bannon, a man celebrated by the white nationalist movement, to serve as his chief strategist and senior adviser.  ""After winning the presidency but losing the popular vote, President-elect Trump must try to bring Americans together - not continue to fan the flames of division and bigotry,"" said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. She called Bannon's appointment ""an alarming signal"" that Trump ""remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign."" His inauguration just 66 days away, however, Trump focused on building his team and speaking to foreign leaders. He remained sequestered in Trump Tower in New York. Inexperienced on the international stage, the Republican president-elect spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone. His transition office said in a readout that ""he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia."" Trump has spoken in recent days with the leaders of China, Mexico, South Korea and Canada. At the same time, Trump was considering tapping Richard Grenell as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He would be the first openly gay person to fill a Cabinet-level foreign policy post. Grenell, known in part for aggressive criticism of rivals on Twitter, previously served as U.S. spokesman at the U.N. under President George W. Bush. Trump was also weighing whether to select Michigan GOP chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, a niece of chief Trump critic and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney. She would be the second woman ever to lead the Republican National Committee -- and the first in four decades.  ""I'll be interested in whatever Mr. Trump wants,"" McDaniel told The Associated Press on Monday, adding that she was planning to seek the Michigan GOP chairmanship again. Appointing McDaniel to run the GOP's political arm could be an effort to help the party heal the anger after a campaign in which Trump demeaned women. The appointment of Grenell, who has openly supported same-sex marriage, could begin to ease concerns by the gay community about Vice President-elect Mike Pence's opposition to same-sex marriage during his time as Indiana governor. The personnel moves under consideration were confirmed by people with direct knowledge of Trump's thinking who were not authorized to publicly disclose private discussions. They stressed that the decisions were not final. Internal deliberations about staffing come a day after Trump made overtures to warring Republican circles by appointing Bannon and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus as his White House chief of staff. The former media executive, who led a website that appealed to the so-called ""alt-right"" -- a movement often associated with efforts on the far right to preserve ""white identity,"" oppose multiculturalism and defend ""Western values."" Priebus on Monday defended the media mogul, saying the two made an effective pair as they steered Trump past Democrat Hillary Clinton and toward the presidency. He sought to distance Bannon from the incendiary headlines on his website, saying they were written by unspecified others.  ""Together, we've been able to manage a lot of the decision making in regard to the campaign,"" Priebus told NBC's ""Today."" ''It's worked very, very well."" President Barack Obama avoided any direct criticism of Trump's personnel moves during an afternoon news conference, suggesting that the new president deserves ""room to staff up.""  ""It's important for us to let him make his decisions,"" Obama said. ""The American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see."" The outgoing president encouraged Trump, however, to embrace a unifying tone.  ""It's really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign,"" Obama said. ""And I think that's something he will -- he will want to do."" Trump's hires were, at first glance, contradictory, though they fit a pattern of the celebrity businessman creating a veritable Rorschach test that allowed his supporters to see what they wanted. Priebus, who lashed the RNC to Trump this summer despite some intraparty objections, is a GOP operative with deep expertise of the Washington establishment that Trump has vowed to shake up. He has close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Wisconsinite. Bannon, meanwhile, helped transform the Breitbart News site into the leading mouthpiece of the party's anti-establishment wing, which helped fuel the businessman's political rise.

Republican Donald Trump's campaign had until 5 p.m. Monday to seek a recount. His campaign did not do so, officially sealing Clinton's victory in the state. Clinton won the small state by roughly 2,700 votes. That's less than 1 percent of the 732,000 ballots cast. New Hampshire drew intense attention from the two campaigns in the final days before the election. Clinton campaigned in the state two days before the election and sent President Barack Obama on her behalf the next day. Trump visited the state twice in the final five days. Trump's edge in the Electoral College now stands at 290 to 232, with only Michigan still to be called by The Associated Press. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In a Facebook post, Netanyahu seized on the moment and rejected longstanding accusations that he contributed to the climate of violence before Rabin's killing.  ""Rabin's assassination was a shocking political assassination that we all renounce. Since the assassination there have been ongoing attempts to distort the historic truth and to attribute the incitement that preceded the assassination to me,"" he wrote. He then posted old videos of his denunciations of the incitement, adding: ""judge for yourselves."" Rabin was shot dead after a peace rally on Nov. 4, 1995 by Yigal Amir, who opposed Rabin's policy of trading land to the Palestinians for peace. Repeated attempts to make peace since then have evaporated, leaving bouts of violence in their wake. In the months before the killing, political hard-liners branded Rabin a traitor and some extremists called for his death. Critics charged that the climate of incitement inspired Amir to kill Rabin. In one famous incident, Netanyahu, then the opposition leader, addressed a protest in downtown Jerusalem where demonstrators held posters portraying Rabin in an Arab headscarf or Nazi uniform. Netanyahu claims he didn't see the banners or hear violent chants. Netanyahu vehemently opposed Rabin's planned concessions and only grudgingly accepted the concept of a Palestinian state after taking office for a second term in 2009. He has since distanced himself from those comments and during his re-election campaign last year said he would not allow a Palestinian state on his watch. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The 52-page indictment accuses the once-rising Republican star of brazen efforts to make money, such as buying World Series tickets with campaign funds and reselling them at a profit. When Schock risked missing a connecting flight for a European vacation, the indictment alleges, he paid a private aircraft company more than $8,000 out of his campaign account to fly him from Peoria to Washington. Schock spent $40,000 in government funds to redecorate his Washington office, including $5,000 on a chandelier, and asked the House to reimburse him for nearly $30,000 worth of camera equipment, prosecutors allege. The indictment says he ran up a $140,000 mileage tab over six years, reimbursements for 150,000 more miles than his vehicles actually traveled. The 35-year-old Republican from Peoria is charged in the 24-count indictment with nine counts of wire fraud, five of falsification of election commission filings, six of filing false federal income tax returns, two of making false statements and one each of mail fraud and theft of government funds. A conviction on just one count of wire fraud alone carries a maximum 20 year prison sentence. His arraignment is set for Nov. 21.  ""Mr. Schock held public office at the time of the alleged offenses, but public office does not exempt him or anyone else from accountability for alleged intentional misuse of public funds and campaign funds,"" the U.S. attorney in Springfield, Jim Lewis, said in a statement announcing the indictment. After the charges were announced, Schock's attorney, George Terwilliger, contended in a phone interview that many of the issues singled in the indictment were administrative ones that many members of Congress grapple with.  ""It's baffling to me that the government would think that it's a proper exercise of discretion to make criminal mountains out of these molehill issues,"" he said. ""It was evident to us from the first day they subpoenaed him that they had every intent to embarrass and humiliate him."" Terwilliger said in an earlier written statement that ""these charges are the culmination of an effort to find something, anything, to take down Aaron Schock."" Also prodigious fundraiser for the GOP, Schock resigned in March 2015 amid intensifying scrutiny over real estate deals, extensive travel that he documented on his social media accounts and other spending documented by The Associated Press and other media outlets. The reports raised questions about improper mileage reimbursements, trips on donors' aircraft and more. The former congressman downplayed the allegations in June, saying any wrongdoing was ""honest mistakes."" In his own statement Thursday, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Schock said he never intentionally did anything wrong and that he was eager to defend his name and reputation.  ""As I have said before, we might have made errors among a few of the thousands and thousands of financial transactions we conducted, but they were honest mistakes -- no one intended to break any law,"" he said. The charges are the culmination of a 19-month investigation that included two grand juries that Schock said ""poked, prodded, and probed every aspect of my professional, political, and personal life.""  ""Like many Americans, I wanted to have faith in the integrity of our Justice Department,"" he said. ""But after this experience, I am forced to join millions of other Americans who have sadly concluded that our federal justice system is broken and too often driven by politics instead of facts."" According to the indictment, Schock also ran up a $140,000 mileage tab over six years, reimbursements for 150,000 more miles than his vehicles actually traveled. Another time, he asked the House to reimburse him for nearly $30,000 worth of camera equipment. In 2014, Schock bought four Super Bowl tickets for $10,025 paid for by one of his campaign funds, according to court documents. He then resold the tickets at a $1,975 profit and never reimbursed his campaign for the initial purchase price. Jeff Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who is now a Chicago-based managing director of investigations at Berkeley Research Group, said some of Schock's alleged schemes were elaborate but resulted in relatively petty payouts compared to other high-profile corruption cases that have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars.  ""It's greed but on a comparatively small scale -- for Illinois,"" Cramer said. Schock's attorney said he was confident any future jurors would acquit Schock and would also be ""disgusted with what their own government has done."" Schock began his career as a successful 19-year-old write-in candidate for school board and became the youngest legislator ever elected to the Illinois General Assembly at 23. In Congress, he replaced Republican Ray LaHood, who became President Barack Obama's Transportation secretary. Ray LaHood's son, Republican Darrin LaHood, took Schock's congressional seat after a special election in September 2015, following Schock's resignation. If Schock is ultimately convicted, he could join an already lengthy list of Illinois politicians who ended up in prison in recent years. Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. was convicted for spending $750,000 in campaign money on fur capes, mounted elk heads, Hollywood memorabilia and other personal items. Two of the state's recent governors, Republican George Ryan and Democrat Rod Blagojevich, were convicted of wide-ranging corruption. And former House Speaker Dennis Hastert was convicted in a hush-money case. ___ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed from Washington. ___ Follow Michael Tarm on Twitter at http://twitter.com/mtarm Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/08/a-new-theory-for-why-trump-voters-are-so-angry-that-actually-makes-sense/	A new theory for why Trump voters are so angry — that actually makes sense	"      The Post's Dan Balz explores some of the factors behind President-elect Donald Trump's victory against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Update: After the election, we chatted with Cramer again about rural whites, Trump, and racism.  Regardless of who wins on Election Day, we will spend the next few years trying to unpack what the heck just happened. We know that Donald Trump voters are angry, and we know that they are fed up. By now, there have been so many attempts to explain Trumpism that the genre has become a target of parody. But if you're wondering about the widening fissure between red and blue America, why politics these days have become so fraught and so emotional, Kathy Cramer is one of the best people to ask. For the better part of the past decade, the political science professor has been crisscrossing Wisconsin trying to get inside the minds of rural voters. Well before President Obama or the tea party, well before the rise of Trump sent reporters scrambling into the heartland looking for answers, Cramer was hanging out in dairy barns and diners and gas stations, sitting with her tape recorder taking notes. Her research seeks to understand how the people of small towns make sense of politics -- why they feel the way they feel, why they vote the way they vote.   [How Trump won: The revenge of working-class whites]   There's been great thirst this election cycle for insight into the psychology of Trump voters. J.D. Vance's memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy"" offers a narrative about broken families and social decay. ""There is a lack of agency here -- a feeling that you have little control over your life and a willingness to blame everyone but yourself,"" he writes. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild tells a tale of perceived betrayal. According to her research, white voters feel the American Dream is drifting out of reach for them, and they are angry because they believe minorities and immigrants have butted in line. Cramer's recent book, ""The Politics of Resentment,"" offers a third perspective. Through her repeated interviews with the people of rural Wisconsin, she shows how politics have increasingly become a matter of personal identity. Just about all of her subjects felt a deep sense of bitterness toward elites and city dwellers; just about all of them felt tread on, disrespected and cheated out of what they felt they deserved.      Donald Trump campaigned in Wisconsin for the fifth time since he became the Republican nominee, in hopes that he can overcome poll predictions and make the consistently blue state go red. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)   Cramer argues that this ""rural consciousness"" is key to understanding which political arguments ring true to her subjects. For instance, she says, most rural Wisconsinites supported the tea party's quest to shrink government not out of any belief in the virtues of small government but because they did not trust the government to help ""people like them."" ""Support for less government among lower-income people is often derided as the opinions of people who have been duped,"" she writes. However, she continues: ""Listening in on these conversations, it is hard to conclude that the people I studied believe what they do because they have been hoodwinked. Their views are rooted in identities and values, as well as in economic perceptions; and these things are all intertwined.""   [Yes, working class whites really did make Trump win. No, it wasn't simply economic anxiety.]   Rural voters, of course, are not precisely the same as Trump voters, but Cramer's book offers an important way to think about politics in the era of Trump. Many have pointed out that American politics have become increasingly tribal; Cramer takes that idea a step further, showing how these tribal identities shape our perspectives on reality.          1 of 26       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                           Skip Ad   x           How the world is reacting to results of the U.S. election      View Photos   People around the globe watched as Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States.

Cramer shows that there are nuances to political rage. To understand Trump's success, she argues, we have to understand how he tapped into people's sense of self. Recently, Cramer chatted with us about Trump and the future of white identity politics. (As you'll notice, Cramer has spent so much time with rural Wisconsinites that she often slips, subconsciously, into their voice. We've tagged those segments in italics. The interview has also been edited for clarity and length.) For people who haven't read your book yet, can you explain a little bit what you discovered after spending so many years interviewing people in rural Wisconsin?  Cramer: To be honest, it took me many months -- I went to these 27 communities several times -- before I realized that there was a pattern in all these places. What I was hearing was this general sense of being on the short end of the stick. Rural people felt like they not getting their fair share. That feeling is primarily composed of three things. First, people felt that they were not getting their fair share of decision-making power. For example, people would say: All the decisions are made in Madison and Milwaukee and nobody's listening to us. Nobody's paying attention, nobody's coming out here and asking us what we think. Decisions are made in the cities, and we have to abide by them. Second, people would complain that they weren't getting their fair share of stuff, that they weren't getting their fair share of public resources. That often came up in perceptions of taxation. People had this sense that all the money is sucked in by Madison, but never spent on places like theirs. And third, people felt that they weren't getting respect. They would say: The real kicker is that people in the city don't understand us. They don't understand what rural life is like, what's important to us and what challenges that we're facing. They think we're a bunch of redneck racists. So it's all three of these things -- the power, the money, the respect. People are feeling like they're not getting their fair share of any of that. Was there a sense that anything had changed recently? That anything occurred to harden this sentiment? Why does the resentment seem so much worse now? Cramer: These sentiments are not new. When I first heard them in 2007, they had been building for a long time -- decades. Look at all the graphs showing how economic inequality has been increasing for decades. Many of the stories that people would tell about the trajectories of their own lives map onto those graphs, which show that since the mid-'70s, something has increasingly been going wrong. It's just been harder and harder for the vast majority of people to make ends meet. So I think that's part of this story. It's been this slow burn. Resentment is like that. It builds and builds and builds until something happens. Some confluence of things makes people notice: I am so pissed off. I am really the victim of injustice here. So what do you think set it all off? Cramer: The Great Recession didn't help. Though, as I describe in the book, people weren't talking about it in the ways I expected them to. People were like, Whatever, we've been in a recession for decades. What's the big deal?  Part of it is that the Republican Party over the years has honed its arguments to tap into this resentment. They're saying: ""You're right, you're not getting your fair share, and the problem is that it's all going to the government. So let's roll government back."" So there's a little bit of an elite-driven effect here, where people are told: ""You are right to be upset. You are right to notice this injustice."" Then, I also think that having our first African American president is part of the mix, too. Now, many of the people that I spent time with were very intrigued by Barack Obama. I think that his race, in a way, signaled to people that this was different kind of candidate. They were keeping an open mind about him. Maybe this person is going to be different. But then when the health-care debate ramped up, once he was in office and became very, very partisan, I think people took partisan sides. And truth be told, I think many people saw the election of an African American to the presidency as a threat. They were thinking: Wow something is going on in our nation and it's really unfamiliar, and what does that mean for people like me?  I think in the end his presence has added to the anxieties people have about where this country is headed. One of the endless debates among the chattering class on Twitter is whether Trump is mostly a phenomenon related to racial resentment, or whether Trump support is rooted in deeper economic anxieties. And a lot of times, the debate is framed like it has to be one or the other -- but I think your book offers an interesting way to connect these ideas. Cramer: What I heard from my conversations is that, in these three elements of resentment -- I'm not getting my fair share of power, stuff or respect -- there's race and economics intertwined in each of those ideas. When people are talking about those people in the city getting an ""unfair share,"" there's certainly a racial component to that. But they're also talking about people like me [a white, female professor]. They're asking questions like, how often do I teach, what am I doing driving around the state Wisconsin when I'm supposed to be working full time in Madison, like, what kind of a job is that, right? It's not just resentment toward people of color. It's resentment toward elites, city people. And maybe the best way to explain how these things are intertwined is through noticing how much conceptions of hard work and deservingness matter for the way these resentments matter to politics. [Stop blaming racism for Donald Trump's rise] We know that when people think about their support for policies, a lot of the time what they're doing is thinking about whether the recipients of these policies are deserving. Those calculations are often intertwined with notions of hard work, because in the American political culture, we tend to equate hard work with deservingness. And a lot of racial stereotypes carry this notion of laziness, so when people are making these judgments about who's working hard, oftentimes people of color don't fare well in those judgments. But it's not just people of color. People are like: Are you sitting behind a desk all day? Well that's not hard work. Hard work is someone like me -- I'm a logger, I get up at 4:30 and break my back. For my entire life that's what I'm doing. I'm wearing my body out in the process of earning a living.  In my mind, through resentment and these notions of deservingness, that's where you can see how economic anxiety and racial anxiety are intertwined. The reason the ""Trumpism = racism"" argument doesn't ring true for me is that, well, you can't eat racism. You can't make a living off of racism. I don't dispute that the surveys show there's a lot of racial resentment among Trump voters, but often the argument just ends there. ""They're racist."" It seems like a very blinkered way to look at this issue. Cramer: It's absolutely racist to think that black people don't work as hard as white people. So what? We write off a huge chunk of the population as racist and therefore their concerns aren't worth attending to? How do we ever address racial injustice with that limited understanding? Of course [some of this resentment] is about race, but it's also very much about the actual lived conditions that people are experiencing. We do need to pay attention to both. As the work that you did on mortality rates shows, it's not just about dollars. People are experiencing a decline in prosperity, and that's real.   [Death predicts whether people vote for Donald Trump]   The other really important element here is people's perceptions. Surveys show that it may not actually be the case that Trump supporters themselves are doing less well -- but they live in places where it's reasonable for them to conclude that people like them are struggling. Support for Trump is rooted in reality in some respects -- in people's actual economic struggles, and the actual increases in mortality. But it's the perceptions that people have about their reality are the key driving force here. That's been a really important lesson from this election. I want to get into this idea of deservingness. As I was reading your book it really struck me that the people you talked to, they really have a strong sense of what they deserve, and what they think they ought to have. Where does that come from?  Cramer: Part of where that comes from is just the overarching story that we tell ourselves in the U.S. One of the key stories in our political culture has been the American Dream -- the sense that if you work hard, you will get ahead. Well, holy cow, the people I encountered seem to me to be working extremely hard. I'm with them when they're getting their coffee before they start their workday at 5:30 a.m. I can see the fatigue in their eyes. And I think the notion that they are not getting what they deserve, it comes from them feeling like they're struggling. They feel like they're doing what they were told they needed to do to get ahead. And somehow it's not enough. Oftentimes in some of these smaller communities, people are in the occupations their parents were in, they're farmers and loggers. They say, it used to be the case that my dad could do this job and retire at a relatively decent age, and make a decent wage. We had a pretty good quality of life, the community was thriving. Now I'm doing what he did, but my life is really much more difficult.  I'm doing what I was told I should do in order to be a good American and get ahead, but I'm not getting what I was told I would get.  The hollowing out of the middle class has been happening for everyone, not just for white people. But it seems that this phenomenon is only driving some voters into supporting Trump. One theme of your book is how we can take the same reality, the same facts, but interpret them through different frames of mind and come to such different conclusions. Cramer: It's not inevitable that people should assume that the decline in their quality of life is the fault of other population groups. In my book I talk about rural folks resenting people in the city. In the presidential campaign, Trump is very clear about saying: You're right, you're not getting your fair share, and look at these other groups of people who are getting more than their fair share. Immigrants. Muslims. Uppity women. But here's where having Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump running alongside one another for a while was so interesting. I think the support for Sanders represented a different interpretation of the problem. For Sanders supporters, the problem is not that other population groups are getting more than their fair share, but that the government isn't doing enough to intervene here and right a ship that's headed in the wrong direction. One of the really interesting parts of your book is where you discuss how rural people seem to hate government and want to shrink it, even though government provides them with a lot of benefits. It raises the Thomas Frank question -- on some level, are people just being fooled or deluded?  Cramer: There is definitely some misinformation, some misunderstandings. But we all do that thing of encountering information and interpreting it in a way that supports our own predispositions. Recent studies in political science have shown that it's actually those of us who think of ourselves as the most politically sophisticated, the most educated, who do it more than others. So I really resist this characterization of Trump supporters as ignorant. There's just more and more of a recognition that politics for people is not -- and this is going to sound awful, but -- it's not about facts and policies. It's so much about identities, people forming ideas about the kind of person they are and the kind of people others are. Who am I for, and who am I against? Policy is part of that, but policy is not the driver of these judgments. There are assessments of, is this someone like me? Is this someone who gets someone like me? I think all too often, we put our energies into figuring out where people stand on particular policies. I think putting energy into trying to understand the way they view the world and their place in it -- that gets us so much further toward understanding how they're going to vote, or which candidates are going to be appealing to them. All of us, even well-educated, politically sophisticated people interpret facts through our own perspectives, our sense of what who we are, our own identities. I don't think that what you do is give people more information. Because they are going to interpret it through the perspectives they already have. People are only going to absorb facts when they're communicated from a source that they respect, from a source who they perceive has respect for people like them. And so whenever a liberal calls out Trump supporters as ignorant or fooled or misinformed, that does absolutely nothing to convey the facts that the liberal is trying to convey. If, hypothetically, we see a Clinton victory on Tuesday, a lot of people have suggested that she should go out and have a listening tour. What would be her best strategy to reach out to people? Cramer: The very best strategy would be for Donald Trump, if he were to lose the presidential election, to say, ""We need to come together as a country, and we need to be nice to each other."" That's not going to happen. As for the next best approach ... well I'm trying to be mindful of what is realistic. It's not a great strategy for someone from the outside to say, ""Look, we really do care about you."" The level of resentment is so high. People for months now have been told they're absolutely right to be angry at the federal government, and they should absolutely not trust this woman, she's a liar and a cheat, and heaven forbid if she becomes president of the United States. Our political leaders have to model for us what it's like to disagree, but also to not lose basic faith in the system. Unless our national leaders do that, I don't think we should expect people to. Maybe it would be good to end on this idea of listening. There was this recent interview with Arlie Hochschild where someone asked her how we could empathize with Trump supporters. This was ridiculed by some liberals on Twitter. They were like, ""Why should we try to have this deep, nuanced understanding of people who are chanting JEW-S-A at Trump rallies?"" It was this really violent reaction, and it got me thinking about your book. Cramer: One of the very sad aspects of resentment is that it breeds more of itself. Now you have liberals saying, ""There is no justification for these points of view, and why would I ever show respect for these points of view by spending time and listening to them?"" Thank God I was as naive as I was when I started. If I knew then what I know now about the level of resentment people have toward urban, professional elite women, would I walk into a gas station at 5:30 in the morning and say, ""Hi! I'm Kathy from the University of Madison""? I'd be scared to death after this presidential campaign! But thankfully I wasn't aware of these views. So what happened to me is that, within three minutes, people knew I was a professor at UW-Madison, and they gave me an earful about the many ways in which that riled them up -- and then we kept talking. And then I would go back for a second visit, a third visit, a fourth, fifth and sixth. And we liked each other. Even at the end of my first visit, they would say, ""You know, you're the first professor from Madison I've ever met, and you're actually kind of normal."" And we'd laugh. We got to know each other as human beings. That's partly about listening, and that's partly about spending time with people from a different walk of life, from a different perspective. There's nothing like it. You can't achieve it through online communication. You can't achieve it through having good intentions. It's the act of being with other people that establishes the sense we actually are all in this together. As Pollyannaish as that sounds, I really do believe it.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/11/08/time-to-take-political-ignorance-seriously/	Time to start taking political ignorance seriously	"    Even more than most others, the awful 2016 election cycle has highlighted the dangers of political ignorance. Data has long shown that voter ignorance is widespread on both sides of the political spectrum . A high percentage of the public is often ignorant of even very basic information, such as which party controls Congress, which officials are responsible for which issues, and how the federal government spends our tax money.  This year, public ignorance has likely played a major role in giving us an unusually painful set of choices on election day, especially (but not exclusively) by contributing to the rise of Donald Trump. Most of the ignorance out there is not the result of stupidity or venality on the part of voters. It is, to a great extent, entirely rational behavior driven by the fact that there is so little chance that any one vote will change the outcome of an election.  If your only reason to become informed about politics is to make better choices at the ballot box, that turns out not to be much of an incentive at all. The odds that your vote will decide the outcome are infinitesimally small. From the standpoint of the ordinary voter, it makes sense to pay little attention to political issues, and instead devote most of your time and effort to other matters.  As former British Prime Minister Tony Blair puts it, ""[t]he single hardest thing for a practising politician to understand is that most people, most of the time, don't give politics a first thought all day long. Or if they do, it is with a sigh...., before going back to worrying about the kids, the parents, the mortgage, the boss, their friends, their weight, their health, sex and rock 'n' roll.... For most normal people, politics is a distant, occasionally irritating fog."" This year, the fog is even more irritating - and much scarier - than usual. But it does not seem to have caused voters to become better-informed. Such behavior is perfectly rational. The ignorance of any one voter makes almost no difference. But individually rational ignorance can cause great harm when many millions of voters behave the same way.  In addition to making little effort to seek out information, most voters also do a poor job of evaluating what information they do know. Instead of acting as truth seekers, they instead function as ""political fans"" cheering on Team Red or Team Blue, overvaluing any information that confirms their preexisting views while ignoring or downplaying anything that cuts the other way.  This kind of bias is exacerbated by the intense partisanship and polarization that has descended upon American politics in recent years. Partisans like to claim that the other side's voters are influenced by ignorance, and they are often right to think so. But rarely consider the possibility that the same may be true of their own party's supporters.  By some measures, partisan hatred is now more widespread than racial and ethnic prejudice, and certainly more socially acceptable. Even if voters somehow become significantly better informed than they are, they may not get much value out of their knowledge unless we can figure out how to curb the ""tribal"" partisan hatred that has engulfed our politics.  Political ignorance is not unique to the United States, but is also a serious problem in many other democracies. In recent years, dangerous demagogic movements of both the right and the left have grown in influence in many European democracies, and elsewhere. Public ignorance is a major contributor to the racism, xenophobia, and zero-sum thinking that facilitate their rise. Sadly, such exploitation of ignorance is often more effective in periods of slow economic growth, like the one we are experiencing now.  Several important works warning about the dangers of political ignorance have been authored by libertarian scholars like Bryan Caplan and Jason Brennan (I critiqued Brennan's insghtful recent book on the subject here). But left of center experts have also sounded the alarm, including Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels' excellent recent book Democracy for Realists (which I reviewed here).  You don't have to be a libertarian skeptic about government to worry about political ignorance. Indeed, the greater the role you want democratic government to play in society, the more you have reason to worry about the quality of voter decision-making. The more powerful the state is, the greater the harm it can cause if ignorant voters entrust that power to the wrong hands. Here too, the rise of Trump is a warning we should take seriously. He is not the first or (most likely) the last demagogue of his kind.  I have long argued that we can best alleviate the dangers of political ignorance by limiting and decentralizing the power of government, and enabling people to make more decisions by ""voting with their feet"" rather than at the ballot box. Foot voters deciding where they want to live or making choices in the private sector have much stronger incentives to become well-informed than ballot box voters do. There is much we can do to enhance opportunities for foot voting, particularly among the poor and disadvantaged. Limiting and decentralizing government power could also reduce the enormous scope and complexity of the modern state, which make it virtually impossible for voters to keep track of more than a small fraction of its activities.  But I am open to considering a variety of other possible strategies for addressing the problem, including voter education initiatives, and ""sortition,"" directly incentivizing citizens to increase their knowledge, among others. Perhaps the best approach to is a combination of different measures, not relying on some one silver bullet.  Large-scale reform efforts aside, there are a number of things individual voters can do to become better-informed and less biased. I am not optimistic that very many will actually do so. But even modest, incremental progress might help somewhat. In this post, my purpose is not to prove that my preferred solution is the best, but to urge you to take the problem of public ignorance more seriously - and to recognize that it goes deeper than just the shortcomings of your political adversaries of the moment. Voter ignorance one of the most important weaknesses of modern democratic government. If we do not erect better safeguards against it, the situation could easily get even worse than it has already become. "
