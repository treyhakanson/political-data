(Thomas Roy/The Union Leader via Associated Press)  Americans on both sides of the aisle are still reeling from the results of the presidential election. There's much about our political environment that is disturbing, but with every election there are new and promising figures who come onto the scene. One such figure is Chris Sununu, son of former New Hampshire governor John H. Sununu and brother of former senator John E. Sununu, who won a hard-fought race to replace New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who was elected to the U.S. Senate. Sununu, at age 42 becomes the country's youngest governor. He hit the right notes in his post-election remarks. ""I think we all want to see as seamless of a transition as we can to make sure we're addressing all the needs of the state and moving forward in as realistic and practical a manner as possible,"" he said. ""Campaigns are hard-fought . . . but as a state, we have to come together."" The Concord Monitor reported: Sununu promised bipartisan work on issues that are fast approaching, including balancing the state budget and passing Medicaid expansion. ""Being a good listener from the beginning is a top priority,"" Sununu said. ""Making sure we're all on the same page, because if we're fighting, pushing back on each other for six months in the legislative session, nothing's going to get done."" Meanwhile in Wisconsin, Republican Mike Gallagher a Marine Corps veteran with a doctorate in international relations from Georgetown University and former counterterrorism staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, won the Wisconsin 8th Congressional District. Gallagher, who also is credited with getting Gov. Scott Walker up to speed on national security matters during the latter's brief presidential run, set an optimistic tone: He said he believes ""our best days are still ahead of us"" and voters from northeastern Wisconsin proved that ""the flame of democracy"" remains lit despite divisive rhetoric displayed during the election season. ""Our message was simple, it's that the world could use more of what we're doing right here in Wisconsin and less of what they're selling in Washington D.C.,"" Gallagher said. ""In Wisconsin, we work hard to take care of our families. We're good neighbors. We're nice. We pay our debts. We take care of our veterans, and we respect law enforcement, and when we have a little money left over, we help those in need. In other words, we place faith in ourselves and each other and not in government.."" For their gracious words in victory and their commitment to public service, we can say, well done gentlemen."

Korea prosecutors want to question president over scandal	 SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean prosecutors want to question President Park Geun-hye this week over suspicion that she let a shadowy longtime confidante manipulate power from behind the scenes, an official said Sunday. It would be the first time that a sitting South Korean president has been questioned by prosecutors. The explosive scandal is the most serious challenge for Park, whose public apologies have done little to calm public anger. Prosecutors are seeking to question Park face-to-face on either Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest, a prosecution official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was underway, said prosecutors conveyed their position to Park's office and were awaiting a response. The president's office said earlier Sunday that it can work out its position on a Park investigation as early as Tuesday. It said it needs time to review when and how Park should be investigated. In addition to allegedly manipulating power, the president's confidante, Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a late cult leader who emerged as Park's mentor in the 1970s, is also suspected of exploiting her presidential ties to bully companies into donating tens of millions of dollars to foundations she controlled. Choi was formally arrested on Nov. 3 on charges of fraud and abuse of power. Prosecutors have until Nov. 20 to formally charge her. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people flooded Seoul's streets to demand Park's resignation in what may be South Korea's largest protest since it shook off dictatorship three decades ago. In an attempt to stabilize the situation, Park said Tuesday that she would let the opposition-controlled parliament choose her prime minister. But opposition parties say her words are meaningless without specific promises about transferring much of her presidential powers to a new No. 2. Under South Korean law, a sitting president has immunity from prosecution except in cases of treason, but many scholars say a president can still face investigation. Park has 15 months left in her term. If she steps down before the end of it, an election must be held within 60 days. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(EPA/JIM LO SCALZO)  LONDON -- U.S. elections are fascinating -- often in a strange way -- to many Europeans. They sometimes (secretly) admire the raucous politicking and grass roots passions, but also scratch their heads over the seemingly endless campaigns, the primaries and the singular rules of the Electoral College. To some European observers, those features explain ""everything that's wrong"" with the United States. Yet some E.U. countries have recently considered adopting some elements of the U.S. electoral system. Here's a roundup of similarities and differences between voting in the United States and in France, Germany and Britain. France: A nod toward the primaries Like in various other European nations (including Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia), the French have to go to the polls twice to elect their president. Whereas all parties can present their own candidates, a second polling date will be decisive. In the second round, only the two highest-performing candidates will be on the ballot paper. Usually, the two remaining candidates belong to the Republicans and the Socialist Party. During next year's general elections, however, there is a high likelihood that voters will have to choose between a mainstream candidate and right-wing politician Marine Le Pen, who represents the National Front party.    French President Francois Hollande stands for a family photo during the E.U. MED Mediterranean Economies Summit in Athens on September 9 2016. (ARIS MESSINIS/AFP via Getty Images)  Presidential elections in France would probably deserve their own explanatory post. One recently introduced key feature is worth pointing out, though: Both parties now hold public primaries, burying a previous candidate-selection process which was frequently criticized as intransparent. The introduction of primary debates, aired on national French television, has not gone without criticism. Some allege that intraparty debates could hurt the two mainstream parties and benefit the right-wing National Front, because they would most likely leave the ""surviving"" candidates' deeply damaged. French observers have pointed at the recent U.S. campaign to make their arguments. ""Primaries are a sign of our political parties' weaknesses,"" Remi Lefebvre, a political-science professor at Lille University in northern France, was quoted as saying by Politico. Britain: The queen still plays a role The British frequently discuss whether the royal family should still exist in the 21st century. Following elections, however, the monarch's role is an integral part of the process. British voters cast their ballot for their favored parliament candidate. Depending on what party is able to get most seats in parliament, the monarch appoints that party's candidate as prime minister. Britain's electoral system favors major parties over smaller ones, such as the right-wing U.K. Independence Party. As in the United States, online voting does not exist in Britain -- so, either you show up yourself, select a ""proxy"" who votes for you, or you rely on postal vote. British citizens living in Northern Ireland, however, need to give a reason why they want to use postal voting. The idea behind that restriction is to limit its use, as observers and government representatives have in the past expressed concerns over voter fraud in the postal process in Northern Ireland. Germany: A rather unexciting election procedure Almost two decades ago, the German government decided voting procedures should be modernized. Back then, computers seemed like the perfect choice to replace ballot papers. German courts, meanwhile, were less convinced and have since stopped efforts to introduce online-voting or computers at official polling places. Although Germany has a president, the main political power is with the chancellor's office. Current Chancellor Angela Merkel is the head of the German government and makes all relevant decisions, whereas the German president (currently Joachim Gauck) primarily fulfills ceremonial functions and signs laws. Following general elections, it can be unknown for days who the next chancellor will be. Like in many European nations, Germany's political system relies on coalition building. The parliament deputies of that government coalition then elects the chancellor.    A German flag flies over steam a the Reichstag building that hosts the Bundestag(lower house of parliament) on January 7, 2015 in Berlin. (LUKAS SCHULZE/AFP via Getty Images)  General election campaigns leading up to that announcement in Germany have been described as rather dull. The campaigns are usually less aggressive than in other countries, and far less emotional than those in the United States. The most relevant event during the campaigning is a TV debate between the leading candidates for the chancellor's office. Television election coverage does not have the same impact as it does in the United States, though. Germany is a country with a multitude of magazines and local as well as national newspapers which significantly influence what voters think of the candidates. Former Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, for instance, once said his decision to give interviews to local newspapers rather than national TV networks helped him win the elections. His successor, Angela Merkel, prefers consensus building and often refrains from directly and aggressively debating her contenders.

Brad Tschida filed an ethics complaint against Gov. Steve Bullock, claiming that the governor ""has been illegally relying upon a state-paid attorney to represent him in [an] ethics matter."" In response, Montana Commissioner of Political Practices Jonathan Motl has threatened to impose ""severe penalties"" on Rep. Tschida, on the theory that the disclosure was a crime. Indeed, Commissioner Motl has emailed over 90 legislators ""reminding"" them ""that ethics complaints are confidential by law""; Mont. Code Ann. SS 2-2-136(D) indeed provides that ""The complainant ... shall maintain the confidentiality of the complaint ... until the commissioner issues a decision."" But how can this be? A representative (or anyone else) files a complaint alleging that a government official has committed misconduct -- and he can't talk about the complaint? Well, it can't be, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (which covers Montana) has expressly held in Lind v. Grimmer (9th Cir. 1994), striking down a similar Hawaii law: ""to the extent Haw.Rev. Stat. SS 11-216(d) prevents an individual from disclosing the fact that he filed a complaint with the Campaign Spending Commission, it is unconstitutional."" The Third Circuit took the same view in Stilp v. Contino, 613 F.3d 405 (3d Cir. 2010), striking down a similar ban: ""to the extent [the statute] prohibits a complainant from disclosing his own complaint and the fact that it was filed, unconstitutionally constrains political speech."" See also Cox v. McLean (D. Mont. 2014); In re Warner (La. 2009); and Petition of Brooks (N.H. 1996). And those court decisions are quite right. The government sometimes has authority to restrict people from revealing information that is disclosed to them in confidence by the government. But there's no basis for restricting people from publicizing accusations that they have conveyed to the government. And indeed, publicizing such accusations is often important political speech, whether in criticizing the person who is being accused, or in criticizing the commission that receives the accusation -- for instance, if the complainant wants to argue that the commission is being slow or biased in its treatment of the accusation. One can imagine some restrictions imposed by the government as employer on government employees who use internal complaint mechanisms, but the Montana statute applies to all complainants, and in any event the government-as-employer rules don't apply to restrictions on legislators -- see Bond v. Floyd (1966). Fortunately, Tschida -- represented by Montana lawyer Matthew Monforton (who won the Cox v. McLean case cited above) -- is challenging the speech prohibition and Commissioner Motl's threat to enforce that prohibition, both on First Amendment grounds and on the grounds that the communications with his fellow legislators were protected by the Montana Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause. I look forward to seeing the government's response. Here, incidentally, is the story behind the ethics complaint, as recounted in the motion; please recall that these are just allegations (some paragraph breaks added): On or about September 19, 2016, Representative Tschida filed an ethics complaint against Governor Steve Bullock and a member of his cabinet, Commerce Director Meg O'Leary. The complaint arose from Governor Bullock's illegal use of a state-owned aircraft to fly him and Director O'Leary to Missoula in August 2014 for purposes of attending a concert performed by Paul McCartney. The complaint alleges Governor Bullock and Director O'Leary attended the concert at the invitation of University of Montana President Royce Engstrom and Mary Engstrom, who invited Governor Bullock ""and a guest to join them in the President's Box to watch Sir Paul McCartney as he performs his 'Out There' concert."" The use of the state-owned aircraft by Governor Bullock and Director O'Leary and their acceptance of seating in the President's Box to attend the concert constituted illegal gifts under Montana law. After Representative Tschida filed the ethics complaint, Defendant Jonathan Motl ordered him not to disclose the existence of the complaint. On September 23, 2016, Andrew Huff, who serves as Legal Counsel to Governor Bullock and is a state-paid attorney, appeared telephonically on behalf of the Governor and requested an extension to respond to the complaint, which Defendant Motl granted. Representative Tschida was concerned about what appeared to be yet another misuse of state resources by Governor Bullock for personal purposes -- the use of a state-paid attorney to respond to allegations of personal ethics violations. Other Montana officials retain private counsel to respond to ethics complaints rather than rely upon state-paid attorneys. ... On October 24, 2016, Senator Dee Brown and Senator Bob Keenan, both of whom are members of the Montana Senate, sent a letter to Representative Tschida and other legislators to obtain support for convening a select committee to investigate allegations by state employees of misuse of state funds by Governor Bullock well as retaliation against state employees for blowing the whistle on him. These allegations included:  Former internal agency auditors being discouraged from investigating fraudulent payments; Seven long-tenured auditors of the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) being fired after raising red flags about agency activity; DPHHS auditors being bullied by state officials after speaking up about potentially fraudulent payments made to undocumented welfare recipients; Employees being stripped of responsibilities, isolated from colleagues and forced into retirement after refusing to perform fraudulent acts; Officials accusing competent employees of insubordination as a means of getting rid of those who blow the whistle; Auditors being discouraged or prevented from fully investigating questionable transactions, sometimes through bullying; Confidential settlement payments being made to former state employees since January of 2013 as well as allegations that some of the settlements were the result of wrongful termination complaints brought against the state.  Representative Tschida responded on November 2, 2016, with his own letter confirming his support for a select committee. He included with that letter a copy of the ethics complaint as well as a letter from Defendant Motl to Mr. Huff, Governor Bullock's state-paid counsel, memorializing the extension Motl granted to Huff and Governor Bullock. Evidence of Governor Bullock's illegal use of a state attorney to defend himself against ethics charges is directly relevant to the planned select committee. Representative Tschida would not have been able to disclose evidence of Governor Bullock's misconduct in the ethics proceeding without also disclosing the existence of the ethics proceeding itself. Later on November 2, 2016, the Great Falls Tribune obtained a copy of Representative Tschida's letter and published a story about it. Defendant Motl informed the Tribune that he would seek a ""severe penalty"" against Representative Tschida for informing fellow legislators of the ethics complaint. On November 3, 2016, Defendant Motl was interviewed on radio station KGVO in Missoula, Montana. During that interview, he stated the following with regard to Representative Tschida: Defendant Motl: There's, uh, the main consequence that befalls an official who, um, violates a mandatory duty is official misconduct. Interviewer: And that would be a charge in civil court? Defendant Motl: No, it's criminal court. Interviewer: It's a criminal court charge? Defendant Motl: Yes. Defendant Motl further stated that he did not expect anyone to file charges against Representative Tschida before Election Day. On that same day, Defendant Motl told the Helena Independent Record that Representative Tschida faced six months in jail for his communication with fellow legislators. On November 4, 2016, Defendant Motl was interviewed by the Associated Press. During the interview, Defendant Motl claimed that Representative Tschida violated the gag rule again by recounting the contents of the ethics complaint in the complaint filed in this Court. He also claimed that Representative Tschida ""has now brought Monforton into the mess."" He stated further that ""What we've got here is a pretty serious magnification of an original improper action by Mr. Tschida,"" and that ""Monforton didn't improve Mr. Tschida's situation. He made it worse. And now he's involved in it himself."" He repeated his assertion that Representative Tschida committed ""official misconduct."" Defendant Motl declined to say what penalties undersigned counsel could face, ""the appropriateness or inappropriateness of anyone's actions will be straightened out afterward."""

"   by Matt Wuerker / Politico (courtesy of the cartoonist)  FEW PEOPLE spend as much time with the president -- even if they never meet the nation's leader -- than an American political cartoonist. As a visual satirist, you effectively ""live"" with the commander in chief up close, day after day. You intensely study everything from facial features to fiscal policies. You know the president's cues and quirks and inflections like the back of your ink-stained hand. So Election Day, in myriad ways, is an event of extreme self-interest for editorial artists. Forget about how they're voting. The question of their profession becomes: Whom are they pulling for as a satirist? Whom would they rather study and skewer for the next four years, if not beyond? Nine top political cartoonists had their campaign handiwork on display last week in Washington, for an event titled ""Hillary vs. Trump Cartoon Debate."" Here is how those cartoonists responded when asked: President Trump or President Clinton -- which would be better for you as a cartoonist?    by Matt Wuerker / Politico 2016  MATT WUERKER (Politico): I'm okay with either -- as a cartoonist. I think it's safe to say there will be no shortage of surprises, shenanigans and scandals, no matter who wins. Another old cliche about Washington is that D.C. is like a cruise ship, and every new administration results in a turnover of the crew and passengers. No matter who is involved in the coming turnover, it's becoming clear the ship is pretty messed up, the rudder is broken and the new crew, like the old crew, will be unruly. It will not be a smooth cruise. Given all that, there clearly will be no shortage of things to cartoon about. I just hope to not get too seasick.    by Kal / The Economist 2016  KAL (Baltimore Sun / The Economist): The chaos that a Trump presidency would unleash would likely supply more cartoon fodder. My professional challenge would be: How do you make a train wreck funny? President Hillary's reign would be a close second, with her loudmouth opponents in and out of Washington helping cartoonists with their bombast and grist.    (courtesy of Ann Telnaes / The Washington Post)  ANN TELNAES (Washingtonpost.com): I'm not sure which one would bring out my best work, since both administrations would open up issues I've commented on for years and that I have strong opinions about. Trump has already said he wants to curtail freedom of speech -- specifically for the press -- and I'm sure he would go after the satirists just as Turkey's President Erdogan has, since they both appear to have the same thickness of skin. I have no doubt if Hillary becomes president, we will see just how deep sexism runs in American society and politics. I guess if I had to choose between the two [sides], both which would definitely energize my creativity, I'd have to choose a Hillary presidency -- since at least I'd be able to draw outside of a prison cell.    by MIKE LESTER / Washington Post Writers Group 2016  MIKE LESTER (Post Writers Group): Before the 2008 election, my liberal friends were telling me Obama would be good for [me as a] cartoonist. That didn't turn out to be the case with the first black president. I see no reason to think the first female president would be any different.    by Daryl Cagle (courtesy of Cagle Cartoons 2016)  DARYL CAGLE (Cagle Cartoons): I think Hillary will be better for me as a cartoonist. She has a wonderful depth of character for cartoonists, with lots of old stories that everyone knows; she comes with Bill Clinton -- and she doesn't know that she is funny, which is funny. If Trump wins, brace for four years of lousy, Trump-monster-name-calling-cartoons.    by TOM TOLES / The Washington Post 2016  TOM TOLES (The Washington Post): I can't even contemplate a President Trump. I think it would be the biggest political mistake I've seen in my lifetime. That leaves Clinton. We'll have to see which way she takes her administration.    by Steve Artley / Artleytoons.com 2016  STEVE ARTLEY (Artleytoons.com): I can easily capture the one dimensional, Donald Trump in a few lines. He has two expressions: the freshly fed, self-satisfied Cheshire Cat grin and his ever pervasive pedantic blowfish look. Combined with his outrageous statements, he's easy to lampoon. Hillary Clinton is more complex, multi-dimensional and harder to read. I find her a challenge every time I try to render her caricature.    by MICHAEL RAMIREZ 2016  MICHAEL RAMIREZ (Weekly Standard): I think either will be good for cartoonists. They are both deeply flawed candidates. On the other hand, I have never had a problem with trying to cartoon against any administration. Even the best candidates for president will ultimately enact policies that we will disagree with at some point. America has some very acute and severe problems; whoever gets elected president will have their hands full.    by Rick McKee / Augusta Chronicle (CagleCartoons.com) 2016  RICK McKEE (Augusta Chronicle): It's a toss-up. Trump would be so much fun because he's a walking cartoon character, from his looks to his mannerisms to his willingness to say the looniest stuff. He would be an endless source of material. A President Hillary would be so wonderful for a conservative cartoonist like myself, because she's such a scandal machine. Most cartoonists tend to skew left, so they might not be as willing to go after Hillary with the same gusto. You toss Bill in the mix and you've got the recipe for cartoonist heaven.

6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/11/08/the-gops-class-warfare-mistake/	The GOPâ€™s class warfare mistake	"   Donald Trump at a campaign event in Sarasota, Fla., the day before the election. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  The political landscape was ripe this year for a credible Republican alternative to Democrat Hillary Clinton. But that never meant that merely any alternative would do. Donald Trump failed to pass the smell test among general-election voters. Even if they had doubts about Clinton, they often had even greater doubts about Trump. Instead of making the election a referendum on his rival presidential nominee, Trump made it about himself. Instead of talking policy, he talked slogans and platitudes. Instead of offering a vision, he offered vulgarity. For many longtime Republicans, the party's turn to an anti-establishment message of class warfare, which has generally been part of the Democratic mantra, is deeply depressing. The Republican Party's increased reliance on -- and political traction with -- alienated, less educated, less affluent white voters as the country is becoming more educated and more diverse suggests that too many Republicans either don't care about winning or don't understand what is happening in the country. According to the Nov. 3-5 NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, Trump is now doing a bit better than Mitt Romney did among non-Hispanic whites with less than a college degree. But Trump is doing far worse than Romney among non-Hispanic whites with at least a college degree.   ['Something is happening that is amazing,' Trump said. He was right.]   In the 2012 presidential election, Romney beat President Obama among non-Hispanic whites with at least a college degree by 14 points -- 56 percent to 42 percent. Clinton is now winning that same group by 10 points, 51 percent to 41 percent, according to the survey. Even more striking, Romney won non-Hispanic women with at least a college degree by six points (52 percent to 46 percent) in 2012, but Clinton is now leading among those same voters by 21 points (57 percent for Clinton to 36 percent for Trump). The GOP's post-2012 election autopsy noted that the electorate is changing and the party needs to appeal to Latinos, Asian Americans and younger voters to remain competitive. I'm sure the autopsy's authors never thought that their party would have trouble with more-educated and more-affluent voters. But Republican primary voters nominated a man this time who disparaged Mexicans and other Latinos, talked to and about women as if this were the 1950s, and repelled younger voters and upscale voters by sounding intolerant and appearing erratic. African American turnout may well dip his year, but an already documented surge in Latino registration and turnout will damage the GOP today and probably long-term -- a surge that follows directly from Trump's campaign.   [Trump's candidacy is severely damaging GOP efforts to court Hispanic voting bloc]   Oddly, Trump, the rich real estate investor, somehow convinced working-class white Republicans and independents that he would be their advocate. Given his lifestyle and past behavior, does anyone really believe that he would rather hang out with an unemployed coal miner than with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon? Trump started off his campaign promising to motivate a flood of white voters who had never voted before. But he never understood -- and many in the media overlooked the fact -- that for every white voter flocking to his campaign, Trump would lose at least one mainstream Republican who could not support him, because of his language, behavior and lack of preparation for the presidency. Though this will come as no surprise to regular readers of this column, national surveys show Clinton the clear favorite in the election. The final NBC-Wall Street Journal poll shows her up by four points (44 percent to 40 percent, with 6 percent for Gary Johnson and 2 percent for Jill Stein), as does The Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll (47 percent to 43 percent, with Johnson at 4 percent and Stein at 2 percent).   [Hillary Clinton has enough electoral votes to win the White House in final Fix map]   Most other reliable surveys, such as the latest Fox News, Bloomberg and CBS News-New York Times polls, show Clinton ahead by at least three points. While that isn't a landslide, it confirms a narrow but clear Clinton popular-vote and electoral-vote advantage. The Senate outlook, on the other hand, remains uncomfortably murky. Republicans will successfully protect three of their own initially vulnerable Senate seats: Ohio, Florida and Arizona. Democrats now appear likely to hold their open Nevada seat, which Republicans had hoped to swipe. With Democrats expected to knock off GOP incumbents in Illinois and Wisconsin, Republicans need to hold Indiana's open seat and reelect three of four at-risk Republican incumbents to keep the Senate: Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Patrick J. Toomey in Pennsylvania, Richard Burr in North Carolina and Roy Blunt in Missouri. That certainly is possible, but it is very difficult.   [The Daily 202: Why Democrats are likelier than not to win the Senate majority]   As I have noted previously, the House is not and has not been in play this cycle. Ever. Democrats simply had too few opportunities to net 30 seats. Trump's current, more competitive status actually helps a few GOP House candidates, and that, combined with the distinctions that voters have made between Trump and down-ballot Republican candidates, should keep Democratic House gains to a minimum. Trump's likely loss raises dozens of questions for the Republican Party. How does it recover? Who leads it back? Is it still headed for a showdown between uncompromising conservatives and pragmatic conservatives that never took place because of Trump? Will grass-roots Republicans understand that upper-class voters, Hispanics and Asian Americans are crucial to the party's recovery? Clinton also has plenty of decisions. Will she shock her adversaries and allies by trying to unite the country, which probably means appointments and policy proposals that her progressive wing won't like? Or will she let the Elizabeth Warren-Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party pull her left? One final point should not be missed: Even with his impending defeat, Trump's performance is mind-boggling. Given his campaign style, obvious personality issues, middle-of-the-night tweets, lack of knowledge, amateurish campaign, thin-skinned reaction to criticism and generally inappropriate comments about many people and groups, it is surprising that he will receive as many votes as he will. The animosity we all witnessed this year reminded me of Paul Taylor's insightful observation about the current shape of American politics in ""The Next America: Boomers, Millennials, and the Looming Generational Showdown,"" with the Pew Research Center: These days Democrats and Republicans no longer stop at disagreeing with each other's ideas. Many in each party deny the other's facts, disapprove of each other's lifestyles, avoid each other's neighborhoods, impugn each other's motives, doubt each other's patriotism, can't stomach each other's news sources, and bring different value systems to such core social institutions as religion, marriage and parenthood. It's as if they belong not to rival parties but alien tribes. Trump's showing in the polls, though he will probably fall short on Election Day, confirms the deep fissure in the country and suggests that the next few years will not be any easier than the past few.

After all of the tumult and tedium of a long, ugly presidential campaign, Election Day is all about which candidate can win enough states to get to 270 electoral votes.(AP Photo/Eric Gay) (Eric Gay/AP)  With hours until Election Day, the wildest U.S. presidential race in memory has grown more competitive in most of the battleground states, although Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton continues to hold a broader path to victory than Republican Donald Trump. The political map suggests that Clinton can lose several key states long assumed to be in her column and still reach the 270 electoral votes she needs to win. Trump, meanwhile, has a new reason for optimism, as a growing number of states appear potentially within his grasp. But to win, he would have to take nearly all of them. The 11th-hour fluidity of the race had the two campaigns scrambling the travel plans of the candidates and their top surrogates. In Trump's case, it is an effort to grab what he considers emerging opportunities in the sprint for the finish line; in Clinton's, as insurance against surprises Tuesday in territory she has considered hers.      Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win View Graphic     Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win  Trump said Saturday that he and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, will hold campaign events in Minnesota, a state that has not voted for a Republican since 1972. A Trump campaign official insisted that the move was not a feint and that internal polling showed the Republican only three points behind Clinton there. In a sign that Democrats are suddenly anxious about Michigan, on Monday, Clinton will be in Grand Rapids and President Obama will campaign in Ann Arbor. Trump and Pence will also be in Michigan in the next two days. At a rally Saturday in Tampa, which is a bellwether of crucial Florida, Trump said his campaign is moving aggressively to seize upon openings it sees across the country.      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump outlined what he sees as his path to victory, predicting wins in big swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida, during a campaign rally on Nov. 5 in Reno, Nev. (The Washington Post)   ""We're going into what they used to call Democrat strongholds where we are now tied or leading,"" the billionaire real estate developer said. He predicted that he will win Florida and Pennsylvania -- which both voted for Obama in the past two elections -- and said that he is ""doing phenomenally well in North Carolina,"" where both candidates have invested significant time and resources over the past few weeks.   Later Saturday evening, Trump was rushed off the stage by security officials at a rally in Reno, Nev., as some kind of disturbance was taking place in the front of the room where he was speaking. People in the crowd scattered as U.S. Secret Service and uniformed officers jumped the barricades to apprehend an unidentified man and lead him out of the room. Local reports said the man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites, 33, was released shortly after the incident. Trump later concluded his rally without further incident. The Secret Service said in a statement that no weapon was found. Crites said he was holding ""Republicans against Trump"" sign when he was tackled by people around him.      Clinton held a rally in south Florida that was cut short by rain. She was set to hold an event Saturday night in Philadelphia that would feature a performance by pop star Katy Perry, whose song ""Roar"" is featured in Clinton's closing ad running in 11 battleground states. Beyonce and Jay Z headlined a concert for Clinton on Friday night in Cleveland.        View Graphic      Also on the line Tuesday is control of the Senate, where Republicans are defending 24 seats, compared with 10 for the Democrats. Trump's performance at the top of the ticket could determine whether Democrats pick up the five seats they need to regain the majority -- or four, if Clinton wins and her vice president, Tim Kaine, has a tiebreaking vote. ""The tightening of the race in many of these battleground states is providing a little bit of lift to our Senate races, and in some of these cases, it is going to be decisive,"" said Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). ""I think we're really on the razor's edge,"" Law said of his party's prospects of holding the Senate. ""Trump's final position in all of this is uncertain. I don't think he's close enough to the pin yet to lift most of these races into the win column."" On Thursday, the Cook Political Report predicted that Democrats will pick up four to six Senate seats, enough to gain control if Clinton is elected, but less than its earlier forecast of a five- to seven-seat gain. Republicans also are bracing to lose seats in the House, which would diminish the largest majority they have held there since 1928. Neither side, however, expects a wave large enough to restore control to Democrats, who lost it in the 2010 midterm elections. Clinton began the final weekend of campaigning with a narrow lead over Trump in the ongoing Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll. Through Friday night, the rolling survey showed Clinton at 48 percent and Trump at 43 percent, among likely voters. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson was at 4 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein was at 2 percent.  That's the largest margin between the two major-party candidates this past week -- and a sign that Clinton may be starting to recover from a fresh round of attention to her use of a private email account and server while she was secretary of state. Clinton's decision to ignore a directive that official business be conducted where possible on a government email account has dogged her since it became public last year. It reinforced the public's long-standing doubts about her honesty and judgment, and sparked an FBI investigation of whether national security might have been compromised. A new chapter in that saga opened on Oct. 28, when FBI Director James B. Comey informed Congress that new emails, possibly pertaining to the investigation of Clinton's private account, had surfaced during a separate inquiry involving disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin.      View Graphic      Before that development, Clinton appeared in control of enough states to put her well over the 270 electoral-vote mark. The tightening of the polls since then has left enough states in doubt this weekend to force a modification of those earlier predictions. A quartet of battlegrounds has dominated the Clinton campaign's calculation throughout the fall campaign: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Obama won those four in 2008 and all of them but North Carolina in 2012. Until recently, it appeared that Trump needed to sweep all four to overcome Clinton's and the Democrats' electoral-map advantage. But as the race has tightened, Ohio seems to have moved into the Republican column, and other states outside those four have potentially come into play. The GOP nominee is looking to states including Michigan, New Hampshire and Wisconsin to make up a potential deficit, should he not win Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. One force that is factoring into both sides' assessments is that more Americans are voting before Election Day, either by mail or in person. Upward of 37 million voters have already cast ballots. In key states such as Colorado, Florida, Nevada and North Carolina, it is likely that over half the electorate will have done so before Tuesday. Those votes have not been counted, but strategists from both parties are poring over the data about who has voted and to get a preview of the contours of the 2016 electorate. The figures also give them a sense of possible trouble spots. In past years, more Democrats have participated in early voting. This year, however, it appears as though Republicans are closing the early-voting gap in many key states. But it is not clear whether this reflects greater enthusiasm and better organization on their part, or just a shift in the behavior of people who would have shown up anyway on Tuesday. Polling and early-voting data suggest a number of electoral cross currents as the race heads into its final two days. Clinton has struggled to reassemble some version of the coalition that twice elected Obama, the combination of African Americans, Hispanics, single women and young voters. Hispanic turnout appears strong, based on early-voting data. That is a major reason Democrats think Nevada will be an easy win for Clinton, although the polls are close and Trump scheduled a stop there Saturday. Clinton also has a double-digit advantage among female voters, who in 2012 accounted for 53 percent of the electorate.   But the Clinton campaign is worried about turnout among African Americans. The Democratic nominee and her top surrogates have made repeated visits to major cities in an effort to stoke enthusiasm among those voters, and she will end her campaign with a big rally in Philadelphia. ""Based on early vote returns, we know that strong get-out-the-vote efforts in the African American communities in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and North Carolina will be needed to win on Tuesday,"" AFL-CIO political director Michael Podhorzer said. For Trump, one challenge is a socioeconomic split in the white vote. He has strong support among white voters without college degrees, but has seen an erosion in the traditional support for Republican nominees among white voters with college degrees. This has been a central dynamic of the campaign, and Clinton campaign officials view it as a potentially decisive factor in an electoral map that has shifted since the last election.      In less than a week, the United States will have a new president-elect. These are the pivotal points in Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's campaigns that led to this moment. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   The split between college-educated and non-college-educated white voters has moved states such as Colorado and Virginia toward the Democrats, while giving Trump more hope of capturing industrial states in the Midwest such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio, where there is a higher concentration of non-college-educated voters. Democrats remain skeptical that Trump, who boasts of his ability to bring new Republican voters to the polls, can crack what in recent cycles has been a ""blue wall"" in the upper Midwest. ""Trump is making a last bet on white, non-college-educated men in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,"" Podhorzer said. ""That's been tried by Republican candidates before, and it hasn't worked."" Entering the final days of campaigning, Clinton maintains her advantage over Trump in voters' perceptions of their qualifications and readiness to serve as president. By 55 percent to 36 percent, likely voters say she is more qualified, and by 58 percent to 32 percent they say she has a better temperament and personality to serve as president. Clinton also is considered the candidate who better understands ""the problems of people like you"" and has ""the stronger moral character."" In both cases, her advantage over Trump is in the single digits. However, on the question of who is more honest and trustworthy, voters are more evenly divided, with 44 percent citing Trump and 40 percent naming Clinton. Perceptions of Clinton's honesty have deteriorated in the final 10 days of the campaign, particularly when there was intense focus on renewed attention to her email problems.  Scott Clement in Washington; Jose DelReal, traveling with Trump; and Anne Gearan, traveling with Clinton, contributed to this report. "

Hereâ€™s how to get kids really engaged in it.	"   George Washington presiding over the Constitutional Convention, 1787. Hand-colored engraving of a 19th-century illustration. (North Wind Picture Archives via AP Images)  We talk a lot about civic education, usually about how little of it too many students get in school. In this charged election season, the subject has rarely, if ever, been more relevant. But here's a different kind of discussion: how kids are actually being engaged in it. Below are several examples that could be used in any school. The first piece is written by Molly W. Andolina, an associate professor of political science at DePaul University, and Hilary G. Conklin, a former social studies teacher and associate professor in the College of Education at DePaul University.  Andolina's publications examine generational differences in civic engagement, with particular attention to the political activism of Millennials. Conklin's research focuses on teacher preparation, social studies education, and middle grades education. The second piece comes from by Steve Zemelman, director of the Illinois Writing Project and author of From Inquiry to Action. All of the authors are working in Illinois, where a law was recently passed requiring high schools to provide a semester-long civics course that includes community action of some kind. It says, ""Civics course content shall focus on government institutions, the discussion of current and controversial issues, service learning, and simulations of the democratic process."" But what they say can apply across the country.   By Molly W. Andolina and Hilary G. Conklin Educators around the country continue to wrestle with how to address this campaign season's unprecedented nature and historically divisive rhetoric.  Educators often use adult politics as an opportunity to engage young people in vital civic learning -- assigning debate-watching homework, conducting mock elections, and simulating campaigns and democratic processes. But in a presidential campaign season in which analysts have tallied candidates' interruptions of each other, and the public has questioned whether debates require mature audiences ratings, politicians could stand to take some civic cues from high school students. Alongside the discouraging adult antics of this year's election season, a more hopeful form of civic participation is brewing: young people across the country are learning to speak publicly about divisive, difficult issues, and they are also learning to listen to each other in the process. Last fall, we conducted research that examined what more than 200 high school students across the city of Chicago learned from participating in Project Soapbox, a civic education curriculum that is currently taking place in classrooms from Seattle to DC. The curriculum invites students across the country to ""tell the next president about an issue that affects your community"" and ""what should be done to address it."" As part of the Soapbox activities, students choose a community issue that is important to them, research the topic, learn about the elements of good rhetoric, and then write and deliver a speech to their peers, along with outside adult community members who serve as judges. What we found surprised us. Not only did students' participation in Project Soapbox cultivate adolescents' speech-writing and speaking skills -- essential proficiencies outlined in the Common Core English Language Arts Standards -- but it also fostered their listening and empathic skills. The students we studied chose serious speech topics that they face in their daily lives and felt strongly connected to: gun violence, relationship and domestic violence, racism and discrimination, depression and suicide, among other issues.   When they delivered their speeches in class, their peers listened attentively and provided supportive snaps and claps of encouragement. When we asked students what they thought they had learned as a result of participating in Project Soapbox, many reported -- as we observed ourselves -- that they learned speech-giving skills: how to organize their ideas, give evidence for a point, and use rhetorical devices. What we did not anticipate was the significant number of students (almost one out of every five) whose key lessons from the curriculum centered on listening to their peers and learning to appreciate the issues that others face. One student wrote, ""I learned a lot about my classmates' struggles...and things they think are important."" A student we interviewed said she realized, ""how every person goes through something different...maybe sometimes you might be able to relate to that, or it just makes you more aware of what people go through."" Another student observed, ""It kind of broadens your horizon, or your way of thinking, when [you're] interacting with somebody who had different experiences from you...I feel a little bit more sympathy for the topic than I did before the speeches."" Students not only learned valuable skills from giving their speeches, but through actively attending to their classmates' speeches, they also learned the value of listening. In other words, a curriculum designed to teach students how to speak also taught them how to listen. Although democratic orientations such as listening and cultivating empathy are often sidelined in the realm of formal civic education, our current political climate highlights their necessity. Indeed, research indicates that students need to develop tolerance, to cultivate the capacity to engage with people with whom they disagree, and, as University of Pennsylvania President and political scientist Amy Gutmann has argued, hone the ability to work collaboratively with others to reach solutions to common problems. Central to these democratic practices is the value of what University of Washington civic education scholar Walter Parker calls listening to strangers -- harnessing public school students' diversity as an asset in the deliberation over public problems. Essential components of listening to strangers are efforts to take the perspective of another (reciprocity), assuming one's understanding of someone else's ideas is incomplete (humility), and moving slowly before responding (caution). To be sure, democracy requires much of its citizens. Young people need to learn the fundamentals of the political system, including how our government functions, the premise and history of democracy, and the rights and privileges that citizens enjoy.  And schools play a pivotal, if unrealized, role in imparting these lessons to our youth. But when students are given the opportunity to do more than learn about facts and processes, and are taught to listen to others and to engage in controversial discussions at school, they experience even greater gains in civic skills and orientations. Moreover, they develop empathy, an integral element in social-emotional learning -- learning that sets the stage for many other forms of success. In an election year that 70 percent of voters say has ""brought out the worst in people,"" it's clear that the American public is yearning for better civic participation practices.  It's time to turn our attention away from the adults on the national stage and toward our youth. Teaching the next generation of citizens and leaders how to listen and learn from each other is a worthwhile investment towards a more civil and hopeful political future.    -0-0-0-0-0-     By Steve Zemelman Many teachers are struggling with how to guide classroom discussions about the 2016 election. But while there's plenty to consider about the campaign itself, a larger question hovers above it all: the sentiment of students, teachers, and many citizens across the country that they have no voice in decisions affecting their lives and work. When we asked a number of high school seniors in a struggling community who are old enough to vote, they said they wouldn't because they didn't see how their voice could make any difference. So while teachers may conduct learning activities around the election, perhaps it's even more important to do much more to develop a generation of citizens with the dispositions and skills to step up, connect with others, and take action to improve their lives and communities. Fortunately, school leaders and legislators are increasingly realizing the importance of students' civic learning and engagement. In Illinois, a new law requires high schools across the state to provide a civics course that includes community action of some kind. This is why I've been passionate about student civic engagement projects since I began learning about them a few years ago. In these projects, students don't just read, discuss, or role-play. They take the lead identifying an issue in their school or community, research it, plan, and then take action to try to address it. They learn by experiencing the real process of advocacy and change. I've seen in school after school, across grade levels and subject areas, how such projects change students' perceptions of themselves, giving them a sense of efficacy, a set of skills for promoting thoughtful action, a habit of respect and caring for one another, and a commitment to their academic learning as well. What do these projects look like? An outstanding Chicago high school teacher, Elizabeth Robbins, offered a powerful explanation in a TEDx talk that got me started on this. She described how students in one class, deeply concerned about teenage date violence, researched the issue, and disliking the school curricula they found on the topic, created their own. They had teachers in their school try it out and then proposed its adoption at a Chicago school board meeting. From there, they were referred to the schools CEO, who green-lighted it for use in high school classes across the city. You can view her talk here.  Yes, that's at an urban high school, but younger students in small towns can just as readily do this. Here's how the fifth graders at Park Forest school in State College PA tackle what they've named CHIRPS -- Current Human Issues Research Projects. The teachers start with community-building activities to tune them in to their peers' needs and outlooks, and provide lots of local news articles to alert them to community issues. Each student writes a proposal to explain an issue to individually explore, and once these are approved by the teacher and fellow students, the kids get to work researching and then creating web pages on their projects. One girl, for example, organized a cohort of fellow students to provide support for other kids who have disabilities or struggle with their learning. Another worked to establish a program for Saturday meals for students who qualified for free lunch during the week. It's important to ask whether the students, once they are adults, actually practice stronger civic engagement, and more research is needed to determine that. However, one study has shown that kids' attitudes toward civic participation grow stronger while still in school. And students testify to the power of this work. As one girl in Chicago commented, ""Before I didn't think I could actually make a difference, but now I am working with people at my church on anti-gang activities."" Of course, social action is hard and not every project goes smoothly. But kids are resilient. As a group of middle-schoolers campaigning against gun violence in their neighborhood explained, ""We thought we were going to change our city, but what we really did was change ourselves."" Numerous organizations help teachers add this kind of learning to their curricula. The one that inspired me is the Mikva Challenge, started in Chicago and now also working in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. (I do not work for them, myself.) Our country needs this. And we can make it happen.          "

It's true that Donald Trump's support has little to do with policies. It's not true, however, that those who support him have no rational or cogent reasons for their preference. They are misguided, in my view, but they aren't stupid, and we flatter ourselves by assuming their preference for Trump is evidence merely of economic forces they don't understand.      Donald Trump says the United States is too preoccupied with being politically correct. Here's how the presumptive Republican presidential nominee bashes the idea of being too PC. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   If the Trump supporters I've met and know are a fair representation of their outlook, what binds them together is a deep hatred for political correctness. No groundbreaking analysis there: Trump has railed about political correctness many times, and of course he relishes expressing himself in ways that can reasonably be called politically incorrect. He may be a bigot and a scoundrel, the thinking seems to be, but the one thing he isn't is politically correct. I don't dismiss that view. PC culture has been the source of jokes and satire for 25 years or more, but it's no less real for that. Trump's supporters aren't wrong to hate it.  But what is it, exactly? There's more to political correctness than an obsession with racial and sexual sensitivities, though those are at the root of it. Political correctness, if I could venture my own admittedly rather clinical definition, involves the prohibition of common expressions and habits on the grounds that someone in our pluralistic society may be offended by them. It reduces political life to an array of signs and symbols deemed good or bad according to their tendency either to include or exclude aggrieved or marginalized people from common life. PC was born of a generous impulse, maybe -- it's good and right to avoid giving offense, when you can. But it has long been a blight and a menace. It obliges us to think constantly about a few topics -- topics having mainly to do with racial and sexual identities, but other sorts of identities as well -- even as it makes it impossible for us to speak openly and honestly about those same topics. You must consider every facet of life in light of racial sensitivities, sexual politics or some kind of cultural imperialism; but you'd better not talk openly about any of these things unless you're prepared to negotiate their exquisite complexities and unless you're up to date on all the latest banned phrases.  Political correctness is an unwritten and constantly changing code of forbidden language and practices, and most Americans sense its unfairness. They sensed it most acutely, I think, over the past few years, when three political controversies coincided in a way that seemed to proscribe all but center-left or progressive interpretations: race relations as a result of the riots over police conduct in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore; same-sex marriage as a result of the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges decision; and transgender rights after Caitlyn Jenner's self-revelation and the Obama administration's executive order regarding public school restrooms. Americans take all sorts of reasonable and conflicting views on all three of these topics, but all three are subjects on which, depending on the nature of their views, many feel a keen reluctance to speak candidly.  That feeling of delegitimation, of not being able to state one's beliefs without attracting accusations of bigotry and backwardness, isn't something most Americans will put up with for long. Many of them felt gagged and irritated, and Trump shrewdly named the thing that troubled them: political correctness. A lot of people fell for it. And in falling for it, they made two disastrous mistakes. First, by promoting political incorrectness as a remedy to the taboos they rightly detest, they gave us a man so loathsome as to make those taboos seem almost sensible. In the saddest irony of this deeply strange election year, Trump's supporters have managed to enhance the credibility of political correctness: Given the choice between political correctness and the bigoted tirades of a dirty old man, I'll take political correctness. Second, those who supported Trump on the theory that he'd push back against political correctness failed to understand that you can't change a culture from the top. Politics doesn't determine culture; culture determines politics, and transforms it. A president can do as much about political correctness as he can, say, about the hookup culture on college campuses. Or about the use of hard profanity in polite company. Or about the loss of appreciation for poetry. One may deplore each of these things (I deplore all three), but they are not political in nature and so cannot be withstood or even affected by politics.  Political correctness is an insidious presence in American life. That's true. But resisting it requires the long and patient work of a generation, not the election of a clownish president.
