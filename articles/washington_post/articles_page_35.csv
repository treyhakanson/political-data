An annex to the U.S. resolution calling for an arms embargo and new sanctions, obtained Friday by The Associated Press, would slap travel bans and freeze the assets of rebel leader Riek Machar, Gen. Paul Malong and Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth if approved by the U.N. Security Council. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power urged the council on Thursday to authorize the arms embargo and new sanctions to curb violence that could lead to mass atrocities. But Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Petr Iliichev on Thursday called the U.S. draft resolution premature and irresponsible. He added Friday that Russia feels ""very strongly"" that targeting leaders is ill-advised because it would negatively affect ""the small progress that we have achieved"" trying to restore peace. He wouldn't say, however, if Moscow would cast a veto. Power said an arms embargo can't prevent weapons getting into the conflict-wracked country, but it would be ""an important step toward curbing the ongoing violence perpetrated by government and opposition forces against civilians."" She told the council the people targeted would be those most responsible for preventing peace. The Security Council issued a press statement Friday night signaling its readiness to consider additional sanctions ""to prevent a further escalation of violence and conflict."" Members agreed with Adama Dieng, the U.N. special adviser on the prevention of genocide, ""that what began as a political conflict has transformed into what could become an outright ethnic war."" They called on the government ""to immediately address increasing hate speech and ethnic violence, and to promote reconciliation,"" and urged all parties to take steps to take ""meaningful steps"" to promote peace. There were high hopes that South Sudan would have peace and stability after its independence from neighboring Sudan in 2011. But the country plunged into ethnic violence in 2013 when forces loyal to President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, started battling those loyal to Machar, his former vice president who is a Nuer. A peace deal signed in August 2015 has not stopped the fighting. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, more than 2 million are displaced, and U.N. envoy Ellen Margrethe Loj told the council Thursday the country faces a ""dire humanitarian situation,"" with 4.8 million people estimated to be ""severely food insecure."" According to the annex, Machar's opposition faction ""declared war on the South Sudanese government and called for armed resistance"" after a wave of violence in the capital, Juba, led him to flee the country. It said ""forces allied with Machar have raided villages and abducted civilians and aid workers."" As chief of staff of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the annex said Malong has expanded the conflict in South Sudan and broken the cease-fire deal.  ""As of early August 2016, Malong was responsible for efforts to kill opposition leader Riek Machar,"" it said, including knowingly violating Kiir's orders and launching tank, helicopter gunship and infantry assaults on July 11 against the rebel leader's residence and the rebels' ""Jebel"" base. He informed SPLA commanders ""that Machar was not to be taken alive,"" the annex said. Lueth, the minister of information and broadcasting, ""has repeatedly and consistently worked to obstruct and undermine the implementation of peace deals in South Sudan,"" the annex said. It cited Lueth's involvement in planning and coordinating an April 2014 attack on the U.N. compound in Bor, the Jonglei State capital, that killed three U.N. guards and 140 civilians, and his statement in September that the government would treat ""as invaders"" members of a new regional force if they deployed without government approval on numbers, nationalities and equipment. The Security Council has already imposed sanctions on six South Sudanese commanders -- three from the government and three from the opposition. Last year, a U.S. attempt to blacklist Malong and top rebel commander, Maj. Gen. Johnson Olony, failed because of opposition from Russia, China, Angola and Venezuela.

The federally funded review conducted for the Illinois Department of Corrections found that the mostly nonviolent women at Logan Correctional Center in Lincoln are often classified as higher security risks than necessary, which with disproportionate discipline needlessly extends their stays. Segregation is overused as a punishment and the women get few chances to prepare for community re-entry, contributing to a recidivism rate of 50 percent -- higher than the state's prison population as a whole, according to the report. The National Resource Center on Justice Involved Women's assessment is harshly critical of the 2013 decision by former Gov. Pat Quinn's administration to close a women's prison in Dwight and move nearly 2,000 women into Logan, which was designed for 1,500. The ""poorly planned, rushed and chaotic"" move ""set the tone for the culture that exists at Logan today,"" it said. Corrections director John Baldwin pledged additional staff training. Illinois is one of about a dozen states to undergo the assessment, for which states had to compete. The report advocates taking a different approach to incarcerated women because of their different emotional responses to stress and their histories. Ninety-eight percent of imprisoned Illinois women have experienced physical abuse, 75 percent have been sexually abused, and 85 percent have encountered emotional abuse. At the time of the review, 42 percent of the inmates qualified as seriously mentally ill. Although women make up only a fraction of the population at Illinois' overburdened prisons, making life better at Logan is worth the effort, said Donna Collins, a Rhode Island state prison administrator who has helped implement gender-response changes in that state and was among the speakers scheduled to address a forum Friday in Chicago.  ""Women are the backbone of the family,"" Collins said. ""You're hurting the community if you continue to re-incarcerate women."" The study said there is inadequate training for staff members to deal with women's emotional responses. In interviews, staff members called inmates ""crazy"" and said they ""talk too much,"" resulting in more discipline and good-conduct credit days taken away. But women are more relational and prefer to discuss things, as opposed to men, who tend to shut down, Collins said. And women often don't relate well to prison security staff because they were typically at odds with authorities on the street, said Colette Payne, who spent five stints in prison beginning at age 14 and was part of the assessment team.  ""If I've been raped and you are yelling at me like my abuser, I see you as that person,"" said the 49-year-old who now runs a support group for former women inmates. ""I'm looking at you like you're my abuser, that's where the tension comes in."" Payne was shocked to see the use of the so-called ""crisis cage,"" where women are placed in a stand-alone cell without privacy or padding; the department has pledged to replace it. The report notes that inmates making ""crisis calls,"" in which they feel a threat to themselves or others, increased dramatically from early 2014 to late 2015, and monthly suicide attempts increased tenfold since the Logan consolidation. The report praises the state Corrections Department for agreeing on necessary change and constructing a mental-health unit at the prison. Baldwin, who also addressed the Chicago forum, called the haphazard 2013 consolidation ""a setup for failure"" and said the agency is adding staff training, ""from how to work with women who have a mental illness to how to be more effective in communicating with offenders."" Ed Caumiant, corrections liaison for the prison guards' union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said the union is ready to work with the department on adequate staffing as well as training. Deanne Benos, a former Corrections assistant director whose Chicago-based Women's Justice Initiative coordinated the project, said one reason Illinois succeeded in the competitive grant process was Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner's criminal justice reform pledge. He wants to reduce the prison population by 25 percent by 2025.  ""Meaningful changes can be made with limited resources,"" Benos said. ""Even changing some of the rules and operational practices at Logan can have a dramatic impact on the facility."" ___ Contact Political Writer John O'Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor .

The commission issued its report on Wednesday. It says it won't ask Congress to direct the Smithsonian to start building the museum right away. Instead, it will ask for $2 million in annual funding for the planning process, with the goal of building the museum within 10 years. The commission says the museum should be on or near the National Mall and identifies three possible sites, including one that's near the Smithsonian's newest museum, the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The report says the museum would cost up to $180 million to build, funded by private contributions. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Laird, a former congressman who served as President Richard M. Nixon's defense secretary at the height of the Vietnam War and designed policies that eventually led to the American withdrawal from combat operations, died Nov. 16 at a hospital in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 94. The cause was complications from congestive heart failure, said a son, David Laird. A shrewd and influential Wisconsin Republican, Mr. Laird became his party's leading expert on military affairs during his 16 years in the House of Representatives. Out of party loyalty, he reluctantly agreed to leave Congress and become defense secretary in January 1969, at a moment when U.S. troop strength in Vietnam -- around 550,000 -- was nearing its peak. During his four years at the Pentagon, Mr. Laird dramatically reduced U.S. troop involvement in the conflict, supported the cause of bringing home U.S. prisoners of war held under horrible conditions in North Vietnam and worked to end the deeply unpopular draft. ""Laird was not a revolutionary, seeking to change the Pentagon in fundamental ways,"" military historian Charles A. Stevenson wrote in ""SecDef"" (2006), a history of the secretaries of defense. ""Nor was he merely a manager, fulfilling his legal responsibilities and leading the Defense Department. Instead, Laird was the quintessential firefighter, preoccupied with the crises and controversies of his tenure.""   Former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, right, greets former Navy Secretary John W. Warner, who escorted Rep. Lindy Boggs, left, and presidential counselor Anne Armstrong. (The Washington Post/Linda Wheeler)  According to journalist Dale Van Atta's 2008 biography of Mr. Laird, ""With Honor,"" he took over a department whose self-confidence was diminished after the seven-year tenure of Robert McNamara, who was briefly succeeded by presidential adviser Clark Clifford. The joint chiefs, micromanaged by McNamara and President Lyndon Johnson, were weary and bitter. Congress had grown to distrust the Pentagon after McNamara painted a misleadingly optimistic picture of U.S. military success in Vietnam. In contrast, Van Atta wrote, Mr. Laird developed a reputation for being far more open with lawmakers and giving the joint chiefs more autonomy to run their respective branches. As secretary of defense, Mr. Laird said he understood that public support for the war was waning. His goal, supported by the president, was to reduce American involvement in a conflict that was causing major divisions at home. He oversaw the effort to withdraw U.S. troops gradually while building South Vietnam's military into a force that could support itself, a policy he called Vietnamization. While several people, including analysts, academics and military officials, helped design the policy, it was Mr. Laird who kept the Nixon administration committed. Vietnamization was a success on many levels, said Scott Sigmund Gartner, director of the Penn State School of International Affairs and an authority on the war. He said the policy decreased the danger U.S. troops faced because the South Vietnamese military was in the field more often. Vietnamization also brought home American troops, and it bought time for South Vietnam's forces to stave off North Vietnam and rebuild themselves. Ultimately, though, communist forces prevailed in 1975 because the South could not overcome internal divisions and government corruption. During the war, Mr. Laird was a rare public voice for American military personnel held prisoner by the North Vietnamese. During the Paris peace talks between the United States and North Vietnam, Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, were muted on the subject of POWs. According to Van Atta's biography of Mr. Laird, the State Department, which was handling negotiations with the North, did not want prisoners to become bargaining chips and thus scuttle progress. In May 1969, after meeting the wives of POWs, Mr. Laird held a nationally televised news conference to reveal the atrocities that American prisoners faced. ""The North Vietnamese have claimed that they are treating our men humanely,"" Mr. Laird said. ""I am distressed by the fact that there is clear evidence that this is not the case."" He showed photographs of beaten and emaciated military personnel, including John McCain, later a U.S. senator from Arizona and Republican presidential candidate. Mr. Laird called for North Vietnam to release the names of prisoners and immediately free the sick and injured. After Mr. Laird's news conference, POWs saw improvements. The changes started slowly; a few prisoners were released, torture decreased, and many were grouped in community cells rather than placed in solitary confinement. By 1973, all the POWs were home. ""There are many of us who believe that perhaps we wouldn't have returned from the war if [it] had not been for Secretary Laird publicizing the plight of the POWs,"" McCain said later. ""Conditions changed dramatically afterwards. Those of us who fought in Vietnam, and those of us who were held prisoner, will always have a special place in our hearts for this marvelous man, Mel Laird."" Opposed to secrecy In 1969, Nixon proposed secret bombings to flush out North Vietnamese sanctuaries in neutral Cambodia, which the communists were using to circumvent U.S. forces. Mr. Laird supported the bombings but opposed secrecy, which he thought would exacerbate public opposition to the war when the Cambodia incursion was inevitably uncovered. The bombings expanded the conflict in Southeast Asia and, amid the destabilization, led to a takeover of Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge. When the bombings were less successful than hoped, Nixon ordered an invasion of Cambodia, something Mr. Laird opposed. On April 30, 1970, the president announced the incursion on national television. The news caused protests, some of which turned deadly. On May 4, members of the Ohio National Guard killed four students during antiwar demonstrations at Kent State University. Mr. Laird was often the focus of protests. One protester threw a brick through his den window, and antiwar beat poet Allen Ginsberg once urinated on his house. Despite the harassment, Mr. Laird staunchly refused to move his family from their suburban Maryland home to a military post. In 1972, the Weather Underground, a radical antiwar group, detonated a bomb inside the Pentagon. No one was injured, and Mr. Laird ""put in a call to his public affairs chief directing him to treat the incident as a minor one,"" Van Atta wrote. Mr. Laird set the groundwork for the all-volunteer military. In late 1969, he instituted a draft lottery because of criticism that conscription was biased against the poor. Then he called up reserves and National Guard units, rather than draftees. On Jan. 27, 1973, just days before he left the Pentagon, Mr. Laird announced the end of the draft. ""The volunteer Army was a huge achievement by Laird,"" diplomat Richard Holbrooke told Van Atta. ""Ending the draft was one of the most important pieces of social legislation that the United States has had."" Former president Gerald Ford told Van Atta that Mr. Laird should be considered the father of the all-volunteer military. After the 1972 election, Mr. Laird left the Pentagon -- he was succeeded by Elliot L. Richardson -- and returned to Nixon's White House as a domestic policy adviser. In March 1974, he received the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award that a president can bestow. A Purple Heart in WWII Melvin Robert Laird Jr. was born in Omaha on Sept. 1, 1922, and grew up in Marshfield, Wis., where his mother's family had deep ties to the lumber and sawmill industry. His father, a Presbyterian minister, won a seat in the Wisconsin state Senate in 1939. The younger Laird was class president of Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., where he graduated in 1942 with a political science degree. Afterward, he served in the Pacific during World War II and survived a massive typhoon and a kamikaze attack against the destroyer on which he was serving. His decorations included the Purple Heart. In 1945, he married Barbara Masters, a former Carleton classmate. A year after her death in 1992, he married Carole Howard. Besides his wife, of Fort Myers, survivors include three children from his first marriage, John Laird of River Falls, Wis., David Laird of Bethesda, Md., and Alison Laird-Large of Sylva, N.C.; a stepdaughter, Kimberly Dalgleish of Avon Lake, Ohio; and five grandchildren. Mr. Laird was on shore leave in 1946 when his father died; he campaigned for his father's state Senate seat and won. In 1952, he was elected to Congress. He sat on Appropriations subcommittees for health and defense, where he had influence over two-thirds of the federal budget. He wrote a book on military and foreign policy, ""A House Divided"" (1962). Although he was a defense expert, his passion was health care. He earmarked millions for the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. In 1964, he received the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for promotion of medical research. That same year, he chaired the Republican National Convention. The party was divided by the platforms of the relatively liberal Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York and the conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona. By attacking Democrats and focusing on principles rather than programs, Mr. Laird drafted a platform that seemingly pleased everyone. After leaving the Nixon administration, Mr. Laird spent more than 30 years as a counselor for Reader's Digest magazine, where he also wrote on the policies of the Ford and Carter administrations. He sat on the boards of Reader's Digest and the defense contractor Martin Marietta, and was a past board chairman of the Communications Satellite Corp., a provider of satellite telecommunications. According to Stevenson, the historian, Mr. Laird's legacy at the Pentagon was overshadowed in large part by the Watergate scandal, which led to Nixon's resignation in August 1974 and the loss of the Vietnam War the next year. In the aftermath, Mr. Laird was largely forgotten by the public. Nevertheless, Stevenson said in an interview, ""he was one of the most effective secretaries of defense, and he's probably an unsung hero in that regard.""

In the last two years, House and Senate committees issued more than a dozen subpoenas to price-hiking drugmakers, collecting hundreds of thousands of documents and berating executives for more than 16 hours of public hearings. But a review by The Associated Press of the list prices of nearly 30 brand-name medications and generic versions targeted by congressional investigators shows most haven't budged since coming under federal scrutiny, according to figures from Truven Health Analytics.  ""These companies have made clear that they are not going to change course on their own -- they will keep bilking the American people for all they can unless Congress acts,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Unlike most countries, the U.S. doesn't regulate drug prices. That means drugmakers, like other businesses, are largely free to set prices as high as the market will bear. Congress has avoided passing laws that would change how drugs are priced, in keeping with the wishes of the powerful pharmaceutical lobby. That leaves lawmakers with few options beyond hauling executives before their committees. Cummings helped kick off Capitol Hill's latest round of pharmaceutical bashing in the fall of 2014 with a flurry of letters to makers of prescription drugs that had seen dramatic price spikes. Since then, the AP counted 29 drugs that were specifically mentioned either in letters from lawmakers or during congressional hearings. The list prices of 22 of those drugs did not change at all. Five fell, and two went up. Those that fell were generic drugs that received little public attention. Drugmakers say list prices overstate drug costs, since insurers who pay for them negotiate discounts and rebates. But companies don't disclose those reductions, leaving the actual prices paid unclear. Meanwhile, executives have found ways to defuse some of the public outrage without cutting prices. Under questioning from Cummings and other lawmakers in September, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch pointed to company coupons that can lower the price for EpiPens by up to $300 for some insured patients. While such coupons lower patients' out-of-pocket expenses, insurers foot the bill for the drug, which still carries of list price of $608 for a two-pack, up more than 500 percent since 2007. Last year, former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli reneged on a pledge to lower the price of the life-saving anti-infection drug Daraprim after raising it 5,000 percent. Instead, his company offered hospitals a sliding discount and the option to buy a 30-pill bottle for $22,500 instead of the original 100-pill bottle, which cost $75,000. The $750 list price per pill didn't budge.  ""The industry has cultivated an outrageously complicated and obscure pricing system,"" said Robert Weissman, president of consumer advocate Public Citizen. ""They can give the illusion of various discounts and rebates that sound on their face like price reductions but without really impacting their bottom line."" Even when corporate leaders seem to promise price cuts while under oath, the decreases don't materialize. Last April, billionaire investor Bill Ackman testified before a Senate committee about Valeant Pharmaceutical's much-maligned strategy of buying niche drugs and raising their prices by as much as 3,000 percent. With the Canadian drugmaker's then-CEO Michael Pearson stepping down, Ackman promised to use his influence on the company's board to try and revamp its pricing strategy.  ""A lot is going to change,"" said Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital fund is Valeant's largest investor. On two heart drugs that Valeant had acquired and hiked, Nitropress and Isuprel, Ackman suggested price cuts were imminent.  ""You can expect from us within weeks, and hopefully sooner, a response to where we're going to price these drugs and it will be meaningfully lower than where they are priced now,"" Ackman said. Instead, Valeant kept the list prices the same and expanded existing rebates for hospitals to up to 40 percent.  ""That sounds good, but when you raise prices more than 500 percent a 40 percent discount is still egregious,"" said Scott Knoer, chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic. Valeant said in a statement the rebates were recommended by its internal drug pricing committee, created in the wake of public outrage over its prices. A spokesman for Ackman declined to comment. Experts who study the pharmaceutical pricing say rebates and discounts allow drugmakers to retain greater control -- and revenue -- than blanket price cuts.  ""You can have different prices for different customers depending on who has more market share,"" said analyst Richard Evans of Sector and Sovereign Research. ""So you can tailor your pricing somewhat stealthily."" Evans says congressional scrutiny of companies like Valeant has discouraged the most extreme price hikes, generally those above 100 percent. But most of the price inflation squeezing patients and hospitals comes from industry-wide price increases that often total more than 10 percent a year, rather than the drastic hikes targeted by Congress. Rep. Cummings and his investigative partner, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, unveiled a new strategy earlier this month that could have more teeth than shaming, at least if companies are doing something illegal. Rather than launching another congressional probe, the lawmakers called on the Department of Justice to investigate possible price collusion among manufacturers of insulin, which they say has seen industrywide price increases of more than 300 percent between 2002 and 2013. There are also some new and long-standing proposals that could stem increases, but they are unlikely to pass Congress, in part because of the pharmaceutical industry's pervasive influence on Capitol Hill. Drugmakers and related health businesses spent more than $235 million on lobbying last year, more than any other industry, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. Investors seem to think the victories of Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have dimmed the prospects for drug price reform even further. Pharmaceutical company shares, which had lagged the broader stock market this year until the election, have dramatically outperformed the market since then. In the meantime, lawmakers are likely to continue publicly lashing drugmakers, if only to appease constituents. A majority of Americans say lowering drug prices is the most important health care issue that the incoming president and Congress should be working on, according to a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.  ""The big question is whether it remains mostly talk and hearings or whether it amounts to action,"" said Drew Altman, president of the nonpartisan Kaiser foundation. ""At this stage the drug industry is playing a version of Muhammad Ali's rope-a-dope -- rolling with the punches and waiting to see how things turn out."" ___ AP Medical Writer Linda A.

The Treasury Department said Wednesday that total foreign holdings dropped 0.7 percent to $6.15 trillion in September, following a 0.8 percent decline in August and a 0.5 percent decline in July. China, the top foreign holder of Treasury debt, reduced its holdings 2.4 percent to $1.16 trillion in September. It marked the fourth straight month that China has cut back.

The investigation of former chancellor Kaya Henderson, who stepped down in September, was launched in May after The Associated Press reported that she had asked major contractors to give money to a gala honoring teachers. Among the companies she solicited was the city's troubled food-service contractor. The AP reported that Henderson asked Chartwells for a $100,000 contribution to the gala, just weeks after the company was accused in a whistleblower lawsuit of cheating the school system out of $19 million and serving spoiled food to city schoolchildren. Chartwells ended up making two $25,000 contributions to the event. Several other companies that do business with the city also gave money to the gala, including Sodexo, a Chartwells rival that took over the food-service contract this school year. In response to questions from the AP, the school system acknowledged that Henderson had solicited contributions from Sodexo and other contractors. City ethics rules prohibit city employees from soliciting money, including charitable contributions, from companies that do business with the city. The rules are meant to prevent the appearance of ""pay to play"" politics in which contractors get preferential treatment in exchange for gifts or campaign contributions. Henderson agreed to the censure, which is largely symbolic because she's no longer in office. The board can fine city officials up to $5,000 for violations but chose not to issue a fine. Still, the episode complicates the legacy of Henderson's 5 1/2 years at the helm of city schools, during which she built a reputation as a national leader in urban education reform. Henderson, who did not immediately return a message seeking comment, told the ethics board that she did not realize her actions were prohibited, according to a settlement agreement that was reached last week.  ""The chancellor did not appreciate the distinction between soliciting funds from ordinary businesses that wanted to assist the District government and those that might be considered prohibited sources,"" said Darrin Sobin, the city's ethics director. John Davis, who was one of Henderson's deputies, is serving as interim chancellor while Mayor Muriel Bowser searches for a permanent replacement. Under Henderson, city schools saw gains in enrollment, standardized test scores and graduation rates. But that progress masked huge achievement gaps between white students and non-Asian minorities. Those gaps remained stubborn and grew in some cases. The improved test scores also coincided with the city becoming wealthier and the white population increasing. One of Henderson's major initiatives was a rigorous evaluation system for teachers that's based, in part, on their students' standardized test scores. Henderson fired hundreds of teachers who received poor evaluations. Those who get the best marks are honored at the annual gala, known as Standing Ovation for D.C. Teachers, which is held at the Kennedy Center. Chartwells, the food-service contractor, ended up paying $19.4 million to settle the whistleblower lawsuit, which alleged that the company had cheated the city through price-gouging and fraud, deliberately stockpiled food and allowed it to rot, and served spoiled food in cafeterias. ___ Follow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols.

Isaac Lanier Avant (eh-VANT') of Arlington struck a plea deal in federal court in Alexandria Wednesday and was convicted on a single misdemeanor charge of failing to file a tax return. He faces up to a year in prison at sentencing in January. Avant is chief of staff for Rep. Bennie Thompson, the state's only congressional Democrat. In court papers, Avant admitted he had no income tax withheld from his congressional paycheck from 2005 through 2012, despite annual wages exceeding $165,000. He filed no tax return from 2008 through 2013. The plea deal requires a $153,500 restitution payment. Thompson's office had no comment Wednesday but confirmed Avant is still an employee.

Russia's state-run news agency reported Wednesday that more officials could be targeted in the corruption probe that has already led to the arrest of the country's economic development minister. Other news reports went so far as to name names, all of them of officials close to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, leader of the so-called liberals, who tend to favor a smaller state role in society and greater international outreach. Medvedev's faction is seen to be in an eternal struggle against the Kremlin's ""siloviki"" -- a force that includes officials from the military, law enforcement and security services in Putin's inner circles. At the center of the current tug of war is the privatization of major oil assets. On Tuesday, Alexei Ulyukayev, the economic development minister, was charged with demanding and receiving a $2 million bribe allegedly for approving the $5 billion purchase of a 50 percent stake in the Bashneft oil company by the state-run oil giant Rosneft.   [Putin backs Russian withdrawal from International Criminal Court]    Russian Minister of Economic Development Alexei Ulyukayev was charged with demanding and receiving a $2 million bribe allegedly for approving the $5 billion purchase of a 50 percent stake in the Bashneft oil company by the state-run oil giant Rosneft. (Maxim Shipenkov/European Pressphoto Agency)  Ulyukayev initially opposed the deal, which eventually went through in October. Rosneft is led by Igor Sechin, seen as a close Putin lieutenant and one of the leaders of the siloviki.   ""The arrest of Ulyukayev served as another proof that Igor Sechin is a very powerful figure,"" Andrei Kolesnikov of the Moscow Carnegie Center wrote in a commentary. ""In the hierarchy of the elites he occupies one of the prized positions for influencing the economy, the political landscape, and the administrative system of weights and measures. Everyone has understood that.""  The influential business daily Vedomosti named four officials who are seen as part of Medvedev's team and have come under investigation by the security services, which have had Ulyukayev under surveillance since last year.  Medvedev presided over a government meeting Wednesday that was at first reported as an ""emergency session,"" although state-run Russia 24 television said later that it was just an ordinary meeting. Medvedev said the case against Ulyukayev showed that ""everyone is equal before the law,"" and he also expressed hope that the investigation would get to the bottom of the allegations.  ""What's happened should be investigated in the most thorough manner and assessed in strict compliance with the law,"" Medvedev said.  [Russia's establishment basks in Trump victory]  Russia's former finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, expressed the doubts of many observers here about the Ulyukayev case. ""Even in the work of law enforcement agencies there are sometimes mistakes; we don't have complete confidence in certain steps,"" Kudrin told Russia 24. ""I know from the experience of other officials who were released after being arrested and all charges against them were dropped. We have such a practice in Russia."" Alpha Bank, one of the leading Russian financial companies, issued its own opinion of the case, saying that the ""explanation for his arrest is questionable."" ""The current situation is, thus, a litmus test for the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, and as to whether he is able to defend the innocence of one his cabinet members,"" the bank said. ""We see this as very negative development for the government's credibility."" Opposition leader Alexei Navalny went further, saying that the government lacks any credibility.  ""The authorities consist of thieves and crooks and anyone can be put in jail,"" Navalny wrote. ""When someone gets a black mark, someone else benefits from it. So in this case probably it was Sechin who benefited. But what's the difference: all of them are toads and vipers.""  Navalny's political aspirations received a boost Wednesday, when Russia's Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction against him in a corruption case and ordered a retrial, opening the door for a potential run for office. Navalny, who helped lead large street protests against Putin in 2011 and 2012 and ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Moscow, was seen as a rising political star and a possible challenger to Putin. But he was convicted in 2013 of embezzling timber worth $500,000 at the time from a state-owned company in the provincial city of Kirov in a trial that was largely perceived as a vendetta against him. He has remained free from prison but was barred from running for office.

The ICC is one of a number of international courts set up since the end of World War II to prosecute war crimes and other atrocities in conflicts around the world. Here is a rundown of some of the various courts and tribunals meting out international and local justice: ___ INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT Established in 2002, the Hague-based ICC is the world's first permanent criminal court with a global reach. It was set up to prosecute suspects considered the most responsible for the worst crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. It currently has 124 member states, although three African nations recently announced plans to quit. The U.S., Russia, China and Syria are among countries that haven't signed up to the court. So far, all of the court's trials have focused on crimes in Africa, but the court is conducting preliminary probes around the world, including the examination of allegations of atrocities in Afghanistan and the use of harsh interrogation techniques there by U.S. forces and the CIA that a prosecution report says may amount to war crimes. ____ NUREMBERG and TOKYO TRIBUNALS The two tribunals set up by the victorious allies after World War II laid the foundation for modern international tribunals. They prosecuted political and military leaders from Germany's Nazi regime and Japan's wartime establishment. Unlike more recent tribunals, which seek to prosecute crimes committed by all sides in conflicts, the Nuremburg and Tokyo courts only indicted suspects from the losing sides. ____ INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA Based in a former insurance company office in The Hague, the U.N. court was set up to prosecute the worst atrocities of the wars that erupted as Yugoslavia crumbled in the 1990s. The court indicted 161 suspects and is currently trying the last of them, former Bosnian Serb military commander Gen. Ratko Mladic, on genocide and other charges. It also has convicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic of genocide. The man alleged to have fomented conflicts throughout the former Yugoslavia, former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, was put on trial but died before his case finished. ____ INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA The U.N. court established to deal with the 1994 genocide in Rwanda indicted 93 suspects. Eight of them remain fugitives. The tribunal, which had its headquarters in Arusha, Tanzania, convicted dozens of people for their roles in the slaughter of some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. A former prime minister, Jean Kambanda, pleaded guilty and was given a life sentence. The tribunal formally closed its doors last year, passing on any remaining legal cases to a mechanism set up in The Hague to deal with legacy issues from both the Rwanda and Yugoslavia tribunals. ____ EXTRAORDINARY CHAMBERS IN THE COURTS OF CAMBODIA A U.N.-backed court set up in 2006 to bring to justice leaders of the notorious Khmer Rouge. The court applies both local and international law in its cases, which deal with the Khmer Rouge's brutal 1975-79 reign that led to the deaths of 1.7 million Cambodians though execution, starvation and inadequate medical care. The tribunal has convicted suspects including Khieu Samphan, the regime's head of state, and Nuon Chea, the right-hand man of the group's late leader, Pol Pot, and sentenced them to life imprisonment. ____ SPECIAL COURT FOR SIERRA LEONE Set up in 2002 to prosecute atrocities in Sierra Leone's brutal 1991-2002 civil war, it finished its work in 2013. The U.N.-backed court was funded by voluntary contributions and was the first international tribunal to be based in the country where the crimes it prosecuted were committed. The court put 10 suspects on trial and convicted nine of them, including former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who was sentenced to 50 years for his role in the conflict. ____ SPECIAL TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON Another court based in the Netherlands, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon opened in 2009 to prosecute those responsible for a truck bombing in Beirut on Feb. 14, 2005, that killed former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others. The court has a mix of international and Lebanese judges and works using Lebanese law. The court is currently trying in absentia four suspected members of the Hezbollah militia on suspicion of carrying out the assassination of Hariri. The case against one other suspect was halted earlier this year after he was killed in Syria. ____ KOSOVO SPECIALIST CHAMBERS Dealing with crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes committed in Kosovo between 1998 and 2000, the European Union-backed chambers are part of the Kosovo system, applying Kosovo law, but based in The Hague. The chambers haven't yet publicly issued any indictments. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
