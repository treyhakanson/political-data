"    Michelle Obama hugs Janasia Johnson, recipient of a National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award, during a White House ceremony on Tuesday. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)  Michelle Obama gazed around the East Room of the White House. It was one of her few public appearances since the election of Donald Trump, a man she had denounced as unfit for the presidency in speeches around the country. ""Just when you wonder whether we're crazy -- we're not,"" she said, gazing at the audience of military families surrounding her for the final event of her Joining Forces initiative. ""We're good people, all over the place."" In the week since Election Day, the first lady has said relatively little about her husband's successor. Unlike President Obama, who spoke to reporters in the Rose Garden and held a news conference, Michelle Obama hasn't given a speech or an interview on her reaction. Instead, she invited her successor, Melania Trump, to the White House for tea and has carried on with her final series of events as first lady. At each one, she's laid down a marker for securing her legacy -- but also slipped in some thoughts that reveal her disappointment.  [Michelle Obama makes a pitch to keep her advocacy work alive in a Trump White House]  At her event for military families Monday, she echoed her husband's notion that Americans are not as divided as the ugly political campaign or the protests that followed have made them seem. ""We are all on one team -- not Democrats first or Republicans first, but we are Americans first,"" she said. ""We're patriots first."" At her final event celebrating the accomplishments of youth in the arts this week, she expressed her views on what she thinks makes the country great, citing the inclusion of children from many diverse backgrounds, including Native Americans, immigrants and those who are gay, lesbian or transgender. ""We believe that each of these young people is a vital part of the great American story. I can't say that enough,"" she said. ""And it is important to our continued greatness to see these kids as ours -- not as 'them,' not as 'other,' but as ours."" Obama then turned to the children and spoke with urgency: ""Don't ever lose hope. Don't ever feel fear. You belong here, you got that? Keep working hard, because it's going to be so important now to be educated and focused."" At one point an audience member shouted out to Obama across the East Room: ""Run for president!"" ""Be quiet back there,"" she replied, with a smile. The first lady has said repeatedly that she is not interested in running for public office.      As calls for first lady Michelle Obama to run for political office grow, she brushed aside remarks to ""run for president"" at a White House event on veteran's homelessness on Nov. 14. ""Be quiet back there!"" she laughingly scolded after a fan shouted the suggestion. (The White House)   "

Giuliani has emerged as a leading candidate to serve as secretary of state under President-elect Donald Trump. (Reuters)   On Monday, I posted about Rudy Giuliani's long history of vindictiveness and authoritarianism. At the time, he was reportedly under consideration to be Donald Trump's attorney general. The latest reports have Giuliani being considered for the State Department. I've also seen multiple reports that he basically has his pick of high-ranking posts in the Trump administration. In part of my post yesterday, I noted that during his first successful campaign for electoral office, Giuliani helped incite a riot involving thousands of mostly white, mostly drunk police officers. On Twitter, Aaron Stewart-Ahn sent along this local news account of the incident:      It's worth noting that this report came shortly after the riots. They were actually quite a bit worse than described. Again, here's longtime New Yorker and civil libertarian Nat Hentoff recounting them in a recent piece published at the Cato Institute: It was one of the biggest riots in New York City history. As many as 10,000 demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Manhattan on Sept. 16, 1992. Reporters and innocent bystanders were violently assaulted by the mob as thousands of dollars in private property was destroyed in multiple acts of vandalism. The protesters stormed up the steps of City Hall, occupying the building. They then streamed onto the Brooklyn Bridge, where they blocked traffic in both directions, jumping on the cars of trapped, terrified motorists. Many of the protestors were carrying guns and openly drinking alcohol. Yet the uniformed police present did little to stop them. Why? Because the rioters were nearly all white, off-duty NYPD officers. They were participating in a Patrolmen's Benevolent Association demonstration against Mayor David Dinkins' call for a Civilian Complaint Review Board and his creation earlier that year of the Mollen Commission, formed to investigate widespread allegations of misconduct within the NYPD. In the center of the mayhem, standing on top of a car while cursing Mayor Dinkins through a bullhorn, was mayoral candidate Rudy Giuliani. ""Beer cans and broken beer bottles littered the streets as Mr. Giuliani led the crowd in chants,"" The New York Times reported . . . Newsday columnist Jimmy Breslin described the racist conduct in chilling detail: ""The cops held up several of the most crude drawings of Dinkins, black, performing perverted sex acts,"" he wrote. ""And then, here was one of them calling across the top of his beer can held to his mouth, 'How did you like the n*****s beating you up in Crown Heights?'"" The off-duty cops were referring to a severe beating Breslin suffered while covering the 1991 Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn. Breslin continued: ""Now others began screaming ... 'How do you like what the n*****s did to you in Crown Heights?' "" 'Now you got a n****r right inside City Hall. How do you like that? A n****r mayor.' ""And they put it right out in the sun yesterday in front of City Hall,"" Breslin wrote. ""We have a police force that is openly racist ..."" One black member of the city council was physically blocked from crossing the street by a drunk cop. Another was trapped in her car as cops rocked it back and forth. Both were bombarded with racist epithets. Giuliani never condemned the riots, the signs or the racist cops. He rode the wave of support from police and law-and-order voters into the mayor's mansion. When his own campaign produced a report criticizing him for egging on the cops and then acquiescing to them after the fact, he ordered the report destroyed. Yes, the riots happened more than 20 years ago. And perhaps they could be overlooked if it weren't for the fact that today, Giuliani is reliably among the first public figures to condemn the activists who protest police brutality. He has practically made a second career of it. Giuliani has said that the very name ""Black Lives Matter"" is ""inherently racist."" The hypocrisy is only uglier when you consider what the two protests were about. Black Lives Matter and other racial justice groups are protesting police violence against black people. You can disagree with their methods. You can disagree with the cases they choose to highlight. You can even disagree with the general assumptions behind their protest -- that police departments and the criminal-justice system are plagued by systemic racism. But it's hard to object to their ultimate aim -- they want equal treatment under the law. The cops that Giuliani egged on were protesting something much different. They were protesting the suggestion that they should be held accountable to the people they serve. (If we're honest, many of them appeared to have been protesting the very idea of reporting to a black mayor.) That is why they rioted. They didn't want to be held accountable to the people of New York. As Hentoff points out, not only did Giuliani never condemn the riots, but after the death of Eric Garner he assailed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for daring even to acknowledge that the NYPD has a history of racism. Giuliani knew full well that this was true -- he benefited from it politically. That Giuliani could launch his electoral career on the riots, go on to a long career in politics, emerge as both a prominent and consistent critic of anti-police-brutality protesters, and now be under consideration to become the chief diplomat for the most powerful country in the world -- all without ever condemning or distancing himself from even the most vile, racist, and violent of the rioting cops -- is all pretty good evidence that Black Lives Matter has a point."
2	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/11/16/a-trump-mandate-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder/	A Trump mandate is in the eye of the beholder	"   President Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington last week. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press)  Talk about a presidential ""mandate"" is ground zero -- along with debates about the filibuster and federalism -- for political hypocrisy. If your guy or gal wins, by gosh, the mandate is yours! If not, well, mandates don't exist. Let's consider a few points. First, a mandate is merely a perception, a consensus that a president's victory means that the ideas he advances are owed deference and support from the losers. In our hyper-polarized environment, losers tend to concede nothing and presidents don't get much of a honeymoon. Opposition, thanks to social media and media polarization, can organize with lightning speed and great intensity. Second, when one party -- the Democrats in 2008, the GOP in 2016 -- wins majorities in both houses and the White House, fights over the existence of a mandate become even more theoretical. The winners are simply going to do what they please, provided that they can keep their party unified and stave off opposition-party delaying maneuvers. President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump both resorted to a simple formulation -- ""I won"" -- to rebuke critics. Third, it's hard to credibly claim a mandate if you ran on mush. ""Make America Great Again"" is the quintessential empty campaign slogan that carries no specific policy objectives. Trump said he wanted to repeal Obamacare but never said what he wanted to replace it with. There is no popular directive for what should follow Obamacare, and Trump already evidences a willingness to keep certain parts of the law in place. When politics becomes an act of tribal identification, winners find it hard to claim that the public has endorsed any particular set of policy ideas. No wonder in this election the public is telling pollsters they just want the new president to work things out with Congress. A Post-Schar School poll shows: Nationally, just 3 in 10 Americans -- 29 percent -- say he has a mandate to carry out the agenda he presented during the campaign, while 59 percent say he should compromise with Democrats when they strongly disagree with the specifics of his policy proposals. That 29 percent figure is sharply lower than the 50 percent who said the same for President Obama after his first election in 2008 and the 41 percent for former president George W. Bush after the 2000 election and the contentious recount that followed. Fourth, Republicans will be hard-pressed to ignore Democrats after whining for eight years that Obama operated on executive orders and party-line votes. The GOP therefore may find it hard to interpret the election results as a directive for Democrats to shut up and go along with White House. Fifth, as we have remarked many times, the Trump agenda and the ""Better Way"" agenda of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) are not one in the same. Indeed, the conflicts there are in some cases as big as conflicts between a traditional GOP agenda and standard-fare Democratic ideas. Trump wants to spend gobs of money and leave entitlements alone; Ryan does not want to do either. Trump wants to move away from free trade and toward tariffs; Ryan has repudiated that approach. What happens when the White House -- egged on by the Democrats -- wants a pork-laden, wasteful, unfocused infrastructure bill? What happens when Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pass a Medicare premium support bill? Sixth, reality gets a vote also. Trump might want Mexico to pay for a wall, NATO countries to pay more, NAFTA to get rewritten and Russia to play nice, but chances are that none of those will happen. A mandate for unicorns, rainbows and pixie dust does not mean much in the real world. Finally, Trump's lack of policy acumen and an array of bickering advisers, also with little interest in policy and even less experience in government, suggest a shift in power and initiative from the White House to Congress. A subtle and not-so-subtle game likely will ensue in which various factions in Congress try to convince others that their own plans are true to Trump's vision. The arguments may be amusing and far-fetched (No, no, single-payer health care would be a repeal of Obamacare!). We've already seen Ryan argue that his tax plan is ""another way"" of fulfilling Trump's trade/tariff objectives. In short, when a mandate is as vague as Trump's and his attention span is just as limited, manipulation and spin may replace conflict as the predominant mode of engagement with the White House."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) greets voters at an October event for Hillary Clinton. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Wednesday endorsed the bid of Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, adding to the congressman's early momentum in the race to lead the party. In a statement, Warren praised Ellison's work in Congress ""try to hold Wall Street accountable"" and praised his leadership as a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. ""I admire Keith's values, his grit, and his dedication to making this country work not just for some of our kids but for all of them,"" Warren said in a statement.      The Post's Abby Phillip explores some of the questions Democrats are facing after Hillary Clinton's defeat against Donald Trump in the presidential election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)     [Keith Ellison makes DNC bid official, rolls out 40 endorsements]   Meanwhile, former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley took himself out of the running for the post Wednesday after announcing five days ago that he was taking a ""hard look"" at it. ""While I'm grateful to the friends who have urged me to consider running for DNC Chair, I will not be seeking our Party's Chairmanship,"" O'Malley said in a statement. O'Malley, who ended a 2016 presidential bid following a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, and Ellison are among several people who have publicly expressed interest in the job since Hillary Clinton's stunning defeat to President-elect Donald Trump last week. Others eyeing the job include former Vermont governor Howard Dean, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison, the DNC's national finance chairman Henry Munoz III and Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. The candidacy of Ellison (D-Minn.), who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) over Clinton in the Democratic primaries, has generated the most buzz. Warren's support adds to a list of liberal lawmakers, including Sanders, who have coalesced around Ellison. He has also picked up the support of several others in the party's establishment, including departing Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), his likely successor. The next chairman is scheduled to be picked early next year by DNC members across the country, who may or may not take their cue from elected officials. The party's charter call for a chairman to be chosen by March 1 to succeed interim chairwoman Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic operative who stepped in after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) resigned in July."

Rehm introduced Johnson during her broadcast Wednesday morning from WAMU-FM, the Washington public station that has produced her program since 1979. Johnson will host a new program, called ""1A,"" that will have roughly the same format as ""The Diane Rehm Show"" -- interviews, panel discussions and listener phone calls about politics, government, science, the arts and other topics spread over a two-hour block. Johnson said he will tweak the long-running format somewhat, sometimes exploring multiple topics within an hour and occasionally delving into pop culture. The appointment, by WAMU's managers and with Rehm's support, instantly makes Johnson, 36, one of the most prominent figures in public radio. Rehm's program, which is distributed by NPR, has a passionate and loyal following, with a weekly audience of about 2.6 million. It is carried on some 198 stations nationwide. ""I'm humbled, grateful and excited, but mostly humbled,"" Johnson said in an interview this week. He called his appointment ""a gift, a treasure, and I'll treat it as such."" Johnson, an anchor and host at public radio and TV station KQED in San Francisco, was something of a surprise choice. He was among the lesser-known of the 30 or so candidates whom WAMU interviewed after Rehm said last December that she intended to retire at the end of this year. (Her last live broadcast will be Dec. 23.)  WAMU General Manager J.J. Yore said Johnson wasn't on the station's initial list of candidates. But his stock rose after his on-air tryout over two days in late September. ""He brought an openness to his sound, a kind of curiosity . . . He was at ease and put his guests at ease,"" Yore said.  Johnson was the morning newscaster at KQED for five years, and he stepped down in February to produce and host a series about race called ""Truth Be Told."" He was also a substitute host on ""Forum,"" the station's nationally syndicated news-discussion program. A Florida native, Johnson graduated from the University of Miami and worked as an anchor and reporter for TV and radio stations in the state. He joined KQED in 2010. As a younger African American man, Johnson may help NPR expand its appeal among the younger, male and racially diverse listeners that public radio has struggled to attract throughout its history. Public radio and TV audiences are largely white and aging, a development that has concerned industry leaders for some time. Yore acknowledged that ""diversity was an important factor in creating this new show. It's not lost on any of us that having a young, African American male leading the conversation on public radio on a national stage is very important."" Rehm, 80, said her decision to leave her program was ""1,000 percent the right decision for me and the station at this time."" But, she added, ""I'm feeling somewhat guilty about leaving in this moment"" following Donald Trump's surprising presidential victory. ""We need more discussion about what has happened and why this has happened.""   She elaborated on this in a speech she gave last week at a gala in Washington honoring her show. ""We're all going to have to learn to listen in new and different ways, better and harder to those with whom we may not agree, those who are different from us, who may not even be aware of public radio, those who feel they have not been heard,"" she said. ""We who've been in public radio for all these years thought we were being broad and bold. But now we know we've been speaking with only a small portion of the electorate and the population at large. We have to do better."" Rehm said in an interview she wasn't speaking about Trump supporters specifically, but about people who are ""comfortable in their own factual universe"" and not open to different points of view. ""They want to construct a universe that is within the confines of the way they're living. Public radio hasn't reached them."" Johnson declined to discuss his political views, but he said he was as committed as Rehm to presenting a balanced show. ""I see a lot of similarities in how I like to represent myself on the air in the way she presents herself on the air -- the same style and ethic of conversation."" At the same time, he added, ""I won't be the next Diane Rehm. I'm the first Joshua Johnson.""  "

Donald Trump's stunning electoral win came despite prognosticators' overwhelming insistence he would lose. And it has forced many to question not just political polling, but other facets of life that are being informed and directed by data.  ""If 'big data' is not that useful for predicting an election then how much should we be relying on it for predicting civil uprisings in countries where we have an interest or predicting future terror attacks?"" asked Patrick Tucker, the author of ""The Naked Future: What Happens in a World That Anticipates Your Every Move?"" His book examines predictive analytics that aim to pinpoint answers to questions as varied as when a person will get married to how many kindergartners in a given class will end up with a cold. Technology has filled people's lives with crowdsourced, data-driven or otherwise instructive metrics and left many convinced of their validity. We look to Yelp rankings to find a good meal and TripAdvisor to gauge a city's finest hotel. Netflix tells us which shows are best to watch and Zillow tells us the worth of the home we might buy. Amazon, Google, Facebook -- all are ubiquitous presences in everyday life with data at their core. So many took the predictions of polling aggregators as gospel -- and their forecasts of Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the presidency went as high as 99 percent. Tammy Palazzo, a 49-year-old corporate trainer in Maplewood, New Jersey, was among them. She's a political junkie who all day long refreshed FiveThirtyEight, the site from the heralded election-predictor Nate Silver. She purposely sought to look beyond her biases, living in a neighborhood dotted with signs for Clinton, a candidate she admired, and took in a variety of news sources. Then came Tuesday night.  ""This is not going the way it's supposed to go,"" she thought, watching returns come in but not in Clinton's favor. ""There was just so much reinforcement from the media that this was pretty locked down."" Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University, was among the few who defied the confluence of polls and projected Trump's win. His model, developed in 1981, uses history as a guide to who will win the presidency through 13 true-or-false questions looking at economic indicators, military failure and success, social unrest and third-party candidacies. He's been consistently right.  ""Polls are not predictions. They are snapshots and they are abused and misused as though they are predictions,"" he said. Claudia Deane, a vice president at Pew Research Center, said many traditional methodologies in opinion polling are under attack as survey experts try to adapt to changing technology and communication methods. She says researchers are trying to find ways to accurately tap into social media or other indicators of public opinion that could enhance phone and internet surveys, but scientific methods are still being developed.  ""The surveys are trying to predict the popular vote, and we're doing that in a country where we have a 50-50 electorate,"" she said. ""Polling is not built for that kind of precision. It's not an excuse, it's just a mathematical fact.""  ""Big data"" has been a buzzword for the last decade in Silicon Valley. Investors and tech companies, from little-known startups to corporate giants, have poured billions of dollars into software and computer systems that promise to pore through mountains of information and glean useful insights into business trends or consumer behavior. David Dill, a computer science professor at Stanford University, said it has opened the door to do things that weren't possible before. It enabled the collection of vast stockpiles of information all while advances in computing hardware and online networking have made it possible to run more sophisticated analytical programs and crunch bigger sets of data more quickly. Even so, there's plenty of hype and unreasonable expectations for what analytics can do.  ""Even if you have a lot of data and you go after it with the most sophisticated, amazing techniques, it may not tell you anything or it may mislead, because the data doesn't have the information you need,"" Dill said. Khalid Khan, who heads analytics at the management consulting firm A.T. Kearney, said people are being influenced by data points without fully understanding what those numbers represent. He encourages companies weighing the direction of data to also consider -- and discuss -- ""the softer side of things."" Speaking of data alone, he said: ""If you take it at face value, you're going to get burnt. Without those conversations, you're only doing half of what you need to do when it comes to decision making."" Technology expert Sarah Granger has also seen that overreliance on data and technology, such as people who use mapping software only to end up on a dead-end street. Snafus like that, or presidential polling errors, she said, offer a reminder: ""Big data's a great thing. There's so much we gain from it. But it's still in its infancy."" ___ Associated Press writer Brandon Bailey in San Francisco contributed to this report. ___ Sedensky can be reached at msedensky@ap.org or https://twitter.com/sedensky Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

A key sticking point in the negotiations during the upcoming lame-duck session is a House-passed provision that Senate Democrats say would undercut protections against workplace discrimination based on sexual or gender orientation. They've called the measure dangerous and are demanding it be removed from the $602 billion measure. Many House Republicans, however, view the provision as a bulwark for religious liberty and just as adamantly want it kept in the final package. Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election has strengthened their hand should the contentious debate begin anew next year.  ""It's going to be a tough one for them to figure out,"" said Justin Johnson, a senior defense policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Drop the amendment and risk a backlash from rank-and-file Republicans, he said. Keep it in and Democrats could mobilize to block the defense bill, which authorizes spending for military programs that range from jet fighters to a pay raise for the troops. A filibuster carries risks for Democrats. They could be hammered by the GOP for stymieing legislation important to U.S. service members and their families. And even if the provision is dropped to avoid a veto by President Barack Obama, Republicans -- who control both houses of Congress -- could wait until Trump is in the White House and attach the provision to a different bill.  ""I think the election gives congressional Republicans a lot more leverage on this issue,"" Johnson said. ""They don't have to be too worried about a veto threat because the situation only improves next year."" Although much of Trump's agenda on social issues remains opaque, he assured conservatives during the campaign that he would place a high priority on religious liberty. The tenure of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, was punctuated by his steadfast support for conservative social issues that at times drew unwanted attention to the state, most notably when a religious objections law he signed provoked a national backlash from critics who said it could sanction discrimination against gay people. David Stacy, government affairs director at the Human Rights Campaign, acknowledged that the long-term prospects for barring the amendment from passing are challenging. But he said he's bullish about the short term. Congress has little incentive to drag out a lame-duck session and that means passing a defense bill unburdened by a provision that has no bearing on the Pentagon's core missions, according to Stacy.  ""The blame could fall either way,"" said Stacy, suggesting Republicans could be seen as obstructionists for insisting the amendment be preserved at the expense of speedy passage of the defense bill. The provision is brief and requires any U.S. government office to provide protections and exemptions ""to any religious corporation, religious association, religious educational institution, or religious society that is a recipient of or offeror"" for a federal contract. Forty Senate Democrats plus two independents wrote in a letter last month that the provision would amount to government-sponsored discrimination by permitting religiously affiliated federal contractors to refuse to interview a job candidate whose faith differs from theirs and to fire employees who marry their same-sex partners or use birth control. The provision would ""vastly expand religious exemptions"" under the Civil Rights Act and Americans with Disabilities Act to allow contractors ""to harm hardworking Americans who deserve to be protected from workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, religious identity, or reproductive and other health care decisions,"" they said in the letter. Republicans argued the measure merely builds on existing law by ensuring that faith-based organizations that perform work for the U.S. government aren't forced to act against their beliefs. The measure is known as the Russell amendment, named after its sponsor, Rep. Steve Russell, R-Okla. Paradoxically, opponents of the Russell amendment may find support from Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee who plays a central role in determining the contents of the defense policy bill. The Arizona legislature passed a religious freedom bill in 2014 designed to give more legal protections to people who might be accused of discrimination for actions they took in accordance with religious beliefs. A frequently cited example is a business that denies service to gay or lesbian customers. With the state facing a national backlash from business leaders, including the National Football League, McCain urged then-Gov. Jan Brewer to veto the legislation. She did.  ""We're hoping he sees this the same way,"" said Maggie Garrett, legislative director for Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ___ Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rplardner Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/10/the-first-big-political-war-of-trumps-presidency-will-be-explosive/	The first big political war of Trump’s presidency will be explosive	"   (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)  THE MORNING PLUM: One of the most cherished narratives that Donald Trump used to scam voters into electing him president is the notion that Barack Obama lawlessly allowed huge swarms of parasitic undocumented immigrants into the country to leach off public benefits and steal the jobs of ordinary Americans. So here's an immediate question: Will Trump make good on his promise to revoke protections for the hundreds of thousands of young people currently working and living in the United States who were brought here by their parents illegally as children? Trump has repeatedly pledged to cancel all of Obama's executive actions right away as president. That includes a promise to scrap Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which grants work permits and temporary reprieve from deportation to the DREAMers. Obama's executive deportation relief has been widely denounced by Republicans for years, and Trump's immigration plan vows to ""immediately terminate"" DACA, describing it as an ""illegal amnesty."" It will be fully within Trump's power to act on this promise on Day One of his presidency, immigration lawyer David Leopold tells me. Because DACA was granted by executive action, it is subject to revocation at the discretion of the president -- or any of his successors. (Obama's effort to expand this protection to other classes was halted by the courts, but DACA remains in force.) If Trump cancels DACA on Day One, Leopold says, it would revoke the work permits of its beneficiaries in short order and leave them subject to deportation.      President-elect Donald Trump will have a busy day after his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   ""Many of these people are young, just starting out, and heavily invested in participating openly in the American system,"" Leopold says. This could have a disruptive impact on hundreds of thousands of people, as well as their families and communities -- whether or not they end up getting deported in the future. After vowing mass deportations throughout the primaries, Trump modified this plan during the general election, promising to deport only the criminals first. But Trump's modified plan would create no meaningful path to long-term legal status and would leave undocumented immigrants targets for deportation at some unspecified later date. Revoking protection for the DREAMers would raise the prospect of them getting deported later, but much more immediately, the revocation of work permits would effectively drive them underground in the short term. Immigration advocates are already organizing to fight Trump, should he make good on this and other promises. ""There's no way these young people are going to walk quietly back into the shadows,"" Leopold says. Many of the DREAMers are sympathetic figures. They are an organized and skillful political force. It is likely that few Americans associate them with the image Trump regularly invokes of undocumented immigrants as parasitic or criminal elements. Many are culturally American and fully fluent in accent-less English, having arrived at a young age and having lived good chunks of their lives here. DACA permitted many of them to integrate themselves deeply into American life by getting jobs on the books, which in turn allowed some to more fully develop skills or utilize their educations. If their work permits are revoked, you can expect sympathetic national media profiles of the victims, which will feature them declaring that their only desire is to work hard and remain productive, contributing members of American society.  This would be one of the first big stories of the Trump presidency. The question is whether other Republicans will want this story to unfold. Congressional Republicans have voted to defund DACA in the past. But they did so secure in the knowledge that they could rail angrily at Obama's lawless amnesty without facing the political consequences of actually ending it, because they knew Obama would never allow that to happen. But now President Trump can end DACA himself with the stroke of a pen, and produce all of those consequences right away. If Trump does not go through with this, he may be castigated by immigration hardliners for breaking a promise on an issue that appears to have been central to his appeal to the ""forgotten men and women"" who elected him and make up Donald Trump's America. If he does go through with it, we will be provided with an early and vivid illustration of what the xenophobic promises Trump made to His America actually mean in the real world. ************************************************************ * TRUMP WILL REVERSE OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONS: Politico reports that Trump is poised to reverse Obama executive actions in areas beyond immigration: On the chopping block will be regulations to address climate change (which he's labeled a Chinese hoax); to implement Obamacare (""a disaster""); and to rein in Wall Street (""We're too involved in regulation of the banks""). Gone, too will be President Barack Obama's executive actions protecting the children of undocumented immigrants. Another key question will be whether Trump is really able to reverse Obama's Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions. * COALITION OF WHITE VOTERS DROVE TRUMP WIN: The New York Times offers a deep dive into the coalition of white voters that enabled Trump to prevail, one that is unlike one enjoyed by any other candidate: Mr. Trump's coalition comprised...millions of voters in the onetime heartlands of 20th-century liberal populism -- the Upper and Lower Midwest -- where white Americans without a college degree voted decisively to reject the more diverse, educated and cosmopolitan Democratic Party of the 21st century Most strikingly, Mr. Trump won his biggest margins among middle-income white voters, according to exit polls, a revolt not only of the white working class but of the country's vast white middle class. Meanwhile, a combination of voter suppression and the lack of a sizable enough win among Latinos kept Clinton's coalition from overcoming Trump's. * TRUMP WILL LEAVE THE DETAILS TO PAUL RYAN: NBC News reports that some Republicans expect Trump to allow Paul Ryan to set a fair amount of the GOP's governing agenda. One leading Congressional supporter of Trump says the president-elect regularly tells Ryan this: ""You drive the legislative agenda, I'll drive the vision and we'll work together and get this done."" One imagines that Trump is likely to sign whatever budgets Ryan sends him, even if they cut entitlements, regardless of what Trump has said about protecting them in the past. * CHUCK SCHUMER'S TOUGH BALANCING ACT: CNN reports on an interesting dynamic to keep an eye on: For Schumer, the challenges will be formidable. He'll have to listen to the vocal and outspoken progressive wing of his caucus, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who have legions of supporters. But he also has five red-state Democrats in states Trump won convincingly -- Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia -- up for re-election in 2018. And if Schumer takes his caucus too far to the left, he's bound to could put his moderates in a difficult political spot. Worth watching: Whether those red state Democrats claim the party has moved too far to ""the left"" when it resists Trump's agenda. * BEWARE THIS ARGUMENT AMONG DEMOCRATS: With the conversations beginning about the lessons the Democratic Party needs to take from their loss, E.J. Dionne makes a key point: If the past is any guide, more moderate Democrats will talk about how, perhaps, the country was asked to accept too much cultural change too quickly, or that whites, especially white men, were exhausted from having every other group lifted up except themselves. I fear that this argument will tear apart those who must now stand together. You can definitely expect that argument from some quarters: the Democrats lost because they were too aggressive in condemning Trump's bigotry and xenophobia. * AND TRUMP TEAM SAW CLINTON AS 'PERFECT FOIL': Bloomberg Businessweek looks at the Trump electorate and concludes it was driven in part by rage at Washington elites: ""Hillary Clinton was the perfect foil for Trump's message,"" says Steve Bannon, his campaign chief executive officer. ""From her e-mail server, to her lavishly paid speeches to Wall Street bankers, to her FBI problems, she represented everything that middle-class Americans had had enough of."" Whatever Clinton's very real flaws as a candidate, it was awfully helpful to Trump that major media organizations chose to relentlessly hype the visibility and significance of all those things.  "

If Trump had run a more-or-less conventional campaign, and if it had earned him a lead in the polls for weeks before Election Day, then his triumph would have been a more-or-less normal event, in the eyes of both his supporters and his foes.  Instead, he broke all the rules of American politics (and politesse) on his way to proving false a near-unanimous expert consensus that his election was not possible.  As his rambling wreck of a campaign rolled on, only he and a hardy few true believers insisted to the end that he knew better, and was going to win -- and, well, now no one can argue with his success.  Therefore, this victory is also a vindication -- confirmation, in the eyes of the millions who evidently wish to believe it, that ""Mr. Trump"" is gifted with special insight and a special connection with the people.      Demonstrators around the country hit the streets on Nov. 9 to protest the election of President-elect Donald Trump. Protests were reported in major cities including New York, Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles. (Victoria Walker,Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   Such political ""miracles"" (which is what, on Nov. 8, a senior adviser said a Trump win would be) confer upon their authors a particular kind of authority.   [How each of us can help keep America inclusive, even under Trump]  It is charismatic authority, which is not quite the same as personal charm or magnetism, neither of which Trump possesses. Nor, of course, does it have anything in common with the traditional authority of, say, a hereditary prince, or the legal authority that U.S. elections under our Constitution were meant to confer. Rather, as Max Weber famously defined it, ""charismatic authority"" stems from a kind of political mojo ""resting on devotion to the exceptional sanctity, heroism or exemplary character of an individual person, and of the normative patterns or order revealed or ordained by him.""  Anyone who has witnessed a Trump rally, and the energy generated by the mutually reinforcing rule-breaking carried out by both candidate and crowd, can confirm that Weber's concept applies. Looking ahead to the Trump administration, the hope must be that all of that was so much political spectacle, and that he will accept constitutional and political constraints once in office. The fear, though, is that his charismatic authority intoxicates, portending great difficulty for any who would challenge him, at least at the beginning. For those outside Trump's charmed circle, of course, the overwhelming sensation now is cognitive dissonance, and a particularly crippling form of it at that.      Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump rejoiced across the nation on Election Night as their candidate defied the polls. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   Democrats feel that they quite literally do not know what is going on in their own country, and it may be a long time before they can formulate an effective response. Yet the situation could also be complicated for Republicans who might try to deal with their new leader and the acolytes -- Chris Christie, perhaps, or Ben Carson -- who may accompany him to Washington, whether their goal is control, cooperation or co-optation.  The Trump White House response could well be ""He was right about the election, when everyone else said he was wrong, so who are you to say he's not right about this, too?"" -- on Russia, immigration or anything else. Add to that the fact that some of the Republicans who were reelected to the Senate or the House arguably owe their upset victories to Trump's coattails, and you have a formula for Trump domination of the GOP establishment, not the opposite.  [Trump won. Here's how to fight back.]  On paper, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) have ample means to contend with Trump. Yet those consist mainly of conventional parliamentary mechanisms. Trump can go over their heads to the GOP masses, aided by the new high priest of Republican communications, Stephen K. Bannon of Breitbart News, who has just helped Trump to campaign victory and is therefore enjoying his own powerful moment of vindication. When and if resistance develops, or Trump blunders, or untoward world events -- such as a recession -- occur, aides will be ready to assist Trump in deflecting blame onto anyone except the new president himself, just as pro-Trump media promiscuously scapegoated the mainstream press and other enemies during the campaign. The American constitutional system's checks and balances may be about to face a historic test. If they still work, however, Trump should find himself bogged down in a series of inconclusive political battles, which ultimately disillusion his followers, encourage his opponents and force him into a more conventional, and stable, form of democratic politics.  This would be the disarming of his charismatic authority through its ""routinization"" -- Weber's word -- and, fortunately, the great German sociologist, with his prodigious learning, was able to identify multiple instances of this throughout history. But not even Max Weber ever had to analyze a case quite like Donald Trump.   Read more from Charles Lane's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/0fcea580-a20d-11e6-8d63-3e0a660f1f04_story.html	A rancorous campaign begets huge problems for the winner	" Donald Trump's campaign for president was rarely pretty and always implausible -- at least that's what the experts said. Trump always believed otherwise and in stunning fashion proved all the experts wrong. But his victory over Hillary Clinton left open the biggest question of all: What kind of president will he be and what kind of country will he lead?  It's impossible to overstate how uncertain the road ahead is at this point. But how will Trump govern, and how effective will he be? His core issues -- trade, immigration, and law and order -- offer clues but no clear road map for the future. Even in pursuit of the goals he outlined in those three areas, his proposals lack real specificity. But then, his campaign was not about policy white papers. It was instead a thumb in the eye of the establishment, an American version of the populist uprisings against open borders and globalization that have been seen in other Western societies. Trump always said he smelled an American Brexit in the making -- a reference to the unexpected victory in Britain in June by those who wanted to take the country out of the European Union. That vote caught the elites and the establishment totally by surprise. It was an uprising that went unseen until it struck. Trump's victory was by far even more shocking. It was the kind of ""can't happen here"" event that will go down as one of the great upsets in political history. What happened Tuesday was a victory powered by an outpouring of voters, overwhelmingly white and many without college degrees, who felt left behind by the economic recovery, ignored by Washington and disdained by the political, cultural and economic elites. In the end, that was enough to topple Clinton and her dream of becoming the first female president in the nation's history. The shock waves will be felt for months and maybe years.  Trump insulted Hispanics, women, a prominent senator who was a former POW, and a disabled reporter. He called for a ban on Muslims entering the country, later modified and softened. Can he make room in the America he now leads for all those who loudly and vigorously opposed his candidacy? Trump suggested he might not accept the outcome of the election if he lost. How will those who oppose him now respond to his victory? Those are far from incidental questions.         1 of 46       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What Election Night looks like as results roll in      View Photos   Americans anxiously await the results of the 2016 election.

Yet even she acknowledged that what fueled his candidacy, at least in part, was the feeling of alienation and economic anxiety on the part of a wide swath of the population. One Clinton adviser described it as ""a quiet rage"" that existed in the privacy of living rooms and around kitchen tables, frustration with the political system and the lack of tangible results from government's actions for many hard-working Americans.  Clinton's ""deplorables"" comment became a rallying cry in the final months of the campaign. Trump attracted an army of loyal followers who saw in him the mechanism to break the hold of those in power and to shake Washington to its core. They also loathed Clinton, no small part of the reason she lost. It was that combination and that power, seen but underestimated during the campaign that produced an election night shocker that sent world markets plunging and left the country on edge. Trump succeeded for many reasons, easier to describe in retrospect than many who view politics through traditional lenses saw throughout the campaign. His mistakes always seemed to overwhelm his attributes. What the experts overlooked was how many people were willing to forgive or discount the most controversial aspects of his candidacy -- and what no one can measure is just how many agreed with what he said. This was an uprising by Americans who had lost faith in institutions. Trump gave them a voice they felt they haven't had in a changing America. Clinton tried to make the campaign all about temperament. As a political strategy, it failed. But that doesn't negate the questions about whether Trump can successfully translate the style of his campaign to the demands of the Oval Office. So many questions now rise up for answers. How will he govern? Can he forge a true working relationship with Republican congressional leaders whom he belittled as they equivocated about his candidacy?  His foreign policy pronouncements lacked both consistency and coherence. He had no fixed ideology. He leaned right on tax cuts and left on trade. He has operated on instinct and impulse. He said whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. What he showed is that huge numbers of Americans cared little about ideological consistency or political correctness. What they wanted was a send-a-message candidate. His most important relationship will be with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). At one point Ryan described Trump's insults about U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel as the definition of racism, yet he still voted for him. As Trump offered his agenda, Ryan countered with one of his own. Whose will take precedence?     The Post's Dan Balz explores some of the factors behind President-elect Donald Trump's victory against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   In the closing weeks of the campaign, Trump went to Gettysburg, Pa., where he laid out an agenda that provides some indication of what he might do. It was a speech akin to the 1994 House Republicans' Contract with America, a series of pledges designed, as Trump put it, ""to drain the swamp"" of privilege and special interests in Washington. Others have promised as much in the past.  This was an election about fundamentals and first principles, bringing to the surface an acrimonious argument about the values and beliefs that provide the underpinnings of any society. It was an election that involved big questions about race, gender, religion and economic inequality, as well as the relationship between the central government and an increasingly distrustful people. It highlighted the gulf between society's elites -- political, economic and cultural -- and the rest of the population. Above all it was a campaign about the identity of a nation. The campaign brought to the fore the tensions of a nation in transition and the pull and tug felt on each side of dividing lines that define far more than just our politics. At its best, this can produce a conversation in which different sides bring heartfelt attitudes about what makes America the great nation it was, is and will be. At its worst, it can give voice to racism and misogyny, anti-Semitism and religious bigotry. The election exposed the rawest edges of a diverse and changing America. The campaign pitted group against group, injected tension into everyday interactions even among friends and neighbors. Social media stoked those tensions and widened the divisions.  Clinton ran a campaign she could never have anticipated. She was thrust into the maelstrom of a Trump-generated cyclone, and she and her campaign tried to adapt on the fly. She represented history in the making, but through much of the campaign the possibility of breaking the gender barrier provided a far more modest lift than Obama received on his way to becoming the nation's first African American president. Trump did what Clinton could not do, delivering margins in predominantly white areas of battleground states that far eclipsed those of Mitt Romney in 2012. Clinton failed to do what she needed, which was to combine elements of the Obama coalition -- Hispanics, African Americans and young voters -- and add to them college-educated white voters turned off by Trump's rhetoric. His rallies were always bigger and more passionate than hers, and on Election Day, that energy helped deliver the victory. Big elections are supposed to help settle some of these disputes, or at least point a direction for the new leader. Yet, as the campaign ended Tuesday, the question remained as to what had been resolved, if anything. No one was prepared to predict what kind of presidency Trump would fashion, only that if it followed the patterns of his campaign, it would continue to divide the country and, at its start, certainly, alarm allies around the world. And yet Trump vowed he could find a way to make it work. Michael Leavitt, the Republican former governor of Utah, said as the polls were closing: ""I think the country is desperate for a jolt of optimism. In their own way, what most people have wanted to find is functionality [in Washington]. Those who support Trump believe the only way you can find functionality is to 'drain the swamp.' "" For months, Americans have been apprehensive as they neared Election Day, never able to turn away from the spectacle that was on their television screens and smartphones. Record numbers watched the debates during the primaries, and the biggest audience ever tuned in for the first of three Clinton-Trump faceoffs this fall.  Everyone knew the campaign was unlike anything they had seen in the past. Everyone wanted it to end. Now it falls to Trump, the unlikely winner of the most traumatic election in memory, to chart the course ahead and try, if he can, to prove that he can lift the whole country out of its morass and make Washington work.
