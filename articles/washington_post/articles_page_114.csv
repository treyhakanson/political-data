They walked out Monday in California, Colorado, Maryland, Washington and other states, many declaring concerns over the president-elect's comments about minorities and the effect he will have on their communities. Some of Trump's supporters have called for the demonstrations to stop, including former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who dismissed the protesters as ""spoiled crybabies."" Trump has accused some of being ""professional protesters,"" although he said in a ""60 Minutes"" interview broadcast Sunday that he also believes some are afraid for the country's future ""because they don't know me."" Here's a look at some of Monday's protests: ___ LOS ANGELES More than a thousand students from several schools on Los Angeles' heavily Hispanic east side marched out of classes. The demonstrations began at Garfield High School, the subject of the 1988 film ""Stand and Deliver"" focusing on teacher Jaime Escalante's successful college-level math programs. Students with signs and slogans headed to nearby Mariachi Plaza. They were joined by hundreds of students from several schools, many shouting, ""Say it loud. Say it clear. Immigration, welcome here."" Some carried signs that read ""Deport Trump,"" while others waved the U.S., Mexican and gay pride flags. Many said they have relatives and friends in the country illegally who they fear will be deported. Brian Rodriguez, 16, was born in the U.S. to parents from Mexico and Guatemala. He said he was offended by Trump's criticism of Latinos.  ""It hurt me inside knowing somebody from outside our race is talking bad about us,"" said Rodriguez, carrying a sign reading, ""Brown and Proud."" Rodriguez said his school's principal opened the gates and told students they could participate. Nancy Meza, a community organizer who announced the walkout, said she helped students organize after they reached out to her.  ""It was really out of frustration of students wanting to voice their opinions,"" Meza said. ""And wanting to feel protected."" ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA Hundreds of students from a dozen high schools in Oakland skipped classes to demonstrate. They called on California cities to remain sanctuaries for people in the country illegally, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee vowed Monday to maintain that status. Administrators had hoped students would return to class quickly, but they did not ask them to stop protesting, Oakland Unified School District spokesman John Sasaki said. ""We support our students' First Amendment rights,"" he said. ___ DENVER About 200 middle- and high-school students left two Denver charter schools to march to the state Capitol, where they chanted and held up signs saying, ""Millennial voice matters"" and ""Make peace not war."" Police and school officials escorted the students along city streets to ensure their safety. The protesters called out ""Si, se puede"" -- Spanish for ""Yes, we can"" -- and ""The people united will never be divided."" Noelie Quintero, 17, said they represented Latinos, Muslims, women and others marginalized by Trump.  ""We're not going anywhere -- we're going to continue to stand strong,"" she said. ""Even though we're only 16- and 17-year-olds and we can't vote, our voice matters. What we believe matters, and we're not going to stop."" ___ PORTLAND, OREGON In a city that has seen large and destructive protests, a few hundred students from several schools walked out of class to gather in the rain near City Hall. The group held signs saying ""Students for change"" and ""Love trumps hate."" They marched across a bridge, some of them climbing up it, while officers stopped traffic. It was peaceful, following smashed windows and other vandalism at recent rallies. Daily demonstrations have led to $1 million in damage and more than 100 arrests. A protest organizer says activists were contacting counterparts in New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., and other cities in an effort to stop Trump from prevailing on his issues.  ""Trump is going to be president, so we need to prepare for that,"" said Greg McKelvey of the group Portland's Resistance. McKelvey said they want to ensure local governments fight racial disparities in policing and help address global warming. ___ SEATTLE Thousands of students across Seattle chanted as they marched in the streets and waved ""Not My President"" or ""Love Wins"" signs. Seattle Public Schools spokesman Luke Duecy reported more than 5,000 students from 20 middle and high schools walked out of classes Monday. Some said they oppose Trump's divisive rhetoric and wanted to show support for those he targeted, such as Muslims or immigrants. Others say they came to support their friends or simply to observe. High school senior Rose Taylor, who is bisexual, says she worries about what Trump's election will mean for the LGBT community and others. Police say two men, who were not students, were arrested in connection with the protest. ___ SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND Hundreds of high school students left campus and took to the streets to declare their opposition to Trump, while hundreds more gathered for a rally at a school football stadium. About 800 Montgomery Blair High School students attended the rally at the stadium, and most returned to class afterward, Montgomery County Public Schools spokeswoman Gboyinde Onijala said. The ones who left joined students from nearby Northwood High School, making up a gathering that Onijala estimated at 200 to 300, some of them chanting, ""Not my president."" Police Capt. Paul Starks says the protesters were peaceful except for one bottle-throwing incident. No one was hurt. ___ Associated Press writers Christine Armario in Los Angeles; Andrew Selsky in Portland, Oregon; Phuong Le in Seattle; and Sarah Brumfield in Washington contributed to this story. ___ This story has been corrected to show Jaime Escalante's name was misspelled Jamie.

(AP)  In 1819, well after helping to found the United States of America, Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. It was the state's first true public university. Known as the ""Father of the University of Virginia,"" Jefferson was laid to rest at his home in Monticello, less than 10 miles from his school. Jefferson embodied the contradictions of his time. He was a slave owner, who wrote ""all men are created equal"" in the Declaration of Independence. But Martin Luther King Jr., for example, regularly evoked Jefferson's words in his speeches. On Sept. 12, 1962, King spoke at the New York Civil War Centennial Commission's Emancipation Proclamation Observance in New York City. There he said, ""Jefferson with keen perception saw that the festering sore of slavery debilitated white masters as well as the Negro. He feared for the future of white children who were taught a false supremacy. His concern can be summed up in one quotation, 'I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just.'"" Now, a group of students and faculty members at the very school Jefferson founded have chastised the university president for quoting him in a statement she made after the election of Donald Trump. Following Trump's victory, University President Teresa Sullivan sent an email urging students to remember their own responsibility in the world, the Cavalier Daily reported. Sullivan wrote, ""By coincidence, on this exact day 191 years ago -- November 9, 1825, in the first year of classes at U.Va. -- Thomas Jefferson wrote to a friend that University of Virginia students 'are not of ordinary significance only: they are exactly the persons who are to succeed to the government of our country, and to rule its future enmities, its friendships and fortunes.' I encourage today's U.Va. students to embrace that responsibility."" It wasn't the first such email quoting Jefferson that Sullivan had written to the student body. As The Washington Post's Susan Svrluga reported, a week earlier she sent one out after someone scrawled the word ""terrorists"" on the door of a dorm room where two Muslim students resided. In that letter, Sullivan advocated peace on campus, writing, ""Thomas Jefferson was the first American president to wrest power from an opposing party, yet he also provided a potent precedent for the peaceful transfer of power and the healing of a divided nation."" With the second email, a contingent of the campus decided they'd had enough. Assistant Professor of Psychology Noelle Hurd drafted an open letter addressed to the school's president ""to provide [Sullivan] with some constructive and respectful feedback regarding [her] messages."" This email denounced her usage of quotations by Jefferson, the school's founder, due to the fact that he was a slaveholder. Four hundred and sixty-nine students and faculty members signed the letter. The letter read, in part: We are incredibly disappointed in the use of Thomas Jefferson as a moral compass. Thomas Jefferson owned hundreds of slaves. Other memorable Jefferson quotes include that Blacks are ""inferior to the whites in the endowments of body and mind,"" and ""as incapable as children of taking care of themselves."" Though we realize that some members of our university community may be inspired by quotes from Jefferson, we also realize that many of us are deeply offended by attempts on behalf of our administration to guide our moral behavior through their use. It stated that, ""although some members of this community may have come to this university because of Thomas Jefferson's legacy, others of us came here in spite of it."" Finally it stated, ""For many of us, the inclusion of Jefferson quotes undermines the messages of unity, equality, civility, and inclusivity that you are attempting to convey."" ""The intention of the email was to start a conversation with our administration regarding ways to be more inclusive,"" Hurd told the Cavalier Daily. ""In the current climate, we must seize every opportunity to communicate that this university welcomes individuals from all backgrounds.""   [A professor offered to send Trump protesters to Canada -- if they 'promise never to come back']   Politics professor Lawrie Balfour, who also signed the letter, said that a simple mention of Jefferson is enough to undo progress -- a cycle that's oft repeated during her decade and a half with the school. ""I've been here 15 years,"" Balfour told the Cavalier Daily. ""Again and again, I have found that at moments when the community needs reassurance and Jefferson appears, it undoes I think the really important work that administrators and others are trying to do."" Sullivan quickly responded on Monday with a letter that reaffirmed the university's ""long-standing tradition of open discourse"" in which she wrote, ""I fully endorse their right to speak out on issues that matter to all of us, including the University's complicated Jeffersonian legacy."" ""In my message last week, I agreed with Mr. Jefferson's words expressing the idea that UVA students would help to lead our Republic. He believed that 200 years ago, and I believe it today,"" Sullivan wrote, continuing to state this doesn't indicate that she agrees with all of the man's actions, thoughts or politics. In her response to a letter asking her not to quote Jefferson, Sullivan continued to, indeed, defiantly quote Jefferson. She wrote: UVA is still producing leaders for our Republic, and from backgrounds that Mr. Jefferson could not have anticipated in 1825, when he wrote the words that I quoted. Today's leaders are women and men, members of all racial and ethnic groups, members of the LGBTQ community, and adherents of all religious traditions. All of them belong at today's UVA, whose founder's most influential and most quoted words were "" . . . all men are created equal."" Those words were inherently contradictory in an era of slavery, but because of their power, they became the fundamental expression of a more genuine equality today. The irony of the situation was not lost on many Twitter users. Others appeared to be angry.   UVA is upset about their pres using a jefferson quote lol man wild times -- jimmy vesey (@dudelawless) November 15, 2016     He. Founded. The. School. https://t.co/ZdyjfbcGL8 -- David Bozell (@DavidBozell) November 14, 2016     Hate Thomas Jefferson? Here's a thought: Don't enroll at or take a teaching job at the university he founded. #UVA #ThomasJefferson -- kerry dougherty (@kerrydougherty) November 15, 2016     Tonight I'm listening to only Thomas Jefferson songs on the Hamilton soundtrack as an f u to UVA  -- Erica B (@Rikki5582) November 15, 2016     Oh  here's another good one President of university founded by Jefferson asked to not quote Jefferson#UVA #VIRGINIA -- margaret (@Margrz) November 15, 2016   This is not the first time an institution has wrestled with the past of a Founding Father connected with said institution. In Sept., Matt Haney, the president of the San Francisco Unified School District Board of Education, argued that local schools named after men who owned slaves deserved new names. He wrote on Twitter, ""We should rename Washington High School after San Francisco native, poet and author Maya Angelou. Maya Angelou High School. No schools named after slave owners."" And, as The Post reported, ""In 1997, [New Orleans], following a policy of not honoring slave owners, swapped George Washington's name on an elementary school for Charles Richard Drew, a black surgeon who lived from 1904 to 1950."" Sullivan argued that, in the case of UVA, using select Jefferson quotes is not the same as honoring his actions. ""Quoting Jefferson [or any historical figure] does not imply an endorsement of all the social structures and beliefs of his time,"" Sullivan wrote in her letter. Regardless, Hurd said his contradictions, if left unexplored, could create a hostile environment. ""The point is not that he is never appropriate,"" Balfour told the Cavalier Daily. ""But the point is that the move that says, he owned slaves, but he was a great man, is deeply problematic, and I think it will continue to prevent us from being the kind of inclusive, respectful community that President Sullivan and the rest of us envision.""

A gilded bell hangs silently above the almost empty floor, engraved with a single word: ""Success."" Not yet. Only three companies are listed on the board and at the end of the day just 7,221 shares were traded, compared with nearly 839 million the same day on the New York Stock Exchange. Since the YSE, a joint venture between Myanmar, Japan's Daiwa Institute of Research and the Japan Exchange Group, began trading in March, only 20,000 investors have ventured into the market. Regulators complain that those who do take the plunge rely largely on rumors, herd psychology and even the stars. Martin Zhang, an account executive with KBZ Stirling Coleman Securities, said one client offered him an astrological chart to help guide his investment decisions. The Amsterdam stock market, the world's first, opened its doors 428 years ago. The New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest, was born in 1817, Thet Htun Oo, senior manager of the Yangon exchange, reminded a recent group of visiting journalists.  ""We are only a seven-month-old baby,"" he said. A half-century of harsh military rule in this Southeast Asian country of 55 million brought economic ruin and isolation from the international community and global financial trends. But Myanmar remains a cornucopia of natural resources, and it is welcoming foreign investment as one of Asia's last economic frontiers. The former British colony's economic growth is forecast at 8 percent this year, among the fastest in the region. Just a week after trading began on the Yangon exchange, a democratically elected government headed by former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi took power. Since then, the United States has lifted nearly all the economic sanctions it had imposed on the former military regime, freeing up remittances from abroad which experts say may help fuel the market.  ""We shall see. It's conditional. If our economy prospers, the stock market will also do well,"" said Khin Maung Nyo, an economist and author. For the time being, he advised caution for ""Mr. Average."" With the three listed companies mostly trading below their initial price levels, many investors have fared poorly. The first stock to be traded, First Myanmar Investment, is owned by real estate tycoon Serge Pun and is one of the country's biggest public companies. It made its debut at 40,000 kyat a share ($31 at current exchange rates). On Nov. 11 it finished at 16,000 kyat (about $12), despite having seen its profit soar in the past year.  ""People watch TV and read novels about stock markets and think they can get rich overnight, but now they are beginning to realize that it's not that easy,"" said Khin Maung Nyo. Many investors blindly follow friends and neighbors into the market and when it tumbles they ""all go over the cliff together,"" said Zhang of KBZ. The firm's operations chief, Jonathan Lin, says he suspects some first consult fortune tellers. After all, this is a country where past leaders made crucial political decisions only after seeing their favorite soothsayers. KBZ and four other brokerage firms handle trading electronically. That is one reason for the lack of activity on the trading floor of the 1939, neo-classical Yangon Stock Exchange building, with its imposing white Ionic columns. Traditionally, Burmese have stashed their wealth in gold and jewelry. The wealthiest, like Serge Pun, have headed to Singapore to list their companies. The country's two-digit lottery is wildly popular with speculators. But most people in Yangon's streets respond with puzzled looks when asked about the stock market. Thet Htun Oo of YSE said his staff are touring the country and using social media to urge would-be investors to ""do their homework"" and invest for long-term gains. Myanmar is drafting legislation to allow foreign investors into the market and to permit continuous trading, rather than the current two daily auctions. A fourth listing, the First Private Bank, is scheduled before the year's end, and Thet Htun Oo said he anticipates five newcomers on the board during each of the next five years. As the market grows, institutional investors, who so far have kept away, are expected to step in. The hope is that Yangon's bourse will emulate Vietnam's highly successful stock markets, rather than the lackluster exchanges in Laos and Cambodia. All were launched since 2005. Having leapfrogged older systems, Myanmar's exchange has the latest technology. Soon, investors will be able to make trades on their mobile telephones.  ""We could grow very fast but we need government regulators to render proper support and understand the value of capital markets to the country,"" said Rudi Rolles, managing director of KBZ in Yangon. Rolles, a veteran of stock markets in emerging economies, said the government could help, for example, by offering tax breaks to companies that list shares on the exchange. He and other market boosters say the exchange should play a central role in raising capital to help grow the economy.  ""The market is in its infancy,"" Rolles said. ""But it will develop in the long run, and it will be successful."" ___ Denis Gray's work can be found at:  https://apnews.com/search/denis%20gray  Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

They included a broken and dysfunctional Republican Party, a balkanized media, and an angry and suspicious electorate. At the top of Obama's list -- the physical embodiment of those gathering and potentially existential threats -- was Donald Trump, from whom Obama sat inches away in the Oval Office on Thursday.  The president had mocked Trump as a temperamentally unstable reality-TV star who regularly demeans women and minorities and was unfit for and unworthy of the country's highest office. Following their first-ever meeting, Obama emphasized the need ""to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face."" Trump's win raises difficult questions for Obama that he and his top advisers have only just begun to confront: What role, if any, did Obama, his policies and his approach to the presidency play in Trump winning the White House? For more than a decade, Obama has forged a national political identity around the uplifting idea that Americans share a core set of liberal, democratic values that run deeper than the country's racial, class and ideological divisions. Why did those divisions only seem to deepen over the course of Obama's two terms in office? ""This has been a deeply dispiriting election year,"" Obama recently told donors at a Democratic fundraising dinner in Ohio. ""Sometimes you wonder, how did we get to the point where we have such rancor?"" Intentionally or not, some of the president's actions probably contributed to that rancor. He was insulated by a White House bubble and a staff with fewer ties to those parts of the country that were most alienated. His executive actions, essential to advancing his agenda in an era of gridlock, inflamed an increasingly partisan electorate. Meanwhile, a micro-targeted media strategy sometimes took precedence over speaking to the entire country.  Inside the West Wing, there were tears, sadness and a general feeling of disbelief that even though Obama's approval rating now stands at 56 percent, a significant number of his supporters backed Trump's sometimes dark, nativist and anti-immigrant vision for the country. ""I don't have an explanation for that, to put it bluntly,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.   [Once the hope candidate, Obama in his final days faces a hopeless electorate]  Senior White House aides rejected the idea that Obama bore responsibility for Trump's victory or that the election was a referendum on the Obama presidency. ""An election is a comparison between two people, and two candidates on the ballot,"" White House communications director Jennifer Psaki said in an interview last week. But White House officials, including Obama, who had described a Trump victory as a near-impossibility, were shocked by the depth of anger and fear that swept Trump to the White House. Throughout his second term, Obama spoke only fleetingly of the economic pain in the country caused by globalization, demographic changes and technological advances. His second-term agenda has been dominated by immigration initiatives and a far-reaching trade deal with Asia. Often, he seemed to question the depth of the anger and division in the country, noting that he was twice elected to the White House. ""There are always going to be folks who are frustrated,"" Obama told NPR's ""Morning Edition"" in December as Trump was gathering support. ""Some of them may not like my policies; some of them may just not like how I walk or my big ears.""     Speaking at the White House, Nov. 9, President Obama vowed to work towards a peaceful transition of power to President-elect Donald Trump and encouraged young people not to become cynical. Here are key moments from that speech, in three minutes. (White House)   In rare moments, he suggested that his race, name and upbringing may have helped inflame conspiracy theories about him in some segments of the Republican Party. ""I may represent change that worries them,"" he told NPR. Obama didn't completely ignore the struggles of rural, white Americans: His administration proposed spending more than $1 billion to deal with the opioid and heroin crisis that has ravaged rural America and is contributing to an unprecedented rise in mortality rates among working-class white men and women. His first-term efforts to save the automobile industry benefited blue-collar workers, as did the push to expand Medicaid, which was blocked by some Republican governors and legislators. But on the campaign trail, Obama sometimes seemed to have trouble connecting with the economic anxieties in rural parts of the country, referring to them fleetingly in his speech at the Democratic National Convention this summer as ""pockets of America that never recovered from factory closures."" He focused instead on the 15 million jobs created during his second term and the country's falling unemployment rate.  [Tom Vilsack's lonely fight for a 'forgotten' rural America]  Senior White House officials in January described ambitious plans to have the president speak more directly to Americans who disagreed with him. But those efforts were often sidetracked by higher priorities, such as police shootings and protests this summer. By early fall, Obama had shifted his focus to mobilizing young and minority voters, who were a key part of his coalition and had been slow to warm to a Hillary Clinton presidency. Obama attacked Trump as ignorant, vain and coldhearted. His mocking of the billionaire as better suited to ""The Bachelorette"" or ""Survivor"" than the Oval Office sometimes made it seem as if he were also mocking Trump's supporters. Even Obama seemed to concede the failure of his efforts to ease the country's growing anger and divisions. He rejected the idea that his policies alienated the white working class. ""The truth is that every policy I've put forward would make a huge difference with the white working class and the black working class and the Latino working class,"" Obama told HBO's Bill Maher a few days before Trump's victory. But Obama conceded his broader failure in an era of ""800 television stations"" and thousands more websites to convince these voters that he understood their frustrations and that his policies were making a difference. ""In this new age, what is the equivalent of getting into people's living rooms and having a conversation?"" Obama asked. ""I have not always been able to do it as successfully here in the White House, partly because of this bubble that's created around me."" In some instances, Obama's strategy for dealing with the polarization in the country may have made the problem worse. To drum up support for its policies, the Obama administration often sought out new media venues to mobilize small, loyal audiences. After his State of the Union address, for example, Obama sat for interviews with enthusiastic and often fawning YouTube stars to talk about his agenda for 2016, the tax on tampons and why he preferred rapper Kendrick Lamar to Drake. To overcome a gridlocked Congress, he relied heavily on executive orders and actions to spur progress on immigration, climate change and gun control. The surge of high-profile executive moves boosted Obama's popularity but angered his opponents.  ""It was all edicts -- fiat government,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels.  Despite Trump's win, Obama will leave the White House with some of the highest approval ratings of his presidency. First lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Biden have garnered even more support in polls. The president's surging popularity convinced his top aides that the anger in the country was not directed at him and his policies but at an implacable Republican Party that had prioritized obstruction and gridlock over reason and compromise. Today, even Obama's staunchest backers concede that the theory might be wrong. ""It would be a mistake if the Democratic Party didn't use this as a sobering moment of reflection on whether or not we are connecting, or if we're trying to connect in an outdated manner,"" said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the election frankly. ""That's not a matter of tactics . . . that's more whether we're hearing and listening to what people are experiencing in the country."" The president in private conversations with his staff has described the next 70 days, leading up to Trump's inauguration, as a key test of his presidency. One of his main jobs, alongside Trump, will be to start healing the nation. ""He recognizes it is going to [take] more than one speech in the Rose Garden,"" the senior administration official said.  [Which Barack Obama speech is the one for the history books?]  In 2004, Obama burst onto the national political scene with an electrifying promise to unite the country. ""There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America,"" he said. The bigger question, perhaps the central question of Obama's 12 years on the national stage, is whether the country has become too big, too diverse and too unruly to be guided by one voice. This was the question Obama seemed to be asking this summer at a memorial service for five slain Dallas officers. ""Can we do this? Can we find the character, as Americans, to open our hearts to each other?"" he asked. ""I don't know. I confess that sometimes I, too, experience doubt.""  David Nakamura contributed to this report.

"   Bagpipes greet Donald Trump as he arrives at his Trump Turnberry Resort on June 24, 2016, in Ayr, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)  As Donald Trump's campaign progressed, Britain's June 23 vote to leave the European Union was clearly on his mind. ""They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT!"" Trump tweeted in August, prompting a somewhat confused response. He soon upped the ante -- telling supporters at rallies in October that the U.S. presidential election would be ""Brexit plus"" and ""Brexit times five."" It was certainly possible to see the similarities in the two campaigns. Both Trump fans and Brexiters tended to be people who scorned the status quo and held negative views about globalization, immigration and political correctness. Often they wanted to upend the system and evinced a desire to bring their respective countries back to greatness. The American businessman seemed to be implying that he was being underestimated in much the same way that the Brexit campaign had been by Britain's political establishment. And there were certainly some who agreed.   [World gasps in collective disbelief following Trump's election]   ""The greatest parallel between the Brexit vote and to what may happen on Nov. 8 is that Brexit mobilized a large number of nonvoters -- indeed, some people who had never voted in their lives,"" Nigel Farage, the former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party and a key architect of the Brexit push, said in an article for The Washington Post in September. However, when Trump first made his comments about Brexit, he was widely mocked. Many suggested that he was misinterpreting the Brexit vote, which was a referendum on a single issue rather than a vote for a specific political candidate.      Americans at the election watch party of the U.S. embassy in London feel a repeat of Brexit shock as Republican Donald Trump edged closer to the White House. (Reuters)   Although Britain's vote to leave the E.U. caused shock, it wasn't entirely unexpected -- at least two major pollsters predicted a victory for the ""leave"" camp, with others saying it would be an extremely tight race. In the U.S. contest, Trump was given far worse odds. Polls had shown him trailing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for months -- the last Post-ABC tracking poll had Trump trailing Clinton 43 percent to 47. Even forecasters who had correctly predicted the Brexit vote outcome didn't think Trump would win, giving him, on average, a 30 percent chance of winning, according to one survey. Yet Tuesday, the unexpected happened. Trump won. With a projected 276 electoral votes, the political novice is expected to be the next U.S. president, though he may well have a smaller share of the total vote. What's more, his Republicans allies have held on to both the Senate and the House, giving Trump even more of a mandate. Brexit times five? Suddenly that statement doesn't seem so unreasonable. Trump had beaten expectations by a far wider margin than Brexiters had in their campaign.      At a rally in Lakeland, Fla., Oct. 12, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton ""is nothing"" without support from the news media. (The Washington Post)   For Britons watching Tuesday's election, there was a sense of deja vu as the results first came in. The Clinton camp's swing from confidence to uncertainty to despair and denial reminded many of the wild emotional ride that ""remain"" supporters had taken during Britain's referendum. And as Trump began to rack up unlikely wins in formerly Democratic strongholds, Farage took to Twitter to note the similarities with Britain's vote. His September prediction seemed to be coming true.   The @realDonaldTrump win in Florida feels just like the Sunderland moment. -- Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) November 9, 2016   By Wednesday morning, ""Brexit and Trump"" began to trend on Twitter in the United Kingdom. While there were some celebratory tweets, often the messages expressed despair, with many users raking over the path to the twin defeats to ask: What went wrong? Familiar fingers were pointed at elitist politicians, out-of-touch journalists and inaccurate pollsters.   Brexit and Trump have shown that too many pundits and media people live in a London, New York and LA myopic bubble. #USElection2016 -- Irvine Welsh (@IrvineWelsh) November 9, 2016   Right now, however, a full postmortem may be premature. As anyone watching the situation in Britain over the past few months will tell you, Brexit is far from a done deal: A recent court decision suggested that a hard exit from the E.U. may be politically difficult, if not impossible. Even in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, ""leave"" campaigners were accused of walking back their biggest promises, and there were reports of regret among those who voted in favor of Britain exiting the E.U. Similarly, it remains to be seen what kind of president Trump will be and whether the grand vision he pitched to his supporters -- including remarkable ideas such as building a wall on the border with Mexico or a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports -- is actually implementable. Even for the pro-Brexit camp, there's unpredictability here: How will ""Mr. Brexit"" deal with a post-Brexit Britain, a country where politicians until recently were insulting him and debating whether to ban his entry? Right now, an uncertainty about the future is what really ties together the future of Trump and Brexit. And the world may soon get more uncertainty. France will have its own general election next year -- and far-right leader Marine Le Pen is looking more confident than ever. More on WorldViews: What a real 'Brexit Britain' would look like"

(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we're talking about voter rationality. Need a primer? Catch up here. Robert Kurzban is a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. Jason Weeden is a researcher and lawyer. Their recent book is ""The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind: How Self-Interest Shapes Our Opinions and Why We Won't Admit It."" Hillary Clinton's use of the word ""deplorables"" to refer to half of Trump's supporters has taken a familiar tone when it comes to election contests. Partisans often view the other side's voters as immoral, ignorant and irrational. While research tells us that humans are subject to any number of biases, shortcomings and prejudices, support for Trump -- or Clinton -- need not, and probably should not, be attributed to these sources. Instead, the patterns of support for the two major candidates reveal a public that tends, on average, to match their votes to a range of rational, competing interests. Some commentators, for example, wondered why white evangelical Christians supported Donald Trump despite his marital record and his remarks and alleged sexual assaults against women. Yet Trump nonetheless was clearly more likely than Clinton to advance the objectives typical of white evangelicals, including the appointment of pro-life federal judges.   [Should we really trust voters?]   These kinds of objectives are not merely symbolic, but reflect genuine, real-life conflicts. Our own research shows, for example, that supporters of abortion rights tend to engage in years of casual sex while simultaneously carefully controlling their timing of reproduction and amount of childbearing. Favoring access to abortion and birth control, and opposing efforts to stigmatize casual sex, is therefore a defense of rational interests for these people. Their opponents, however, travel a more monogamous path with less-controlled fertility. And they often view those with more casual sexuality as disruptive to their lifestyles. (Think of it as trying to stick to a diet in an office where everyone else has candy bowls on their desks.) The efforts of religious conservatives to make casual sex more costly and difficult is also a defense of rational interests. It is perhaps even easier to see competing interests at work with immigration and trade. While economists generally agree that immigration and trade are good economically, it is simultaneously the case that they aren't good for everyone. Low-skilled immigrants and their families clearly benefit from accessing the U.S. labor market, but in doing so they create more job competition for low-skilled natives. Free trade lowers prices that consumers pay for many goods and boosts profits for the investor class, but also offshores some formerly good-paying jobs that less-educated natives might find difficult to replace. Such observations help explain Trump's appeal to whites without college degrees, but there is clearly more to it than that. Trump's promise to ""make America great again,"" coupled with some of his best-known proposals -- overturning ""political correctness,"" building a wall, banning Muslim immigrants, stop-and-frisk policing of minorities -- involve perhaps the most central and tangible matters driving contemporary politics. These issues are about the basic competition between group-based discrimination and meritocracy. In the not very distant past, social advantages were primarily given to white, heterosexual, native-born Christian men and only secondarily based on test-based and education-based meritocratic concerns. The last few decades have flipped these priorities. Trump's core constituency involved not just low-education whites, but more specifically low-education, white, heterosexual, native-born, Christian men -- in other words, just the sort of constituency that had relative benefits under the old rules but faced a material loss in privilege under the new meritocratic priorities. While those of us who are the winners from meritocracy might find such views deplorable, it would be difficult to maintain that their solid support for Trump was not in their tangible interests. Similar arguments apply to supporters of ""crooked Hillary."" How could they overlook emails, the Clinton Foundation, her pandering to Wall Street and her husband's sexual history? Well, Clinton's core supporters were the demographic reverse of Trump's -- minorities, immigrants, gays and lesbians, non-Christians and women, particularly those with more education. Her supporters also had much to gain from her policies and priorities. The new core of the Republican party, Trump Republicans, don't represent a particular puzzle. They plausibly showed up to the polls this year because they would be better off under the policies that Trump emphasized in his campaign. And, having flexed their muscles, they are likely to continue seeking expanded influence. Not because they're irrational, but because they are self-interested -- something generally true of voters on both sides.

Up is down, no means yes, day is night. Donald Trump's tweets, speeches, interviews, debate statements, news conferences and off-the-cuff remarks -- that is, pretty much every utterance made during his waking hours -- have been a source of hyperbole at hyper-speed. His misstatements have been so ubiquitous that Hillary Clinton's slippery words often slithered right on by unnoticed. Trump made pernicious use of fictional numbers, concocted certain events and both contradicted and mispresented his earlier self. Clinton took actual facts and went beyond them, promising more than she can deliver, cherry-picking numbers and otherwise standing for the lawyerly Washington tradition of paying partial heed to reality while bending it to her advantage. Cautious by nature, she was most inclined to stretch facts to their snapping point when on the defensive about her email practices, which was often. Clinton's defensive position, in essence: The dog ate my homework. With Election Day finally, nearly upon us, some lowlights from both candidates: FOR TRUMP, DAY IS NIGHT --On Clinton's approach to borders: ""She wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That's what could happen."" THE FACTS: For this to happen, every other country in the Americas, from Mexico south to Chile's southern tip, and a chunk of Canada would have to empty its entire population into the U.S. But wait, there's more. Trump said that under Clinton, this could happen ""in one week."" This was no slip of the tongue -- at several events he's spoken of 600 million coming in under Clinton; at another, 650 million. This doesn't faintly resemble anything Clinton has proposed for the U.S. (population 325 million). Trump is riffing off of a leaked Clinton speech to bankers in which she spoke of her dream of a ""hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders."" The remarks in context suggested an interest in free commerce, not necessarily the free movement of people. But no one is talking about packing whole populations from other Western Hemisphere countries into the U.S. like sardines. Numbers are always pliable in the political arena; for Trump they are often whatever he wants them to be. He routinely overstates the U.S. trade deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars, no matter how many times he's called on it. ___ --On the battle of Mosul, Iraq, and other operations against Islamic State militants: ""Whatever happened to the element of surprise?"" THE FACTS: Many generals agree with Trump that it is folly to tell IS that it is about to be attacked. But those are armchair generals. Real ones tend to see the value in pre-announcing a major offensive. In the case of Mosul, signaling an assault in advance was a way for Iraqi forces to warn civilians in the city and to encourage a resistance movement to weaken IS before the battle began. Moreover, any element of surprise had been long lost; preparations for the battle began more than a year ago, with the U.S. part in it under close scrutiny by Congress. More broadly, Trump's theory that secrecy should surround all such operations reflects a lack of understanding of how this battle against IS has developed over the past two years, as well as certain obligations to keep Congress informed. Basic decisions like when to assault Mosul are left to the Iraqi government, because it is the Iraqis who will have to govern the place when the fighting is done. The U.S. wants the Iraqis to own the Mosul problem -- both militarily and politically -- so they don't repeat the mistakes that allowed IS to capture the city in the first place. Mosul was the obvious last major target of an Iraqi counteroffensive against IS, whose ability to defend the city had been undermined by months of U.S. airstrikes against its leaders and financial and military resources. Surprise was not an option. ___ --When Clinton accused him of calling climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese: ""I did not. I did not."" --When asked about telling people on Twitter to check out a sex tape: ""It wasn't 'check out a sex tape.'"" THE FACTS: On these and other occasions, Trump has blithely denied making statements he plainly made -- even though he was caught on tape making them. In a 2012 tweet, he wrote: ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."" He later claimed he was kidding, but he's also repeated the claim that climate change is a hoax, and one that benefits China. In 2014: ""Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!"" During this campaign, he also tweeted ""check out sex tape and past"" of former 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Clinton discussed in a presidential debate as an example of Trump's derogatory comments about women. Machado, a Clinton supporter, criticized Trump for body-shaming her by calling her ""Miss Piggy"" when she gained weight. Was there a sex tape? In a manner, yes. Machado was filmed in a 2005 Spanish-language reality show in bed with a man; no nudity is seen but she said they were having sex in the footage. ___ --""I was against the war in Iraq, because I said it's gonna totally destabilize the Middle East. ... I was opposed to war from the beginning. ... I would not have had our troops in Iraq."" THE FACTS: Trump publicly supported the war before it started and praised its early progress. He's insisted otherwise uncountable times, despite the record. It's true he wasn't a cheerleader for the March 2003 invasion. For example, he said a few months before the war that the economy and North Korea were bigger problems. But that's hardly opposition. In September 2002, he told Howard Stern on the radio, when asked if he would back an invasion, ""Yeah, I guess so."" Days after the invasion, he said it ""looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint."" Moreover, Trump offered support for a hypothetical invasion of Iraq in his 2000 book, suggesting he would favor a pre-emptive strike if Iraq were viewed as a threat to national security. Trump did turn against the long-running war before many in Washington did. But that does not show the foresight he claimed when campaigning against Republican primary rivals who backed the invasion and when campaigning against Clinton, who voted in the Senate for the war. He was not against it when the decisions were being made about whether to start it. ___ TRUMP: ""I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering. ... It was on television. I saw it."" THE FACTS: This early head-scratcher, from November 2015, helped set a pattern of tall tales that would continue through the campaign. It also fed into one of the signature insults of a campaign full of them -- when Trump appeared to mock the disabilities of a New York Times reporter whose recollections from New Jersey after the 9/11 attacks did not support his own. No video or other proof of large-scale celebrations of the falling towers by Muslims in New Jersey ever emerged. Serge Kovaleski of the Times, who was working for The Washington Post in 2001, reported in the week after 9/11 that authorities in New Jersey detained and questioned ""a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks."" Kovaleski has a congenital condition that restricts joint movement. In a speech, Trump went after the ""the poor guy, you oughta see this guy"" -- making jerking gestures and taking a mocking tone. Trump later denied he was imitating Kovaleski and further claimed ""I have no idea"" who he is and didn't know of his condition. But Kovaleski said he had met Trump repeatedly, in face-to-face face interviews and at news conferences, and ""Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years."" ___ --On why he continued to raise questions about Barack Obama's country of birth even after the president produced his birth certificate in 2011: ""Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it."" THE FACTS: Trump himself continued to press false theories about Obama's birthplace after they were debunked. His claim that the matter faded when the birth certificate came out belies his efforts to keep the myth alive.  ""Was it a birth certificate?"" he asked in a 2012 interview. ""He was perhaps born in Kenya. Very simple, OK?"" Trump said in 2014. ""Who knows about Obama?"" Trump asked in January 2016. ___ CLINTON: THE DOG ATE MY HOMEWORK --""For those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand. And as I've said, I'm not making excuses. I've said it was a mistake and I regret it."" THE FACTS: She has made a variety of excuses on the way to a grudging acknowledgment that her use of a personal server and email for State Department business was wrong. She's said she used personal email because she wanted the simplicity of a single digital device, although it turned out she carried several devices. She said her email practices were ""approved"" when they were not -- they merely had not been expressly prohibited at the time for the secretary of state. She said she didn't understand that material marked with a ""c'' that passed through her personal communications system meant it was confidential. She said other secretaries of state did it first. That's partly true, but in a limited way and not with their own servers. She said she never passed on classified material in her system. The FBI found she passed on three email chains with information that had classified markings in the body of the emails; the State Department contended two of those chains held unclassified material. ___ --On the Trans-Pacific Partnership: ""I did say I hoped it would be a good deal."" THE FACTS: Clinton heartily supported the Pacific trade deal in speeches around the world as secretary of state; she did not merely hope it would turn out well. Clinton declared in Australia in 2012, ""This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field."" Similar speeches elsewhere affirmed her belief that the deal, still under negotiation, was ""groundbreaking,"" ''exciting"" and ""embodied"" 21st century standards. That position became awkward if not untenable in her Democratic primary race against Bernie Sanders, a foe of the deal, and she turned against it. Her less-than-detailed explanation: The deal as finally negotiated did not measure up to her standards for protecting U.S. wages, jobs and national security. Yet the final deal contains some of the strongest labor protections of any U.S. trade agreement. The subject became Exhibit A in the case made by critics that she lets political currents, instead of personal conviction, guide her. A hacked email from Clinton adviser Joel Benenson may have inadvertently lent weight to that suspicion. ""Do we have any sense from her what she believes or wants her core message to be?"" he asked. ""Sanders has simplicity and focus."" ___ --""I don't add a penny to the national debt."" THE FACTS: Not true, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. It estimates her increased spending in areas such as infrastructure, more financial aid for college and early childhood education would increase the national debt by $200 billion over 10 years. That is far less than their estimate for Trump, who they predict would add $5.3 trillion over 10 years. But it's plenty more than a penny. ___ ONE FOR THE ROAD TRUMP to Clinton: ""You've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life."" THE FACTS: The Islamic State group did not exist for almost all of Clinton's adult life. She's 69. IS is 4. ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Christopher S.
