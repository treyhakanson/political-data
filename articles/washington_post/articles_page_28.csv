But his election could scramble Britain’s post-E.U. plans.	"  LONDON -- The man who will soon occupy the Oval Office calls himself Mr. Brexit.  He was perhaps the biggest foreign cheerleader for Britain's departure from the European Union before the country voted, and he celebrated on Scottish soil when it opted to get out.  He says he wants to do a trade deal with Britain, and he invited a British politician to be his first international visitor upon winning the White House.  In many ways, Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election would seem to be a boon for Britain as it prepares to file its divorce papers with the E.U.  Boris Johnson, Britain's voluble foreign secretary, said as much, calling it ""a moment of opportunity.""  But rather than grease Britain's exit path, Trump's elevation to the peak of U.S. power could make this country's already tortuous road to Brexit even rougher. Reactions such as Johnson's, said Queen Mary University of London politics professor Tim Bale, are merely ""a front"" that masks a deep anxiety among British officials over whether Trump can be trusted.  ""I think there's an awful lot of nervousness in government and more generally, mostly down to the unpredictability of the guy,"" Bale said.  That worry is being felt worldwide. But in London, it is especially acute.   [Trump promised Brexit 'times five.' He delivered.]  Since World War II, Britain has positioned itself as the bridge linking the United States to Europe, with sturdy ties on either side. But now both ends of that connection are looking creaky.  Britain's June 23 decision to exit the E.U. has set the stage for years of complex -- and potentially acrimonious -- breakup negotiations in which most of the leverage lies with Europe. The continent's leaders have taken a hard line in the months since the vote, insisting that Britain will not get the sweetheart deal it has sought. Brexit advocates have played down any concerns over strained relations with Europe, insisting that Britain outside the E.U. has the chance to reassert itself in the wider world -- particularly in the Anglosphere with countries such as Canada, Australia and, most important, the United States. President Obama delivered a blow to that theory in the spring when he urged Britons to vote against an exit and said the country would need to go ""to the back of the queue"" in negotiating a free-trade deal with the United States. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton took a similar tack. Trump has adopted a very different approach, insisting that Britain will be prioritized. Johnson noted Monday that Trump is ""a dealmaker, and I think that could be a good thing for Britain."" But Britain may not like the deal that Trump has to offer.  The billionaire real estate developer railed against trade deals during the presidential campaign, insisting that the exchanges are zero-sum and always favor the other side at the expense of the United States. ""We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs,"" he said repeatedly.  [It's going to be Trump's world, and not everybody likes it]  Trump has pledged to reverse that dynamic as president and to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Britain now has a trade surplus with the United States, making it vulnerable to protectionist efforts by Trump to limit British imports at precisely the moment when Britain needs to start selling more to the world beyond Europe. Eric Kaufman, professor of politics at Birkbeck College, said there is likely to be ""an affinity"" between Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May because both leaders' countries have experienced populist revolts against the global order. But while May on Monday said she wants Britain to be ""the true global champion of free trade in this new modern world,"" Trump's threats to tear up existing trade agreements probably would complicate that task. ""The worry would be if the rules-based international trading order is weakened by Trump, that's not great for Britain trying to champion a free trading order outside of the E.U.,"" Kaufman said. There is also the question of timing: Even if Trump wants to do a quick trade deal with Britain, the latter is not well-positioned because the negotiations to come with the E.U. are already more than it can bear.  A recent memo by a government contractor assessing Britain's progress in developing its Brexit strategy concluded that the government still lacks an overall plan five months after the vote and that it may need another six months to devise one. The memo, dated Nov. 7 and leaked to the Times of London, also said the government may need another 30,000 civil servants to make Brexit a reality.  Indeed, Britain's response to Trump -- which has been notably warmer than that of other European powers -- may be less about any realistic hopes of a deal and more about attempting to gain leverage with Europe.  The response, Bale said, is ""consistent with a game we have played for decades where the U.K. suggests to the Europeans we have a unique insight into the American mind, and we suggest to the Americans we are a useful bridge to Europe.""  [Is Trump reaching out to Europe's far right before he talks with the heads of state?]  In at least one sense, that may continue to be true in the Trump era. Trump, whose mother was Scottish and who owns Scottish golf courses, appears to have a genuine affection for Britain.   ""The traditional white Anglo world,"" said London School of Economics professor Tony Travers, is one that Trump and his backers ""see as broadly their kind of world.""  And at least with certain British politicians, the affinity is apparent. Longtime Brexit champion Nigel Farage campaigned for Trump in the United States and was the first foreign politician invited to meet with the president-elect at Trump Tower. When the two emerged after an hour-long meeting, both were grinning broadly.  Britain's actual leader, May, has not received as favorable a reception. She was the 10th foreign leader Trump spoke with after the U.S. vote. According to a Times of London account of their 10-minute call, he was not exactly insistent in his invitation for her to follow Farage up the elevator to his Trump Tower suite.  ""If you travel to the U.S.,"" he reportedly said, ""you should let me know.""

The Facebook founder took on the role of an evangelist for ""connectivity"" as he spoke at an Asian-Pacific trade summit, lamenting that half the world has no access to the online world and is being deprived of its economic potential as well as advances in science, education and medicine. He urged leaders to work with his company and others to close that gap.  ""If we can connect the 4 billion people who aren't connected we can lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty,"" Zuckerberg said as he addressed business and government leaders at the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. But as he was promoting the benefits of the online world in the speech, he took to his Facebook page to address one of the downsides of the internet: the rapid dissemination of bogus news stories on social networks. Zuckerberg said in a post late Friday that his company was taking measures to curb what he said was a ""relatively small"" percentage of deliberately false stories. The measures include developing new tools to detect and classify ""misinformation"" and to make it easier for users to report the material. He said the company also is looking into the possibility of working with established fact-checking organizations to evaluate content and into the feasibility of warning labels for stories flagged as false. Critics have complained that a surge of fake news stories on Facebook may have swayed some voters to back President-elect Donald Trump. The company said on Monday that it was clarifying its advertising policy to emphasize that it won't display ads -- thus cutting revenue -- for sites that run information that is ""illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news."" That followed a similar step by Google, which acknowledged that it had let a false article about the election results slip into its list of recommended news stories.  ""The bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously,"" the Facebook CEO said in his post. ""Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information. Zuckerberg's comments came after President Barack Obama, who is also attending the APEC summit, and others have been sharply critical of the spread of fake news online. In a news conference Thursday in Berlin, Obama called bogus stories disseminated on Facebook and other social media platforms a threat to democracy. The president decried ""an age where there's so much active misinformation and it's packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television."" Zuckerberg called the problem ""complex, both technically and philosophically."" It is also sensitive issue for a company that does not want to censor content such as legitimate political satire that some people find offensive. Facebook sees itself not as a traditional publisher, but as a facilitator of global communication. It was that lofty vision of the company that was on display as Zuckerberg spoke at the APEC forum. He described Facebook efforts in artificial intelligence programs that could lead to advancements in medicine and education, as well as a high-altitude solar-powered drone, still in the development stage, to provide online access to places with none. He also described a program to work with local operators around the world to provide free basic internet.  ""We can't afford to leave anyone behind,"" he said. The Facebook CEO said that investment in such infrastructure is necessary to address the gap between rich and poor that has become a source of rising anxiety. ""As we are learning this year in election after election, even if globalization might grow the overall pie of prosperity, it also creates inequality,"" he said. ""It helps some people and it hurts others."" Investing in ""connectivity,"" he said, can address some of the consequences of globalization. ""We can disconnect, risk less prosperity and hope jobs that are lost come back. Or we can connect more, try to do more great things, try to work on even greater prosperity and then work to aggressively share that prosperity with everyone."" ___ Associated Press writer Martin Crutsinger contributed from Washington Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Organized by the teachers' union, the noisy protest in downtown Warsaw was another public show of discontent with the policies of Poland's year-old Law and Justice government. The organizers said about 50,000 people participated, while police estimated the crowd at 15,000. Over the past year, Warsaw has seen repeated massive protests against various steps taken by the government, especially those which critics say undermine the rule of law. The Education Ministry wants to do away with the country's three-year middle schools starting next year. The ministry says the middle schools do a poor job of educating students. It wants to go back to a system used under communism of eight-year primary schools followed by a four-year secondary school. That system was changed in 1999, when middle schools were introduced, also amid great objections that it would complicate the education process. The protesters, joined by some local governors from across Poland, said they fear the loss of thousands of jobs, and argued that the new curriculum would have to be written in haste and would be poor quality. Some teachers say the reform is intended to add nationalist values to the curriculum in addition to facts from the past that are key for Law and Justice policy.  ""School in Poland doesn't need destruction. It needs some wise changes,"" teacher Artur Sierawski said. ""So we are saying 'no' to the elimination of the middle schools and to the prospect of mammoth schools."" The marchers said that middle schools have helped bring Poland's education up to European standards, while a reform of the system would be costly, taking tens of millions of zlotys from the strapped education budget.  ""This reform is done in haste. It will bring nothing but chaos for our children,"" said Ewa Gniatkowska, a mother of a 10-year-old from Warsaw. The protesters heaped pieces of chalk in front of the Parliament, to protest the draft law of the school reform and left a petition at President Andrzej Duda's office asking him to stop the reform.

Du Bois to be saved	 GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. -- A Massachusetts church where civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois once attended services will be bought and preserved. A member of Clinton Church Restoration tells The Berkshire Eagle (http://bit.ly/2f7UGJK ) that it has agreed to buy the Clinton African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Great Barrington from the Northeast Regional Conference of the AME Zion Church. The deal is expected to close in March. Clinton Church Restoration is a volunteer organization formed just three weeks ago. It is still seeking nonprofit status. The deteriorating church dates to 1857 but has been closed for several years since the congregation dwindled. Some residents were concerned it would be sold and torn down, erasing an important piece of local history. Du Bois was the founder of the NAACP.

Thursday's 132-17 vote in the lower house follows passage in the Senate last year. It set off celebrations by animal activists gathered outside Congress. The measure includes jail terms of up to four years and fines of about $5,000 for anyone who organizes, participates in or promotes dog races. President Mauricio Macri has backed the measure and is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming days. Greyhound racing is popular in some regions of Argentina. Numerous jurisdictions across the United States and the world have banned greyhound racing. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In a video reaction posted online in Dutch and English, Wilders called the sentence demand ""utter madness. Only meant to shut you and me up."" The politically charged trial centers on comments that Wilders made before and after the Dutch municipal elections in 2014. At one meeting in a Hague cafe, he asked supporters whether they wanted more or fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands. That sparked a chant of ""Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!"" -- to which he replied ""we'll take care of it."" Prosecutor Wouter Bos said the court should ""send a clear signal that statements like these do not belong in the Netherlands."" Bos told the three-judge panel that Wilders' comments portrayed Moroccans as ""of less value and put them outside society. In fact, Wilders is saying that Moroccans don't deserve to stay here."" The prosecutor cited one of the many Moroccans who filed criminal complaints against Wilders.  ""You only want less of something that is bad and not good,"" Bos said, citing the complaint. ""Wilders gives me the feeling that I am worthless."" Wilders has branded the case a political trial and is refusing to attend. Members of Wilders' Freedom Party unfurled a banner in the lower house of the Dutch parliament emblazoned with a large photograph of Wilders with a red X stamped over his mouth. Prosecutors earlier said the maximum possible sentence was a two-year prison sentence. The verdict and sentencing are scheduled for Dec. 9. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Dr. Ahmad Tarakji is president of the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS). Laila Soudi works with SAMS and the psychiatry department at the Stanford University School of Medicine.  Today, more than 250,000 Syrians remain trapped in besieged eastern Aleppo with limited access to food, clean water and medical supplies. Living under constant aerial bombardment, residents in the eastern part of the city have nowhere to go. Eastern Aleppo is expected to run out of food and medical supplies in 20 days or less, after which we risk losing more than a quarter-million people to mass starvation and restricted access to lifesaving medical care. Of the quarter of a million people stuck in Aleppo, 100,000 are children. These children cannot eat or sleep without incapacitating fear. Every day, they experience unparalleled levels of trauma and anxiety, making them an especially vulnerable group with only 29 doctors remaining to care for them and their families. Our doctors are faced with the unimaginable task of having to decide which child to save and which to let die due to the severe shortage of medical supplies and staff. Furthermore, we do not have the infrastructure in place to provide those who survive with mental-health services to alleviate their severe trauma symptoms. Instead, we let them leave our hospitals in anguish and despair, knowing we helped rescue them from underneath the rubble and provided medical care for them in our hospitals but also knowing we cannot alleviate their fear. We are all afraid. We work knowing that the next child we help may be our own. Our children in Syria deserve a better future. They deserve dignified medical and mental-health care. They deserve to go to school and play with their friends without fear. We have to work together immediately to help the people of Aleppo. This is not a divisive political appeal to a single party; the White Helmets affirms its stance to help everyone regardless of their ethnicity, religion or political affiliation inside Syria. The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) affirms the same stance to help internally displaced Syrians as well as refugees in neighboring countries and beyond receive the medical care they deserve. This appeal we are making is a human one. We are calling on the international community to stand with us now and in solidarity with the people of Aleppo. We must all come together and place pressure on our governments to lift the siege on besieged areas especially in rural Damascus, Homs and, in line with the U.N. Security Council resolution, all other regions across Syria and allow for food and medical supplies to enter immediately. We are asking you to mobilize, place pressure on your governments and demand that the people of Syria be granted the supplies they urgently need. Call your political representatives immediately. Organize on the streets. Demand that action be taken. We have less than 20 days, and the time to act is now. Help us help them.

The Republican Governors Association held its annual conference at a resort near Disney World this week where several governors talked eagerly about how the election of Donald Trump could herald sweeping changes on everything from health care to education. But many of them said those changes need to come soon before the nation and Republican leaders get caught up in the 2018 election cycle.  ""We cannot squander this opportunity,"" said Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. Republicans now control the White House and Congress. And Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pointed that this was the first time there has been this many GOP governors across the country since the 1920s. Many of them were excited Tuesday about what could come next.  ""The sky's the limit,"" Walker said. ""There's no end to the good we can do."" Walker and other governors ticked off a long list of areas they would like to gain more control over whether it was education, transportation, workplace rules, health care or environmental policies. But they said some of these policies need to be tackled within Trump's first 100 days. Florida Gov. Rick Scott contended that Democrats and their allies would do what they could to stop Republicans.  ""The empire will strike back,"" said Scott, referencing the title of one of the ""Star Wars"" movies. ""You can be sure they are right now planning to stop us from making real changes."" Most of the GOP governors mentioned health care when discussing their top priorities. But it became evident they are not in complete agreement on how to unwind President Barack Obama's health care overhaul that included an expansion of Medicaid, the nation's main safety net health care program for the poor. An estimated 20 million Americans are now receiving coverage through different elements of the overhaul including Medicaid or through health care exchanges that offer insurance policies. Scott called the overhaul a ""disaster"" and said Republicans need to repeal it entirely. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, however, said she expected people to continue to enroll for insurance using health care exchanges as long as it's the law and that they can't just take away insurance from people who have it now.  ""I don't know that there will ever be a turn off the switch, wait a period of time and then turn it back on,"" said Martinez. ""There is going to have to be a transition and not leave everyone uninsured."" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who noted that Medicaid was expanded in his state prior to his election, called for a ""thoughtful approach"" to revamping health care and said he wants the ability to put in additional requirements for Medicaid recipients such as work requirements. Hutchinson has tried to win federal approval for some of his ideas but said he had been ""stymied"" by the Obama administration.  ""We have the opportunity to do things we cannot do now,"" Hutchinson said. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley called it a ""new day"" for statehouses across the country, but she added her own admonition.  ""We can't celebrate too long, we've got to get to work,"" Haley said. ""And that means 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 120 days, all of us have to get to work."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2016/11/14/flournoy-to-trump-let-women-serve-in-combat-roles/	Flournoy to Trump: Let women serve in combat roles	"   President-elect Donald Trump. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)  During the presidential campaign, President-elect Donald Trump called the Obama administration's move to open combat fighting roles to women in the military ""politically correct"" and said he might reverse the policy. On Monday, the woman who might have been Hillary Clinton's defense secretary called on him to preserve options for women who serve in uniform. ""If we reverse direction, it will very likely have very profound impacts -- certainly for morale, certainly for retention of women who are looking for opportunities ... and it will probably also impact recruiting,"" Michele Flournoy, who served as undersecretary of defense for policy during President Obama's first term, said Monday at an event at the Aspen Institute. Trump has said he would follow the recommendations of military leaders on a range of military personnel policies. But it's not clear what this will mean for last December's decision to open up all combat roles to women who meet fixed standards and last July's move to allow transgender soldiers to serve openly and receive related medical coverage. ""We have a politically correct military, and it's getting more and more politically correct every day,"" Trump said at a campaign event in October. ""Some of the things that they're asking you to do and be politically correct about are ridiculous."" In September, Trump defended a 2013 tweet in which he seemed to blame gender integration in the military for a rise in sexual assaults. ""26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military -- only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?"" Trump tweeted. Flournoy, who was widely expected to be named as the first female defense secretary if Clinton had won, said the Trump team should look at all of the research, develop a deeper understanding of the issue and then make decisions based on what the actual implications would be of rolling back military personnel reforms, rather than treating it as a political issue. ""I would hope the new administration would take a fact-based, data-informed approach to this issue, understand it for all of its potential implications and ultimately choose to stay on the trajectory that's been set by a couple of administrations now,"" she said. Setting standards and then allowing members of the military to try to meet those standards regardless of gender or gender identity is the right approach socially and militarily, she argued. ""Ultimately, having a military that is a truly a meritocracy, that has the diversity that looks like America, that leverages all our strengths across the full range of human capital and people who are willing to serve, that's in our interest as a nation,"" she said. If Trump does decide the new policy based on the views of the uniformed military leadership, the current reforms could very well be reversed. According to reports, the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, opposed the decision to allow women to serve in combat roles and tried to exempt his service, the Marine Corps, from the policy. The GOP platform explicitly calls for keeping women out of combat units and infantry battalions and proposes a review of the Obama administration's ""ideology based personnel policies."" ""We reject the use of the military as a platform for social experimentation and will not accept or continue attempts to undermine military priorities and mission readiness,"" the platform states. ""Military readiness should not be sacrificed on the altar of political correctness."" The incoming Trump administration is pledging to strengthen and expand the size of the U.S. military, but it risks weakening that very effort by pushing away women who want to fight."

They argue Hillary Clinton's defeat was because of her coziness with big money donors, and that Schumer is from the same mold. They urged Democrats to do everything they can to block Trump's agenda. Schumer has lain low since Election Day, pondering the path forward for his party. He has indicated a willingness to work with Trump. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
