Jeff Sessions for attorney general. Comments attributed to Trump's picks, also including alt-right architect Stephen Bannon as senior adviser and chief strategist and former Army Lt. Michael Flynn as national security adviser, serve to embolden everyday Americans to lash out at members of minority groups, they said. Sessions, of Alabama, was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 after hearings in which he was accused of making racially charged remarks as a U.S. attorney. According to transcripts, Sessions was accused, among other things, of joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan ""was OK"" until he learned they smoked marijuana, and of calling a black assistant U.S. attorney ""boy."" During the hearing, Sessions denied making some of the comments and said others were jokes taken out of context.  ""Every American should be concerned about the direction of the U.S. Department of Justice and oppose any nominee who threatens to turn back the clock on civil rights by 50 years,"" said National Urban League President Marc Morial. Bannon led the Breitbart website, which has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. In a 2011 radio interview, Bannon said conservative women infuriated liberals because they ""would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children,"" contrasting that against a slur for lesbians. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has called the accusations against Bannon ""very unfair."" Lennie Gerber, an 80-year-old resident of High Point, North Carolina, who led the fight against her state's ban on same-sex marriage, said she worried Trump's appointments will further incite such sentiments among the public.  ""Saying that kind of thing incites the racism and the anti-gay feelings in everybody else and says you're free to express these things,"" Gerber said. ""These people who've been suppressed by the positive transformation that has gone on over the last few years are now feeling free to express themselves."" Civil rights leaders are calling on Trump to rescind Sessions' nomination or for the Senate to reject him. Sessions requires Senate confirmation as attorney general, as does U.S. Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas for CIA director, but Bannon and Flynn do not. In August, Flynn spoke at an event in Dallas for the anti-Islamist group Act for America, calling Islam, a religion with 1.6 billion adherents, ""a political ideology"" and ""a cancer.""  ""Unfortunately, these very important picks in his administration send a troubling message indicating that the bigotry we saw expressed in the campaign will continue,"" said Ibrahim Hooper, spokesperson for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Aside from comments and actions attributed to the nominees, their lack of diversity worries civil rights leaders. Trump has said he planned to reward loyalty, and demonstrated such with his nomination of Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse him. Washington attorney A. Scott Bolden said Trump is ""0 for 4"" on diversity. All of his picks so far are white men.  ""The scariest part of his potential administration will be how his political debts to the alt-right will manifest itself in his administration and policies,"" Bolden said. ""Jeff Sessions is one of those manifestations ... to be in control not only of justice in America, but really to bring injustice to America."" Daniela Lapidous, a 22-year-old Jewish woman who works to fight climate change, called Bannon a ""misogynist and anti-Semite and an anti-climate extremist."" She said she never before felt the need to fight anti-Semitism, but now thinks that she must.  ""I've been somewhat convinced that anti-Semitism isn't a thing in the United States anymore, but this past year, with Trump and Bannon, it's made me scared about that for the first time in my life,"" said Lapidous, who lives in San Francisco. The Rev. Jeffrey Brown, associate pastor of the Twelfth Baptist Church in Boston, said he is not happy with Trump's choices so far, particularly Sessions.  ""I hear people complaining that we should give the Trump administration a chance,"" Brown said. ""It's very clear by his appointments that he's not going to give a lot of communities in the United States that same chance."" Elaine Walton, an African-American resident of New Orleans, said she had deep concerns. Her most visceral reaction to Trump's picks? ""Fear. How is he going to be the top watchdog for the country when he's so biased?""  ""I think those people cannot lead him, advise him on how to lead this country forward,"" she said. ""They are going to advise him on how to lead the country backwards."" ___ Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin in Richmond, Virginia; Rebecca Santana in New Orleans; Rachel Zoll in New York; and Denise Lavoie in Boston.

LOUIS -- Missouri's highest court says it won't intervene in a lawsuit by activists seeking an independent probe of a prosecutor's handling of grand jury proceedings in the Ferguson police shooting of Michael Brown. The Missouri Supreme Court announced in an order obtained by media outlets Friday that it won't hear the matter. Activists were challenging a state appellate court's May conclusion that a St. Louis County judge correctly dismissed the suit, which sought a special prosecutor to scrutinize prosecutor Robert McCulloch's conduct during the secret grand jury proceedings. The activists questioned McCulloch's role. The grand jury cleared white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the fatal 2014 shooting of 18-year-old Brown, who was black and unarmed. Wilson later resigned. A U.S. Justice Department probe concluded Wilson acted in self-defense. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A five-year offshore drilling plan announced on Friday blocks the planned sale of new oil and gas drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas north of Alaska. The plan allows drilling to go forward in Alaska's Cook Inlet southwest of Anchorage. The blueprint for drilling from 2017 to 2022 can be rewritten by President-elect Donald Trump, in a process that could take months or years. Besides Cook Inlet, the plan also allows drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, long the center of U.S. offshore oil production. Ten of the 11 lease sales proposed in the five-year plan are in the Gulf, mostly off the coasts of Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Alabama. Confirming a decision announced this spring, the five-year plan also bars drilling in the Atlantic Ocean.  ""The plan focuses lease sales in the best places - those with the highest resource potential, lowest conflict and established infrastructure - and removes regions that are simply not right to lease,"" said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell.  ""Given the unique and challenging Arctic environment and industry's declining interest in the area, forgoing lease sales in the Arctic is the right path forward,"" Jewell said. The decision follows an announcement last year by Royal Dutch Shell PLC that it would cease exploration in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas after spending nearly $7 billion. The company cited disappointing results from a well drilled in the Chukchi and the unpredictable federal regulatory environment. Despite that, industry representatives reacted bitterly to the latest announcement, calling the decision blatantly political.  ""The arrogance of the decision is unfathomable, but unfortunately not surprising,"" said Randall Luthi, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, an industry group.  ""Once again, we see the attitude that Washington knows best -- an attitude that contributed to last week's election results,"" Luthi said, referring to Trump's victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. More than 70 percent of Alaskans, including a majority of Alaska Natives, support offshore drilling, Luthi said. The state's three Republican members of Congress also blasted the decision. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she was ""infuriated"" that Obama ""has once again ignored our voices to side with the factions who oppose"" offshore drilling in Alaska.  ""Arctic development is one of the best ways to create jobs, generate revenues and refill the Trans-Alaska Pipeline,"" said Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. ""Why the president is willing to send all of those benefits overseas is beyond explanation."" As he prepares to leave office in two months, Obama has worked to build an environmental legacy that includes a global agreement to curb climate change and an ambitious plan to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. He also has imposed stricter limits on smog-causing pollution linked to asthma and rejected the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. All of those accomplishments and others are at risk from Trump's presidency. Trump loathes regulation and wants to increase oil and gas drilling and the use of coal. Trump has said he believes climate change is a hoax and has vowed to ""cancel"" U.S. involvement in the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming. While he has been vague about precise policies, Trump is likely to seek to weaken or kill the Clean Power Plan, a cornerstone Obama policy meant to reduce carbon pollution from the nation's power plants as part of an effort to combat climate change. The decision to block Arctic drilling follows a decision this spring to block drilling in the Atlantic. Republican governors in North and South Carolina back drilling off their states' coasts, as does the Democratic governor of Virginia. Jacqueline Savitz, senior vice president of Oceana, an environmental group, hailed the Arctic announcement and praised Obama and Jewell for ""protecting our coasts from dirty and dangerous offshore drilling."" Rejection of drilling in the Artic and Atlantic ""demonstrates a commitment to prioritizing common sense, economics and science ahead of industry favoritism and politics as usual,"" Savitz said. Nearly 400 scientists signed a letter this summer urging Obama to eliminate the possibility of Arctic offshore drilling. ___ Follow Matthew Daly: https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The settlement eliminates the possibility that Trump will be called to testify in court in the midst of his presidential transition. It ends three separate lawsuits that made claims against Trump University, including a California class action case that was scheduled to go to trial later this month, as well as a second suit in that state and an action filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. In a statement, Trump Organization General Counsel Alan Garten said he thought Trump would have prevailed at trial but settled so Trump could ""devote his full attention to the important issues facing our great nation"" during his presidential transition. Schneiderman, a Democrat who had faced harsh attacks from Trump since filing the 2013 suit, said in a statement that his office had sued Trump for ""swindling thousands of innocent Americans out of millions of dollars"" and that the settlement had come despite significant resistance from Trump for years. ""Today, that all changes,"" Schneiderman said. ""Today's $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university."" Schneiderman said the settlement includes a $1 million penalty paid to New York state for violating the state's education laws by calling the program a ""university"" despite offering no degrees or traditional education. Trump did not, however, admit fault regarding the claims that customers were cheated. A lawyer representing former customers in the two California cases also confirmed the settlement at a hearing in San Diego.  [Donald Trump said his 'university' was about education. Actually, it was about 'sell, sell, sell!']  The Trump University settlement appears to fit a pattern in which lawyers for the president-elect are working to reduce the number of his legal entanglements before he takes office. On Wednesday, Trump's attorneys dropped an unrelated lawsuit he was pursuing in Florida against Palm Beach County, in which he had complained about commercial air traffic over his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump has fought the county for years over flight patterns from the county airport, which he has complained causes too much noise at his club. New airspace restrictions likely to be imposed with Trump's election could mean that Trump will win the long fight without legal action. Negotiations over the Trump University deal were handled in part by lawyers for Schneiderman, who had filed suit against Trump University in 2013. Schneiderman has called the real estate program ""a fraud from beginning to end.""         1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Nov. 18, 2016 A motorcade vehicle transporting President-elect Donald Trump arrives at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        The fates of the New York case and the two California suits were closely linked because they were all brought on behalf of an overlapping pool of former Trump University customers, said a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ongoing negotiations. Lawyers for customers who sued in California said the settlement must still be approved by the court, but that some customers would see full refunds of the money they spent on Trump University, potentially as much as $35,000 in some cases. An administrator is expected to be appointed to disburse the funds, but attorney Jason Forge said many could see refunds in three to four months. Forge called the settlement an ""unprecedented recovery"" for such a case. Charles Spada, an attorney for former Trump University president Michael Sexton, said in a statement that the one-time Trump business partner remained ""proud of the work done at Trump U."" and is ""grateful for the unwavering support he received"" from Trump. Trump is known for aggressively pursuing his business interests in court. Still, he has settled lawsuits many times, despite arguing that doing so only invites further litigation. ""I don't settle cases. You know what happens? When you start settling lawsuits, everybody sues you,"" he said on MSNBC in March, responding to a question about Trump University. ""I don't get sued, because I don't settle cases. I win in court."" The Trump University case emerged as a political issue during the presidential campaign. And even as he rose in the polls, won primaries and emerged as the Republican nominee, Trump at times seemed deeply engrossed in the litigation and repeatedly defended the business from the stump. At a rally in San Diego in May, Trump dissected the matter at length, insisting that most customers who had spent money on the real estate program had been pleased. He attacked particular plaintiffs by name, including one who later dropped out of the case, citing the publicity. Trump's San Diego statements included an attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was overseeing the California cases, and a promise: ""If we have a trial, we'll go all the way,"" he said then. ""Watch how we win it."" In subsequent interviews in June, Trump continued to press complaints against Curiel, alleging that the Indiana-born judge was biased because of his Mexican heritage. Those comments sparked an uproar that swallowed days of Trump's campaign and subsided only when his campaign released a lengthy statement in June claiming his comments had been ""misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage."" The cases against Trump University were based on complaints from customers who described their experiences in programs that could cost more than $30,000. The former customers said they were taken in by false promises including advertisements in which Trump promised seminar attendees would learn his personal tricks for succeeding in real estate from instructors he had personally hand-picked. In depositions, Trump has acknowledged he did not pick seminar leaders. Trump argued in a written statement that, ""with all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case!"" Curiel had strongly urged a settlement in the cases pending in his courtroom, where Trump's lawyers had recently asked for a delay, citing the burdens of the presidential transition. They suggested the trial, which was scheduled to open Nov. 28, would be easier in February or March, after Trump takes office.  Roxana Popescu in San Diego contributed to this report. "

President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski told delegates gathering in Lima for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum that global trade already stopped growing in the last two years and would get much worse if nations close off their economies.  ""It is fundamental that world trade grow again and that protectionism be defeated,"" Kuczynski said. The Peruvian leader cited the U.S. election, though he did not specifically mention President-elect Donald Trump, who pledged to overhaul U.S. trade policy and tear up trade agreements such as NAFTA or the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. Kuczynski, a U.S.-trained economist and former investment fund manager who took office this year, also cited the vote in June by Britain to leave the European Union as evidence that ""protectionist tendencies are taking over"" in the world.  ""And for anyone who wants to promote protection I suggest they read an economic history of the 1930s,"" he said, a reference to the Great Depression that many argue was aggravated by protectionist policies. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also touched on the U.S. and British elections as she called for action to address rising economic inequality that has accompanied increased global trade.  ""The social and political consequences are now becoming all too apparent,"" she told an audience at the Universidad del Pacifico after an appearance at APEC. ""Voters in the United States and the United Kingdom, for example, have sent clear signals of concern about migration, trade and technological change."" APEC has brought more than 1,000 delegates from 21 countries, representing nearly 40 percent of the world's population, to Lima for a forum aimed at easing global commerce. U.S. President Barack Obama was expected to arrive late Friday for his last international summit before leaving office in January. Also expected were Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Obama had been expected to promote the TPP, which would have included 12 members of APEC but not China. That trade pact is now considered politically dead because of Trump's victory. The Chinese president is expected to seek support for an alternate agreement backed by his country that would include all 21 countries in the organization. APEC ministers, meeting ahead of the leaders' summit, endorsed a study of the Chinese-backed plan and called for further talks in a joint statement issued Friday that also echoed concerns about protectionism. ""Faced with rising skepticism over trade and stagnated trade growth, we reiterate our commitment to build an open economy in the Asia-Pacific,"" it said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Trump's ethics plan would ban all executive-branch officials from lobbying for five years after leaving their government jobs -- one of several policies aimed at curbing the influence of lobbyists. His campaign released his plan about three weeks before Election Day, and ""drain the swamp"" quickly became a favorite rallying cry and social media hashtag. Lobbyists, many of whom are massed along the K Street corridor downtown just blocks from the White House, see the plan as misguided and argue that it could backfire on him. The incoming Republican president is racing to hire some 4,000 executive-branch employees, and his ethics plan could cause some job-seekers to look elsewhere because it limits how they can earn a living when they decide to leave the administration.  ""This will have a chilling effect on his hiring, no doubt,"" said Paul Miller, who leads the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics. ""Most people who agree to government service want to go back into the private sector. We don't want career politicians, and that's what he could end up with."" But to those who have long advocated for breaking the ""Potomac fever"" that befalls those who come to Washington and never leave, Trump's ban is worth the risk of losing some potential administration employees.  ""Too many people go into government service as a way to punch their ticket and come out and make millions of dollars. That's both a concern and a reality,"" said Meredith McGehee, an executive at the government reform group Issue One. Trump's plan makes bold assertions, some more doable than others. He can enforce his executive-branch lobbying ban with the stroke of his pen, but measures involving Congress are trickier. Trump says he will ask Congress to institute a five-year lobbying ban for departing members and staff. That would take the approval of legislators who might be squeamish about tamping down their own future employment options. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell didn't directly answer when asked about Trump's proposed lobbying ban for those leaving the Hill. He said he wants legislators to ""address the real concerns of the American people"" rather than fixate on every utterance during the presidential contest. Trump also wants to ""expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisers when we all know they are lobbyists."" That's reasonable, McGehee said, but difficult. Increasingly, those employed by the influence industry call themselves ""consultants"" or ""strategists."" In fact, the number of registered lobbyists in Washington has dropped to fewer than 10,000 from 15,000 a decade ago, likely due to this rebranding effort. Miller and other lobbying advocates also agree registration should be more expansive. Yet 2011 legislation to do just that hasn't moved forward. That could be a heavy lift for Trump. If it's too onerous, he could pare back his goals and include a more expansive lobbying definition that would only apply to the administration. It's also unclear how many of the 4,000 or so people Trump is about to hire would be subject to his ban. His proposal says ""all executive-branch officials,"" but in practice he may be referring only to Cabinet members and high-level White House officials. Trump's transition team did not respond to questions about his ethics plan. Washington insiders are getting mixed signals from Trump. His original transition team was packed with lobbyists and interest advocates, and that group is charged with helping to find, vet and hire for the Trump administration. In recent days, Trump put Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge of transition, and he is changing some of the people who are involved. Pence is ""making good on President-elect Trump's promise that we're not going to have any lobbyists involved with the transition efforts,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Wednesday. ""And this is, when we talk about draining the swamp, this is one of the first steps. And so, the bottom line is, we're going to get the transition team where we need it to be."" In a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday, Trump said he'd had no choice but to initially rely on lobbyists in Washington because ""the whole place is one big lobbyist."" He vowed to ""phase that out."" His White House predecessors have made similar promises. On the campaign trail in 2007, Barack Obama frequently condemned the ""revolving door"" of Washington in terms strikingly similar to Trump. Obama made bold promises before his first election, yet government influencers remained entrenched. Still, he won re-election after a second campaign that included almost no talk about the revolving door.  ""Drain the swamp. Stop the revolving door. These are great things to say to get elected,"" said Howard Marlowe, president of Warwick Group Consultants, and a longtime advocate for fellow lobbyists. ""After you get elected, you find a way to quietly push it aside."" ___ Ken Thomas in New York and Erica Werner in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/Bykowicz Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

McDonnell, who recently emerged from a long legal saga a free but tarnished man, will join the faculty at the evangelical university founded by televangelist Pat Robertson. McDonnell (R) will serve as a distinguished professor at Regent University's Robertson School of Government starting in January, the Virginia Beach-based school announced Tuesday. He also will help establish the Governor's Center for Federalism and Civility, which is intended to help states understand their role in a federal society, Regent said. McDonnell, who was a prosecutor, state delegate and state attorney general before becoming governor, earned a law degree and a master's degree in public policy from Regent in 1989.  A master's thesis he wrote at Regent surfaced during his 2009 bid for governor, becoming a flash point in the race because it criticized working women and gay people as detrimental to society. McDonnell, who had tried to play down social issues during the race, tamped down the furor by saying his views had evolved, and he went on to a 17-point victory over Democrat R. Creigh Deeds.  [From the archives: Va. candidate McDonnell says views changed since he wrote thesis]  ""We are delighted to welcome Governor McDonnell back to Regent University,"" Robertson said in a written statement. ""As we train students to serve in government, law and other disciplines, McDonnell will bring his extensive public service experience as an Army officer, prosecutor, state legislator, attorney general and governor."" McDonnell was a popular governor and rising GOP star when a gifts scandal blew up in his final year in office. Shortly after leaving the Executive Mansion in January 2014, he and first lady Maureen McDonnell were charged with federal corruption for accepting more than $175,000 in luxury gifts, vacations and sweetheart loans from Richmond businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr., who'd sought their help promoting his nutritional supplement. Prosecutors contended that the McDonnells connected Williams with state officials, let him throw a luncheon at the governor's mansion to help launch the product and allowed him to shape the guest list at a mansion reception meant for health-care leaders. The McDonnells asserted that Williams got no special treatment, only the routine political courtesies extended to any political donor. The state never included the tablets on its employee health plan or conducted university clinical trials as Williams had sought. A federal jury in Richmond convicted the couple of corruption in September 2014, but attorneys for the former governor took the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and won. In June, the high court threw out his conviction, ruling that jurors had been wrongly instructed on the meaning of an ""official act"" -- the thing McDonnell was said to have performed for Williams -- and therefore deserved at least a retrial. The ruling set a higher bar for prosecuting public corruption, saying explicitly that setting up meetings or arranging events for benefactors did not, on its own, constitute the ""quo"" of a corrupt quid pro quo deal. In September, the Justice Department decided not to seek a retrial of McDonnell or his wife under that standard.  [Prosecutors will drop cases against former Va. governor Robert McDonnell, wife]  McDonnell referred to his legal ordeal in the statement released by Regent. ""During my painful journey through the justice system after I left the Governor's office, I came to the realization that politics and polls are much less important than people and policies,"" McDonnell said. ""I'm eager to engage with Regent students and faculty in and out of the classroom, and I hope that my experiences can inspire others to consider careers in public service."" "

In this worldview, racial and economic anxieties shape -- and are shaped by -- people's personal values, like their beliefs about who works hard, and who deserves what. As Cramer writes in her book: This is how the politics of resentment operates -- it works through seemingly simple divisions of us versus them, but it has power because in these divisions are a multitude of fundamental understandings: who has power, who has what values and which of those values are right, who gets what, and perceptions of the basic fairness of all of this. After the election, we returned to ask Cramer for her reaction. Wisconsin was supposed to be part of Hillary Clinton's ""blue wall"" -- but in the end the state went to Trump, largely thanks to the white working-class and rural voters that Cramer studies. Some of these Trump supporters may have even voted for President Obama in 2012.   [Yes, working class whites really did make Trump win. No, it wasn't simply economic anxiety.]   This time, we tried to further unpack how Trump's campaign invigorated racial resentments, and vice versa. Throughout this past year, there has been a drawn-out debate over the true nature of Trump's appeal -- do people like him because he stirs up racial resentments, or because he speaks to their economic struggles? These questions are even more important now, because the answers speak to the nature of Trump's mandate. Did Americans elect Donald Trump because he promised to deport millions of immigrants? Or did they tolerate his statements about Mexicans and women because they believed he would make life better for them economically? (The following has been condensed and edited for clarity. Sometimes, Cramer -- who herself is a native Wisconsinite -- slips into the voice of her subjects. We've tagged those statements in italics.) Were you surprised at the election results? I think I was surprised, but also not surprised. I guess my work allowed me to see that the people who support Trump are not all a bunch of crazy idiots. He hasn't hoodwinked a bunch of people. The people that I have spent time with see his flaws. They know he's got this crazy character, that he's very flamboyant and irrational. They supported him not because of his character, but because he represented substantial change. That's really interesting to me. The media has focused a lot of attention on the nastiness that erupts at Trump campaign events. From those incidents, it's easy to assume that all the people who voted for Trump were crazy racists. But you're describing a kind of racial indifference. Many Trump voters probably don't care about what Trump is threatening to do to immigrants or Muslims -- or at least, that's not their primary motivation for supporting him. They might even find his comments on minorities distasteful. But they think Trump is going to be good for their own communities, and that's all that matters to them. Right -- there's definitely this view that racial justice is not a concern. The term ""racial justice"" isn't even in their vocabulary. It's not their thing. It's not something they think the world should be worried about in this moment. Just this morning I was in Central Wisconsin, and there's this group that meets in the back of a warehouse. We talked for a long, long time. They're happy that Trump won. They have a lot of hope for the future, because they think that finally, we have someone who is not a politician. There is a chance he will run the country like a business, and he will stop spending money that we don't have. They don't have much to say about what a great person or great leader he is. They think that he's kind of arrogant. But his promise to shake things up, to overturn what we have been doing, to just do things completely differently in Washington, D.C. -- that was really appealing to them. Here's the thing that was really eye-opening to me this morning. Eventually, we got around to discussing specific policies. I asked, ""So what are you hoping he accomplishes in the next four years? In what ways do you think he's actually going to make your life better?"" And they kind of looked at me. And they said, Well, probably nothing. Presidents don't do anything for people like us. But at least he's going to balance the books and stop spending money that we don't have. They did believe that Trump was going to boost the economy. They thought there would be 4 percent growth in the economy under him, and there might be more jobs and things would perk up. But they also said, Well nobody even notices that this place exists, so it's probably not going to affect our lives that much. I think that's a good indicator of the perspective that folks are coming from. They are feeling so stuck. Even this person, whom they support because he represents overnight change to them -- they still don't have hopes that he will significantly improve the quality of their lives. [Why these rural, white, gun-owning guys didn't vote for Trump] The people that you study are from upstate Wisconsin, which is mostly white. So I wonder: To what extent do they have experience with diversity in their own communities?  Not much. There are Latino immigrants in Wisconsin, in the dairy farming industries, and in the cities, but not as much as in Iowa, for example. In rural Wisconsin in general, especially in the northern parts, if people have interaction with people of different ethnic backgrounds it's with Native Americans. The racism in northern Wisconsin is mostly about Native Americans. The community I visited this morning is tiny, about 300 residents. I don't think there are a lot of immigrants there. I could be wrong. But maybe the more important thing is that they perceive they have no interaction with immigrants. They certainly have little to no interaction with African Americans. I ask that question because I'm thinking within the framework of contact theory. There are people in the South who voted for Trump who live around black people and have experience with diversity. But in these rural northern communities, I think it's little different. I wonder if it's easier for people's attitudes to be affected by someone speaking loudly about race when their own concepts of race aren't rooted in their own lived experiences. This morning, the group I talked to asked me a lot of questions about the level of crime in Madison. It was part of a conversation about Black Lives Matter. Their perception is that things had gotten really out of hand, that it's very dangerous in Madison right now. One guy even said, I'm not going to Madison right now. I wouldn't come anywhere near there. To me that kind of fear sounds like fear that comes from sensationalized information, as opposed to personal experience. I told them, ""My impression is that if there's fear of crime right now, it's that African Americans are afraid of law enforcement folks. It's not an unsafe city."" In your book you talk a lot about how it's not all about racism, that the resentments of small-town America are broader, and have many different targets. But as your research has emphasized, a lot of political opinions are influenced by storytelling and framing. I wonder how the stories that Trump tells have affected people.  I do too. There's been so many reports across the country of people yelling ""Build the wall!"" at people who look Latino. It's happened in Wisconsin too. That's just such a vibrant indicator that there's a campaign effect. People didn't come up with that phrase themselves. They're saying it because Donald Trump said it. It's an unleashing. It's validating that certain people are a target of blame, that certain groups are the other, the them. The group that I talked to this morning, they've had a lot of things to say about Black Lives Matter -- about how distasteful it is, and how Obama really let things get out of hand. Now our race relations back to where they were in the 1960s. This is primarily coming from one guy in the group, but the other people weren't arguing with him. They're also talking about how illegal immigrants are taking our jobs. That subject came up this morning way more than it ever has in this group. I think that's a campaign-induced thing. Because seven or eight years ago, when I'd go around and ask about people's top concerns, immigration just never came up. Some people on Twitter have been asking: Why do we need to be the ones who now need to go out and understand the white working class, Trump voters, and rural people? Shouldn't those people also have a responsibility to understand city folk, immigrants and minorities? In the group that I visited this morning, they were asking me, What is going on with those students in Madison? How can they vote for Hillary Clinton? How can they not see what a liar she is? What a total say-whatever-will-get-her-ahead politician she is? In other words, they were saying to me basically what people in Madison say about residents of upstate Wisconsin. How can people be so stupid? In a democracy, we're making choices that govern each other. So yes, we all have an obligation to understand each other. Rural parts of the United States have to understand that the people in cities are humans too, that they are working hard to make ends meet, that they have families and struggles of their own. But I think the fact that most of our information is produced in the cities means that we have to put special effort to understand what is going on in rural places. I think the way this election caught many of us by surprise is a case in point. People have been talking about the power of media bubbles, of Fox News, and sites like Breitbart. In what ways are the rural folks you're studying getting their information and forming their opinions? Like, the stuff about Black Lives Matter that you mentioned -- those protests probably happen very far from the lives of people living in rural Wisconsin, yet it seems to loom large in their concept of present-day America. It depends on where I am in the state. Fox News is a factor, and so is conservative talk radio. I don't hear people talking much about internet-based information sources -- but part of that is that the download speeds are slow in parts of rural Wisconsin. More often than not, they talk about each other as their sources of information. Conservative media gets input into these groups, but it's not because everybody is watching Fox News or is devoted to this or that talk radio host. It's that one or two of the people in the group comes with something they've heard, and it gets passed around. Also, email chains seem to be a big deal. People are commonly telling me about something they read on their email. It sounds to me like stuff that somebody somewhere reads and it gets passed on and passed on. In our previous conversation, you mentioned many of your subjects liked Obama because they saw him as an agent of change. Looking at this past election, it was stunning to see how many counties flipped from Obama to Trump. It really does seem that some people voted for Obama and for Trump. I think they saw in both of them, maybe, a potential to shake things up in Washington.  That's absolutely spot-on. I remember going around to some groups [in rural Wisconsin] right after the Iowa caucuses in 2008, and asking people, ""Were you surprised at the outcome?"" And many groups would say, Actually, I can see a black president or a woman president. It's about time we had something different in there! I heard that in a lot of places. Not universally, but in a lot of places. They really did see the possibility that the first African American president could offer something different. It's not surprising to me that people would vote for both Obama and Trump -- they both promised some kind of change. It just goes to show, too, just why Hillary Clinton was so distasteful to so many people. They just see her as so political-class. In the aftermath of this election, I think it's become clear that this wasn't just about people being attracted to Trump, but people being repelled by Hillary Clinton. How did the people you talked to feel about her? There was a lot of focus on the liar thing, seeing her as very dishonest. In this group this morning, they talked a lot about the email stuff. They talked about how sketchy it was that there would be news that came out about all these emails on her private server, and then a few weeks later the news would just kind of evaporate. They saw that as something very fishy going on. There's definitely guilt by association with Bill Clinton. Especially his philandering, which rubbed off on her. The part of being the D.C. establishment. The Trump line -- she's been in there 30 years and we don't want more of the same. So it's mainly those three things. I see her as part of her establishment, she's dishonest, and she's married to Bill Clinton. All of those arguments were central to the way the Trump campaign attacked her. You've been talking to these same people for a very long time. Did Trump's attacks change their minds about her? I first met most of these groups back in 2008, back when she was running for president the first time. Even then, the attitude was, anything but Hillary Clinton. And I think over time they were given new reasons to dislike her. Certainly I'm overgeneralizing here, but in these groups of guys in these rural communities who were white and older, I can't remember coming across anybody who had anything positive to say about her. There's a great line from your book: ""Listening in on these conversations, it is hard to conclude that the people I studied believe what they do because they have been hoodwinked. Their views are rooted in identities and values, as well as in economic perceptions; and these things are all intertwined."" Is there a way to illustrate that concept to people who might not understand exactly how that works?  I think health care is a great example. Lefties in the cities will say to me, ""How can they not support Obamacare when they can't afford health insurance?"" So in the past year I've been more openly saying to folks in these rural groups, ""People are asking, 'How can you be voting against your own interests'?"" And this morning, one guy said back to me, ""You mean they're saying, 'How can people be so stupid?"" And I said, ""Well, yes, that's sometimes how it's put!"" We did talk about health care this morning, and one fellow was saying, ""Obamacare hasn't helped us. I'm on Medicare so it really hasn't affected me, but it's made the cost of things go up."" And another guy in the group said, ""Before Obamacare I couldn't afford health insurance, so if Trump gets rid of that, I don't know what I'm going to do. But the thing that really gets us is having to pay a fine unless we get health insurance."" So I said, ""Even though Obamacare is actually saving you money, you think it's bad because you're being told you must buy health insurance?"" He said, ""Yes."" To some people, that would be an example of ignorance. There's a clear cost-benefit calculation there. These people are better off under Obamacare. But no -- not if you open it up to identities and values. To a group of people who feel completely ignored and disrespected by their government, it makes sense for them to say I oppose a policy that tells me what I have to do with my money. It's just a different, very different way of seeing it. But it's not being hoodwinked. That's such a wonderful example. I think it really shows that people are pretty self-aware. They aren't ignorant of Obamacare's benefits. But they also recognize the costs. And to them, the costs -- to their freedom, for instance -- feel like they outweigh the benefits.  Exactly. Part of the cost is not just the money, right? It's the cost of having this additional burden put on them by this very distant force that, in their minds, has shown them no regard.          1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.
