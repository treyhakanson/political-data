The Labor Department said Wednesday that its producer price index was flat last month after rising 0.3 percent in September. Services prices fell 0.3 percent, pulled down by a record 5.7 percent drop in the price of brokerage and other financial services. The services drop was offset by a 0.4 percent increase in the prices of goods, including a 2.5 percent increase in wholesale energy prices. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, fell 0.2 percent in October. The producer price index measures cost pressures before they reach consumers. Inflation has stayed well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent annual target. Low oil prices -- currently well below $50 a barrel -- have helped keep inflation in check. Over the past year, producer prices have risen 0.8 percent, modest but still the highest annual gain December 2014. Core inflation was up 1.2 percent annually. The Fed has been dropping hints that it might resume raising U.S. interest rate at its next meeting Dec. 13-14. The Fed raised rates nearly a year ago for the first time since 2006 and was widely expected to follow up with several more hikes in 2016. But it held off as the U.S. economy stalled from late 2015 through mid-2016 and the global economy continued to look weak. At its last meeting in November, the Fed described a healthy job market, rising consumer spending and improved economic growth after a weak start to the year. All of that helps explain why it said the case for a rate hike has ""continued to strengthen."" Some economists thought before the election that a victory by Donald Trump might cause havoc in financial markets and push the Fed to delay once more. But U.S. stocks have rallied, and investors peg the chance of a December hike at more than 90 percent, according to figures from the CME Group. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Government negotiator Humberto de la Calle and rebel negotiator Ivan Marquez announced the new, modified deal Saturday in Havana, moving to end a half-century-long conflict that has claimed more than 220,000 lives and driven almost 8 million people from their homes. The latest agreement aims to address some of the concerns of opponents of the original accord, who said the deal was too lenient on a rebel group that had kidnapped and committed war crimes.  ""The new deal is an opportunity to clear up doubts, but above all to unite us,"" said De la Calle, who described the text of the modified accord as ""much better"" than the previous one. The negotiator didn't say if or how it would be submitted again to voters for approval or to congress. President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia inked an initial peace deal on Sept. 26 amid international fanfare after more than four years of negotiations. But voters rejected it on Oct. 2 by just 55,000 votes, dealing a stunning setback to Santos who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end Colombia's conflict. Santos immediately began looking for ways to rescue the deal and the sides extended a cease-fire until Dec. 31 to get the modified deal done. The rebels insisted they wouldn't go back to the drawing board and throw out years of arduous negotiations with the government.  ""The meetings with the FARC delegation were intense,"" said De la Calle. ""We worked 15 days and nights to reach this new agreement."" De La Calle said some modifications made were related to justice, punishment for combatants accused of war crimes and reparations for the conflict's victims. He said negotiators had worked out the details of how and where those responsible for crimes would serve their sentences, addressing complaints by opponents that rebels accused of atrocities would not be imprisoned but submitted to ""alternative punishments."" Other modifications include requiring the rebels to present an inventory of acquired money and holdings, and the provision of safeguards for private owners and property during reforms carried out in the countryside. Cases of conflict participants accused of drug trafficking would be dealt with under Colombia's penal code and be heard by high courts. In a televised address Saturday night, Santos said he had instructed De la Calle and the negotiating team to return to Bogota to explain the details of the new accord to the ""no"" campaign led by conservative former President Alvaro Uribe. Santos said that an issue where negotiators did not achieve advances was on the insistence by opponents of the peace deal that guerrilla leaders not be allowed to run for elected office.  ""We won't have assigned legislative seats. To the contrary, they will have to participate in elections. Nor will they have positions in government, as has occurred in other cases. But yes they can be elected,"" he said. FARC negotiator Marquez said ""the implementation of the accord is all that remains for the construction of the bases for peace in Colombia."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry congratulated Colombians, including Santos and those from the ""no"" campaign, for reaching the new peace deal.  ""After 52 years of war, no peace agreement can satisfy everyone in every detail. But this agreement constitutes an important step forward on Colombia's path to a just and durable peace. The United States, in coordination with the Government of Colombia, will continue to support full implementation of the final peace agreement,"" he said in a statement. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's office said Sunday that he ""commends the parties for maintaining firm their commitment to the cease-fire and cessation of hostilities"" and ""reaffirms the support of the United Nations for the peace process."" Hours before the deal was announced, Uribe, who was Colombia's president from 2002 to 2010, had asked that it ""not be definitive"" until opponents and victims of the conflict could review the text. Following a meeting with Santos, Uribe read a statement to reporters saying he had asked that the ""texts to be announced from Havana"" not be official until they had been reviewed. Uribe and his supporters had demanded stiffer penalties for rebels who committed war crimes and criticized the promise of a political role for the FARC, a 7,000-strong peasant army that is Latin America's last remaining major insurgency. They didn't like that under the old deal guerrilla leaders involved in crimes against humanity would be spared jail time and allowed to enter political life. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Xi spoke on the 150th anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, China's first president and the godfather of Chinese nationalism, who continues to command broad respect within China and the Chinese diaspora. Speaking to an audience of officials and military officers at the colossal Great Hall of the People in central Beijing, Xi called on Taiwan's leaders to endorse the principle that the island and mainland China are parts of a single Chinese nation.  ""Any party, organization or individual in Taiwan, no matter what they proposed in the past, as long as they acknowledge the '92 consensus and that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China, we would like to make exchanges with them,"" Xi said, referring to a 1992 agreement that laid the foundation for talks between the two long-time antagonists. China, Xi said, would ""never allow anyone, any organization, any party to split out any piece of land of China at any time and in any way."" Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has refused to endorse the '92 consensus, prompting Beijing to cut contacts with her government and broaden its outreach to the opposition Nationalist Party that formally backs eventual unification. Tsai scored a decisive win in January's presidential election, while her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party gained a majority in the legislature representing the island of 23 million people that split from the mainland amid civil war in 1949. Beijing has also registered alarm over anti-China sentiment in Hong Kong among newly elected members of its legislative council. China's top legislature this week took the rare step of intervening directly in a local Hong Kong political dispute by effectively barring two legally elected separatist lawmakers from taking office, setting the stage for further turmoil in the semiautonomous city.

Trump's threats to tear up trade deals and hike tariffs on Chinese goods look ominous. If carried out, they could chill thriving commercial ties at a time when Beijing is struggling to shore up economic growth. At the same time, Trump's suggestion he might reduce Washington's global strategic presence to focus on domestic issues would be a gift to Chinese leaders. They could expand their political and military profile in East Asia with less risk of conflict. ___ The incoming Trump administration faces the task of maintaining influence in the face of rising Chinese strategic ambitions while accommodating Asian countries that are being drawn into Beijing's economic orbit. That calls for more nimble diplomacy that transcends the security-focused ""pivot to Asia"" and caters to countries' desire for a balanced relationship between Washington and Beijing, analysts say. It will require greater economic and diplomatic engagement, drawing on America's soft power assets in culture, media and education. China is ""without doubt trying to subvert American alliances and relationships,"" including in Europe, Australia and South Korea, said Michael Montesano, a research fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. That's been abetted by ""depressingly unimaginative"" U.S. diplomacy in Asia that is focused too narrowly on military alliances and is now hobbled by Washington's failure to advance the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact, Montesano said. Over U.S. objections, Beijing has moved to cement its claim to most of the South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and military airstrips atop coral reefs. On strategic issues, Chinese researchers have ""come around to the view that Donald Trump is better for China,"" said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center at Tsinghua University in Beijing.  ""There is a sense among many that Donald Trump will draw inward,"" said Haenle. ""This is music to their ears, because this means that the United States might not put pressure on China in the region."" Beijing has been visited in recent weeks by leaders from the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam, highlighting its economic appeal and lack of interest in their internal affairs, especially corruption and human rights -- issues the U.S. is seen as harping on. Still, it would be ""premature to write off the United States,"" said Carlyle Thayer, an expert on Southeast Asia and emeritus professor at Australia's University of New South Wales.  ""The U.S. has important equities in the region through investment and trade,"" said Thayer. ""And the U.S. has a national interest in preventing China from becoming a hegemonic power over the region."" As for the Philippines' unpredictable new president, Rodrigo Duterte, the new administration would be best advised to ""ride out the Duterte storm and let domestic politics in the Philippines take its course,"" said Thayer. Meanwhile, concerns about China's intentions will propel governments such as Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam toward closer ties with the U.S., Australia, Japan and India, said Greg Poling of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ___ How will Donald Trump deal with China on politically volatile commercial issues? Despite his threats of a trade war, no one is sure -- probably not even Trump himself. But businesspeople and economists say Washington is bound to be tougher on trade, market access and currency after the election laid bare Americans' anxiety about jobs and stagnant wages. Uncertainty about where Trump wants to take the world's biggest economy has caused turmoil in global financial markets. The answer -- and especially how that affects ties with No. 2 China -- could have been even bigger repercussions. Trump is unlikely to carry out his most extreme threats to tear up trade deals or slap 45 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, say economists. But they say high-visibility gestures such as declaring Beijing manipulates its exchange rate to boost exports -- a step that can trigger penalties -- look more likely.  ""It has been clear for some time that whoever wins the White House is going to be tougher on China by necessity,"" said Randal Phillips, vice chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. ""And I think, frankly, the Chinese government has known that for several years."" Phillips and others warn that Chinese leaders will need to be sensitive to American public sentiment to avoid disrupting their access to U.S. consumers. At the top of the U.S. wish list is more access to China's growing market, where finance, telecoms and a wide swath of other industries are mostly off-limits. Foreign governments assumed China would open up as it grew richer. But business groups complain Beijing is trying instead to squeeze foreign rivals out of technology and other promising industries in violation of its free-trade commitments. The United States, along with Germany and other trading partners, are increasingly frustrated that their companies are blocked from buying Chinese assets in most industries while China Inc. is on a global acquisition spree.  ""It's just not acceptable anymore,"" said Phillips. That could help Washington recruit allies to pressure Beijing, said Haenle of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center. He noted Germany, the biggest economy in the 28-nation European Union, is becoming more assertive in demanding ""reciprocity and market access."" Washington will talk to the EU ""to see what can be done on this issue,"" Haenle said. Others warn reckless action could backfire.  ""The biggest threats to the economy stem from Trump's protectionist stance on trade, anti-immigration policies and the weakening of government finances stemming from expected tax cuts,"" Sarah Boumphrey of Euromonitor International said in a report. Trump's election adds to the urgency of winding up negotiations begun in 2013 on a bilateral investment treaty before President Barack Obama leaves office, said Jake Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents some 200 companies. His group sees the measure, which would guarantee the legal status of investments in each other's markets, as the best way to increase access to the China.  ""This may offer an opportunity to accelerate the negotiations,"" Parker said. China's government tried to remind Washington that both sides benefit from one of the world's biggest commercial relationships despite chronic disputes.  ""Bilateral trade over the past decades has tangibly benefited the U.S. people and created jobs instead of harming their interests,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang. Tough talk on China has featured in every U.S. presidential campaign since 1992, when then-candidate Bill Clinton dubbed the ruling Communist Party the ""butchers of Beijing."" Once elected, Clinton set that aside and persuaded Congress to grant China low-tariff ""most-favored nation"" status. Other candidates have taken a similar approach.  ""What he said during the campaign, that's not government policy,"" said James Zimmerman, the American chamber's chairman. ""Government policy really requires thoughtful discussion, dialogue and compromise."" Companies and economists were waiting to see whether Trump follows tradition.  ""This scenario is still subject to considerable uncertainty,"" said Boumphrey. ""Republicans will control both houses (of Congress), which would ordinarily make for more certainty, but it is unclear how many of his policies the party will support."" ___ Christopher Bodeen has reported on Chinese politics and diplomacy since 2000.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-control-up-for-grabs-as-democrats-seek-majority/2016/11/08/205795c2-a610-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	GOP keeps Senate control as Democrats fall short	" WASHINGTON -- Republicans held onto their slim Senate majority, a stinging blow to Democrats in a night full of them. Democrats had been nearly certain of retaking control but saw their hopes fizzle as endangered GOP incumbents won in Missouri, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and even Democrat-friendly Wisconsin. GOP-held New Hampshire remained too close to call on Wednesday morning, but even if Democrats eked out a win there it would not make a difference. Republicans started the night with a 54-46 majority in the Senate and were on track to end up with at least 52 seats, presuming they win a December runoff in Louisiana, as expected. The outcome added to a debacle of a night for Democrats, who lost the presidency and faced being consigned to minority status on Capitol Hill for years to come. Republicans celebrated their wins, already looking ahead to midterms in 2018 when Democrats could see their numbers reduced even further with a group of red-state Senate Democrats on the ballot. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who will serve in that role next year under a President Trump, issued a statement congratulating the president-elect.  ""After eight years of the Obama administration, the American people have chosen a new direction for our nation. President-elect Trump has a significant opportunity to bring our nation together,"" McConnell said. ""It is my hope and intent that we succeed in the years ahead by working together with our colleagues across the aisle to strengthen our national and economic security."" As the night wore on, Democratic operatives struggled to explain why their optimistic assessments of retaking Senate control were so mistaken. Some blamed unexpected turnout by certain segments of white voters, or FBI Director James Comey's bombshell announcement that he was reviewing a new batch of emails connected with Democrat Hillary Clinton. In Pennsylvania, GOP Sen. Pat Toomey won a narrow victory for his second term over Democratic challenger Katie McGinty. It was a race Democrats expected to win going into the night -- and one that many Republicans felt nearly as sure they'd lose. The story was the same in Wisconsin, where GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, written off for months by his own party, won re-election against former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold in a rematch. In Missouri and North Carolina, where entrenched GOP incumbents Roy Blunt and Richard Burr faced unexpectedly strong challenges from Democrats, both prevailed in the end. Democrats did grab a Republican-held seat in Illinois, where GOP Sen. Mark Kirk lost to Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a double-amputee Iraq war vet. That stood as the one Democratic pickup. The other bright spot for Democrats was in Nevada, where Minority Leader Harry Reid's retirement after five terms created a vacancy and the one Democratic-held seat that was closely contested. Reid maneuvered to fill it with his hand-picked successor, Catherine Cortez Masto, Nevada's former attorney general who spoke often of her family's immigrant roots in a state with heavy Latino turnout. Cortez Masto will become the first Latina U.S. senator. She beat Republican Rep. Joe Heck, who struggled with sharing the ticket with Donald Trump, first endorsing and then un-endorsing Trump to the disgust of some GOP voters. Indeed the Senate races were shadowed every step of the way by the polarizing presidential race between Clinton and Trump. Yet in the end, Trump was apparently not the drag on GOP candidates widely anticipated. Republicans like Johnson who endorsed him and stuck with him won re-election, as did others like Pennsylvania's Toomey who never backed Trump until the very end. And so did a few like GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona who un-endorsed Trump after audio emerged of him boasting of groping women. McCain, at age 80, won his sixth term in quite possibly his final campaign. The 2008 GOP presidential nominee was re-elected without much difficulty despite early predictions of a competitive race, and struck a reflective note ahead of the outcome.  ""While as Yogi Berra said, 'I hate to make predictions, especially about the future,' I'm not sure how many more I have in me,"" McCain said. In Indiana, GOP Rep. Todd Young beat former Democratic senator and governor Evan Bayh, who mounted a much-ballyhooed comeback bid, but wilted under scrutiny. And in Florida, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio beat Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, giving Rubio a platform from which he could mount another bid for president in 2020. In New York, Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' leader-in-waiting for a new Congress, easily won re-election. But the results elsewhere meant he would be leading a Senate minority when he replaces Reid in the leader's role. Even though the GOP's renewed control of the Senate will be narrow, the advantages of being in the majority are significant. The controlling party holds the committee chairmanships, sets the legislative agenda and runs investigations. First up is likely to be a nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. ___ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/abf50efe-a64f-11e6-ba46-53db57f0e351_story.html	Trump rides his movement to vindication and the White House	" NEW YORK -- Donald Trump awakened a movement of angry working-class voters fed up with political insiders and desperate for change. On Tuesday, that movement propelled him to the White House. Trump's stunning, come-from-behind victory over Hillary Clinton -- a far more organized and experienced rival -- served as a raised middle finger to the political establishment from his fervent backers.  ""I have been so ready for this,"" said Oklahoma resident Holly Berry, who flew all the way from Tahlequah to celebrate at Trump's victory party in Manhattan. Berry, who works in sales, said that she can no longer afford her health insurance, which has spiked 86 percent.  ""People are sick and tired,"" she said. ""This country's fed up with everything. We're ready for a change. We're ready for lower taxes, ready for our economy to grow, we're ready for jobs."" But to millions of others, the billionaire businessman's elevation to the presidency is a shocking and terrifying reality that will take time to comprehend. Many see the president-elect as a bigot and a misogynist unfit for the office.  ""He scares the daylights out of me,"" said Wendy Bennett, a Democrat and government worker from Reno, Nevada, who cast her ballot for Clinton. ""I think his personality is going to start World War III. He reminds me of Hitler."" Lisa Moore, a registered Republican from Glen Rock, New Jersey, crossed party lines to vote for Clinton, who would have been the nation's first female president.  ""As a woman, in good conscience, and as the mother of a daughter, I can't vote for somebody who's so morally reprehensible,"" said Moore, an exercise instructor. The 2016 election was vindication for Trump, a former reality TV star who was underestimated from the start. While pundits assumed his poll numbers would sink as soon as voters started taking the race seriously, Trump was drawing thousands each night to rallies packed with angry, largely white supporters who felt ignored and lied to by Washington. While statistics showed the U.S. economy improving overall, it didn't feel that way in places like upstate New York, Pennsylvania's coal country and former manufacturing towns across the Midwest devastated by outsourcing and globalization. Chaos abroad only added to the feeling that the country was sliding backward. Together, those factors drove a yearning to return to a simpler time when America was the world's undisputed superpower and middle-class wages were on the rise.  ""We have our fingers in too many baskets,"" said Joe Hudson, 49, an engineer and registered Republican from Virginia Beach, Virginia, who said he would be voting for Trump because ""we're not taking care of our own people.""  ""We're trying to be too involved in world politics. And our country is imploding from within,"" he said. ""We need a new direction, a new attitude, and people to stop arguing and letting the media affect how we feel."" Trump's vow was simple: He'd ""Make America Great Again."" His outsider status, coupled with his personal business success, lent credibility to a populist message that emphasized recapturing manufacturing jobs, restoring American strength abroad and curtailing legal and illegal immigration. Trump promised to immediately create new jobs, end conflicts abroad and -- in Trump's words, ""win again"" Trump, early on, painted his supporters as a ""movement"" larger than himself.  ""This isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country. And they're talking about it all over the world,"" he said at a rally in Miami last week during the race's furious final stretch.  ""There has never been a movement like this in the history of our country -- it's never happened. Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump, have said it's the single greatest phenomena they have ever seen."" But as he worked his base into a frenzy and locked down one primary win after the next, Trump was also repelling large swaths of the populace -- including women, college-educated whites and minorities -- with his deeply divisive rhetoric. Trump launched his campaign with a speech that accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals across the border. He later questioned 2008 Republican nominee and former POW John McCain's status as a war hero, saying he preferred people who hadn't been captured. He mocked a disabled reporter. And he called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"" -- a blanket religion test denounced by many as un-American. After securing his party's nomination, Trump questioned a federal judge's ability to treat him fairly because of the judge's Hispanic origin, repeatedly insulted a Muslim-American family whose son had been killed in Iraq, and got into an extended spat with a former beauty queen, at one point instructing his millions of Twitter followers to ""check out"" her non-existent sex tape. Again and again, Trump appeared poised to close the gap with Clinton, only to go off on a tangent that would send his poll numbers tumbling. Then came the release of shocking old video footage from an ""Access Hollywood"" bus in which Trump bragged about being able to grope women because he was famous. The video's release was followed by a string of allegations from women who said Trump sexually harassed or assaulted them. Trump denied the accusations, at one point threatening to sue the women. But one October surprise was overshadowed by another. Trump's numbers had already been rising with news of health care premium increases when the FBI director informed Congress that the bureau had found a new trove of emails potentially relevant to its investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server a secretary of state. While the FBI eventually announced that there was nothing in the emails to merit criminal prosecution, the damage appeared to have been done. On Tuesday, Trump won a commanding victory, buoyed by a new Trump coalition.  ""It's time to get together,"" he said. ___ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj.

The yearlong investigation thrust the FBI into the thick of an already fractious presidential race, entangled in a way that strained its vaunted independence and cracked its prized reputation for silence about its work. Even after Tuesday's election, FBI Director James Comey is sure to face second-guessing over his public statements that opened the curtain on normally secret investigative details.  ""This has been a very difficult election process. Unfortunately, the FBI has been drawn into it,"" said Leo Taddeo, a retired FBI supervisor. Although Comey signaled a conclusion to the Clinton email matter with a letter to Congress on Sunday, the discussion continues. Lawmakers demand answers to questions left unresolved by two vague and ambiguous Comey letters. Clinton and her aides feel wronged by the disclosure of ""new"" emails less than two weeks before Election Day. And ex-prosecutors of both parties are concerned the bureau's actions strayed from its mandate to steer clear of politics. If Clinton should win on Tuesday, could the investigation follow her into the White House? Comey said Sunday that agents had finished reviewing all newly found emails to and from her while she was secretary of state and had found nothing to change his conclusion from July -- no charges. A senior law enforcement official said the letter meant an end to the email review, rather than a simple status update. There was no suggestion any of Clinton's aides were being scrutinized, indicating the investigation was again closed. The speed with which agents reviewed the trove of emails -- found on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide -- suggested investigators encountered many duplicates of messages they had already seen. It's hard to gauge the political impact of Comey's recent announcements. In the nine days between Comey's initial statement that he was looking at more emails and his all-clear announcement on Sunday, nearly 24 million people cast early ballots -- about 18 percent of the expected total votes for president. The controversy, coupled with leaks that laid bare internal squabbling, suggests a tough road ahead for FBI leaders regardless of who wins Tuesday. After a referral from the intelligence community inspector general, the FBI began investigating Clinton for the potential mishandling of classified information as secretary of state. Comey has said the investigation was done without regard to politics, but he also never lost sight of political sensitivities, receiving regular briefings but refusing to comment in public. When the FBI decided in July it wouldn't recommend charges, he broke from protocol and delivered an unusual public statement chastising Clinton and her aides as ""extremely careless."" There was plenty of Republican pushback to that announcement, but it was nothing compared to what Comey has faced -- from officials on both sides of the political divide -- the past two weeks. That started with his Oct. 28 notification to Congress that the FBI would review newly discovered emails potentially connected to the email investigation. The statement provoked outrage from Clinton and other Democrats who said it needlessly placed her under suspicion when the FBI didn't even know if the emails were relevant. Then came Sunday's statement, in which Comey effectively cleared the Democratic presidential nominee by saying the new review had done nothing to change the FBI's July recommendation that she not face charges. Though a relief to Democrats and Clinton, the news also raised skepticism among Republicans and questions among others why the issue had been raised again in the first place. Comey has said he felt obligated to alert Congress after having previously testified that the investigation had been closed. Supporters say had he kept silent until after the election, he would have faced partisan allegations of stifling a bombshell announcement and perhaps given fuel to allegations of a ""rigged"" election. He also would have risked the chance of the news leaking out.  ""Do I sit quietly and do nothing for 10 days and let the election quietly go by, pregnant with the knowledge that we have thousands of new emails?"" said Ron Hosko, a retired FBI assistant director. ""Or do I tell the same Congress that I've been committed to being transparent with?"" The bureau has been further roiled by leaks that hint at discord over the handling of a separate inquiry involving the Clinton Foundation and agents from the New York field office, the FBI's largest. The Associated Press and other news organizations have reported that FBI agents seeking an investigation met this year with public corruption prosecutors to present allegations they wanted to pursue, but that the lawyers did not see a basis for moving forward. Thomas O'Connor, president of the FBI Agents Association, said in a statement that FBI agents conduct investigations with ""integrity and professionalism"" and that it was wrong to imply that they don't respect the confidential nature of their work. The latest turmoil poses a unique challenge for a venerable law enforcement organization and for a director who talks often about his desire to be accountable to the American people and transparent. Depending on who wins Tuesday, Comey will have to co-exist with either a Republican president who has challenged his organization's integrity or a Democrat whose email practices were the subject of a criminal investigation. He'll also probably have to explain his decision-making to Congress.  ""Rest assured, Jim Comey's not afraid of creating controversy,"" Taddeo said. ""He is determined to do the right thing."" ____ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
