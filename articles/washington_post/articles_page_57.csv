Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in early 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fed policymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy is making progress toward the Fed's goals on employment and inflation. She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case for a rate increase ""had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon."" Analysts viewed Yellen's comments as an effort to put financial markets on notice that a rate hike is likely to occur at the Fed's last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased market uncertainty after Trump's election might be cause for a delay. Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen said that uncertainty surrounding Trump's proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending could well last for a good deal longer than one month.  ""Yellen's testimony before Congress ... further cemented in place expectations that the Fed will hike rates next month,"" said Michael Feroli, senior economist at JPMorgan. Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was ""fully my intention"" to remain as Fed chair until her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018. She said she could not imagine any circumstance that would cause her to leave early, addressing speculation that she might step down once Trump takes office, given his critical comments of her during the election campaign. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that it could raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S. economy went through a prolonged soft-patch. The rate has remained in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a record low near zero for seven years. Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point in December and then will boost rates two more times in 2017. Yellen stressed in her testimony that the slow recovery and absence of inflation pressures should allow the Fed to move gradually in raising its key rate, the federal funds rate.  ""Gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years,"" Yellen said, referring to the point where the funds rate is neither promoting economic growth nor slowing growth. As measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government has estimated, more than twice the rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level typical of a healthy economy, down from 10 percent in 2009. In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed before her term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bank regulation differ from Trump's. Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. After the country lived through a ""devastating financial crisis,"" Yellen said that ""I would not want to see the clock turned back on all the improvements we have made."" Trump and other Republicans have attacked Yellen and other federal bank regulators for imposing too-restrictive rules on banks, pledging that they will seek to repeal major parts of the 2010 law. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Yellen's term ends Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.

The county collects more than $22 million a year in profit under the system, which requires that bars, restaurants and retail stores buy beer and wine directly from the county instead of from private wholesalers. Consumers can buy beer and wine in private stores, but if they want hard liquor, they must go to county-owned outlets. It is the only such system in Maryland, and there are few like it in counties anywhere.  [Last call for Montgomery liquor monopoly?]  Critics, including restaurant owners and consumers, have long assailed the system as a relic of the era that followed the repeal of Prohibition and a legacy of the county's conservative, rural roots. Critics complain of poor selection at the Department of Liquor Control's warehouse and late or damaged deliveries. But the county has been loath to give up the revenue generated by its liquor monopoly, a portion of which has gone to road construction. Opponents counter that within the county's $5 billion budget, the loss of revenue would be minimal and be offset by increased economic activity triggered by the liquor industry's privatization. State lawmakers and Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot (D) pressed for full or partial privatization last year but eventually agreed to Leggett's proposal to form a task force to examine alternative models. The working group recommended a series of privatization options. The county also hired a private consultant, the PFM Group, to study the issue. Under the option selected by Leggett -- and recommended by PFM -- the county would fold the Department of Liquor Control into a Liquor Authority. Leggett would name a board of directors, which would hire a chief executive. The authority would oversee all alcohol distribution and sales, while the county receives an annual payment of net profits. Unionized warehouse employees would still bargain collectively with the county over pay and benefits. The proposal represents Leggett's second major push to privatize a county function. Last year, he led the effort to transform the county's Economic Development Department into a separate entity. Leggett said Thursday that the liquor-authority proposal gives the county the best chance to retain its revenue while bringing in private-sector expertise to improve service. ""It's an organization that is much leaner and meaner, protects our employees and is able to give us some reasonable guarantee of revenues,"" Leggett said. Leggett's staff is drafting a bill to be considered in the General Assembly's coming legislative session. The Montgomery County Council will be asked to take a position on the measure for the legislative delegation but will not take formal action. Del. C. William Frick (D-Montgomery), who led the push for privatization last year, called Leggett's plan ""an admission of failure."" ""This doesn't do anything to solve the complaints of consumers or small businesses,"" Frick said. ""It's just a monopoly under another name. It's the same structure with an additional layer imposed."" Council member Hans Riemer (D-At Large), who proposed a partial privatization last year, said that Leggett's plan is ""worth looking at"" but that he has some questions. ""The concern I've always had with the authority model is accountability,"" said Riemer, a member of the working group. ""What do you do when service deteriorates or if the authority isn't doing a good job?"" Leggett said he doesn't expect all stakeholders to fully embrace the plan, even though he believes it strikes the best balance between improving service and retaining revenues. ""My view is, we have to finally put this to rest."" he said. "

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in January 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. ___ America's shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America's shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara's office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart's profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 percent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap's third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 percent NEW YORK -- Gap's third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 percent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favoring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don't stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK -- Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 percent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 percent from the previous year. The bank saw a 50 percent drop in credit card applications. ___ Verizon's AOL cutting 500 jobs, will focus on mobile, video NEW YORK -- AOL is cutting about 500 jobs, or 8 percent of its workforce, as it trims back following some deals and focuses on mobile, video and data. In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. ___ Sorry Trump, NY Times says subscriptions rose since election NEW YORK -- The New York Times pushed back against President-elect Donald Trump, saying Thursday that its paid subscriptions have jumped since the election, despite Trump's accusations. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Times ""is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'"" The Times said Thursday that it added 41,000 paid subscriptions to its newspaper and digital news products in the week since Election Day. The increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,333.97. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.70 per 1,000 cubic feet.

"      President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it's ""healthy"" for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. ""When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,"" Obama said. (The Washington Post)   President Obama put on his political strategist cap Monday at a White House news conference, diagnosing the Democratic Party's immediate problems and telling it what it needs to correct going forward. And some saw a bit of a dig at Hillary Clinton's campaign in all of it. Here's what Obama said (emphasis added): I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues the Democrats have to be clear on is the given population distribution across the country. We have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grass-roots level, something that's been a running thread in my career. I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa. It was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW Hall, and there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There's some counties maybe I won, that people didn't expect, because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for. And the challenge for a national party is how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for. And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press (ph). And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about, how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build state parties and local parties and school board elections you're paying attention to, state rep races and city council races -- that all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future. And I'm optimistic that will happen. The Iowa comment, to some, seemed designed for Clinton.   President Obama: ""I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated I win Iowa, but because I spent 87 days in Iowa."" Masterclass in shade. -- Nerdy Wonka (@NerdyWonka) November 14, 2016     President Obama's description of how he won Iowa is low-key shade at Clinton and how much time she spent campaigning in the states she lost. -- Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) November 14, 2016     2/ Obama is seriously subtweeting HRC right now. Talking about how much he campaigned in Iowa, where demographics not on his side -- Jesse Singal (@jessesingal) November 14, 2016     Obama: ""I won Iowa not because the demographics dictate that I would win Iowa, but because I spent 87 days"" there - that's gotta sting 4 HRC -- Ali Rogin (@AliABCNews) November 14, 2016   So, I get the argument. Clinton was criticized for her campaign schedule: both for not making a post-convention appearance in Wisconsin -- a state she lost -- and for not having a particularly arduous and intense one. You might even recall a certain opponent of hers suggesting she didn't have the ""stamina"" and needed lots of sleep. (Whatever happened to that guy?) In that way, Obama's comments could certainly be read as a dig at the campaign that Clinton ran and the areas in which she fell short. But the context of Obama's comments make pretty clear that he was talking about the distribution of his party more broadly. The Democrats are the party of urban areas and find themselves on the short end in an increasing number of states. This has left them with a historically low amount of power beneath the White House level. And it's a troubling development for the party over the long term if they start losing in the Midwest and Rust Belt, like they did last week. At the same time, his choice of Iowa as his example is easy to read as a shot at Clinton. Iowa provided one of the biggest swings between 2012 and 2016, going for Obama by six points and then going for Trump by nearly 10 points, according to the latest election results from the Cook Political Report's David Wasserman. If there's one state that epitomizes Clinton's failures to live up to the example set by Obama, it's Iowa, Iowa, Iowa. Obama's mention of a ""national press strategy"" could also be read as a dig at Clinton. But Trump's team certainly ran that kind of campaign, too, so it could have been more a reference to how difficult it is to focus intently on individual states these days -- for both sides. Overall, Obama's comments don't seem to include much actual malice. Perhaps he thinks Iowa epitomized Clinton's failings as a candidate and he's frustrated at her losing to a guy who once questioned his legitimacy as president. Or maybe he just thinks it's a good example of a very white, Midwestern state that Democrats can't lose election after election, and he wants them to try harder to keep it from happening again.          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

Alexei Ulyukayev became the highest-ranking official to be charged with corruption during Putin's tenure as Russia's leader, and the first national minister to be arrested while in office since Joseph Stalin's dreaded security chief Lavrenti Beria was detained in the Kremlin in 1953 after the Soviet dictator's death. Some Putin critics saw Ulyukayev's arrest as a tactic by the Russian leader to keep his senior lieutenants in check. ""The arrest of such a loyal and important official as Ulyukayev is a powerful act of intimidation, first of all, for the benefit of officials,"" Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko party, said in a Facebook post. ""Everyone should know: Anything can happen to you at any moment; that's the main message."" Authorities on Tuesday said that Russia's Federal Security Service had been listening to Ulyukayev's phone conversations for months, and Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that the Russian president had been aware of the investigation all along. ""These are very serious accusations, and only a court can pass a verdict,"" Peskov said, according to news agencies. Russia's Investigative Committee, the state agency that looks into major crimes, said Ulyukayev was caught ""in the act"" of receiving the $2 million bribe in exchange for signing off on the $5 billion acquisition last month by the state-run oil giant Rosneft of a 50 percent stake in a smaller state-owned company, Bashneft.   [Opinion: Russia may be wounded, but it can still bite]  The sale was reported in the Russian media to have caused dissension between rival factions in the Kremlin. Rosneft's top official, Igor Sechin, a Putin confidant, pushed for the right to purchase Bashneft. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev headed a second group that believed Bashneft should be sold to private investors, not a state-owned company. Ulyukayev, 60, a minister in Putin's cabinet since 2013 who has been overseeing the sale of state assets, initially opposed the Bashneft deal on the grounds that a state-owned company purchasing a state-owned company is not privatization.  He eventually signed off on the sale, which was pushed by Putin as a way to close the country's budget deficit, which is widening in the face of low oil prices. According to the Investigative Committee, Ulyukayev demanded a bribe from a Rosneft representative in return for a positive appraisal of the deal.  ""The defendant threatened to create impediments for the company's future operations by use of his official capacities,"" said Svetlana Petrenko, spokeswoman for the Investigative Committee. Ulyukayev could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. After a court hearing Tuesday, he was placed under house arrest. Russia's political leadership lined up to cheer the arrest as a sign that top officials in a country long associated with official corruption can no longer operate outside the law with impunity.   [Trump and Putin look to reset relations]  Vyacheslav Volodin, a former Putin aide and now the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, said the arrest means that there are ""no untouchable people"" in Russia. Others took the case as a sign of political tension. Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Putin strategist, pointed out how odd it was that Putin apparently knew that the minister was under investigation for months but let him stay in office instead of firing him.  ""This proves that things are very bad at the top,"" Pavlovsky told TV Dozhd. ""Very bad."" Others pointed to the oddities surrounding the investigation.  The Investigative Committee emphasized that although Ulyukayev was arrested on charges of taking money to facilitate a deal, the deal itself had been completed legally and was not subject to investigation. The man whom Ulyukayev is alleged to have strong-armed, Sechin, is perhaps one of the most powerful people in Russia and someone who has Putin's ear. No special investigation would have been needed for that. Sechin could have just told his boss that he was being shaken down. ""One would have to be crazy to extort a bribe from he most influential person in the country,"" said Alexander Shokhin, who served with Ulyukayev in the earliest post-Soviet Russian governments, which sought to privatize state-owned companies to kick-start a transition to a market economy, a process that was marred by widespread corruption among Kremlin insiders. Shokhin, who heads Russia's biggest business lobbying group, also pointed out how odd it was that Ulyukayev would have asked for a bribe when the company sold at market price. ""If Aleksei Ulyukaev had been charged with hitting an old babushka while driving his Mercedes G-Class at high speed at night in Moscow, it would've looked more plausible,"" Shokhin told the Meduza news agency. Many in Russia's political ranks hold old ""reformers"" such as Shokhin and Ulyukayev responsible for selling out Russia to the West after the Cold War. That sentiment pervaded the comments by lawmaker Nikolai Kovalyov, a former head of the Federal Security Service, who referred to verses Ulyukayev wrote in 2011 for his son: ""Go my son, go from here; On this globe you will find many places; where one step forward does not mean 500 steps back; Where they don't say everything backward all the time.""  ""I am not surprised"" by the arrest, Kovalyov said. ""I expected something of this kind to happen when I read his verses calling on his son to leave Russia.""   Editor's note: An earlier version of this story misidentified the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, and his former position in the Putin administration.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        Jimmy Carter did it. Ronald Reagan did it. George H.W. Bush did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And Mitt Romney would have done it. For the past 40 years, every president and presidential candidate who has had anything other than the most vanilla of investment portfolios -- Barack Obama, who had most of his money in Treasury bonds, fell into that category -- has put or has promised to put their assets into a blind trust to prevent any kind of conflict of interest between what's good for the country and what's good for their retirement. This wasn't required by law, but it did seem like it was required by good governance. Donald Trump, though, has refused to entertain this even though he has a much more extensive and eclectic array of holdings that includes golf courses in the United Arab Emirates, skyscrapers in Turkey and condos in the Philippines. He has said his three adult children will run his business instead. To be clear -- because Trump was asked this in a debate -- this would not be a blind trust. To count as one, the Congressional Research Service says, he'd need to transfer ""control and management of private assets to an independent trustee who may not communicate information about the identity of the holdings in the trust"" to him. In other words, let someone he doesn't know sell all his old assets and buy new ones for him without telling him what they are. Having his kids manage his properties fails both of these tests, especially when they're a part of his transition team. How do we know that they won't staff the Trump administration based on who'll be friendliest to the Trump Organization? Or that they won't hint that the Trump Organization is just an extension of the Trump administration when they're, say, trying to negotiate a real estate deal overseas? We don't. And we can't as long as there isn't any actual separation between Trump's political operation and his business one. Alan Garten, the Trump Organization's general counsel, has offered a defense of what in modern times are these unprecedented conflicts of interest: that they're plenty precedented in other countries. ""It's not unusual,"" he told the Wall Street Journal, ""for people around the world successful in a business to play a role in government."" And he's right. There are a lot of places where this is endemic. Take Ukraine. For a quarter century, it has been passed back and forth between oligarchs who have treated it like their own personal piggy bank. And for a quarter century, its economy hasn't grown at all. In fact, its per capita gross domestic product has actually fallen 26 percent since its communist-era peak in 1989. The problem is that Ukraine is a place where it takes a bribe to do anything, and you can't do anything because of all the bribes it takes. You have to pay off the police, the prosecutors, the judges, the employers, and even the professors if you want a college degree. It's no wonder, then, that Ukraine ranks 130th out of 168 countries in Transparency International's corruption rankings. Or that its recently deposed president had a palace replete with an ostrich-filled zoo, a replica pirate ship in his man-made lake, a stable of classic cars, and a set of gold-plated golf clubs to go with his own private course. Ukraine's Catch-22 is that it needs to privatize its state-owned companies that enable so much of this graft, but that the act of privatizing them can enable far more. That's because selling companies without a lot of transparency allows people to buy them for way below-market rates -- where do you think the oligarchs come from? -- with the difference going directly into the auctioneer's pocket. Not to mention the more run-of-the-mill corruption: the tax officials who take disguised payoffs to let companies pay next to nothing, and the politicians who pay $150 million more than they should for, say, an oil rig to turn public money into a private fortune. This nexus between business and politics has created a situation where it's hard to tell them apart. The point of winning elections in Ukraine seems to be about amassing more money for your company, and the point of your company seems to be amassing more power to win elections. It's the chicken and the egg of corruption. Whichever one comes first, though, there's enough money in it that even a political consultant such as Paul Manafort, who not only ran Trump's campaign for a while, but also that of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, could have $12 million earmarked for him in under-the-table payments. Now, Trump may completely ignore his business interests in office. But without transparency, without a legal wall between his personal financial interests and the American people's interests, you can't be sure. And although a foreign policy that even partly benefits Trump's hotels couldn't destroy the United States' commitment to openness and the rule of law, it sure could undermine it. Culture matters. So do norms. And above all, the example of the highest-profile person in the country. If Trump tries to turn public office into a vehicle for private enrichment on a scale unknown since the Gilded Age, it can't help but hurt a big part of what already makes the country great. That you can take a dream and turn it into a business without having to worry about greasing the wheels every step of the way. That's what has let the United States become the richest country in the world, and what has kept Ukraine from getting any richer over the past 25 years. ""Make America a Post-Soviet Kleptocracy"" isn't that catchy of a slogan.      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump took time off the campaign trail to cut the ribbon at his new D.C. hotel Oct. 26. How that and other campaign stops have affected Trump's businesses.

(Martin Meissner/Associated Press)  A world greatly concerned about how the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president could stall global climate policy received a major dose of welcome news Sunday, when scientists published a projection suggesting that for the third straight year, global carbon dioxide emissions did not increase much in 2016. The news comes from the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who measure how much carbon dioxide humans emit each year, as well as how much is subsequently absorbed by plants, land surfaces and oceans. The difference between the two determines the amount of carbon dioxide that remains in the atmosphere and drives global warming. Big news came from this group late last year, when it turned out that emissions in 2014 and 2015 represented a seeming end to a strong growth trend that had appeared unstoppable for some time. And moreover, this flattening had occurred despite steady global economic growth above 3 percent, which has typically been coupled with higher emissions. And now, the group reports, 2016 appears to be similar to 2014 and 2015, based on early projections. It will be about a 0.2 percent increase above the emissions levels of 2015, the group calculates, or barely a rise at all. The results were released in the form of a massive study in the journal Earth System Science Data, written by no less than 67 researchers from an army of institutions. That's what it takes, it seems, to chart the annual flow of carbon throughout the Earth's systems. ""2016 we estimate to be flat again,"" said Glen Peters, one of the contributors to the research and a scientist at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research-Oslo in Norway. ""It's definitely three years, it's fairly flat, which is quite a contrast to a decade ago, when it was growing at about 3 percent. It's really leveled out the last few years."" Peters said this leveling is attributable to a decline in emissions in China and the United States, the two largest emitters. In both cases, this was in significant part a result of less coal burning. China saw carbon dioxide emissions decrease by 0.7 percent in 2015 and is forecast to see an additional 0.5 percent decline in 2016. U.S. emissions are falling even faster. They declined by 2.6 percent in 2015 and are expected to fall an additional 1.7 percent this year. But not all of the world is following suit. By comparison, in 2015 there was strong 5.2 percent emissions growth in India. The current leveling out still means that slightly more than 36 billion tons of carbon dioxide are expected to have been emitted in 2016 from fossil fuel use and industrial activity. And after the oceans and the land take away their part, the rest of that carbon will stay there for a very long time, steadily warming the planet. (That 36 billion tons does not include emissions of other greenhouse gases, such as methane, or the releases of additional carbon dioxide from deforestation and other nonindustrial causes. Including these gases and sources only increases our impact on the planet further.) From a climate policy perspective, the key question is whether these three flat years suggest that the world is beginning to peak its emissions and bring them down again, which will be necessary if there is any hope of limiting warming to widely embraced international targets such as 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. But Peters said that it's too soon to know for sure, and that he would want to watch trends in China, in particular, for a bit longer. ""I'd certainly give it five or more years before I'd say it's a peak,"" he said. ""But certainly you would say, even leveling out, like we have over the last three years, is a big surprise. If you'd stood back three years ago, we wouldn't have been expecting this. So it's certainly good news."" However, it's also important to keep things in context. Not only is a cessation of growth very different from a decline. But, as the study notes, emissions today are ""still 63% above emissions in 1990."" What's more, if global warming is ever to stop -- and if we're ever to cool the planet back down again -- eventually emissions have to go to zero. Thirty-six billion tons is very far, indeed, from that. In fact, it's looking increasingly likely that we may have to find some way to make emissions go negative (pulling more from the air than we put in) in the second half of this century. The new research also suggests that, starting in 2017, the world will have only 800 billion tons, or gigatons, of carbon dioxide left to emit if it wants to preserve a two-thirds chance of preventing the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. This is the remaining global carbon ""budget."" Based on emissions of 36 billion tons per year, we would bust the budget in 22 years. There are pretty hard-to-miss political implications of the new finding about flat global emissions. The United States, after all, has elected Trump, who has pledged to ""cancel"" the Paris climate agreement, which seeks to reduce emissions quickly, and to rescue the domestic coal industry, which relies on the mining and the burning of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel. ""While there are many reasons why the growth in emissions has been halted, a key contribution has been the efforts made by the world's two biggest emitters, the United States and China, to reduce the consumption of coal,"" Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said in a statement. ""However, Donald Trump as President could undermine this achievement if he carries through with his threat to scrap the Obama Administration's Clean Power Plan, and encourages an increase in the use of coal for electricity generation.""

(Video: The Washington Post / Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   The last time we blew up the international system, it took two World Wars, a Cold War, and a Great Depression before we were able to get it back to where it'd been in 1913. With any luck, it won't require quite as much this time around. That, make no mistake, is what Donald Trump's election might mean. I say ""might,"" because we really don't know what he'll do in office. He's gone back and forth and back again on almost every issue. But if he's serious about jailing his political rivals, about cracking down on the free press, about potentially abandoning our allies, about encouraging them to get nuclear weapons of their own, and about ripping up free trade agreements, then the liberal international order that has bequeathed us a relative Pax Americana the past 70 years will be no more. It'll be the end of the end of history. That's become a familiar theme the past year. From Europe's anti-immigrant parties edging closer to power to Britain's all-but-winning it with the country's vote to leave the European Union to Trump's ascension to the White House, Francis Fukuyama's famous idea that free-market liberal democracy had vanquished all its ideological foes and was the ""final form of human government"" seems to be, well, a little more temporary. Just as he could have told you himself. Fukuyama, you see, believed that just because we'd reached the end of history didn't mean we'd stay in the end of history. That peace and prosperity might not be enough for some people who would, ""struggle for the sake of struggle"" simply ""out of a certain boredom"" from living in a world that doesn't seem to have meaning or identity any more. And so we might see a 227 year-old republic succumb to someone who evinced only the slightest respect for constitutional norms and even less for minority groups. How has it come to this? Well, the white working class is letting out a wail across the Western world against a political system they don't think recognizes them, and a society they don't recognize themselves. Add in the monotony of day-to-day life--why not smash it up just to see what happens?--and you've got a global revolt against the global order. Really, though, it's white men who are the ones rebelling against an economy that they feel like devalues their work, against a culture that they fear is devaluing their once-preeminent place in it, and against a mundane existence that devalues any kind of meaning. In other words, it's about economic anxiety, it's about racial resentment, it's about misogyny, but it's also about a general ennui. Now, by a happy coincidence, the first 25 years of the postwar liberal order had maybe the best and most broadly-shared growth in all of human history. We built the UN to keep the peace, NATO to defend Europe, the IMF to help countries out of economic trouble, and a middle class that, if you were white, got the help it needed to own a home and go to college. And then it was over. Productivity growth stalled in the 1970s, and, at least in the United States, what economic growth there was overwhelmingly accrued to the top 1 percent in the 1980s and beyond. Part of this was due to Western workers having to compete with billions of Chinese, Indian, and Indonesian ones after the Berlin Wall came down. An even bigger part was good-paying jobs being automated into obsolescence. And the rest was policy--tax cuts for the rich, deunionization for the rest, and deregulation for Wall Street--which is why inflation-adjusted median incomes stagnated even more in the U.S. than in Europe. But it's not as if Trump only won the people who have been hit hard by technology and globalization. Sure, exit polls show that he did 16 percentage points better with people making $30,o00 or less than Romney did in 2012. But in general, Gallup economist Jonathan Rothwell has found, Trump supporters aren't any more likely to have come from places that have lost a lot of manufacturing jobs or have a lot of immigrants. The opposite, actually. Nor are they just people who are barely getting by. They tend to be a rung or two above that--decently middle class or more--who nonetheless might feel economically insecure because they haven't gotten a raise in a long time, and see everyone else around them doing even worse. Indeed, their towns are the ones where white people are dying younger than they used to due to the ongoing epidemic of suicides and drug overdoses. It's no surprise that these kind of economic grievances can ratchet up racial ones. After all, as Harvard economist Ben Friedman found in The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth, ""a rising standard of living for the clear majority of citizens more often than not fosters greater opportunity, tolerance of diversity, social mobility, commitment to fairness, and dedication to democracy."" So a stagnant one can make people meaner, less generous, and more suspicious of people who don't sound, look, or worship like they do. But it's important to point out that a weak economy isn't necessary for this kind of backlash. Any time white people--and really white men--feel like their position in society is being challenged in any way, this has happened. Like it did, for example, even when the economy was booming during the civil rights movement. Or, it turns out, when the country's share of immigrants got close to an all-time high this year. The fact is that a lot of white people don't like being around minorities who haven't assimilated, and they don't want to assimilate to a culture where they'll soon be a minority themselves. Harvard political scientist Ryan Enos, for one, found that even white liberals who aren't used to hearing Spanish in public became much more opposed to increased immigration and much less in favor of letting kids who were born here stay here if their parents were undocumented once they were exposed to Spanish-speakers during their morning commutes. Which seems to explain why, as the Wall Street Journal found, the counties that experienced the fastest minority growth between 2000 and today voted so heavily for Trump. His promises to keep Muslims out, kick Mexicans out, and, as his crowds will tell you, build the wall, are what a white majority that's scared of no longer being one want. As researchers Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson found, all you have to do is remind them that the country is on track to being majority-minority to make them endorse these kind of racially conservative policies. But it's not just minorities who white men are worried about. It's women too--or one woman in particular. That was clear enough if you listened to Trump's supporters. They weren't chanting that they wanted to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but rather that they wanted to ""Lock Her Up."" And in case you didn't get the message, they were wearing shirts emblazoned with ""Trump That Bitch,"" ""Hillary Sucks But Not Like Monica,"" and ""Don't Be A Pu**y, Vote For Trump."" Now, this isn't the only reason they hated Hillary Clinton so much--far from it--but it is part of the reason. There's still a socially-accepted hostility to women being in charge, a fear that this would make a man not a man, and a feeling that women shouldn't even try to act like men. Researchers Tyler Okimoto and Victoria Brescall found that people experienced ""moral outrage"" when they were told that a hypothetical female politician was ambitious, but nothing when they were told a male was. The last part is harder to quantify. It's that life at the end of history can get, well, kind of tedious. You get up, you go to work, you come home, you watch TV, you go to sleep, and then you repeat 20,000 times. For a lot of people, there is no great cause, no great conflict, no great meaning to it all. The big battles have already been won, and now there are just bills to pay and weekends to look forward to.  The problem with this, Fukuyama wrote, is that ""if men cannot struggle on behalf of a just cause because the just cause was victorious in an earlier generation, then they will struggle against the just cause."" There are hints of this reality TV-ification of our politics in the Trump supporter who admits he ""could be as bad as Hitler"" or the one who thinks Trump is actually ""a blend of Hitler and Hirohito."" What, they wonder, is the worst that could happen? Tune in tomorrow to find out! The answer, of course, is that the world as we've known it might cease to exist. From Turkey to Poland to Hungary, democratically-elected leaders who don't believe in liberal democracy have already consolidated power by curtailing the freedom of the press, the courts, and the opposition. Now that might happen here. Trump's threats to ""open up"" the libel laws, his attacks on a judge because of that judge's ethnic background, and his praise for Putin even when it's been pointed out to him that Putin has almost certainly been behind the murder of journalists and political opponents are something dark and new in our politics. And it's something that his supporters don't seem to mind. Earlier this the year, 84 percent of them said that ""what we need is a leader who will say or do anything to solve America's problems."" Constitutional conservatism this is not. It's not clear what is to be done. It's true that for almost 35 years now the liberal international order has failed to give rich world workers the rising standard of living they expect. Insofar as that was what was motivating Trump's supporters, we could redistribute more to try to make the economy work for everyone. But Europe already does that, and it hasn't stopped the rise of right-wing nationalists there. That's because they just blame immigrants for stealing benefits instead of stealing jobs. But insofar as Trump's voters were really driven by a fear of a future where white men are no longer politically, economically, and culturally dominant, there's nothing we should do. Some things should not be accommodated. It's possible that 2016 will be our own 1914. Not that we'll descend into a paroxysm of suicidal violence, but that a world that was defined by openness might give way to one that's not. For the last 70 years, liberal democracy has guaranteed people's individual rights, and the U.S. has guaranteed liberal democracy's right to exist. All of that is doubt now. What will President Trump do if Putin sends the tanks into Tallinn or Riga or Vilnius to ostensibly defend ethnic Russians against persecution? Or if North Korea threatens to overrun Seoul? Whatever its flaws, the liberal international order gave us peace and prosperity on a scale heretofore unknown in human history. And perhaps in our future too. History was better when it was over."

(Photo by Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: President-elect Donald Trump was right all along. He had a silent majority. The media, the pollsters and Republican elites never saw it - even though it was right in front of them the whole time. -- Because his adopted party maintained its majorities in the Senate and the House, Trump can now advance a very ambitious agenda. He gets to pick Antontin Scalia's replacement, vindicating Mitch McConnell's decision to deny Merrick Garland a hearing and ensuring that the GOP will control all three branches of government. Because Barack Obama has relied so much on executive actions since the 2010 midterms, if he chooses, Trump can roll back many of the president's signature achievements. The Republican Congress can also use budget reconciliation to eviscerate Obamacare. TPP is definitively dead. -- The reality TV star will be the first president in American history to take office without prior government or military experience. -- It's going to take some time for this new reality to fully sink in, but the question of the hour is: How the heck did this happen? What follows are several of the most plausible explanations... -- ""Confirmation bias"" is the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing theories. Since he came down that escalator at Trump Tower 17 months ago, many elites could never fully visualize Trump as the president of the United States. That made it very hard to see him winning the nomination - until he did - or winning the White House - until he did. Confirmation bias does not mean one preferred a particular outcome. Rather, it is a condition of psychology: All human beings tend to put a premium on information that validates their existing expectations and downplay new data points that undermine them. Even many members of the Republican establishment who supported Trump could never envision him prevailing. That meant that some very talented GOP operatives (who have won very big races) were insisting until late last night that the votes were not there for Trump. A Republican who won a statewide race in Florida two years ago texted after polls closed to say Clinton was going to win that state by four points. (Trump won 49 percent to 48 percent.) Another veteran Republican, who has served the Bush family in various roles, emailed in the wee hours of this morning: ""I no longer need to go to Rome. Going to watch an empire fall right here in the next four years."" -- That said, Trump's own internal models were wrong too. Staffers at the Republican National Committee were telling reporters that Trump would win 240 Electoral College votes. ""The best data inside the Trump campaign and the RNC had his chances of winning the presidency as a 1 in 5 proposition,"" Yahoo's Jon Ward reports.    Trump supporters rally in front of the White House. (Reuters/Joshua Roberts)   -- Looking back, there was so much anecdotal evidence: All those guys at the bar in a hollowed out Ohio steel town who did not know a single Clinton supporter. The two dozen independents at a Pirates-Reds baseball game in Pittsburgh who talked how much they love Bill but loathe Hillary. The conservatives in rural Selma, North Carolina, who said they stayed home four years ago but would vote for Trump. There were also so many red flags of lagging enthusiasm for Clinton: The paid canvasser for the Clinton campaign at The Ohio State University who could not find a single person to commit to support her during his shift in Columbus. The African Americans in Raleigh this past weekend who wanted to vote early and supported Clinton but gave up because the lines were too long. The North Carolina college students down the road who said they were probably going to vote for her - but also described her as a pathological liar. In Richmond, there were no yard signs for Clinton in places that were full of Obama signs four years ago. All these anecdotes should have received more weight vis-a-vis the polls, which were themselves based on assumptions about what the electorate would look like.    British Prime Minister David Cameron puts his arm around his wife Samantha after announcing his resignation at 10 Downing Street in London after the country voted to leave the E.U. (Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA via AP)   -- Trump's victory must be viewed as part of a global wave of reaction to immigration, trade and globalization. Donald has been calling himself ""Mr. Brexit"" in his stump speech for a while, drawing heavy parallels between the British vote to exit the European Union and his own campaign. Elites in Europe thought it was inconceivable that Brexit would happen - until it did. Also look at the rise of nationalists across continental Europe. Nigel Farage, the U.K. Independence Party member known for his strong support for Brexit, even came to the U.S. to campaign with Trump. ""2016 is going to be the year of two great political revolutions,"" Farage said on London television overnight.  I hand over the mantle to @RealDonaldTrump! Many congratulations. You have fought a brave campaign. pic.twitter.com/txD3RFMQ2l-- Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) November 9, 2016   The Clinton campaign, blinded by hubris, ridiculed and heavily pushed back on journalists who argued that Brexit showed Trump could win. To borrow a lyric from ""Hamilton"":  This disruption we've seen in Europe has made it's way across the ocean. #oceans rise, empires fall.-- amy walter (@amyewalter) November 9, 2016   -- 2016 truly was THE YEAR OF THE OUTSIDER - even more so than even 2008. Few elites in December 2014 believed that neither a Clinton nor Bush would be president in 2017. But there has been a ravenous hunger and deep thirst for change, even if that change agent is imperfect. (Only 38 percent of voters in the exit polls said Trump is qualified to be president - which means about one-fifth of Trump's voters did not think he was qualified but supported him anyway.)    Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, wearing a hat with the logo #newmajority, speaks in Louisville last night. (Timothy D. Easley/AP)   Exactly one year ago, Republican Matt Bevin won the Kentucky governor's race despite every single poll showing him down. Two of the top people on his campaign, Jason Miller and Jessica Ditto, worked for Trump this fall. Bevin had quixotically challenged Mitch McConnell in a 2014 primary and been crushed. But he prevailed in a three-way GOP primary just one year later, and then the millionaire businessman tapped into a coalition very similar to Trump's with a message that sounded a lot like his. A few months later, Jeb's shock and awe strategy failed. Money could not buy him the love of the voters. Hillary, who has been in the public eye over four decades and who has had a Secret Service detail for almost 25 years now, insisted during the primaries that she was not part of the Democratic establishment. No one, even her, actually believed that. The fact that a septuagenarian socialist from Vermont kept her sweating through the California primary in June should have set off even louder alarm bells than it did. The fact that Bernie won so many primaries in states dominated by conservative Democrats, such as West Virginia, also underscored the extent to which his appeal was really more about tapping into disaffection with the status quo than his far-left ideology. Evan Bayh led by more than 20 points in public and private polls when he first jumped into the Indiana Senate race this summer. The son of a onetime presidential candidate thought his surname and huge war chest - held over from 2010 - would allow him to easily get his old seat back. But Republicans defined him as a consummate D.C. insider who made millions as an influence peddler after leaving office. He lost by 10 points, a margin no one expected. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt narrowly survived after getting hammered for his fancy house in Washington and the fact that his wife and all his kids are lobbyists. Trump won Missouri by 19 points. Blunt won by just three points, underperforming the top of the ticket by 215,000 votes. If Trump had not fared quite so well, even Blunt advisers agree he would have gone down. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson won a shocking upset against challenger Russ Feingold by successfully presenting himself as the outsider in the race despite being the incumbent. It was a rematch of 2010, when the political neophyte had knocked off the three-termer. ""Obviously something is happening in this country,"" Feingold said in his concession speech. ""I'll be honest. I don't understand it completely.""    Rep. John Mica (R-Florida) gets a hug from his wife, Patrica, after conceding defeat to Democratic challenger Stephanie Murphy in Altamonte Springs last night. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP)   John Mica, the 12-term Republican congressman, fell in the Orlando suburbs. He based his campaign on his ability to bring home the bacon, highlighting earmarks and road projects that he facilitated as chairman of the House Transportation Committee. That did not resonate with voters in this environment. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who like Mica has been in office since 1992, went down in Phoenix. Trump won his county by four points, but Arpaio - despite being one of his most prominent early supporters -- lost by 10 points. Why? Voters were exhausted by all the drama associated with him and wanted a fresh face. ""There's a new sheriff in town,"" his challenger, Paul Penzone, said at his  victory party. North Carolina Republican Gov. Pat McCrory apparently went down, even as Trump carried his state and Sen. Richard Burr survived, because voters were angry about the so-called bathroom bill that he signed into law earlier this year.    FBI Director James Comey (Michael Reynolds/EPA)   -- James Comey deserves a significant share of credit/blame/responsibility, whichever word you want to use, for Clinton's loss. The percentage of likely voters who saw the former secretary of state as untrustworthy rose after the FBI director's bombshell announcement only 11 days before the election. Comey undercut Democratic enthusiasm, and his suggestion that the investigation into her would reopen motivated Republicans to fall in line. Democrats will forever more hate Comey, who contributed financially to John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, even though he tried to clean up the mess he created this past Sunday. But by then it was too late. Tens of millions of early votes had been cast, and his walk back received a fraction of the attention.  I asked D strategist close to Clinton WTF is going on. Response ""One word: Comey.""-- Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) November 9, 2016   -- Recalcitrant Republicans definitely came home in the final days. Trump won 88 percent of self-identified Republicans. He wound up doing better than expected in places like the Milwaukee suburbs, where there had been strong pockets of Never Trump resistance. He wound up garnering 60 percent of white men and 52 percent of white women, according to the exit polls. He even won college-educated whites! White evangelicals supported Trump by an 81 percent to 16 percent margin in the exit polls. Compare that to 2004, when George W. Bush pandered to this group by endorsing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and still only got 78 percent among this group. Maintaining control of the Supreme Court - with the long-term goal of overturning Roe v. Wade - was definitely one motivator. Trump's list of potential justices reassured many in this bloc who feared him. -- Trump's Rust Belt and rural strategies were smarter than he got credit for. He really ran up the score outside of urban areas everywhere. Florida, his second home, was always a pretty good fit. He wound up outperforming Romney in 51 counties. Clinton outperformed Obama in just seven.    John Podesta leaves the stage after telling people at the Javits Convention Center to go home early this morning. (Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images)   -- The Clinton campaign blew it. Top officials on the campaign became way too overconfident and complacent. They believed their own spin. They were measuring the drapes. They had too much confidence in their models, and they chastised anyone who doubted them as bedwetters. Hillary lost the primaries in Wisconsin and Michigan, but she invested little in shoring up her support there until the 11th hour. Her team clearly failed to see the race tightening in both places. -- Trump was helped in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by Republican Senate candidates running great campaigns. Ron Johnson campaigned with Trump. Pat Toomey avoided ever saying whether he'd vote for him or not. But both first-term incumbents invested heavily in get-out-the-vote efforts that wound up benefitting Trump. The Koch political network steered clear of the presidential but also invested massively in field programs to boost these down-ballot Republicans. Trump certainly helped both senators at the end of the day, but they also helped him.    Hillary Clinton acknowledges the crowd after delivering her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- Misogyny also remains alive and well in America. It would be intellectually dishonest to pretend that Clinton's gender did not work against her as she sought to break the ultimate glass ceiling. Women have never been elected to the top jobs in Ohio and Pennsylvania (governor or senator), and you cannot discount the reality that at least some voters in those places were uncomfortable with a woman as president. Especially in Pennsylvania, where Katie McGinty narrowly lost to Toomey. (Until 2014, Iowa - another Trump state - was also in this ignominious category.) -- History was actually always on Trump's side. One American University professor predicted a GOP victory  this way. The pendulum swings. America has a long history of replacing its presidents with someone who is temperamentally the opposite. The hot-headed and brash Trump is the un-Obama in almost every way. Obama, outwardly intellectual and cerebral, was perceived as the opposite of Bush 43, who went with his gut. He was seen as a reaction to Clinton, who was seen as a reaction to his father. Reagan was the un-Jimmy Carter. Nixon was the un-LBJ. Kennedy was the un-Eisenhower. Historian Arthur Schlesinger called this ""cyclical theory."" -- Just like in the 1930s, many Americans want to turn inward. The Republican coalition is not as hawkish as the neocons who have controlled the party. Elites freaked out about Trump saying the U.S. might not fulfill its obligations under the NATO charter. It's hard to imagine that cost him a single vote.    -- Some number of Americans were ashamed to tell pollsters that they supported Trump. Pollsters will have a lot of explaining to do. Speaking to reporters last night, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway (a pollster by training) said ""the undercover Trump vote"" was real. Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, both actors when they ran for governor of California, outperformed polls on Election Day for similar reasons. There was evidence during the cycle that Trump fared better in online polls and robopolls than live-caller polls because people felt more anonymous when disclosing their preference. Call it the reverse Bradley Effect.    Hillary and Bernie during a rally in Raleigh last Thursday night. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   IT IS TRUMP'S WASHINGTON NOW - WHAT'S NEXT? -- The Democratic Party is about to descend into full-scale civil war. It's going to get very ugly. Who is the head of The Democratic Party come Jan. 21? Just like Bush leaving office in 2009 created a vacuum that allowed for the rise of the tea party movement, Obama leaving office will do the same. Many supporters of Sanders who very reluctantly got onboard the Clinton bandwagon are going to take from yesterday's results that the Democratic Party must nominate an unapologetic and unabashed liberal in 2020. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are going to have a whole lot more juice than they would have had Clinton won. There is also no obvious frontrunner for the nomination four years from now - which could mean an especially nasty primary contest. The grassroots of the party will clamor for someone that really excites the left. Indeed, Clinton's palpable enthusiasm problem cannot be overlooked. Her public image has taken a beating for years, and the protracted attacks took a toll. ""It's not the same as Obama,"" a 55-year old Clinton supporter told the Boston Globe's Annie Linskey while he waited around at Clinton's ""party"" last night. ""Obama was like a new car coming off the boat. This year you're buying a used car where you know all the problems."" Again, this quote comes from someone who was at Clinton's own party...  -- But Trump's victory may also be Pyrrhic. If he governs as he's campaigned - if he tries to build the wall, if he blocks Muslims from entering the country, etc., etc., etc. - he may relegate Republicans to long-term minority status. People talk a lot about the lessons of Proposition 187 in California in 1994, which denied public services to undocumented immigrants and which Republican Gov. Pete Wilson latched onto to boost his reelection bid. What people forget is that Prop 187 passed and Wilson won. The Republican Party has just never recovered in the Golden State. On the other hand, Trump has no clear ideology - only a belief in his own ability to solve problems. He could surprise a lot of people by being a pragmatist who cuts deals with fellow New Yorker Chuck Schumer, to the great chagrin of his base.

The President will make a statement on Wednesday at the White House to discuss the election results and what steps we can take as a country to come together after this hard-fought election season. The President invited the President-elect to meet with him at the White House on Thursday, November 10th, to update him on the transition planning his team has been working on for nearly a year. Ensuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the President identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the President-elect is the next step."" -- Trump addressed supporters in New York shortly before 3 a.m., sounding a magnanimous note for reconciliation after Clinton called him to concede. From Karen Tumulty, Philip Rucker and Anne Gearan: ""Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country,"" Trump said. ""I mean that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. We have to get together. To all Republicans, Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people."" Under his administration, he said, ""America will no longer settle for anything less than the best."" And he promised foreign countries that ""while we were always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone,"" adding: ""We will seek common ground, not hostility."" He also thanked Melania and his children for their patience, saying, ""This was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough.""

It marks a repudiation of the status quo of failed liberal progressive policies,"" Ryan said.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)   -- A very different scene played out inside the Javits Center, where the ""once-jovial atmosphere"" grew darker and darker as the night wore on. ""Senior Clinton aides, who had been circulating among the press risers, had long since disappeared and stopped answering their phones. The only Clinton staff in evidence as the 11 o'clock hour approached were fairly junior aides, looking nervous and uncertain. By midnight, supporters were streaming out the exits. Many of those who remained were in tears. 'I'm actually speechless right now,' said a dejected Julia Beatty, 38, who left the Javits Center with her Clinton sticker peeling off her leather jacket. 'I just want to make it safely uptown so I can sob into a glass of wine.'"" -- Hundreds of Clinton supporters who had gathered outside the White House to celebrate her victory stood in stunned silence as poll results began coming in. Here's the vantage point of one: ""Minister Carol Kelly, 64, and seminary student Bettina Hindes, came to Lafayette Park to help sing in what they thought would be a new Democratic regime. Their excitement quickly turned into depression. They sang along with the Avaaz activists -- songs like 'God Bless America.' The hymns sounded more funereal than celebratory, however ... Kelly, who is from College Park, said she had expected to 'put this polarizing election behind us and move toward progress' after the voting. 'But I'm concerned if Trump is president we won't get that. He's so divisive,' Kelly said. ""It is so disheartening ... It's time to head home.'"" (T. Rees Shapiro, Arelis R.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank more than 100 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped over 200 points.

Meanwhile, the Mexican peso nosedived to an eight-year low."" -- ""The possibility of a Trump victory makes investors anxious for a couple of reasons,"" Max Ehrenfreund explains: ""For one, investors are unsure of what, exactly, Trump would do if elected, since he wavered between various economic policies on the campaign trail. Moody Analytics' Mark Zandi predicts if Trump were able to implement his agenda in full, the economy would enter a two-year recession and see unemployment rates spike to 7.4 percent.  Another cause for concern among economists is Trump's proposal for heavy tariffs on goods imported from China and Mexico, reducing spending and slowing down the U.S. economy overall.""    Russian President Vladimir Putin celebrates Trump's victory this morning in the Kremlin. (Sputnik)   THE WORLD RESPONDS: -- Vladimir Putin congratulated Trump, expressing his ""hope to work together for removing Russian-American relations from their crisis state"" in a telegram. Members of the largely pro-Kremlin house of parliament reportedly broke into applause after his victory. (AP) -- The world gasped in collective disbelief after Trump's victory on Wednesday, with apprehensive allies seeking to put a brave face on a result they had dreaded and American adversaries exulting in an outcome they see as a potential turning point in global affairs, Simon Denyer and Griff Witte report. ""Within minutes of Trump's triumph, congratulatory messages to the Republican nominee poured in from leaders around the world, both friend and foe alike ... But beneath the assurances was a deep anxiety that Trump's win could unsettle the global order. The terms 'shock' and 'nightmare,' which were trending on Twitter in Germany, appeared to reflect the sentiment among many observers and politicians in Berlin. Concerns were also sharp in Brussels, the headquarters of NATO and the European Union, where Trump had been universally opposed, as well as in key Asian strategic allies such as Japan and South Korea. But China's state media chortled at how the elections revealed the decline of American democracy. ""The probably most divisive and scandalous election in American history has eroded voters' faith in the two-party system, as many voters called it a game of money, power, and influence,"" wrote state-run news agency Xinhua."" -- France's National Front party leader Marine Le Pen warmly congratulated Trump on Wednesday, ""Congratulations to the new president of the United States Donald Trump and to the free American people!"" she said on Twitter. France's National Front has been building support for its anti-immigration, anti-European Union stance in recent years, Reuters notes. -- The Vatican's secretary of state cardinal wished Trump well, saying he would pray for the new incumbent to be ""enlightened."" ""We pledge to pray that God enlightens him and supports him in the service of his country of course, but also in the service of wellbeing and peace in the world,"" Pietro Parolin said. ""I think today everyone needs to work to change the global situation, which is one of deep laceration and serious conflict."" (Reuters) -- ""Canada has no closer friend, partner, and ally than the United States,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement. ""We look forward to working very closely with President-elect Trump, his administration, and with the United States Congress in the years ahead, including on issues such as trade, investment, and international peace and security. -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump, calling him a ""true friend of Israel"": ""I am confident that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights,"" he said in a statement. -- ""A Trump foreign policy, based on his statements, will bring an intense 'realist' focus on U.S. national interests and a rejection of costly U.S. engagements abroad,"" Post foreign affairs columnist David Ignatius writes. ""It will likely bring these changes"":  A move to improve relations with Russia: Trump stressed repeatedly during the campaign, at some political cost, that he would work with President Vladimir Putin.

A new push for European allies to pay more for their own defense: ""It's unlikely that Trump will dismantle NATO, as critics charged during the campaign.

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio acknowledges the cheers from supporters after winning a second term in office. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)   IT WAS THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR DOWN-BALLOT REPUBLICANS-- IN THE SENATE: -- Only Mark Kirk went down in Illinois, to Tammy Duckworth.  -- Kelly Ayotte is clinging to a 1,500 vote lead in New Hampshire against Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, with 93 percent of votes counted.  -- Pat Toomey won the most expensive Senate race ever in Pennsylvania.  -- Richard Burr survived in North Carolina, running slightly ahead of Deborah Ross.  -- Roy Blunt narrowly survived because Trump ran so strong in Missouri. -- John McCain coasted in Arizona. -- Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto will succeed Hary Reid in Nevada, becoming the first Latina senator ever. -- Kamala Harris, an African American woman, easily won the race to succeed Barbara Boxer in California.  AND IN THE HOUSE: -- Republicans also maintained a comfortable majority, poised to lose only a handful of seats that fall far below the double-digit losses predicted by some. From Mike DeBonis: ""Democrats seized four redrawn, GOP-held districts in Florida and Virginia and ousted incumbents in a few more. But they could not unseat Republicans in key districts across the country, including suburban seats that they thought they could win easily with Trump on the ticket. In the Northern Virginia suburbs, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) fended off a strong challenge that generated $6 million in television spending in the past week alone. Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R) handily won a Miami-area district that Democrats targeted for months. And Rep. Mike Coffman (R) was able to separate himself from Trump in a diverse pocket of the Denver suburbs."" -- Democrats edged out victories in a few districts: ""Reps. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.) and Bob Dold (R-Ill.) lost, and Democrats claimed a pair of GOP-held seats in Nevada. In New Hampshire's first district, Democrat Carol Shea-Porter defeated Republican incumbent Frank Guinta. But they struck out in many more."" EXIT POLL BREAKDOWN: -- ""The composition of the 2016 electorate was similar to that of the 2012 voting population. But Trump was performing exceptionally well among white voters, while Clinton was doing less well among nonwhite voters than [Obama] did four years ago,"" per Rosalind S. Helderman, Philip Bump and Scott Clement. ""In general, a pattern appeared to be taking hold across a number of key battleground states late Tuesday: In places where Obama won, Clinton appeared to be winning as well -- but often by significantly less. Where Romney won, Trump won, too -- but his margins were much bigger."" Among nonwhite voters, Clinton led Trump by 54 points -- a whopping advantage, but less than Obama's 61-point lead four years ago. -- Across Florida, in counties that were under 60 percent white, Clinton was performing about 2.5 percentage points worse than Obama and Trump was doing a bit less than a percentage point better than Romney. ""In counties that are three-quarters white, Clinton was down 4.8 points versus the president and Trump up 3.1 points,"" Philip Bump notes. ""And preliminary exit poll data shows that Trump got about as much support from Republicans as Clinton did from Democrats -- not atypical for a presidential candidate, but something that seemed to be unlikely even a few weeks ago. Those same exit polls also suggest that Clinton's margin among nonwhite voters was a little over 50 points, down from the 61-point margin Obama enjoyed in 2012. These margins are friendlier to Trump than they were expected to be.""  -- There was a dramatic shift in party support at nearly every income level: ""Historically, lower-income voters have tended to support Democrats, and wealthier voters leaned more Republican. But income correlates with education, which strongly divided voters this cycle,"" NYT analysts noted.    Trump supporters cheer during the election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)    MORE ON HOW TRUMP DID IT: -- ""How Trump won: The insiders tell their story,"" In four dozen interviews over the course of this year's presidential campaign, Dan Balz and Philip Rucker chronicle Trump's rise to success: ""By the spring of this year, it was clear that Americans were heading into one of the ugliest, most consequential and often bizarre presidential campaigns in memory. Donald Trump would become the improbable Republican nominee, and Democrat Hillary Clinton the first woman to head a major-party ticket. Their clash challenged Americans to confront divisions over race, gender, ideology and our very national identity. This is how the race unfolded, as retold by the people who lived it. This oral history is based on four dozen on-the-record interviews with campaign advisers and other key players, conducted during the final two weeks."" --""Rejected by the elites from the very start of his career as a real estate developer in Manhattan in the 1970s, Trump had a lifetime of resentments that he had reacted to with searing attacks against his enemies and often-successful revenge plays against those who believed they were better than he,"" says The Post's Marc Fisher. ""The big real estate developer families in New York had long sneered at Trump as a brash, nasty, nouveau riche intruder on a business that took pride in doing things quietly and diplomatically. The banks treated him like an out-of-control adolescent who needed to be reined in and taught a lesson. The politicians humored him, then scrambled to be by his side to catch some of his reflected fame. Trump beat them all back, again and again, by appealing to the people, his customers, his admirers. On Tuesday, he reached [the] final step in a half-century-long ascent. What he plans to do with his newfound power, even he does not know: ""Asked earlier this year if he has spent much time preparing to actually be president, Trump admitted that his focus had been solely on the campaign. 'I'm all about the hunt and the chase,' he said. 'When I get something I really wanted, I sometimes lose interest in it.' Trump has 73 days until his inauguration."" -- ""How the stampede for big money enabled Donald Trump's rise,"" by Matea Gold: ""The hunt for big dollars began in January 2015 outside Palm Springs, Calif. ... [where] the emerging crop of Republican presidential candidates jockeyed to impress the millionaires and billionaires who make up the Koch political network.  In the end, there would be plenty of big checks to go around. And rich benefactors, it turned out, would have a limited ability to keep their chosen candidates aloft. But the all-consuming pursuit of mega-donors had a deeper, more fundamental effect on the 2016 presidential race. The magnet of six- and seven-figure contributions tugged at the early White House front-runners in both parties, reshaping their political strategies and their early priorities. It drew them away from the campaign trail, leaving them vulnerable to the fiercely populist mood gripping voters -- and to a candidate on the GOP side, Donald Trump, uniquely positioned to harness that anger ..."" -- ""What Trump has done is nothing short of cataclysmic,"" Chris Cillizza writes. ""He has fundamentally reshaped the political map. He has broken the Republican Party into pieces -- and its shards still remain scattered everywhere. He has proven that the political polling and punditry industries need a deep re-examination. But, even more than all that, Trump's victory reveals that many of the assumptions that people have long made about who we are as a country and what we want out of our politicians, our political system and each other are, frankly, wrong."" ""Trump's candidacy was premised on the idea that everyone -- politicians, reporters, corporations -- is lying to you, and lying to you to to feather their own nests,"" Chris adds. It was a Holden Caulfield campaign: Everyone, except Trump and his supporters, were phonies. In short: Trump played on the deep alienation and anxiety coursing through the country. A prevailing sense that things were so screwed up that radical change -- and make no mistake that is what Trump cast himself as in this contest -- was the only option left. How Trump happened then, while remarkable, can be understood and analyzed. What Trump will do as president is a far more difficult question to answer."" -- ""Big elections are supposed to help settle some of (the big) disputes, or at least point a direction for the new leader,"" Balz writes. ""Yet, as the campaign ended Tuesday, the question remained as to what had been resolved, if anything. Everyone knew the campaign was unlike anything they had seen in the past. Everyone wanted it to end. Now it falls to Trump, the unlikely winner of the most traumatic election in memory, to chart the course ahead and try, if he can, to prove that he can lift the whole country out of its morass and make Washington work."" -- ""Usually elections bring a measure of closure ... [But] you wonder if anyone will even bother this time,"" Mark Leibovich writes in the Times. ""At the very least, I'll offer a small proposal, take it or leave it. Maybe the purest act of patriotism involves well-meaning citizens redoubling their efforts at being respectful, compassionate and decent in their everyday lives. It's what we can control, after all, our small gift to democracy, beyond all the noise and fallout that our politics inflicted in 2016. We toast to our endurance and maybe our resilience, too. We survived the rough trip to Nov. 8, and now we unpack.""   -- ""The new president will face immense and unrelenting challenges from Day One,"" The Post's Editorial Board writes. ""He inherits a world in which liberal democracy is in retreat and U.S. leadership is doubted. The Middle East is in turmoil, North Korea's nuclear arsenal is growing, Russia and China are flexing their muscles. At home, President Obama bequeaths an economy in generally good health but facing problems: slow growth, stubborn inequality, long-term stress on the federal budget. ... Americans are not and have never been united by blood or creed, but by allegiance to a democratic system of government that shares power, cherishes the rule of law and respects the dignity of individuals. We hope our newly elected president will show respect for that system. Americans must stand ready to support him if he does, and to support the system whether he does or does not."" -- ""Baker Melissa Alt showed up unbidden at Trump Tower on Election Day with a 40-pound cake in the form of a Donald Trump bust ... But there was something wrong with the chocolate confection,"" Dana Milbank writes. ""Alt was aiming to reproduce Trump's pout, but she wound up making him look startled and sad. After Tuesday night, that's the exact expression worn by tens of millions of Americans and countless more across the globe. When [John Podesta] appeared ... on the Fox News screens in the room to say Clinton wasn't yet conceding, Trump's supporters punched fists in the air and raised middle fingers at the screens. More cases of beer were wheeled in. Next to the bar, the Trump cake still looked worried. Maybe the human Trump should worry, too. He stirred up racial and religious hatred and stoked gender and class resentments, validated conspiracy theorists and the racist alt-right, employed a vast oeuvre of untruths and promised followers an unachievable agenda. How does he govern now?"" -- ""On Saturdays in synagogues across the United States, Jews recite a prayer for our country. In my synagogue, the custom is that the congregation stands, and says the prayer in unison,"" Post columnist Ruth Marcus writes. ""Until [Trump's] run for the presidency, this moment in the liturgy felt like boilerplate. It was a nice expression of patriotism; certainly, in the edgy days after Sept. 11, our country felt in need of joint and fervent prayer. But its exhortations to justice and tolerance seemed superfluous. No one could disagree with them. Until Trump, and Trump's divisive rhetoric, upended the assumption that politicians of both parties share an essential platform of agreement on matters of basic decency, of respect for those of other religions and backgrounds ... And until Trump's election made the prayer for our country all the more relevant -- and all the more imperative.""    Mike Voss high-fives Jim Geldrich as they hear a television report projecting Trump winning Wisconsin in West Bend, Wis. (John Ehlke/West Bend Daily News via AP)   COVERAGE FROM THE BATTLEGROUNDS: -- ""Trump's victory in Wisconsin makes him the first Republican since 1984 to carry the state,"" the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel's Craig Gilbert writes. ""According to exit polls, 63% of voters [view him unfavorably]. But 21% of those voters who dislike him still voted for him -- a testament to their hunger to shake things up."" White, blue-collar voters made up the demographic core of Trump's support, supporting him by far larger margins (31 points) than Romney in 2012 (8 points.)  ""The most staggering divide Tuesday was the one between white college women (Clinton won them by 21 points) and white non-college men (Trump won them by 44 points). That gap was twice as big as it was in the 2012 presidential race. Trump also won rural voters by 29 points -- far more than Romney four years ago, capturing a long list of small counties that [Obama] won in both of his elections. -- ""Across [Iowa], election returns suggest Trump comfortably carried Republican areas while making significant gains in toss-up counties and places where Democrats previously ran up meaningful margins,"" the Des Moines Register's Jason Noble writes. ""Clinton won the state's urban centers but badly underperformed Obama's victories in 2012 ... [Meanwhile], Trump nearly won in Scott County -- the county containing Iowa's Quad Cities that Obama won by almost 14 percentage points four years ago. Trump cruised to victory in Des Moines County -- a Mississippi River county encompassing the old industrial city of Burlington that Obama won by better than 18 points in 2012. It was a similar story in Jasper County, a blue-collar county that Obama carried by more than 7 percentage points.In Iowa's five northwestern-most counties, the state's social-conservative heartland where Republicans routinely win with 70 percent of the vote or better, Trump outpaced the party's 2012 showing. -- Trump's Florida victory was a ""microcosm"" of what unfolded nationwide. From Politico's Marc Caputo: ""Despite losing big to Clinton in diverse, urban areas of south Florida, Trump dominated in every other corner of the state and outperformed past Republican candidates with older, white and blue collar voters. Despite [Clinton's] large margins in Miami/Dade County and Broward County, Trump ran up the score elsewhere in the state -- from the Deep South Panhandle to the interior of Florida to peninsula's southwest, a bastion of working-class whites and retirees from the Midwest. ... By the end of the night, Trump's lead was so big that, even if turnout in Florida was modeled at 80 percent - far higher than recent elections - Clinton would still not win if she beat Trump by double digits.""  -- The Raleigh News and Observer's Tim Funk: ""The polls that forecast a close race and the targeted wooing by the candidates and their campaigns were testaments to the fact that North Carolina is a rapidly changing state - demographically and politically. But North Carolina was a sea of Republican red as Trump carried virtually all of the suburban and rural counties outside the state's big cities, including some that [Obama] won in 2012.""

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   LET THE MEDIA CRITICISM BEGIN: -- ""To put it bluntly, the media missed the story,"" Post columnist Margaret Sullivan writes. ""In the end, a huge number of American voters wanted something different. And although these voters shouted and screamed it, most journalists just weren't listening. They didn't get it. They didn't get that the huge, enthusiastic crowds at [Trump's] rallies would really translate into that many votes. They couldn't believe that the America they knew could embrace someone who mocked a disabled man, bragged about sexually assaulting women, and spouted misogyny, racism and anti-Semitism. It would be too horrible. ... Trump -- who called journalists scum and corrupt -- alienated us so much that we couldn't see what was before our eyes. We just kept checking our favorite prognosticating sites, and feeling reassured, even though everyone knows that poll results are not votes. Make no mistake. This is an epic fail. And although eating crow is never appealing, we'll be digesting feathers and beaks in the next weeks and months -- and maybe years. The strange thing, of course, is that the media helped to give Trump his chance."" ... Except for a handful of fringe-right news outlets that, at all odds, had correctly predicted the movement all along. From Paul Farhi: ""Election Day began hopefully for the clarions of the right, the conservative media outlets that have championed Trump's long-shot candidacy for months and hated on Hillary Clinton for years. ""Trump could win, they said. Trump would win, they asserted -- a breast-beating prediction with more than a little vested interest behind it. A Trump victory, after all, would boost the prestige and profile of the conservative media and make de facto establishment figures out of some of its leading journalists. And slowly at first, the poll- defying assertions began to seem like prescience as the evening wore on."" -- The Huffington Post ended its editor's note calling Trump a ""serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther"" that for months had accompanied every Trump article posted on the site. A staff note note from Huffpost's Washington Bureau Chief Ryan Grim on Tuesday evening said the decision to remove the note was for a ""clean slate"". ""The thinking is that (assuming he wins) that he's now president and we're going to start with a clean slate,"" Grim said. ""If he governs in a racist, misogynistic way, we reserve the right to add it back on. This would be giving respect to the office of the presidency which Trump and his backers never did.""

But in the American context he is like nothing we have seen before -- a shatterer of all norms and conventional assumptions, a man more likely to fail catastrophically than other presidents, more constitutionally dangerous than other presidents, but also more likely to carry us into a different political era, a post-neoliberal, post-end-of-history politics, than any other imaginable president. I retract none of the warnings that I issued about the likelihood of catastrophe and crisis on his watch. But he will be our president ... So we must hope that he has the wit to be more than a wrecker, more than a demagogue, and that his crude genius can actually be turned, somehow, to the common good. And if that hope is dashed, we must find ways to resist him -- all of us, right and left, in the new chapter of American history that has opened very unexpectedly tonight."" -- ""It's 2009 all over again. Except this time Republicans are in charge and Democrats have been run over,"" Politico's John Bresnahan and John Burgess Everett write. ""Tuesday's astonishing victory means everything's on the table for Republicans: Tilting the Supreme Court in a conservative direction for years to come, repealing Obamacare, overhauling the tax code, boosting defense spending, tearing up trade deals and cutting regulations. Some of this Republicans will be able to do under 'reconciliation,' the special parliamentary procedure that Democrats used to enact the Affordable Care Act on a party line vote in 2010. Now Republicans can 'reverse engineer' Obamacare with Democrats powerless to stop it. Tax reform, another GOP dream dashed during the Obama years, could also happen under this process. Republicans are looking at an open-ended opportunity next year to reshape American policy across an array of issue areas and the Supreme Court, with a vacancy ready to be filled due to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's blockade of [Merrick Garland].
