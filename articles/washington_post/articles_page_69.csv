(AP Photo/A&E, Zach Dilgard)  After 11 seasons, filled with beards, camo and controversy, the cast of A&E's popular reality television show ""Duck Dynasty"" announced Wednesday night during its season premiere that this one would be their last. ""We've got an unbelievable announcement for y'all,"" Uncle Si Robertson says enthusiastically to the camera. ""After five years, we've decided as a family for this to be the final chapter of the 'Duck Dynasty' series,"" one of the Robertson brothers, Jase, continues. ""May God bless each and every one of you,"" Si Robertson says in closing. The family, all 21 of them, let out a resounding ""Yay!""   SPOILER ALERT: The Robertsons made a big quacking announcement. Join your #DuckDynasty family for new episodes Wednesdays at 9/8c on @AETV. pic.twitter.com/uw7Ei0y3xL -- Duck Dynasty (@DuckDynastyAE) November 17, 2016   The show chronicles the lives of Willie Robertson and his brothers, Jase, Jep and Alan; their wives; their parents, Phil and Miss Kay; and Uncle Si as they run their highly successful Duck Commander duck-call business in rural Louisiana. Although it debuted as a reality television hit, raking in record numbers in its infancy, ""Duck Dynasty"" has suffered in recent years from a decline in viewership, probably brought on, in part, from a widely reported controversy that forced A&E to briefly suspend Phil. In an interview with GQ magazine in 2013, the year after the show debuted, the Robertson family patriarch made unsavory comments about homosexuality, women and race relations. As Washington Post reporter Emily Yahr wrote at the time: It all started when Robertson -- a 67-year-old self-proclaimed ""Bible thumper"" -- was asked by the magazine what he considered sinful. He responded, ""Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."" There were some other crude remarks about why he prefers women and on race relations in the Jim Crow South. Reaction was swift and loud. The NAACP expressed outrage. Gay rights groups called for A&E to condemn their star for his ""vile"" comments. The network went one step further: Executives announced late Wednesday that Robertson would be suspended from filming ""indefinitely."" Fans defended Robertson in the name of free speech, among them Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), who said, ""It is a messed-up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended."" But the suspension did not last long. After the Robertson family said that Phil's remarks were expressions of his faith and that they could not ""imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm,"" A&E reversed course a week after the announced suspension. ""After discussions with the Robertson family, as well as consulting with numerous advocacy groups, A&E has decided to resume filming 'Duck Dynasty' later this spring with the entire Robertson family,"" the network said in a statement. After the controversy, ratings fell steadily, but the show remained popular among die-hard fans. The Robertson family managed build an entire empire out of the show's success -- clothes, hunting gear, a holiday CD, books and even a spot on America's political stage.    Phil Robertson heads the family dinner on A&E's ""Duck Dynasty.""  This year, at the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump, also a reality-show star, invited Willie Robertson to lead off the opening night. He wore his signature beard and an American flag bandanna and took on one of the businessman's favorite targets, one the now-president-elect has continued to attack on Twitter: the media. ""It's been a rough year for the media experts,"" Robertson said at the convention. ""It must be humbling to be so wrong about so much for so long. But I have a theory about why they missed the Trump train. They don't hang out with regular folks like us, who like to hunt and fish and pray and actually work for a living. Heck, I don't even know that they know how to talk to people from middle America. I mean, when I tell 'em I'm from Louisiana, they really start talking real slow and real loud.""    Willie Robertson, star of the television show ""Duck Dynasty,"" speaks at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, on July 18, 2016. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)  And the embattled patriarch, Phil Robertson, got political himself, endorsing presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in an official campaign video nearly a year ago. ""My qualifications for president of the United States are rather narrow. Is he or she godly, does he or she love us, can he or she do the job, and finally, would they kill a duck and put him in a pot and make him a good duck gumbo?"" Robertson asks in the ad video. ""I've looked at the candidates. Ted Cruz is my man. He fits the bill. He's godly, he loves us, he's the man for the job, and he will go duck hunting because today we're going,"" Robertson said. The ad then cuts to a frame of the two men shooting. In their announcement Wednesday night, the Robertson family said that fans can expect to see them in some holiday specials. A spinoff series, ""Going Si-Ral,"" launched Wednesday and features uncle Si and Willie Robertson analyzing viral videos and online trends, Us Weekly reported. Season 11 of ""Duck Dynasty"" runs through Jan. 18, and the show will return in March for seven final episodes. https://twitter.com/bosshogswife/status/799085933115179008 More from Morning Mix:  Ala. man sentenced for murdering daughter's sexual abuser 13 years after his prison release.

There is a crisis of identity. Donald Trump now leads a coalition including the Republican establishment -- and people who despise the Republican establishment. The insurgent president-elect -- lacking relevant experience, adequate personnel and actual policy proposals -- cannot exercise power without the help of those he ridiculed.   Trump has chosen to incorporate this conflict into the structure of the West Wing. His chief of staff, Reince Priebus, was the sponsor of the 2013 Republican autopsy report, which called on the party to accommodate America's multicultural future. Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K.    Bannon, has made a career out of resisting that future. This is less a team of rivals than an ideological cage fight.  Every good presidential transition should involve betraying a few of your friends. Not everyone who helps a president become president is fit to help him govern. Bannon -- whose Breitbart News invited the alt-right into the conservative mainstream and who has made a business model out of spreading conspiratorial nonsense -- belongs in this category, along with Sarah Palin, Rudy Giuliani, Corey Lewandowski and the rest of the distracting campaign sideshow.  For the Republican Party, this is also a governing crisis. Trump won office promising to undo globalization, bring back manufacturing jobs and fulfill ""every dream you ever dreamed."" So expectations are pretty high. But Trumpism, for the most part, consists of cultural signals and symbolic goals, not a set of developed proposals.      President-elect Donald Trump announced Nov. 13 that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and former head of Breitbart News Stephen Bannon will be taking senior positions in Trump's White House. (Reuters)   Many Republican members of Congress are frankly confused. Are they supposed to follow Trump's lead or supply his agenda? He has embraced massive infrastructure investment, but there is no favored bill or detailed plan. Obamacare must go, but what approach to ""replace"" does Trump prefer? House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) is pushing for tax reform. Does the president-elect have any interest in the topic at all? The biggest frustration reported by Republicans who have met with Trump is his inability to focus for any period of time. He is impatient with facts and charts and he changes the subject every few minutes. Republican leaders need policy leadership -- or permission to provide it themselves.  One area where the agenda is unifying and well-developed concerns the reversal of Obama-era executive orders. Republican lawyers have spent the past year and a half working in study groups on reversal language in order to be ready on the first day of a GOP presidency. The action most likely to cause controversy would overturn President Obama's limited amnesty for students brought illegally to the United States as children. Most Republicans think that executive order was illegal; but most Americans will probably find the victims of reversing the order to be sympathetic.  This hints at the long-term political crisis faced by the triumphant GOP. Trump won the presidency in a manner that undermines the GOP's electoral future. He demonstrated that the ""coalition of the ascendant"" -- including minorities, millennials and the college-educated -- is not yet ascendant. But in a nation where over half of children under 5 years old are racial or ethnic minorities, it eventually will be. Trump was elected by a 70 percent white electorate. But that was about two percentage points lower than in the 2012 election -- and that number has been dropping by about two points each presidential election for decades. Trump's white-turnout strategy is not the wave of the future; it is the last gasp of an old and disturbing electoral approach.  The final crisis faced by the GOP -- and just about everyone else -- relates to the quality of our political culture. Trump won office in a way that damaged our democracy. He fed resentment against minorities, promised to jail his opponent and turned shallow invective into an art form. If he governs as he campaigned, Trump will smash the unity of our country into a thousand shards of bitterness. We should hope that the president-elect will be sobered by the responsibilities of high office and discovers hidden resources of charity (even though malice has been the habit of a lifetime). He deserves the space at least to try. But Republicans may end up depending on a younger generation of leaders -- Ryan, Ben Sasse, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Jeff Flake, Marco Rubio -- to demonstrate the possibility of unifying aspiration and civil disagreement. And that would lay the foundation for a lasting and honorable victory.  Read more from Michael Gerson's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .

"   DEMOCRATS ARE licking their wounds, arguing about what or whom to blame and opening a fight over who should next lead the party. That's normal after losing the presidency, both chambers of Congress and all but 15 governorships. They also are beginning to argue about what the party should stand for. That, too, is normal -- and potentially healthy. The country will be better off if it has a vibrant, left-of-center party making the case for progressive views. But what does it mean to be progressive? We don't propose to lay out an agenda here -- this is a debate that will and should go on for months, hopefully drawing on new ideas and up-and-coming leaders, and we expect to return to it often. We would, though, like to suggest that in some key areas, the people who are defining themselves as the progressive wing of the Democratic Party -- identified with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) -- are embracing principles that are not genuinely progressive. Specifically: They want to enlarge government entitlements and hand out the benefits as broadly as possible -- free college, free health care, expanded Social Security -- regardless of need or available resources. They emphasize redistribution over growth. And their ostensible protection of American workers leaves no room to consider the welfare of poor people elsewhere in the world. On all three counts, we think that the higher moral ground and the smarter policy lie elsewhere. Take free college, a key plank of Mr. Sanders's presidential campaign. Generally two arguments are offered for making such a benefit universal. One is political: If everyone gets a benefit, everyone will press Congress or state legislatures to keep funding it. The other is moral: This is something society should do. We don't make the wealthy pay tuition for high school; why should college be any different?  Our answer -- we would argue, the progressive answer -- is that there are people in society with far greater needs than that upper-middle-class family in Fairfax County that would be relieved of its tuition burden at the College of William & Mary if Mr. Sanders got his wish. In an era of constrained resources, is the nation serious about helping the ""left-behinds"" in small-town America, whose plight President-elect Donald Trump supposedly championed? How about the mothers and children who remain trapped in multi-generational poverty in our biggest cities? Government programs should benefit those who most need the hand up. The same is true of Social Security. You can expand benefits for everyone, as Ms. Warren favors. Prosperous retirees who live mostly off their well-padded 401(k)s will appreciate what to them will feel like a small bonus, if they notice it. But spreading wealth that way will make it harder to find the resources for the vulnerable elderly who truly depend on Social Security. Here we pause for a moment of preventive self-defense, because the fiscal argument is easy to caricature. When we say that resources are constrained, we are not arguing that the budget has to be balanced tomorrow. We are not arguing against investments in infrastructure, education and research -- all of which we favor. But demographics -- the aging of the population -- cannot be wished away. In the 1960s, about five taxpayers were helping to support each Social Security recipient, and the economy was growing about 6 percent annually. Today there are fewer than three workers for each pensioner, and the growth rate even following the 2008 recession has averaged about 2 percent . On current trends, 10 years from now the federal government will be spending almost all its money on Medicare, Social Security and other entitlements and on interest payments on the debt, leaving less and less for schools, housing and job training. There is nothing progressive about that.  That is one reason we say that economic growth is also a progressive goal. It's not a sufficient goal; growth must be shared, not vacuumed up by the top 1 percent. It's not in conflict with the goal of redistribution; there's reason to think that inequality can retard growth. But over the course of U.S. history, economic growth has been key to the rising prosperity of all Americans. What does that mean for policy? Can government spur growth, and if so, how? That is a fraught debate. At a minimum, though, a progressive should favor growth, think twice before vilifying business as a whole and consider the effect on jobs when advocating additional regulations.  Finally, when true progressives think about trade and the world, they ought to keep in mind a statistic that President Obama cited in his final address to the U.N. General Assembly: The share of people living in extreme poverty in the world fell over the past quarter-century from 40 percent to under 10 percent. That's an astounding achievement for human progress, unique in world history, taking place even as global population grew -- and mostly thanks to the globalization of the economy. That trend is good for Americans, economically, because it gives them markets to sell into. But the decrease in human misery also should be celebrated for its own sake.  We understand the political challenges underlying these arguments. Mr. Trump campaigned on proposals that would grow the federal debt far more than any Democrat's program, and his benefits would be targeted -- to the wealthy. His proposals on trade would be far more destructive. In opposing every government program and regulation as a job-killer -- including, wrongly, Obamacare -- the Republicans make a rational discussion of trade-offs almost impossible. If they attempt to govern on the basis of these proposals, why should Democrats, in the minority, be any more responsible? Far easier to claim to be standing up for the American worker by bashing China or Mexico, declaring that every problem can be solved by soaking the rich and promising government benefits to every voting family. But if Democrats hope to deserve electoral gains in 2018 and beyond, they will need to do more than oppose Mr. Trump while outdoing him in undeliverable promises. They will need a constructive, 21st-century version of progressivism -- one that embraces growth, fairness and opportunity for everyone.    Read more:   Robert J.

That’s the only way to uphold principles in Trump’s America.	"   President-elect Donald Trump at one of the presidential debates. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty)  The ascendancy of Donald Trump is surprising, but it is not shocking. How could this have happened? Easily. We are not a society of angels. The poisons that Trump peddles have been loose in the land for a long time. For decades the Republican Party has played with this fire with increasing recklessness, until finally it surrendered to the ravaging flame. There was never anything ""unimaginable"" about the nasty anti-modern furies that carried this repulsive demagogue to the White House; more precisely, liberals appear to have suffered yet again from a failure of imagination. If our allegiance to the ideals of justice and equality and tolerance leaves us shocked at the persistent vitality of their opposites, then our idealism is parochial and naive. This is a country of wildly different destinies, and the belief in equality does not make people equal: The unprecedented pace of change, the daze of historical acceleration in which we live, produces a sensation of insecurity, a terrible volatility, that often results in fear. Trump battened off working-class panic and white panic. He practices the politics of panic. He is not the first: There is a tradition of such politics in America. In the wake of its victory, we must attend to its causes. Why all this American panic? It is unforgivable not to know one's own country. Yet the expansion of our understanding does not absolve us of the responsibility for judgment. To understand is not to forgive. Let us study the roots of populism and ponder the nature of ethnonationalism, but let us also maintain our disgust at the low and malign politics that have just prevailed. There is no economic analysis that can extenuate bigotry. The scapegoating of otherness by miserable people cannot be justified by their misery. Resentment, even when it has a basis in experience, is one of the ugliest political emotions, and it has been the source of horrors. Trump's road to power was manifestly a foul road, even if it was supported by millions of people. Wisdom is never to be found in numbers. Trump's success vouches only for his strategy. It says nothing about his probity or his decency. Those Americans who are ashamed that we have elected as our president a man bursting with prejudices and lies are right. Their shame makes America great again.      Nationwide protests have gripped many cities for days following the presidential election as thousands march against Donald Trump's victory. Trump tweeted to condemn ""professional protesters, incited by the media."" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   Isn't it rich? The apostle of anger now hopes that we rise above anger. Having employed divisiveness as his primary instrument, the president-elect now implores us to put an end to our divisions. In the name of post-electoral comity, we are supposed to forget what we know. At this moment, therefore, it is important to affirm the reality, and the inevitability, and even the nobility, of some of our divisions. They are, some of them, based on fundamental distinctions of philosophy, on divergent conceptions of the individual and society, on incompatible ethical standpoints, on irreconcilable views of America and its responsibilities in the world. Vaporous homilies about working together -- one of President Obama's specialties, and behold his legacy -- only confuse the situation. Where we can work together, let us work together -- who is against infrastructure? The rehabilitation of compromise in a system of government designed for compromise would be a salutary development, though the unified Republican government makes it unlikely. Yet there is still the matter of first principles. There is no way to unite the view that one should deport the children of illegal immigrants with the view that one should not deport the children of illegal immigrants. This is what Martin Luther King Jr. meant when he deplored ""the luxury of cooling off."" If the presidency of Donald Trump inspires anything, it should be a fierce spirit of opposition. But Trump's victory, we are told, was owed mainly to the hatred of Washington, which is plainly dysfunctional. It is indeed hard to say a kind word about Congress, which could not even find a way to act against Zika when it mattered most. But this, too, is rich. Republicans contribute significantly to the breaking of the system, and then they thunder to the country that the system is broken. They refuse to govern, and then they denounce government. They seem to confuse governing with having their way. And more to the point, how does this vast alienation from Washington excuse this vast contempt for whole groups and races and genders? The same question must be asked of the anti-elitism upon which Trump based his campaign. Never mind the bad joke of the billionaire from Fifth Avenue and Palm Beach pretending to be an outsider, a man of the margins. The real issue is the relationship of social status to decency. There is no such relationship. It is not elitist to respect Muslims and Mexicans and African Americans and women and immigrants and Jews, and a blue collar is not a moral pass. A college education is not a requirement for, nor a guarantee of, a moral compass: There are educated members of the American elite who spectacularly lack one, such as the man who was elected president Tuesday. And there are ""poorly educated"" Americans who abundantly express kindness and solidarity for Americans unlike themselves. Neither the elites nor the masses have a monopoly on qualities of character. But Trump's American vision despises people at the top and people at the bottom. It is an inclusive vision. The demons that have haunted our society for decades and even centuries, the vile illiberalism that currently disgraces other governments in the West, will now inhabit the White House. Difficult times are giving way to dark times, and dark times require a special lucidity and a special vigilance and a special ferocity about principle. We must not lose our faith in moral progress and in social progress, but we must remember that moral progress and social progress are not linear and unimpeded and inevitable. There will always be reversals and setbacks, because change rattles the world that preceded it. If you demand justice, prepare for instability, and for the exploitation of instability by political reactionaries who weaken the wounded with nostalgia and fantasies of exclusiveness. The struggle for reform is often succeeded by the struggle to repeal reform. Trumpism, insofar as it is coherently anything, is a great promise of repeal. If Trump succeeds in his repeal, then the fight for the repeal of the repeal must begin. There is nothing Sisyphean or cynical about this. It is the abiding condition of a democracy comprising conflicting ideals. The fight is never over. The prettification of Donald Trump has begun. When a crushed Hillary Clinton graciously asked that Trump be given ""a chance to succeed,"" I confess that I felt no such graciousness. This made me as small as Mitch McConnell, I know. But if Trump succeeds, America may fail; and it is America, its values and its interests, whose success matters most desperately to me. No cooling off, then. We must stay hot for America. The political liberty that we cherish in this precious republic is most purely and exhilaratingly experienced as the liberty to oppose.          1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flare up from opponents of the president-elect.

(Steven Senne/Associated Press)  Tom Brady and Bill Belichick were in message-control mode when the two titans of the New England Patriots faced the media for the first time since their names were used by Donald Trump in a campaign speech Monday. Did Brady vote for the Republican, as Trump said? Did the quarterback's wife, Gisele Bundchen, say the couple didn't support Trump? Did Belichick really write a letter gushing about Trump? Inquiring minds wanted to know and the opportunity to find out presented itself Wednesday when the Patriots star and coach met with reporters for the first time since the speech. First, the Brady/Bundchen family. In Manchester, N.H., Trump had claimed that Brady had phoned to say he had voted for him, which was at odds with Bundchen's ""NO!"" reply over the weekend to an Instagram user who had inquired if the couple backed Trump. Asked initially why he gave permission for Trump to speak of his ballot preference, Brady intimated to reporters that Trump may not have been given the go-ahead. ""So you're assuming I gave people permission?"" he asked. Pressed to say whether he supported Trump, he deferred to the Mrs. ""Talk to my wife. She said I can't talk about politics anymore. I think that's a good decision made for our family.""

The coach was forced to do that rarest of things for him, pulling back the curtain just a wee bit and revealing information completely unrelated to the game at hand this weekend. ""I've received a number of inquiries relative to a note that I wrote to Donald on Monday,"" he said. ""Our friendship goes back many years and I think anybody that's spent more than five minutes with me knows I'm not a political person. The comments are not politically motivated, I have a friendship and loyalty to Donald. ""[A] couple of weeks ago, we had Secretary of State [John] Kerry in our locker room. That's another friend of mine. I can't imagine two people with more different political views than those two, but to me friendship and loyalty is just about that. It's not about political or religious views. ""I write hundreds of letters and notes every month. [It] doesn't mean I agree with every single thing that every person thinks about politics, religion or other subjects. I have multiple friendships that are important to me. That's what that was about. ""It's not about politics, it's about football. We've got a huge game this week against a great football team and a great organization . . .""

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Teryn O'Brien has stopped calling herself evangelical. As a 28-year-old living in Colorado Springs, O'Brien has held concerns with the conservative brand of evangelical Christianity for several years now, but she described this election as ""the final straw."" O'Brien said American evangelicals have historically held the upper hand in America and are seeing that power slip away. Searching to recapture it, many of them turned to Donald Trump, someone she sees as racist, misogynist and antithetical to Christian behavior. Now O'Brien, who attends an Anglican church, has dropped the ""evangelical"" label, simply calling herself a Christian. But she said it has become hard to distinguish ""evangelical"" from ""Christian. "" Evangelicals make up about a quarter of the U.S. population, according to the Pew Research Center. Three-quarters of them are white.      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told conservative pastors in Florida, Aug. 11, that if he's elected, they will ""have great power."" Trump pledged to take on a law that bars tax-exempt organizations from getting involved in political campaigns. (The Washington Post)   Conservative Christians are also the loudest group by far,  O'Brien observed, and so they often get the most attention. Exit polls show 81 percent of white evangelicals across the country backed Trump, the vast majority of whom are Republican and lean conservative, constituting the highest percentage that has voted for the Republican nominee since they voted overwhelmingly for President George W. Bush in 2004.   [White evangelicals voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, exit polls show]   ""This election has truly shown the underbelly of the toxic relationship that can develop between politics and religion,"" O'Brien said. Political divisions have run deep within churches and families, and observers say this election cycle has exposed underlying political and racial divisions within Christianity as a whole, but especially among evangelicals. As a result, some religious leaders are afraid of damage done to the perception of the Christian faith in the United States during this election cycle and fear its long-term effects. Tensions high Evangelical pastors say tensions have soared during the election season, and some are questioning whether they can even continue to use the label evangelical for fear of being associated with Trump. ""I keep trying to disavow that I am 'that' brand of evangelical, but after tonight, I don't know if I even want to have any association with that label anymore,"" Helen Lee, an evangelical author, said on Tuesday. Eugene Cho, a pastor of an evangelical church in Seattle, said that his church building was recently painted with ""F-- organized religion,"" though he is unsure whether it's connected to Trump or the election. ""The election has made things more hostile or given permission to people to be more aggressive on both sides,"" Cho said. Cho, who has pledged that he will never endorse a candidate from the pulpit, joined a group of evangelicals in the fall condemning Trump, arguing his campaign ""affirms racist elements in white culture."" The letter, which was also backed by about 80 evangelical pastors and other leaders, decried Trump's comments on women, Muslims, immigrants, refugees and the disabled. ""People just think that all evangelicals support Donald Trump or support particular platforms or a certain way of thinking,"" Cho said. ""This was just to communicate there isn't a monolithic thought within the so-called evangelical wing of Christianity."" Who speaks for evangelical Christians? After a video of Trump was released showing he joked about sexually assaulting women, some religious leaders said that while his comments were inappropriate, he was still the best leader for the country. Others rejected the idea that those leaders were speaking on everyone's behalf. ""The evangelical support of Trump will be an indictment against its validity as a Christian movement for generations to come,"" Richard Rohr, a Franciscan author and teacher, tweeted after those comments.    The Rev. Russell Moore, director of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, speaks in 2014 in Nashville. (Mark Humphrey/AP)  Some leaders are worried about the lasting impact this election will have inside churches. Russell Moore, who leads the Southern Baptist Convention's political advocacy arm, is deeply concerned about the impact of Christian leaders who defended Trump and the potential damage it has had within churches, especially among women and younger evangelicals.  ""One evangelical woman said to me, 'I've spent all my life saying the church is going to be a place where you can go when you face this sort of thing.' Now I'm looking around, and a pastor is saying 'This isn't a big deal.' That's going to take a lot of work to undo,"" he said. Christianity's political ties The contrast between different groups of religious voters this election season is striking, said Mark Silk, professor of religion in public life at Trinity College. Polls ahead of the election showed Catholics divided, and that many Mormons abandoned the Republican Party compared with years past. But evangelicals voted for Trump in even greater numbers than they voted for Republican candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain. ""Trump has been a candidate where one could say, 'Is there no point at which you won't vote for the Republicans?' "" Silk said. ""I think that's what's given away the extent to which personal identity for religious conservatives and churchgoers has become wrapped up in Republicanism."" In their book, ""American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us,"" Harvard sociologist Robert Putnam and Notre Dame political scientist David Campbell argue that the extraordinary rise of people who affiliate with no religion is due in part to their rejection of its entanglement with politics. Today 22 percent of the population says they have no faith. ""For many, their aversion to religion is rooted in unease with the association between religion and conservative politics,"" Putnam and Campbell wrote. ""If religion equals Republican, then they have decided that religion is not for them."" Michael Wear, who did evangelical outreach for President Obama's campaign in 2008 and now consults with evangelical groups, said that people have been talking about rebranding evangelicals or even Christianity in America now for several years.    ""The people I work with view Trump as a moment for Christians to actually separate themselves from towing a particular party line,"" Wear said. ""We're going to have four years to test that theory."" Shifting demographics White Christian Protestants have dominated America's political and social landscape for most of its history. But in recent decades, the number of Americans who stopped affiliating with religion has surged, along with a rise in Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and other Americans. The year 2008 marked the last in which Protestants represented a majority of Americans, according to demographer Robert P. Jones.   Here's a map of #white Protestant density in the country. Looking familiar... #ElectionDay pic.twitter.com/7vKW6ToB2z -- Robert P. Jones (@robertpjones) November 9, 2016   For most of American history, mainline and evangelical Protestants have dominated the landscape, spiritually and politically. But as Protestants' majority has waned, Jones writes in his book, ""The End of White Christian America,"" Americans who are between 18 and 29 are less than half as likely to be white Christians as those who are 65 and older. This election season, there was a divided voice among Christian leaders as a whole, Jones said. The Catholic bishops in the United States were much quieter than in elections past and  some Mormons, including former GOP candidate Mitt Romney spoke out against Trump, while the so-called ""values voters,"" Christian conservatives who historically coalesced on issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, largely backed Trump. ""It's going to be poignant that the group that has sold themselves as 'values voters' has abandoned those arguments and justifications,"" Jones said. The dividing lines Faith often becomes front and center during election years, said Barna Research President David Kinnaman, because it reveals the fault lines along gender, generations and ethnicities, and between theological traditions. ""It's a powerful moment where people are organizing themselves and making those differences more clear,"" he said. ""There are larger questions about why and how Christians should engage on cultural matters, and this election is redefining how Christians interact."" When reports emerge about whom evangelicals voted for, they usually mean ""white evangelicals,"" glossing over a growing racial division within Christianity. Latino evangelicals are one of the fastest growing segments of churchgoers in America and have largely been fueling the growth among evangelicals, and many did not favor the Republican candidate. ""There is some real angst when there is a blanket statement that 'evangelical supports . . .' "" said Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition. Latino Christians are different from their white Christian peers, Salguero said, because they don't have a history of being a majority in America. ""We don't have messianic expectations for our politicians,"" Salguero said. ""We don't have this moment of 'we're not at the center of power anymore.' Latino evangelicals were never at the center of power, so we can be a prophetic voice independent of who gets into office."" Want more stories about faith?

The Manhattan billionaire who for decades boasted of his playboy lifestyle, stiffed contractors and vendors, hired illegal immigrants, eschewed churchgoing, embraced liberal causes, and counted Hillary and Bill Clinton as friends and allies pulled off one of the most brazen pivots in American history, selling himself to American voters as a populist hero who understood their frustrations and guaranteed a blizzard of wins.  Trump did it the way he'd said he would for more than 30 years: He ignored the rules of modern politics and spoke to Americans in plain, even coarse, everyday language, without massaging his words through the data-driven machinery of consultants, focus groups and TV commercials. He scoffed at ideologies, preaching a tough, blunt pragmatism fueled by unbridled, unashamed ego. He told people what they wanted to hear: that a rapidly changing and splintering society could be forced back to a nostalgia-drenched sense of community and purpose, that long-lost jobs could be retrieved, that a pre-globalized economy could be restored.  [Live updates from the election fallout]  Trump ran against the elites and won. Never mind that he was born rich, flaunted his wealth and lived like a king. He defined the election as a people's uprising against all the institutions that had let them down and sneered at them -- the politicians and the parties, the Washington establishment, the news media, Hollywood, academia, all of the affluent, highly educated sectors of society that had done well during the time when middle-class families were losing their bearings. He swore he would turn Washington upside down, that he would ""drain the swamp,"" and the crowds so loved the image that they would shout the words before he even opened his mouth to say them. Trump ran against the old rules that governed how people talked about politics, and he won there too. Political experts from both parties chortled over Trump's failure to get with the program and build a data-driven, modern campaign based on focus-group-tested TV commercials and microanalysis of voting behavior, but Trump trusted his gut and believed that his message and style would connect with how Americans now absorb the news.     View Graphic      More than any other major political figure in the digital era, Trump saw how social media had segregated the nation into almost wholly separate ideological and cultural camps, each with its own attitudes and its own narratives. He saw how Facebook and Twitter had blurred the line between public and private. He took advantage of that shift in culture and turned himself into a human vent, blasting the country with a stream of frustration and anger that many people had either kept to themselves or spewed about only anonymously.  [How Donald Trump won: An oral history of 2016]  The shift in how people relate to one another online dovetailed almost perfectly with Trump's personal style -- his impulsiveness, his quickness to hit back when criticized, his tendency to lash out at perceived enemies. The result was a new campaign rhetoric, a marketing breakthrough that dramatically altered the emotions and expectations of the presidential race. Trump won because he understood that his celebrity would protect him from the far stricter standards to which politicians are normally held -- one bad gaffe, and you're done. He won because he understood that his outrageous behavior and intemperate comments only cemented his reputation as a decisive truthteller who gets things done. And he won because he had spent almost 40 years cultivating an image as a guy who was so rich, so enamored of himself, so audacious, and so unpredictable that he could be trusted to act without regard to the powers that be. ""I think he has such an ego, he couldn't stand to fail,"" Mary Vesley, 74, a Trump voter in Mechanicsville, Va., outside of Richmond, said Tuesday.  [Donald Trump just blew up the electoral map]  Trump ran against a barrage of accusations that he'd groped women, a near-daily drumbeat of stories about his boorish behavior and nasty insults, and he won there, too. The day after The Washington Post revealed video showing Trump explaining to TV host Billy Bush how he would grab women by the crotch, a Trump supporter in Syracuse, N.Y., Shannon Barns, said that the video had only deepened her belief that he should be president. ""This just put a human face on the guy for me,"" she said. ""I was worried that he was a billionaire and didn't know about the lives of people like me. This showed me that he's a man. You know in your heart every man talks like that.""     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump View Graphic     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump  Trump called himself a ""blue-collar billionaire,"" and although he had lived a fairly isolated life, working and sleeping in Trump Tower, with no close friends and few trusted advisers, he believed that he had so completely won the hearts of many Americans that, as he put it, ""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose voters."" Rejected by the elites from the very start of his career as a real estate developer in Manhattan in the 1970s, Trump had a lifetime of resentments that he had reacted to with searing attacks against his enemies and often-successful revenge plays against those who believed they were better than he. The big real estate developer families in New York had long sneered at Trump as a brash, nasty, nouveau riche intruder on a business that took pride in doing things quietly and diplomatically. The banks treated him like an out-of-control adolescent who needed to be reined in and taught a lesson. The politicians humored him, then scrambled to be by his side to catch some of his reflected fame. Trump beat them all back, again and again, by appealing to the people, his customers, his admirers. Whether he was succeeding at building skyscrapers and casinos, or failing by going through six corporate bankruptcies, he turned again and again to show business and the media to make his case for himself to regular Americans.  [Considering what America's choice of Donald Trump really means]  From his years of appearances on network sitcoms and WrestleMania to his 14-season run as the decisive, tough-talking CEO on NBC's ""The Apprentice,"" Trump cultivated an image among middle-class Americans as a straight-shooting billionaire who had the bucks and the brass to stand up to anyone. From the moment he rode down the escalator of Trump Tower to his beloved pink marble lobby in the summer of 2015, presenting himself to the nation as the antidote to the ideologies and allegiances of both parties -- pitting himself against Republicans and Democrats alike for their cozy ties to Wall Street, Hollywood and the rest of the moneyed class -- Trump claimed that his path to victory was elementary. All he had to do, he said, was connect directly to the pains, fears and frustrations of a nation that had been smacked around by globalization, terrorism, rapid demographic change, and a technological revolution that enriched and enraptured the kids with the stratospheric SAT scores, but left millions of Americans watching their jobs fall victim to the latest apps, overseas outsourcing, robots, and a stunning shift in the nature of commerce and community. Trump easily dispatched 16 Republican primary opponents, dismissing one after another with just the right insult -- ""Low-energy Jeb"" for the once-reluctant Bush brother who started out as the race's favorite; ""Little Marco"" for Sen. Rubio, the diminutive Floridian who always seemed to be trying too hard.  [They were sure Trump would be the next president]  Trump relished the idea of running against Hillary Clinton, who he saw as a feisty and strong figure who was incapable of connecting with middle-class voters and who was beholden to exactly the power bases he planned to run against. He successfully took Clinton's decades-long reputation as a shape-shifting politician whose excessively legalistic language and guarded public persona and twisted it into a searing, angry portrait of an outright criminal, ""Crooked Hillary."" Clinton's hesitant handling of the slow-moving political train wreck over her use of a private email server when she was supposed to be using only government-supplied computers became a bonanza of an opportunity for Trump to hurl his well-honed insults. Then, when FBI director James B. Comey announced this summer that Clinton had not done anything criminal but had been ""extremely careless,"" and again last month when Comey shocked the country by announcing that he had reopened the emails investigation, Trump was able to ratchet up his attacks. Chants of ""Lock her up!"" escalated to far more severe punishments. Comey's announcement two days before the vote that the FBI had cleared Clinton seemed to come far too late to make any difference. As it turned out, Trump won in exactly the way he'd planned to -- outperforming Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee four years ago, in places where Romney came off as a rich, distanced, aloof figure who didn't get how middle- and working-class people were suffering. And Clinton, in Trump's view, ran exactly the campaign he had hoped she would, focused mainly on attacking him rather than offering an alternative vision to the nation's middle class.  [The crowd yelled 'Lock her up!' Then Trump thanked Clinton for 'service to our country.']  Trump, according to exit poll data, earned the votes of 60 percent of white men and 52 percent of white women. And he appeared to be consolidating the GOP coalition, bringing Republicans home in the final weeks of the campaign. The exit polls indicated that he had won 88 percent of Republican votes and 78 percent of ballots cast by white evangelicals. Clinton's strength seemed limited to the most narrow definition of the Democratic Party -- nonwhites and college-educated whites. Even though college graduates made up fully half the electorate, and Clinton did even better among that group than President Obama did four years ago, Trump's margin among people with little or no college was a massive 39 points, a big boost over Romney's 25-point margin four years ago. Trump voters seemed drawn to him more because of how he positioned himself against the elites than because of his policy message. Even his most prominent position, his oft-repeated call to build a wall against Mexican immigrants, seemed not to be a priority shared by his own supporters: Exit poll data showed that a majority of voters opposed the wall idea, about 7 in 10 voters said most illegal immigrants should get a chance to become legal residents, and only a quarter of voters agreed with Trump's call to deport everyone who is in the country illegally.  [How Donald Trump did it, in 5 images]  Trump organized his campaign the way he had run his businesses -- rejecting modern notions about a decentralized hierarchy and sticking instead to his tight circle of loyal advisers. He chose people he knew would stand by him no matter what, rather than people with extensive experience in campaigns. When Trump launched his campaign last year, he selected as his manager a young New Hampshire-based operative, Corey Lewandowski, who rarely made demands of Trump, but instead catered to the candidate's instincts and tempers. Lewandowski, combative with reporters and intensely defensive of his boss, remained loyal even after he was removed in June. Under pressure from the Republican Party, whose leaders were eager to corral Trump into a more predictable campaign, Trump eventually replaced him with veteran GOP aide Paul Manafort, whose experience could be traced back to Gerald R. Ford's 1976 campaign and Bob Dole's 1996 bid. Yet even Manafort found it difficult to corral Trump and keep him on script. When Manafort was forced to step down, Trump brought in a third team, one that he told friends would ""let Trump be Trump."" Campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon, who came aboard from the hard-right Breitbart news site, and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tried to both harden Trump's harshly anti-establishment message and soften his rhetoric to draw in suburban women. Bannon saw Trump as the American equivalent of Britain's vote earlier this year to leave the European Union -- another unexpected popular uprising against the elites. Bannon believed that a Trump victory would not be the upset that the media and the political parties thought it would be, but rather as part of a worldwide revolt against globalization, the hegemony of the technology utopianists, and the arrogance of the overeducated. Bannon brought Nigel Farage, the far right champion of Britain's Brexit campaign, to a Trump rally and repeatedly told Trump that his candidacy was part of something bigger, a worldwide movement against elites in finance, media and politics. Bannon pushed Trump to frame Clinton as a candidate who was not just wrong for the working class but was a ""corrupt"" and scheming ""globalist."" Trump's closing two-minute ad did not mention the words ""Republican"" or ""Democrat,"" but portrayed Clinton huddling with bankers and financial power brokers -- many of them Jewish, which led many Jewish organizations and political leaders to accuse the Trump campaign of deploying anti-Semitic tropes. Whether Bannon or others in the campaign will follow Trump to the White House is not yet known. Trump's inner circle of executives and assistants consists mainly of people who have been with him for decades, and he has added few new people to that circle through the years. ""Most of my friendships are business related because those are the only people I meet,"" Trump said in an interview this spring. ""I mean, I think I have a lot of friends, but they're not friends like perhaps other people have friends, where they're together all the time and they go out to dinner all the time. . . . I have good enemies, too, which is okay."" Trump's father, New York real estate developer Fred Trump, instructed his boy from a young age to devote his life to becoming a very big something. There was nothing worse, the father said, than being a ""nothing."" Donald Trump took his father's total commitment to work, his mother's love of showmanship, and his mentor, New York lawyer Roy Cohn's hyperaggressive approach to making deals and settling scores, and combined them into a public persona that celebrated money and ego. Trump believed that through creative use of media, he could build an image that would inspire ordinary people to want to be like him. He believed that if he crafted that image well enough, he could become rich and powerful and ultimately rise to the highest office in the land. On Tuesday, he reached that final step in his half-century-long ascent. What he will do with it, even he does not know. Asked earlier this year if he has spent much time preparing to actually be president, Trump admitted that his focus had been solely on the campaign. ""I'm all about the hunt and the chase,"" he said. ""When I get something I really wanted, I sometimes lose interest in it."" Trump has 73 days until his inauguration.  Robert Costa, Rosalind S. Helderman and Michael Kranish contributed to this report.  Read more:   The media didn't want to believe Trump could win. So they looked the other way.

Trump's closing two-minute ad did not mention the words ""Republican"" or ""Democrat,"" but portrayed Clinton huddling with bankers and financial power brokers -- many of them Jewish, which led many Jewish organizations and political leaders to accuse the Trump campaign of deploying anti-Semitic tropes. Whether Bannon or others in the campaign will follow Trump to the White House is not yet known. Trump's inner circle of executives and assistants consists mainly of people who have been with him for decades, and he has added few new people to that circle through the years. ""Most of my friendships are business related because those are the only people I meet,"" Trump said in an interview this spring. ""I mean, I think I have a lot of friends, but they're not friends like perhaps other people have friends, where they're together all the time and they go out to dinner all the time. . . . I have good enemies, too, which is okay."" Trump's father, New York real estate developer Fred Trump, instructed his boy from a young age to devote his life to becoming a very big something. There was nothing worse, the father said, than being a ""nothing."" Donald Trump took his father's total commitment to work, his mother's love of showmanship, and his mentor, New York lawyer Roy Cohn's hyperaggressive approach to making deals and settling scores, and combined them into a public persona that celebrated money and ego. Trump believed that through creative use of media, he could build an image that would inspire ordinary people to want to be like him. He believed that if he crafted that image well enough, he could become rich and powerful and ultimately rise to the highest office in the land. On Tuesday, he reached that final step in his half-century-long ascent. What he will do with it, even he does not know. Asked earlier this year if he has spent much time preparing to actually be president, Trump admitted that his focus had been solely on the campaign. ""I'm all about the hunt and the chase,"" he said. ""When I get something I really wanted, I sometimes lose interest in it."" Trump has 73 days until his inauguration.  Robert Costa, Rosalind S.
