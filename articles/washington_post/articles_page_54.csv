The resolution entitled ""Combating glorification of Nazism, Neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fueling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,"" was approved by the U.N.'s human rights committee on Friday with 131 in favor, 3 against with 48 abstentions. Ukraine and Palau were the other no votes.  ""We condemn without reservation all forms of religious and ethnic intolerance or hatred at home and around the world,"" said Deputy U.S. Representative to the Economic and Social Council Stefanie Amadeo, explaining the U.S. vote.  ""However, due to this resolution's overly narrow scope and politicized nature, and because it calls for unacceptable limits on the fundamental freedom of expression, the United States cannot support it,"" Amadeo said. She said the U.S. also disagrees with the resolution's willing to curb freedom of expression even while sharing its concerns about the rise of hate speech around the world. ___ Attorney says adoptee from South Korea deported from US SALEM, Ore. -- A man who was adopted from South Korea by Americans when he was 3 years old landed on Thursday in his native country -- one that is completely unknown to him -- after he was deported from the United States, an official and his lawyer said. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had ordered Adam Crapser deported because of criminal convictions, including assault and being a felon in possession of a weapon. His life story highlights the failings of an adoption system that put him in the homes of one set of parents who abandoned him and another that physically abused him and other adopted children, his Seattle attorney, Lori Walls, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson told AP in an email that the 41-year-old Crapser arrived in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday morning aboard a commercial airline flight escorted by ICE deportation officers. Richeson said Crapser was arrested by ICE on Feb. 8 after serving a 60-day sentence for menacing constituting domestic violence and attempted coercion. He had been held in an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington since then. A judge could have allowed Crapser to stay in America but decided on deportation. Crapser's supporters said he waived an appeal because he couldn't stand to stay in the detention center any longer. ___ Mike Trout, Kris Bryant win baseball's MVP awards CHICAGO -- While the Los Angeles Angels stumbled, Mike Trout soared again. Just too good to ignore. Trout won the AL MVP award Thursday for the second time in three years, and Chicago Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant was voted NL MVP in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.  ""To win it one time, it's hard to do,"" Trout said. ""Twice, I guess you saw my emotions tonight, it was something special."" While the Angels finished fourth in the AL West, Trout was his usual brilliant self. The center fielder batted .315 with 29 homers, 100 RBIs and 30 steals. He scored 17 percent of Los Angeles' runs, the highest percentage for an AL player since Rickey Henderson with the 1985 New York Yankees. ___ Snow off to a slow start in Rockies, delaying some skiers DENVER -- Autumn snow has been scarce in the Rocky Mountains, forcing some ski areas to push back opening day and causing some nervousness about how much water will be available next spring for the Colorado River, the lifeblood of the Southwest. But the first significant storm of the season that moved into Colorado, Utah and Wyoming on Thursday is expected to bring 8 inches of snow or more at higher elevations, forecasters said. Water managers and climate experts say it's too early in the season to predict a dry winter.  ""This doesn't mean at all that the winter is going to be dry,"" said Klaus Wolter, a climate scientist with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences in Boulder, Colorado.  ""It's kind of a nervousness-inducing late onset,"" he said. A lot can happen between the fall and spring, said Marlon Duke, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages multiple reservoirs on the Colorado River. ___ Wave of ethnic killings engulfs town in South Sudan YEI, South Sudan -- Infants hacked with machetes. Charred bodies with their arms bound. Women who were gang-raped. Men who were spared death but arbitrarily detained. These are the tales of horror told in Yei, a formerly peaceful town surrounded by farms in southern South Sudan near its border with Uganda and Congo. Once a beacon of coexistence, Yei is now a center of the country's renewed civil war, gripped by a wave of killings among South Sudan's dozens of different ethnic groups. And things could get worse.  ""The signs are all there for the spread of this ethnic hatred and targeting of civilians that could evolve into genocide, if something is not done now to stop it,"" said Adama Dieng, the U.N.'s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, after visiting Yei last week. ___ Experts: Video evidence isn't slam dunk in police shootings MINNEAPOLIS -- When Philando Castile was shot by a Minnesota police officer, his girlfriend broadcast his final moments live on Facebook. But experts say the footage from a squad car camera was probably a bigger factor in prosecutors' decision to charge the officer with manslaughter. And that footage, which has not been made public, is still no guarantee that Jeronimo Yanez will be convicted, as other police shootings have shown.  ""There have been cases that had video that resulted in either an acquittal or a hung jury, so sometimes the video may raise more questions,"" said Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University who tracks fatal police shootings. ""It's very hard to convict in these cases."" Since the beginning of 2005, a total of 78 officers in the U.S. have been charged with murder or manslaughter. Of that number, about a third of the defendants were convicted -- 14 by juries and 13 through guilty pleas, Stinson said. Of the 18 police officers charged with murder or manslaughter last year, at least 11 cases involved video evidence, he said. ___ AP source: Trump offers Flynn national security adviser job NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump offered former military intelligence chief Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser as he began to build out his national security team Thursday, according to a senior Trump official. The move came as Trump made his most direct foray into foreign policy since the election, meeting with Japan's prime minister. Flynn, who served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has advised Trump on national security issues for months. As national security adviser, he would work in the White House and have frequent access to the president. The post does not require Senate confirmation. The official wouldn't say whether Flynn had accepted the job, which left open the possibility that the arrangement was not finalized. The official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly and insisted on anonymity. Flynn, who turns 58 in December, built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. He retired in 2014 and has been a fierce critic of President Barack Obama's White House and Pentagon, taking issue with the administration's approach to global affairs and fighting Islamic State militants. Flynn has called for Washington to should work more closely with Moscow, echoing similar statements from Trump. But his warmth toward Russia has worried some national security experts. ___ Flynn's reputation: astute intelligence pro, straight talker WASHINGTON -- Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the man Donald Trump has asked to be his national security adviser, built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. What set Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon, taking issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State group and, more generally, its handling of global affairs. In recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by IS requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow. Flynn is a champion of other foreign policy themes Trump pushed during the campaign, including renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal. But Flynn's warmth toward Russia and antagonism toward what conservatives rail against as ""radical Islam"" has worried some national security experts. Flynn traveled last year to Moscow, where he joined Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials in a celebration of the RT network, Russia's government-controlled television channel. Flynn later explained that he had been paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort. Flynn has also been outspoken in his alarms about the dangers of Islamist groups, complaining on CNN in June that the U.S. needs to ""discredit"" radical Islam, but that ""we're not allowed to do that right now."" He blamed the Obama administration in a New York Post op-ed in July for failing to design a coherent strategy for opposing the Islamic State group. And in August, he spoke at an event in Dallas for the anti-Islamist group Act for America, saying that Islam ""is a political ideology"" and that it ""definitely hides behind being a religion."" ___ 10 Things to Know for Friday Your daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Friday: 1. DONALD TRUMP OFFERS FLYNN THE JOB OF NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER The move came as the president-elect made his most direct foray into foreign policy since the election, meeting with Japan's prime minister. 2. OBAMA PRODS TRUMP TO BE TOUGH WHEN RUSSIA VIOLATES GLOBAL NORMS The Kremlin accused Obama of trying to lock in bad relations before Trump takes office. ___ Japan PM in NY for 1st meeting by foreign leader with Trump NEW YORK -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he believes Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence after meeting with the president-elect Thursday. Abe, who became the first world leader to meet with Trump since his election, was seeking reassurances over the future of U.S.-Japan security and trade relations. He described the meeting as ""really, really cordial"" but offered few details of their discussion.  ""I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as an outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader with whom I can have great confidence in,"" Abe said at a press conference following the meeting, where he took only two questions. Abe said the meeting renewed his conviction that he would be able to establish a relationship of confidence with Trump. Abe met with Trump in New York, where the incoming president is working on setting up an administration after his surprise election victory last week that has injected new uncertainty into old U.S. alliances. The Trump transition team provided no readout of the meeting. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

"   (Michael Quirk/iStock)  Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we're talking about American identity. Need a primer? Catch up here. Lawrence R. Samuel is a Miami-based author whose books include ""The American Dream: A Cultural History"" and ""The American Middle Class: A Cultural History."" While Donald Trump resoundingly won the electoral college -- the state-based ""point system"" we've used in presidential elections for more than two centuries -- Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by about 780,000 as of a week out of the election. In other words, more Americans wanted Clinton to win, reason enough to revisit the wisdom of using the electoral college to determine elections. But a larger, more important argument is often overlooked in this ongoing debate. The United States of America: We use the phrase all the time but rarely think of what the words actually mean. In 1776, when this country officially became the United States of America, the words signified a bold idea. Geographic neighbors had formed alliances previously in history to form nations, of course, but these united states shared a vision and philosophy that was literally revolutionary.   [Do Americans still have a shared identity?]   The coming together of 13 disparate colonies was itself a historic achievement; never before, perhaps, had a collection of diverse, often contrarian regions merged to create a country whose leaders so vigorously rejected the political and religious doctrines of the times. (The people were not as enthusiastic.) We tend to forget how difficult a process the uniting of the original states was, as the cultural boundaries of the 13 regions persisted after the Founding Fathers joined forces to form a federated republic. But times have changed, and we need to rethink the notion of the ""United States of America."" Our states are no longer culturally diverse regions with their own respective identities; rather, they are artificially constructed geographic entities that certainly would not be formed today. Borderlines between states are especially nonsensical. Pensacola, Fla., is a lot more like Mobile, Ala., than Miami. Upstate New Yorkers are less than happy about being in the same tax pool as Manhattanites. In fact, despite all the attention to divisions within the country based on geography (or race, gender, class or any other demographic measure, for that matter), Americans share a remarkably similar way of thinking and acting. (The so-called red-vs.-blue-state divide is a crude, media-driven concept that looks great on maps but has little basis in reality.) Regional differences have drastically dissipated over the course of the past 240 years, turning the once radical proposition of the ""United States"" into an anachronism that now has little or no real value. More than anything, it was the barrage of mass media and mass marketing through the 20th century that crushed regionality in this country (and much of the world), flattening out attitudinal and behavioral dissimilarities. Suburbanization -- as well as the kudzu-like spread of strip malls, chain stores and franchises -- transformed much of the country's physical landscape into something that makes it difficult to know where one is. The automobile and the jet allowed us to conquer space, and the Internet has virtually obliterated the lines of geography. We now shop at the same kind of stores (or websites), watch the same kind of television shows and work at the same kind of jobs. More important, we share the same basic principles and core values grounded in the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- despite trivialities like New Englanders' charming (or annoying) pronunciation of the word ""park"" or Southerners' inclination to eat grits for breakfast. Why does any of this matter? Quite a bit, as the problem with states goes far beyond their illogic and irrelevance. State governments are expensive to run and taxpayers are forced to foot most of the bill. We can't afford them anymore -- and we don't need them. A federation of states was a wonderful idea in the late 18th century, but represents an unnecessary and costly burden in the early 21st. Two layers of government -- federal and local -- offers a cleaner, more sensible and much more affordable system than our current one, a notion not unlike cutting out the middle layer of an overly bureaucratic, inefficient company. Eliminating this middle layer would save the American people billions of dollars a year, the kind of money that could go a long way toward paying down our national debt or preparing for our looming crises in Social Security and health care. Would abandoning the ""United States of America"" for something different present challenges? Absolutely. The dismantling of anything more than two centuries old would naturally require considerable effort, a step almost as radical as the uniting of colonies to form states. Not just the political system, but the legal system would have to be overhauled. (Probably a good thing in itself given the vast inconsistencies in laws across state lines.) It might well take time to get used to things such as national driver's licenses and license plates, though some kind of tracking system is likely to arrive soon for other reasons related to homeland security. State affinities will likely never completely disappear, and there is no reason that the University of Florida or the New York Jets could not keep their names (even if the latter plays their games in New Jersey). But it's time we start thinking of ourselves as one people -- Americans -- who live in real, local communities rather than as 50 kinds of people living in imaginary regions. Read more: Dale M.

In his annual state of the nation address, President Joseph Kabila accused unnamed foreign entities of manipulating the country's youth. He did not provide details.  ""This gives me the opportunity to again denounce any interference in the affairs of our country,"" Kabila said. Kabila's second term in office expires next month, but Congo's courts have ruled that the election of a new president can be delayed and that Kabila can stay in power until a new leader is chosen. A deal reached last month calls for the vote to be held in April 2018, though the largest opposition party rejected it. On Monday the prime minister resigned as part of the deal. Anger over the delay has sparked violence including street clashes in September that killed dozens. Kabila has not revealed his plans, but he raised the prospect of amending the constitution to allow for a third presidential term when speaking over the weekend with a visiting delegation from the U.N. Security Council, according to Twitter messages posted by Stephen Hickey, political counselor for the U.K.'s mission to the U.N. Hickey called the remark ""very concerning."" Government spokesman Lambert Mende on Monday said a third term was not being considered but added that Congolese voters could opt to change the constitution ""in three, four or five years."" On Tuesday, Kabila reiterated past statements that the constitution would be ""respected."" Opposition lawmaker Delly Sesanga responded to Tuesday's speech by saying the president's respect for the constitution would be evident ""not in a speech but in his actions.""

Opponents said the document revealed the chaos behind the government's frequent assurances that ""Brexit means Brexit."" The Times of London newspaper published a memo, written by a staffer at accountancy firm Deloitte, claiming splits within Prime Minister Theresa May's team have delayed development of a negotiating strategy with the EU. The government says it will trigger two years of formal exit talks by March 31. But the memo says ""it may be six months before there is a view on priorities/negotiation strategy as the political situation in the U.K. and the EU evolves."" The prime minister's office said ""this is not a government report and we don't recognize the claims made in it."" Deloitte said in a statement that the note was ""intended primarily for internal audiences"" and ""represents a view"" of the task facing Britain's civil service.  ""This work was conducted without access to No. 10 (Downing St.) or input from any other government departments,"" Deloitte said. The document, dated Nov. 7, says individual government departments are working on 500 different projects related to Britain's EU exit. It says ""every department has developed a 'bottom up' plan of what the impact of Brexit could be,"" but ""there is no prioritization and no link to the overall negotiation strategy."" The memo says May's government has little understanding of Brexit's implications for industry, and ""the government's priority remains its political survival, not the economy."" It says government departments may need to hire up to 30,000 civil servants to complete the mammoth task of leaving the bloc. May took office in July, after Britons voted to leave the EU. She had campaigned to stay in, but has promised she will deliver on voters' decision to leave. Her Cabinet contains both ""remain"" backers like Treasury Chief Philip Hammond and ""leave"" supporters including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. The government has declined to say what sort of deal Britain will seek with the EU -- including whether it will try to keep Britain in the bloc's single market for goods and services, something many British businesses desire. Keir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said that the memo was right to say that ministers ""are in a mess over Brexit and do not have a plan.""  ""Brexit is the most important issue facing Britain for generations and it is simply not good enough for the government to give mixed messages and cause unnecessary confusion,"" he said. May's official spokeswoman, Helen Bower, said the memo appeared to have been written by ""a firm touting for business."" She said the government intended to stick to its timetable, ""and I struggle to understand how one individual who has never met the prime minister or any members of her team can then decide that the timetable is somehow off course or different."" Tony Travers, director of British government studies at the London School of Economics, said it was no surprise the leaked note had provoked a strong reaction, given the febrile atmosphere surrounding Britain's EU exit. Travers said pro-Brexit politicians ""fear that out of chaos, out of a lack of a plan, might come a much weaker version"" of divorce than they want. But he said pro-EU forces shouldn't take too much comfort from hints of government confusion.  ""Brexit will happen. Britain will leave the EU -- but the question is on what terms,"" Travers said.

U.S. allies in Europe fear the dawning of Donald Trump's presidency could signal sharp shifts ahead in Washington's stance on security, climate change, free trade, Russia and the Middle East. Obama, on his final foreign tour, will seek to assuage those concerns in exit meetings here with the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Spain. Trump's victory is set to usher into the White House a worldview very different from the liberal democratic consensus that was the cornerstone of Obama's partnership with Europe. With Britain disengaging after its vote to leave the European Union and other regional leaders mired in domestic battles, Obama's exit is set to leave Merkel as the world's most influential standard-bearer of those principles.     Many far-right parties in Europe are celebrating the presidential victory of Donald Trump. (Jason Aldag,Ishaan Tharoor/The Washington Post)   Speaking to reporters Tuesday in Athens, Obama acknowledged that populist movements, many with dark undertones, have been gaining ground across the globe. ""Obviously there's something being tapped into, a suspicion of globalization, a desire to rein in its excesses, a suspicion of elites and governing institutions that people feel may not be responsive to their immediate needs,"" he said. ""And that sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity. And that can be a volatile mix. It's important to recognize, though, that those trends have always been there."" A more inclusive world vision, the president added, ""will win the day in the long term."" Some see the levelheaded Merkel emerging as a possible counterpoint on the world stage to the steady global march of personality-based populism, including in the United States. German officials are calculating that Trump may dial back his staunchest campaign pledges. But if he does not, ""it would be difficult not only for Merkel but for all the European Union states and partners"" to work with him, said Jurgen Hardt, a close Merkel ally and her party's point man on transatlantic affairs. Before the surprise result in the U.S. presidential election, Obama's last official visit to Germany -- the sixth of his presidency -- was seen as a way to boost Merkel ahead of national elections next year. He was paying back a leader whom Ben Rhodes, the White House deputy national security adviser, described as ""the president's closest partner over the course of his entire presidency."" But now Obama's visit marks a more consequential moment. No other world leader so closely matches Obama's ideology of tireless diplomacy with an emphasis on human rights, tolerance and equality. Sharing similar temperaments, Merkel and Obama forged a friendship that helped broker several major agreements -- including the deal on Iran's nuclear program and sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Obama ""has been able to fashion a consensus with Berlin, and then Chancellor Merkel has been able to work the issue within the E.U.,"" Charles A. Kupchan, the National Security Council's senior director for European affairs, said in an interview. ""It turns out to be a very effective vehicle for building a transatlantic consensus.""  [Meet the international odd couple: Barack Obama and Angela Merkel]  But with that partnership drawing to a close, it is unclear what might replace it. Merkel is famously pragmatic and is likely to forge some kind of a working relationship with Trump. But she already has signaled her caution, issuing a carefully worded statement of congratulations after the elections that seemed to double as a warning. ""Germany and America are bound by common values -- democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views,"" she said. ""It is based on these values that I wish to offer close cooperation, both with me personally and between our countries' governments."" Trepidation When Obama was first elected -- and even before, when he drew a massive crowd in Berlin -- he was hailed here as a healer of transatlantic relations that had been deeply tested during the presidency of George W. Bush. The Germans became some of Obama's fiercest supporters, with his popularity ratings in Germany almost always higher than they ever were at home. Trump's election has had the opposite effect -- provoking a sense of trepidation, even betrayal, that may factor into Merkel's dealings with the president-elect. ""I don't understand how America could have done this,"" said Judith Schuelhle, 33, a university researcher who joined an anti-Trump protest at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate this past weekend. ""Trump's election for me means that America can no longer be the leader of the free world,"" she said. ""Because Trump doesn't speak for a free world. He speaks for everything we don't stand for -- anti-women, anti-equality, for hate."" Merkel has not declared her candidacy for a fourth term next year, but some of her close allies suggest she will. Nonetheless, she is facing her own populist challenge amid a backlash against her open-door policy for refugees. If she runs again and wins, as many here still expect, history suggests she and Trump may find difficulties ahead. An all-business pragmatist, consensus builder and trained physicist, Merkel eschews sentimentality and is known especially to distrust charismatic leaders. She was initially skeptical of Obama, too. When he visited Berlin in 2008 as a candidate, Merkel reacted with ""bewilderment"" to Obama's request to speak in front of the Brandenburg Gate -- a request she promptly denied. Observers describe her as uneasy with Obama's ""Yes we can"" campaign -- the notion of one man affecting change. It was anathema to a woman who grew up in communist East Germany, leery of political one-man shows. Even after Obama's election, austerity-loving Merkel bristled at his administration's spend-to-save economic rescue plan during the Great Recession. In a leaked 2009 communique to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from her confidant Sidney Blumenthal, the latter described Merkel's ""profound belief"" that ""the Obama administration is on a disastrous economic path."" ""Obama and Merkel are like oil and water,"" he wrote. Yet Obama managed to win her over, observers say, in part because he had no choice. Europe's decider During his eight years in office, Merkel grew into her job as chancellor, becoming the ballast that kept Europe afloat as it stumbled from crisis to crisis. Under her leadership, Germany rose to the zenith of its post-World War II power -- distancing itself every year from the dark days of the Nazis by leading the effort to combat global warming and taking in nearly 1 million migrants and refugees. She became the continent's decider -- and a leader ever more important to U.S. policy in Europe. ""Germany became pivotal during the Obama [administration] and under Merkel,"" said Josef Janning, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""Without German acceptance, nothing happens in the E.U. anymore. The White House read that, and understood that France and Britain have their own interests around the world. But if you get Germany on your side, you get the E.U."" In 2013, Obama and Merkel faced their greatest test, when revelations emerged of U.S. spying on the chancellor. Germany expelled the CIA station chief. But in phone conversations with Obama, she seemed to couch the response as political expedience and nothing too personal. Privately, observers say, she was eager for the scandal to blow over so Washington and Berlin could move on. Over time, their relationship was helped, many say, because the two share similar traits. They are cautious leaders, sometime to the point of seeming academic. Although she took hits at home and abroad, history would prove the German chancellor right, Obama has said, when it comes to her humanitarian stance during the refugee crisis. Speaking to reporters Friday, Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, made it clear that from the president's perspective, no other leader rivals Merkel. ""They've worked together on almost every issue. They've developed a deep mutual respect, I think, and close friendship as well,"" he said. ""So he wanted to see Chancellor Merkel one more time to thank her for her partnership and leadership.""

However, Kerry's announcement drew an immediate backlash from the internationally-recognized Yemeni government, which dismissed the deal as ""unilateral."" Kerry told reporters that the rebels, known as Houthis, have told him they agree to abide by a cessation of hostilities, starting on Thursday, providing the government side does the same, and that they are also willing to participate in a unity government, to be formed by the end of the year.  ""There is a humanitarian disaster in Yemen - (not) just serious security and economic and political and humanitarian challenges,"" the top American diplomat said after leaving Oman -- an Arab country that has been a traditional Mideast go-between -- where he held talks with a Houthi delegation  ""All the parties we talk to agree that there's no military solution,"" Kerry said. ""So if that's the fact, you've got to get into: What is the political solution?"" President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi's government promptly rejected the cease-fire initiative. Hadi's government is supported by a Saudi-led coalition that has been waging an air campaign in Yemen to dislodge the Houthis after they seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhalfi said the deal has nothing to do with his government.  ""The government doesn't know and is not concerned with what Kerry announced; this shows a desire to foil peace efforts by trying to reach a deal with Houthis away from the government,"" al-Mekhalfi wrote on his Twitter account. Two top Hadi aides described Kerry's remarks as ""unilateral deal."" The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Hadi's government has opposed a road map to peace, which Kerry said won support of Houthis. The document, which was drafted last month by the U.N. envoy to Yemen, sidelines Hadi by stipulating the formation of a new unity government. It also transfers the president's powers to a vice president and a new prime minister. The document says the formation of the unity government would come hand-in-hand with preparations for the Houthis to withdraw from cities they seized and hand over their weapons to a third party. Hadi's government described the road map as a reward to the rebels though Kerry said it has the support of the Saudi-led coalition. Yemen has been caught in a deadly conflict since 2014 when the Houthis descended from their northern enclave and seized Saana, forcing Hadi's government to flee and seek military intervention from the Saudi neighbors and Arab Gulf states. The relentless airstrikes, along with the fighting on the ground, have killed over 4,000 civilians and pushed Yemen, the Arab world's poorest nation, to the brink of famine.

Burying a dictator accused of massive rights violations and corruption by thousands of activists and dissenters at the heroes' cemetery has long been an emotional issue in the Philippines, where Marcos was ousted by a largely nonviolent army-backed uprising in 1986. In other images from the Asia-Pacific region last week, chaotic scenes played out across India, with long lines and scuffles breaking out, as millions of anxious people tried to change old currency notes that became worthless when the government demonetized high-value bills. New Delhi and other Indian cities announced a slew of measures to combat crippling air pollution, including closing down schools, halting construction and ordering that all roads be doused with water to settle dust. Hundreds of thousands of people flooded Seoul's streets demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye amid an explosive political scandal, in what may be South Korea's largest protest since it shook off dictatorship three decades ago. Parts of a main street collapsed in the heart of a major city in southern Japan, creating a massive sinkhole and cutting off power, water and gas supplies to parts of the city. Authorities said no injuries were reported from the pre-sunrise collapse in downtown Fukuoka, which created a sinkhole more than half the size of an Olympic pool in the middle of the business district. ___ This gallery was curated by Associated Press photo editor Masayo Yoshida in Tokyo.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/12/there-may-have-been-shy-trump-supporters-after-all/	There may have been shy Trump supporters after all	"   Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Macon, Ga., on Nov. 30, 2015. (Christopher Aluka Berry/Reuters)  As Americans settled in on the evening of Nov. 8 to watch the election returns, there was widespread agreement that Hillary Clinton was likely to win the presidency. Models based on polling data had nearly all suggested that a Donald Trump victory was either virtually impossible or at least unlikely. Many had locked in these forecasts relatively early on. ""It is totally over,"" tweeted Sam Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium on Oct. 18. ""If Trump wins more than 240 votes I will eat a bug."" The good news is that bugs are packed with protein, because Trump won the presidency. If this is a modern ""Dewey Defeats Truman"" moment (though some disagree) how did it come to be? One possibility is that the polls were off because people were uncomfortable openly sharing with pollsters that they planned to vote for Trump. Discomfort with openly admitting a political viewpoint is hardly new. In the book ""Independent Politics,"" two of us (Klar and Krupnikov) demonstrate that people will often hide behind the label ""independent"" to avoid publicly associating with either of the two parties -- particularly when those parties are stigmatized. The culprit is social desirability bias. To avoid ""looking bad,"" some people avoid answering survey questions or, even worse, outright lie. Social desirability becomes even more powerful in a negative context: The more negative messages people receive about a certain group, the more likely they are to avoid publicly associating with that group. By the time the 2016 campaign was in its home stretch, the media culture surrounding the Trump candidacy had become significantly more negative. Almost no mainstream newspapers had endorsed his candidacy (though some highlighted his endorsement by the official newspaper of the KKK). Many mainstream newspapers highlighted Trump's flaws, and journalists openly grappled with their inability to withhold judgment. In short, identifying as a Trump supporter may have seemed -- at least to some people -- as socially undesirable. Could Trump's social undesirability have mattered for pre-election polls? The challenge here is that people refuse to answer survey questions in a variety of ways. Hiding your views need not mean lying. It could mean saying that you're undecided or simply not taking the poll at all. Right now, the data don't tell us definitively what happened. That said, certainly there were more undecided voters in 2016 than 2012 -- 15 percent vs. 5 percent as of late October. Meanwhile, exit poll data suggests an unexpected level of enthusiasm for Trump, and more subdued reactions for Clinton. Turnout patterns point in a similar direction: Clinton underperformed with key Democratic-coalition groups, while Trump did better than expected among Republicans and independents. Moreover, although some research suggested that ""shy Trump voters"" were few and far between, other research did find that Republicans were more likely to deflect questions about voting for Trump. And we do not know yet whether some Trump supporters simply didn't participate in polls at all. If early coverage is any indication, the 2016 campaign has led many people to doubt the value of modern polling. This is too hasty. As some have suggested, the polls did not fail all that spectacularly in 2016. But they were off by enough in a few key states to give a misleading impression of the outcome. This should lead us to be more sensitive to the political context in which surveys occur, and the resulting incentives that respondents have to be truthful. Some respondents may change their response if they fear people's disapproval. Elizabeth Connors is a PhD student in the political science department at Stony Brook University.

Police said about 260,000 people turned out for the latest mass rally against Park, whose presidency has been shaken by suspicion that she let a shadowy longtime confidante manipulate power from behind the scenes. Protest organizers estimated the crowd at 1 million. Waving banners and signs, a sea of demonstrators jammed streets stretching about a kilometer (half a mile) from City Hall to a large square in front of an old palace gate for several hours, roaring and applauding to speeches calling for Park's ouster. Protesters also marched on a road in front of the palace gate and near the Blue House, the mountainside presidential office and residence, carrying candles, blowing horns and banging drums, while shouting ""Park Geun-hye, resign!"" Bae Dong-san, a 45-year-old man, said Park's government has ""worsened the living conditions of workers, completely messed up state governance and monopolized state affairs with her secret inner circle.""  ""It feels much better to shout together with many other people,"" he said. Despite rising public anger, opposition parties have yet to seriously push for Park's resignation or impeachment over fears of triggering a backlash from conservative voters and negatively impacting next year's presidential election. However, they have threatened to campaign for Park's resignation if she doesn't distance herself from state affairs. The protest on Saturday was the largest in the capital since June 10, 2008, when police said 80,000 people took part in a candlelight vigil denouncing the government's decision to resume U.S. beef imports amid mad cow fears. Organizers estimated that crowd at 700,000. In the summer of 1987, millions rallied in Seoul and other cities for weeks before the then-military government caved in to demands for free presidential elections. Train and express bus tickets to Seoul were difficult to get from some areas Friday evening and Saturday morning, with the protest reportedly drawing tens of thousands of people from other cities.  ""I have never been interested in politics and I don't even have a TV at home ... but unbelievable things have been happening and I came out today because I didn't want to feel defeated as a South Korean citizen,"" said Cho Jong-gyu, who took a five-hour bus ride from the small southern island of Geoje to participate in the rally, where he quietly held a cardboard sign calling for Park to resign. Lee Ryeo-hwa, a Seoul resident who brought her three children to the rally, the youngest of them hanging on her front in a baby carrier, said Park had to go because she ""created this mess with her undemocratic leadership style and refusal to communicate.""  ""People said it was a bad idea to bring my kids here, but I want them to remember today ... and learn that democracies are built on participation,"" Lee said. In addition to allegedly manipulating power, the president's confidante, Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a late cult leader who emerged as Park's mentor in the 1970s, is also suspected of exploiting her presidential ties to bully companies into donating tens of millions of dollars to foundations she controlled. In an attempt to stabilize the situation, Park said Tuesday that she would let the opposition-controlled parliament choose her prime minister. But opposition parties say her words are meaningless without specific promises about transferring much of her presidential powers to a new No. 2. Moon Jae-in, a lawmaker from the main opposition Minjoo Party who lost to Park in the 2012 presidential election, has even demanded that Park surrender her authority to command South Korea's military. The opposition is also demanding a separate investigation into the scandal by a special prosecutor. Prosecutors have arrested Choi, one of her key associates and two former presidential aides who allegedly helped Choi interfere with government decisions and amass an illicit fortune at the expense of businesses. On Saturday, prosecutors summoned a senior executive of Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest company, which is under suspicion of spending millions of dollars illicitly financing the equestrian training of Choi's daughter. They had raided the company's headquarters in southern Seoul on Tuesday. On Friday, prosecutors summoned the chairman of POSCO over allegations that Choi and her associates tried to forcibly take over the shares of an advertising company previously owned by the steelmaker. The increasingly strange scandal surrounding Choi has inspired rumors to fly and left her accused of everything from influencing national security decisions to swaying the careers of pop singers to swinging construction deals for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Under South Korea's criminal litigation law, which requires suspects to be either indicted or released within 20 days of their arrest, prosecutors have until Nov. 20 to formally charge Choi. Ahn Jong-beom, Park's former senior secretary for policy coordination, who allegedly pressured companies into donating large funds to two nonprofits Choi controlled, could also be indicted by the end of next week, said a prosecution official, who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. There is also a possibility that prosecutors will eventually investigate Park, who in a televised apology last week said she would accept a direct investigation into her actions. Under South Korean law, the president has immunity from prosecution except in cases of treason, but she can be investigated. Park has 15 months left in her term. If she steps down before the end of it, an election must be held within 60 days. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

For 21 years, Marguerite LeHand was Franklin Delano Roosevelt's secretary, nurse, cheerleader, adviser and possibly lover. ""Missy,"" as FDR's children nicknamed her, was so crucial to FDR's life and career that he split the income from his estate evenly between her and his wife, Eleanor. But LeHand kept no diary or records, and destroyed her letters. From the time she entered FDR's service in 1920, her focus was on the man she called ""FD."" Journalist Kathryn Smith's biography of LeHand presents her as she apparently saw herself: a satellite to the era's star. Coming into Roosevelt's circle when a former boss plucked her from government work to join Roosevelt's staff as he ran for vice president on the 1920 Democratic ticket, LeHand so impressed Eleanor that after the Democrats' spectacular loss, she asked the young woman to work at the family's Hyde Park, N.Y., home. From there, LeHand became FDR's private secretary. She stayed at his side for the next two decades, answering his mail, nursing him through ill health, cheering on his dream of a health resort in rural Georgia. She accompanied FDR on his long rehabilitation vacations in the early 1920s: In the 116 weeks between 1924 and 1928 that FDR was away from his home and family, his mother was with him for two of those weeks, Eleanor for four and LeHand for 110. When FDR was elected governor of New York in 1929, LeHand was at his side, standing on call 24 hours a day for the four years he held that office.  From Albany, LeHand accompanied the Roosevelts to the White House, where she had her own suite and mediated between the president and his wife and children. She worked in a cubbyhole adjoining the Oval Office, where she monitored FDR's mail and calls and provided private access to the president. Deeply involved in policy discussions, she suggested the appointment of FDR's attorney general and the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. When Time magazine ran a 1934 story about FDR's inner circle, LeHand and three men were on the cover. She was the first person in the White House to hear that Germany had invaded Poland, but she would not be at FDR's side during World War II. A massive stroke in June 1941 incapacitated her until her death in 1944 at age 47. Was LeHand FDR's secretary? Lover? Adviser? Who knew? The 1920s ushered in the New Woman who smoked and drank, wore short skirts, and had a career. How did such a woman engage in politics? People tried to fit LeHand into a traditional mold, referring to her as a sort of super-secretary and noting her clothing. ""Superficially the most modern of modern women, she actually is like the old-fashioned wife and mother, sacrificing herself on the altar of duty and service,"" one reporter wrote. ""For her work has taken the place of husband and children and her office is her home.""    ""The Gatekeeper: Missy LeHand, FDR, and the Untold Story of the Partnership That Defined a Presidency,"" by Kathryn Smith E (Touchstone)  This confusion served LeHand well, enabling the child of Irish immigrants to become second only to Eleanor as the most powerful woman in America. That confusion extends less successfully to Smith's biography. Hampered by LeHand's own determination to keep the spotlight on FDR, Smith has had to tell LeHand's story by examining her few extant letters, her charm bracelets and some film clips, and by presenting the era's larger history, a task at which she excels. Smith has written a highly readable jaunt through some of the nation's most trying years. She offers a quick and lucid account of Irish immigration, Massachusetts and Georgia history, the Great Crash, and FDR's New Deal. But the star of the story remains firmly who LeHand wanted it to be: FDR. LeHand's clothing, love interests and calendar take up more space in her biography than her intellect and power. But LeHand was a politician above all. While Smith suggests that she avoided marriage because inevitable pregnancies would strain a heart weakened by rheumatic fever, it seems likely that this daughter of immigrants, so extraordinarily talented that she continually caught the eye of superiors, built for herself the only political career open to her. By sitting at FDR's side, arguing, laughing, cajoling and adoring, she helped to create the New Deal. One observer noted that she was at once ""the efficient secretary, the helpful and lively participant in a policy conference, or the gracious hostess at the Roosevelt table."" ""Missy,"" FDR often said, ""is my conscience."" All this from a woman who once told a reporter that she ""would hate to be mixed up in politics.""  The New Deal years offered women a political foothold. While Smith tends to dismiss Eleanor Roosevelt as a high-minded harpy whose painful confrontations with FDR were counterproductive, in fact Eleanor was even more central to her husband's career than LeHand. Eleanor hated the glad-handing of politics, but she made constant social calls to advance FDR's standing, joined him on the campaign trail and saved his nomination in 1936 by making an appeal directly to the convention. The first lady was the human face of the FDR bureaucracy, winning women and African Americans to the New Deal coalition.  Women first entered government service during the Civil War, and by the time FDR took office they were ubiquitous. Louise Hackmeister ran the White House switchboard; Malvina ""Tommy"" Thompson was Eleanor's personal secretary. Legions of other women, making half a man's salary, performed the backroom duties that kept the government running. Phone calls, letters and access to officials all went through them. Exactly what that meant for government remains obscure, but it is certain they were vital to the structure and substance of American politics. LeHand was more than FDR's ""Girl Friday,"" as Smith calls her. In New Deal America, political women had to define what it meant to be a female politician. LeHand attached herself to a star and stayed in his shadow as she helped change America. Smith's biography represents her subject perfectly.
