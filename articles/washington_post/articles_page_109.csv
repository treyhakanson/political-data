And he could be right.	"      The Post's Dan Balz explores some of the factors behind President-elect Donald Trump's victory against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   This post has been updated with Trump's tweets. Democrats are taking solace in the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 election. Some supporters are even using this fact to implore Trump's electors to overturn the result of the electoral college and install Clinton as the rightful president. And Trump himself on Sunday night reiterated that he preferred the popular-vote method: ""I'm not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes."" The reactions to that comment were similar -- that Trump would have lost the election under his own preferred format!   I totally agree with Donald Trump that the popular vote winner should determine the Presidency. -- Neera Tanden (@neeratanden) November 14, 2016     Trump says he would rather see a simple popular vote determine the president, which means he would have lost. @60Minutes -- Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) November 14, 2016   Except, it's impossible to know that for sure. The fact is that just because Trump lost the popular vote last week doesn't mean he would have lost a popular-vote election. What do I mean by that? Basically, losing the popular vote in an electoral-college election isn't the same as losing the popular vote in a popular-vote election. The former involves a very specific strategy that may cost you when it comes to winning the nationwide popular vote. But you pursue that strategy because the latter doesn't matter. You need to get to 270 electoral votes, not a majority or plurality of all votes. An electoral-college election involves making explicit appeals to and advertising in around 10 or 12 out of the 50 states. It means Trump didn't campaign or advertise in California or Massachusetts or Washington state and that Clinton didn't campaign in Oklahoma or even Texas (despite polling within single digits there). They knew it would be wasted effort to try to turn a 30-point loss in those states into a 22-point loss, or a 14-point loss into an eight-point loss. It also means they tailored their messages specifically to voters in key states, which happen to be disproportionately Midwestern and on the East Coast. It meant Trump had little incentive to appeal to Western voters -- outside Nevada, at least. And he pursued a very specific strategy that appealed to the key Rust Belt states that wound up delivering him the presidency. After this post went up Monday, Trump made the same argument himself in a pair of tweets Tuesday.   If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2016     The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2016   Trump is taking some liberties here. He has made his preference for the popular vote clear -- even on ""60 Minutes"" this weekend -- and it's not clear he would have done that much better in big states if it was a popular-vote election, as he asserts. But it's a valid question to ask. To be clear, it seems more likely than not that he probably would have lost a race in which the popular vote and not the electoral college decided the president. After all, he trails in the popular vote by 0.8 points, and that number is growing as results from California and other coastal states roll in. Clinton's margin is likely to grow from here -- to as much as 2 full points, according to some estimates. Would his message have been significantly different in a truly national election, in which he had to appeal to moderate Republicans in Orange County along with conservative former Democrats in coal country? Maybe. Maybe not. But California is a telling example. In fact, it's Case Study No. 1 in why Trump might lose the national popular vote by as much as he is. Numbers tallied by the Cook Political Report's David Wasserman show Trump is trailing in that state 61.5 percent to 33.2 percent. As things stand, that 28-point Democratic win is the biggest since FDR in 1936 -- bigger even than Mitt Romney's 23-point loss in 2012. It's a bloodbath, and even as Trump did better than Romney, he's doing worse in California. There are more than 4 million ballots left to count, but Clinton is already netting nearly 3 million votes in California alone -- a number that is bigger than her overall 728,000-vote lead in the nationwide popular vote. Possibly contributing to Trump's poor performance in the state is the fact that the only other statewide race -- an open Senate contest -- featured two Democrats running against one another after both advanced under California's unusual ""top-two"" primary system. But if Trump simply would have taken 37 percent of the vote in California -- the same as Romney took in 2012 -- he would be about tied with Clinton in the national popular vote. And that's just an adjustment of about four points in one inconsequential (albeit huge) presidential state. Those were votes, of course, that neither he nor his campaign needed, and so they didn't even try to get them. Had he and Clinton both sought them and made direct appeals to Californians, perhaps the margin would have been similar. But we'll never know for sure. What we do know, though, is that less-competitive states tend to have lower turnout. According to the United States Election Project, several swing states ranked in the top 10 in turnout: New Hampshire, Iowa, Wisconsin, Colorado, Virginia and Florida. California ranks 44th in turnout. Only an estimated 53 percent of its eligible voters have had their ballots counted (including the four-plus million that haven't been tallied). Making states like California consequential seems likely to draw a significantly different -- or at least significantly expanded -- electorate. Trump's deficit is growing and could soon be historically large for the winner of the electoral college. But it's simply impossible to say for sure that it means he would have lost a popular-vote election."

Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in October, after an upwardly-revised 1 percent gain in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The two-month increase was the largest since the spring of 2014. The numbers suggest that the economy may grow more quickly in the final three months of the year than many economists had expected. Retail sales are closely watched as a sign of consumer health. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of the economy. Steady hiring and emerging signs of solid pay increases have made Americans more confident and willing to spend. The unemployment rate fell last month to a low 4.9 percent and in October, workers saw the biggest annual pay gain since the end of the recession. And while many companies, such as Dunkin Donuts, blamed their own weak sales figures in the late summer and fall on consumer concerns surrounding the election, Tuesday's figures show that the presidential campaign had little impact overall.  ""If electoral uncertainty were restraining activity prior to last Tuesday, it is nowhere apparent in the consumer spending data,"" JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli said. Revisions to September and August data indicate that consumers spent more than previously estimated in the July-September quarter, Feroli said. That means growth in the third quarter may have been as high as 3.2 percent, he estimated, above the 2.9 percent figure reported last month. Some of the biggest sales increases were in autos and gas, with higher prices boosting gas station sales. Even excluding those categories, however, sales rose 0.6 percent in October and 0.5 percent the previous month. Auto sales rose a healthy 1.1 percent, though many dealers relied on steep discounts. Sales of home and garden supplies also rose 1.1 percent in October, a positive sign that more Americans are remodeling and expanding their homes. Home Depot, the nation's biggest home improvement chain, upped its outlook for the year Tuesday after beating Wall Street expectations handily. Customer transactions jumped, as did the amount they spent on each visit, the company said. Most other retailers also saw healthy increases: Grocery stores, health and personal care outlets, sporting goods retailers, clothing stores, and online and catalog retailers all reported strong sales. Online and catalog retailers are continuing to seize market share from older-line outlets such as department stores. Online and catalog sales have increased 12.9 percent in the past year, much faster than the 4.3 percent gain for all retailers. Department stores, meanwhile, have seen their sales plunge 7.3 percent in the past 12 months. Furniture stores were one of the few to report a drop in October, with sales falling 0.9 percent. Steady hiring may be boosting spending. Employers have added about 175,000 jobs a month this year, down from last year's pace but still enough to push unemployment even lower over time. That appears to be boosting consumer confidence, which has been mostly healthy in recent months. A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan rose in the first half of November. Even with solid growth in the October-December quarter, the economy has been weak this year. It expanded at just a 1.1 percent pace in the first six months of 2016. It accelerated to a 2.9 percent pace in the July-September quarter. Even with a healthier expansion in the fourth quarter, growth may not reach 2 percent for the full year.

The Commerce Department says business inventories edged up 0.1 percent in September, slower than the 0.2 percent gain seen in August. Sales were up a solid 0.7 percent, double the 0.3 percent rise in August. It was the best showing since a 1 percent gain in June. The gain in sales was evidence that the economy is gaining strength after a sluggish period at the beginning of the year. Overall economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the July-September quarter, double the 1.4 percent GDP gain in the second quarter. Economists expect solid growth this quarter. A separate report Tuesday showed that retail sales increased 0.8 percent in October following an upwardly revised 1 percent gain in September. Both increases suggested that economic growth could accelerate more in the final three months of the year. The inventory report showed that stockpiles held by retailers rose 0.2 percent in September while inventories at the wholesale level edged up 0.1 percent and stockpiles held by manufacturers were unchanged. The gain in business sales in September was led by the 1 percent increase in retail sales followed by an increase of 0.8 percent in sales at the manufacturing level. Sales by wholesalers edged up a modest 0.2 percent. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

The International Federation for Human Rights, known as FIDH, and Burundian Human Rights League ITEKA said in a report issued Tuesday that the government's recent break with the international community ""heralds a new intensification of repression and crimes against citizens who are considered hostile to the regime."" The report cited what it called several ""dramatic actions"" by Burundi's government. They include the government's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court, its denunciation of a U.N. human rights report ""damning of the regime,"" its expulsion of the African Union and three U.N. experts, and its suspension of five Burundi organizations defending human rights, including ITEKA. Burundi's government rejected the report, saying the organizations that produced it ""are aiming at regime change,"" manipulated by the opposition and using false information, said Jean Claude Karerwa Ndenzako, deputy spokesman for President Pierre Nkurunziza.  ""We are not surprised by what they say. There is nothing new,"" Karerwa told The Associated Press. War in Burundi -- which is overwhelmingly Hutu -- started in 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's first democratically elected president, a Hutu. Fighting mainly between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army resulted in the deaths of 300,000 people. A cease-fire was declared in 2006 but fighting persisted for years. The latest unrest began in April 2015 when Nkurunziza announced he was seeking a third term, which some called unconstitutional. He won re-election, and protests turned to violence. According to the new report, the human toll is now more than 1,000 dead, 8,000 detained on political grounds, between 300 and 800 people missing, hundreds tortured, thousands arrested, and hundreds of women subjected to sexual violence.  ""These abuses, committed mainly by Burundian security forces, have already forced more than 310,000 people to flee the country,"" it said. FIDH and ITEKA, which have observers in the country, said ""crimes against humanity are being committed in Burundi today."" It cited systematic arrests, summary and extrajudicial executions and torture. The groups also said soldiers from the former Tutsi-dominated army are being purged and dozens have been murdered, arrested or transferred. Senior officials also ""increasingly and brazenly denounce 'Tutsis' as enemies of the regime,"" they said. FIDH released a circular from Burundi's Senate requiring every government office and public enterprise to classify employees by ethnicity -- Tutsi, Hutu or Twa -- saying this was to conform with the agreement that ended the civil war. The rights group said such ethnic classification isn't required under the accord. In the 1994 Rwanda genocide, more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and moderate members of the Hutu majority were killed by Hutu extremists. It ended after Tutsi-led rebels ousted the extremist Hutu government that orchestrated the killings. Rwanda's government remains Tutsi-led. This year, Burundi has refused to allow the African Union to send 5,000 peacekeepers and the United Nations to deploy 228 international police. ___ Eloge Willy Kaneza contributed to this report from Bujumbura, Burundi.

""We're not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life,"" Trump declared, calling the payment of promised benefits ""honoring a deal."" But the man heading the Trump transition team's Social Security effort? Michael Korbey, a former lobbyist who has spent much of his career advocating for cutting and privatizing the program.  ""It's a failed system, broken and bankrupt,"" Korbey said as a lobbyist in the mid-1990s. Korbey acknowledged that some of the changes his group backed would hurt retirees, but ""our constituents aren't just senior citizens,"" he told a newspaper in 1996. A decade later, as a senior adviser to the Social Security Administration, Korbey was an advocate for the George W. Bush administration's failed attempt to privatize Social Security. Korbey is just one example of apparent discord between Trump's populist economic platform and the people who have been put in charge of planning to carry it out. While there are some true Washington outsiders on the team -- such as Dan DiMicco, a former steel industry executive who is Trump's transition head for the office of U.S. Trade Representative -- many of the players are familiar from the Republican economic establishment. The mix indicates a strong leaning toward rolling back much of the Obama administration's post-financial collapse changes, and a general posture toward deregulation. The team will not necessarily carry over into the Trump administration -- though members of past transition teams often have. Instead, they are in charge of putting together hiring recommendations, working with outgoing appointees and laying the groundwork for administration's opening months. Bill Walton, one of the two people overseeing the economic transition effort, is the former chief executive for Allied Capital, a financial firm that was sold after nearly failing during the financial crisis. He is both a trustee for the Heritage Foundation and a senior fellow at another conservative organization, the Discovery Institute. David Malpass, who is overseeing both the Treasury Department staffing and part of the broader economic issues portfolio, was Bear Stearns' chief economist in the years leading up to its collapse. In August 2007, as U.S. economic growth ground to a halt and the debt markets shuddered, he wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled ""Don't Panic About the Credit Market.""  ""Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the U.S. economy, or of job creation,"" the piece declared, predicting continued economic growth and dismissing concerns that recent growth had been dependent on the housing bubble. Eight months later, Bear Stearns collapsed, unable to withstand the toxic combination of overheated home prices and shoddily assembled debt that Malpass dismissed. But Malpass landed on his feet, founding a consulting firm called Encima Partners. Since then, he's faulted both the Federal Reserve's monetary response to the financial crisis and regulations intended to prevent future such calamities. In a 2010 National Review article titled ""Chris Dodd's Big, Misguided Bill,"" Malpass argued against the value of creating the consumer financial protection bureau, writing that the Obama administration should ""streamline and concentrate"" existing consumer protection regulators, a step that he said ""would result in a reduction of government jobs."" In Paul Atkins, Trump has found a leading proponent of the theory that government should get out of the financial industry's way. Appointed to the Securities and Exchange commission in July 2002 at the height of the era's corporate accounting scandals, he was considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure. Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies for allegedly fraudulent conduct, contending that they don't effectively deter crime. And in 2005, he defended the practice of backdating stock options -- a practice in which executives paid themselves for fictitious outperformance in their companies' stocks. Numerous executives went to jail for those activities -- but Atkins caused a stir by saying he found nothing objectionable about it. In the years that led up to the financial crisis, Atkins warned of dangers posed by ""enacting regulations that supplant the market's judgment."" Among the initiatives he successfully backed at the SEC was a loosening of leverage restrictions on investment banks, a step that allowed firms like Bear Stearns and Lehman brothers to borrow more money and invest it in mortgage-backed securities. Atkins resigned in August of 2008, and now runs a financial services industry consulting firm. But he has maintained his vigorously pro-market stance.  ""We all know that overregulation can ""kill the goose that laid the golden egg,"" he said in a 2012 speech opposing the regulation of money market funds. ___ Associated Press writer Marcy Gordon contributed to this report.

The group quickly poured millions into the state. The Clinton campaign did similarly, and on the eve of the election, aides sent in Clinton herself, as well as her top surrogate, President Obama. It was too late. Clinton's failure to attract enough supporters in Michigan and its Rust Belt neighbors Wisconsin and Pennsylvania cost her the election -- and shocked the world. And while many reasons have been offered up, both inside and outside the campaign, one reality has emerged in the days since Clinton's stunning loss, according to many Democrats interviewed for this article: a series of strategic mistakes, including some made in the final two weeks, probably sealed the deal. One error was to stick with a long-standing, one-dimensional campaign strategy: attacking Donald Trump. That strategy had been devised despite overwhelming evidence, not only in Trump's rise but also in Clinton's struggles during the Democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, that the electorate was looking for political and economic change.     Only 107,000 votes in three states decided the election. View Graphic     Only 107,000 votes in three states decided the election.  Another problem, some said, was to devote resources in states Clinton did not need to win -- notably Arizona -- instead of shoring up support in deep-blue states, notably the Rust Belt, that she did need. ""Why go to Arizona? Who the hell needs Arizona?"" said Lou D'Allesandro, a state senator and Clinton supporter from New Hampshire, where Clinton appears to have narrowly prevailed Tuesday. ""You go to Michigan. You go to Pennsylvania. You play to your strengths in this business."" The lack of enthusiasm for Clinton among the Democratic voters who carried Obama to victory twice could not be overcome with a campaign message focused so heavily on Trump's divisiveness, said David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Obama's presidential campaigns. ""What you can't do is you can't manufacture enthusiasm,"" Axelrod said. ""There was an assumption that antipathy toward Trump would be enough to mobilize the base . . . a certain lethargy that sets in when you've had the White House for eight years. Your troops are just not as hungry."" Axelrod added that ""too much was assumed in the industrial Midwest."" In the end, even as the campaign shifted resources and sent surrogates back into the Rust Belt, the message remained the same: Trump lacked the temperament to be president and was unfit for office. To the bafflement of Democrats in Wisconsin, for instance, the late Clinton push there did not mirror the economic messaging of the local labor unions. One played back Trump's worst remarks about women; another, his mocking of a reporter with a physical disability; the last, a warning from a nuclear technician who worried that a reckless President Trump would start a war.     In a crucial Democratic stronghold, Trump surged. Clinton didn';t. View Graphic     In a crucial Democratic stronghold, Trump surged. Clinton didn';t.  That decision was backed by data showing that voters reacted most strongly to his controversial comments. But it did little to motivate Clinton's base of supporters, especially when they were faced with questions about her judgment in using a private email server as secretary of state. Again, in Wisconsin, the results proved the case -- a state where Clinton did not make a single stop during the general election. Clinton's margin in Milwaukee, for instance, which boasts a heavily African American electorate that Democrats rely on to carry the state, far underperformed that of Obama in 2012. Trump, meanwhile, earned a similar vote count as 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. He won the state not because he outperformed his predecessor but because Clinton underperformed hers. ""You can test a whole set of arguments against Donald Trump and always the top attacks on him had to do with temperament,"" said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who worked on several down-ballot races in this cycle. ""But you can have things that test well but don't move people to vote."" ""Obviously we don't know if it would have been different if she had a more consistent economic message,"" Greenberg added, ""but I think it's hard to win without it."" Clinton made a pledge to build ""an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,"" a mantra in nearly every speech while promising to be rebuild the middle class and create more pathways into it. She outlined myriad plans and proposals that she said would help deliver new jobs and rebuild U.S. manufacturing. Yet, there was no simple or overarching message that tied it all together. As a rallying cry against economic injustice, a pledge to be ""the small-business president,"" for example, sounded bloodless. Even among minority voters disinclined to vote for Trump, that message fell short. ""Pre-election research showed that among African Americans, their feelings of economic optimism were precipitously lower in this election than in 2012,"" said Geoff Garin, a pollster for Priorities USA who conducted this research independently of the super PAC. ""And their feeling that Clinton's economic policies would help people like them were substantially lower. ""Those kinds of things affect people's willingness to come out to vote."" Some Democrats inside and outside of the campaign say that there is little Clinton could have done to stop the slide even if she had spent more time campaigning in Wisconsin and Michigan. The forces that caused her loss in the upper Midwest were also at work in places where her campaign sent her far more often and invested huge amounts of money, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida. In some instances, there were factors in play beyond the control of the campaign. When the decision was made to send Obama to Michigan on the eve of the election, Democrats there counseled to send him to Detroit, where enthusiasm among the party's African American base was sagging. But a funeral scheduled on Monday for a police office killed in a hit-and-run made that logistically messy, so Obama went to Ann Arbor instead. By the time the campaign realized Clinton was in trouble there, it was too late. In the end, although Clinton won Detroit's Wayne County in a landslide, she underperformed Obama there by 78,000 votes -- vastly more than her statewide losing margin of roughly 11,000. In calls with surrogates and donors this week, top Clinton aides and Clinton herself focused instead on a letter to Congress from FBI Director James B. Comey 11 days before the election. In it, Comey said the bureau had found a new trove of emails from Clinton's private server that warranted examination. In the end, Comey declared that the investigation into her use of the server while secretary of state would remain closed. According to the campaign, that was too little, too late. ""It affected us a couple of ways. First, it blocked out the sun. We really weren't able to break through for a couple of days,"" communications director Jennifer Palmieri said on one such call Friday. And secondly, the issues stirred up distaste among some voters, she said. ""It adds to people who had doubts about the ticket, or it certainly didn't help."" On Saturday, Clinton laid blame squarely at Comey's feet. She told top donors in a farewell call that the first FBI letter reopening the email inquiry stopped her momentum -- and the second one shutting it down again, something that should have been good news, served to energize Trump voters. ""There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful. But our analysis is that Jim Comey's letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum,"" Clinton said. ""Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would -- saying there was no there there -- was a real motivator"" for angry or disappointed Trump voters to turn out, she said. After Comey's Oct. 28 announcement, Clinton's standing with suburban, college-educated voters plummeted across the board, undermining the centerpiece of her electoral strategy. Clinton's aides also believe that the renewed attention to the email story helped dampen enthusiasm among her base voters. Democrats have long complained that the campaign failed to address the email issue swiftly over a year ago, and those frustrations bubbled over after her loss Tuesday. ""She should've apologized for that earlier, and people would have understood,"" D'Allesandro said. ""We all make mistakes. That's why pencils have erasers."" Instead, he said, ""the email situation kept coming up and coming up and coming up, and it came back up again at the last hour."" The road for Clinton had always been difficult. She was historically disliked, outdone narrowly in that characteristic only by Trump. And in seeking the presidency, she was asking voters to sign off on a third Democratic term, a historically difficult task for any governing party. It was ""a very proficient campaign with a very freighted candidate,"" Axelrod said. ""Not a great candidate, and not a great candidate in a time of change."" Clinton also spent time and resources over the summer urging Republicans to abandon Trump, but exit polls showed that 90 percent stuck with the party's nominee. ""The general election turned into a battle of negatives,"" said Jeff Weaver, Sanders's campaign manager in the primary. Weaver noted that more of Clinton's television ads could have focused on proposals such as debt-free college that have great appeal to working-class voters. ""I felt that given the strength of many of her programs, the fact that those things weren't getting sufficient attention were a problem,"" Weaver said. Exit polls and polling data conducted during the campaign found that voters were aware of and in some cases repulsed by Trump's brashness, but it was not enough to compel them to vote against him. ""There are many millions of people who did not vote for Donald Trump because of the bigotry and hate that fueled his campaign rallies,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Thursday in a speech at the AFL-CIO. ""They voted for him despite the hate. They voted for him out of frustration and anger -- and also out of hope that he would bring change."" Sanders said, ""The simple truth is a lot of the Democratic base did not come out to vote,"" noting that white working-class voters deserting the Democratic Party is a ""humiliation"" for the party. Asked whether he could have beaten Trump, Sanders said: ""I hesitate to be a Monday morning quarterback."" But he added: ""In my heart of hearts, I think there's a good chance I could have defeated Trump, but who knows.""  This story has been updated.

The 2016 election has brought a moment of reckoning -- and a new era to the party.  Democrats have been shut out of power in Washington, with the White House and both chambers of Congress in GOP control starting in January. In state houses across the country, their ranks have been decimated.  And for the first time in a quarter-century, there will be no one named Clinton in the Oval Office or on deck. Obama and Vice President Biden are also moving offstage. That is certain to set off a struggle for the soul and direction of the party -- and give an opening for other leaders to fill the void in a party with a thin bench.     As a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to dismantle some of President Obama's key achievements. Washington Post White House reporter David Nakamura breaks down what the Obama administration is worried about going forward. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   Incoming Senate minority leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) is a talented legislator and skillful politician who is always eager to take the spotlight. But he is not likely to be the party's entire answer.  ""I think there's going to be a fight in the Democratic Party about which direction to go in,"" political consultant Joe Trippi said. ""That's healthy for the party long-term, but it's going to be painful over the next few years. There won't be a Democratic president to hold the factions together."" In particular, Trump's victory over former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is certain to embolden the party's liberal wing.   [Obama's journey to become a leader of consequence]  Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), who challenged Clinton for the Democratic nomination, has argued, with questionable plausibility, that he would have been a stronger standard-bearer against Trump. He was a harsher critic of Wall Street and a more full-throated foe of free-trade deals. The left says that the Democrats' salvation is to reclaim their New Deal roots and move the party onto a more populist footing, as championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The lesson of their defeat by Donald Trump is that ""Democrats need to speak more directly to voter anger,"" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ""They'll hopefully remold the party in Elizabeth Warren's image and have a more authentic message that channels that anger in a more productive direction than Donald Trump's authoritarian message.""     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump View Graphic     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump  An electoral shutout has added new urgency to an argument that has been going on within the party, in one form or other, since the 1980s. The danger of all this is that the Democrats could move too far left and give Republicans space in the center. ""The question is, can left-wing populism really beat right-wing populism? There's no argument for that,"" said Matt Bennett, a senior vice president of the centrist organization Third Way.   Trump is unorthodox in his views -- his victory speech focused on rebuilding America, rebuilding roads and bridges and airports and hospitals.  Republicans probably benefited from not having to run a hard-right candidate as their nominee. That, however, means it is far more difficult for the opposition party to figure out precisely what it is to oppose.  What is undeniable, however, is that there has been a systematic erosion of Democratic power during Obama's eight years in office, and particularly from the heady days of his early presidency. ""I think of this job as being a relay runner,"" Obama said Wednesday morning, as he pondered the results of the election. ""You take the baton, you run your best race. And hopefully, by the time you hand it off, you're a little further ahead, you've made a little progress."" In purely partisan terms, however, the opposite has happened.  Trump's candidacy appealed to voters, including traditional blue-collar Democrats, who believe they have been left behind in the belated economic recovery from the financial meltdown that was occurring as Obama was elected in 2008.  ""His administration delivered to Wall Street, and did not to Main Street,"" said former congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), an ardent liberal. ""The Democrats were basically obtuse to this, because it was all about winning and holding power, and it was not about deliverables to the American people."" In Obama's first year in office, buoyed by the biggest presidential election victory since 1988, the Democrats expanded their House majority to 257-178; in the Senate, they could count a filibuster-proof majority for the first time since the Jimmy Carter era.  As a result, their numbers were robust enough to muscle through virtually all of Obama's early agenda, most notably his health-care overhaul. They lost control, however, in the devastating midterm election of 2010, which was fueled in large part by a backlash against the health-care law and government bailouts of Wall Street and industry. Democrats' numbers further eroded in 2014.  Democrats' hopes of regaining the Senate were dashed on Tuesday, when Trump's victory provided a badly needed updraft for a handful of endangered GOP incumbents.   [Republicans keep control of Congress after decisive Senate wins]   The lesson: Without Obama himself on the ballot, his army of young and minority voters would not show up in numbers needed to keep his party afloat.  Unlike Franklin Roosevelt's durable New Deal coalition, the impressive political operation that Obama built does not appear transferrable to other Democrats -- and therefore, may not live on past his presidency. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the math is undeniable, if perplexing. ""There are a lot of people . . . who voted for Barack Obama in 2008, who voted for his reelection in 2012, and voted for Donald Trump in 2016,"" Earnest said. ""I don't have an explanation for that, to put it bluntly."" Meanwhile, the party has also been hollowed out in state capitals across the country. Where Democrats held 29 governorships when Obama was inaugurated, they can count only 15 in the wake of Tuesday's election. In 2017, Republicans could tie the record for controlling governorships, which is 34, set in 1922 when Warren Harding was president. (One governor is an independent, and a recount is possible in North Carolina, where the Democrat has a narrow lead.) During the Obama presidency, more than 900 Democratic state legislators were defeated.  On Tuesday, Republicans picked up additional legislative chambers, and continued to make gains in state houses, with 24 states now having the ""trifecta"" control of both houses of the state legislature and the governor's mansion. The victories for the GOP Tuesday included picking up the Kentucky House for the first time in almost a century and gaining control of the Iowa Senate.  Republican gains at the state level have unnerved Democrats and led to the launch this year of an effort designed to restore Democratic state-level power in advance of the 2020 Census and the redistricting that follows.  The new initiative, called the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, will be led by former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. It was launched in August with strong backing from the White House.   Dan Balz and Alice Crites contributed to this report.  "

(All times EST): 6:50 p.m. Bernie Sanders says he's prepared to work with Donald Trump to help the working class, but will ""vigorously oppose"" other policies promised by the president-elect. The independent Vermont senator has released a statement noting Trump ""tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media."" He says that if Trump ""is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him."" But Sanders adds that if Trump ""pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him."" Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, and supported her candidacy after she won that race. ___ 6:40 p.m. The White House says Melania Trump will meet with first lady Michelle Obama on Thursday morning. President Barack Obama has invited Donald Trump to the White House as the two leaders prepare for the transition of power following a bruising, often nasty presidential election. Obama's meeting with the president-elect will take place in the Oval Office, while the first lady and Mrs. Trump will meet in the residence of the White House. Obama says former President George W. Bush could not have been more gracious after his 2008 election victory and he has instructed his team to follow that example in preparing the way for Trump. ___ 6:30 p.m. Kansas' secretary of state says he's serving on President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. Kris Kobach, a conservative Republican, told various Kansas media outlets Wednesday he has no expectation of a role in Trump's eventual administration. But he says he's open to working for Trump, if offered. Kobach will help advise Trump on policy matters leading up to his January inauguration. He advised Trump on immigration policy during the campaign, adding to the Republican Party's platform Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Kobach also served as counsel to Attorney General John Ashcroft during the President George W. Bush's administration. ___ 5:31 p.m. Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan has captured a New Hampshire Senate seat, defeating first-term Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. The Associated Press called the race for Hassan on Wednesday. Ayotte says in a statement that she has contacted Hassan to concede the close race and offer her congratulations. She is thanking the people of New Hampshire for their support. Democrats have picked up two Republican-held Senate seats -- one in Illinois, the other in New Hampshire. They had been far more optimistic about capturing GOP seats on Election Day, but lost in Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri and North Carolina. Republicans are expected to hold the Senate seat in Louisiana in next month's contest after a Republican and Democrat advanced to the runoff. ___ 5:25 p.m. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he has no interest in at least one agenda item preferred by President-elect Donald Trump: term limits for members of Congress. Trump praised the idea during the campaign, but McConnell said Wednesday the issue is going nowhere in the Senate. The Kentucky Republican tells reporters: ""I would say we have term limits now. They're called elections. And it will not be on the agenda in the Senate."" McConnell also says he hopes Vice President-elect Mike Pence follows former Vice President Dick Cheney in attending the Senate GOP's weekly luncheons. McConnell says Cheney, a former congressman, served almost as Senate liaison for President George W. Bush. He says he hopes Pence, a former Indiana congressman, will do the same for Trump. ___ 5:09 p.m. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire has conceded and congratulated her Democratic rival Gov. Maggie Hassan. In a statement late Wednesday, Ayotte said the voters have spoken and ""now it's time for all of us to come together to get things done"" for the people of New Hampshire. Ayotte, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and leader on defense issues, said it was a tremendous privilege to serve one term. She thanked her family and supporters. The Associated Press had not called the race because Hassan had a lead of just 0.1 percent. ___ 5:05 p.m. Organizers of a comedy benefit featuring performances by John Oliver, George Lopez and others have canceled Wednesday's red carpet arrivals. A spokeswoman for the Natural Resources Defense Council's ""Night of Comedy"" benefit in New York said Wednesday afternoon that ""in light of current events, we will no longer be having the red carpet."" Seth Meyers is hosting the comedy benefit, where Mike Birbiglia and Hasan Minhaj are also performing. The event was originally billed as ""the place to be the night after the presidential election."" ___ 4:38 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has spoken to President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his upset victory over Hillary Clinton Tuesday night. A spokesman says the California Democrat told Trump that she hoped to ""find common ground where possible,"" including an infrastructure bill that could create jobs. Each of the top four leaders in Congress -- the top Democrat and Republicans in both House and Senate -- has spoken with Trump since the election. ___ 4:20 p.m. The FAA has imposed temporary flight restrictions over Donald Trump's high-rise home as a safety measure in response to his presidential victory. A notice dated Wednesday bars aircraft from flying below 2,999 feet in midtown Manhattan, where Trump Tower is located, and in parts of Brooklyn and Queens. It says military aircraft supporting the Secret Service are exempt, along with police and emergency aircraft. The FAA generally issues temporary restrictions when there's a special event or hazardous condition. The notice says the New York City air space restrictions are needed because of ""VIP movement."" They expire Jan. 21. ___ 3:25 p.m. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is proposing that she and President-elect Donald Trump ""put aside our differences"" and work together to rebuild the American economy for working people. A favorite of liberals, Warren has waged a bitter war of words with Trump. She's called him a ""pathetic coward"" and worse on Twitter. He's nicknamed her ""Pocahontas"" -- a reference to claims she made about being part Native American. As recently as Monday, Trump called Warren a ""terrible person,"" ''a terrible human being"" and a ""terrible senator."" In a statement Wednesday, Warren said the integrity of U.S. democracy is more important than an individual election. She said she hopes Trump will fulfill the role of president ""with respect and concern for every single person in this country, no matter who they are."" ___ 3:15 p.m. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says President Barack Obama has congratulated the Senate's top Republican about his party's success in maintaining its majority in the Senate. Earnest said Obama and Mitch McConnell discussed priorities that should be taken up as lawmakers meet before a new Congress takes office. They spoke Wednesday, the day after the election. While he did not have details about the issues discussed, Earnest said Obama will continue to encourage Republican leaders to take up a massive trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said the president believes the trade pact will benefit the U.S. economy. President-elect Donald Trump strongly opposes the deal. Earnest says the president also hopes to talk with House Speaker Paul Ryan. ___ 3:05 p.m. The White House says the President's Daily Brief and other intelligence materials are now being made available to President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and other members of Trump's transition team. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it's a courtesy that former President George W. Bush extended to President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and a few aides as they were preparing to take office. The President's Daily Brief is a classified document delivered to the president each morning. Until his victory Tuesday, Trump had received some classified briefings but not as extensive as what he'll now be receiving. Earnest says it's part of Obama's efforts to ensure a smooth transition. ___ 3 p.m. The Senate's top Republican isn't interested in rehashing contentious comments President-elect Donald Trump made about Hispanics during the campaign. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky wouldn't say whether he thought Trump's remarks have caused lasting damage to the Republican Party with an important demographic group. Trump has called some Mexicans rapists and criminals and had claimed that a judge might be biased against him because of the judge's Mexican heritage. Several months ago, McConnell publicly worried that Trump could push Hispanics from the party as Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater had done with blacks in the 1964 election. McConnell said: ""We should look forward and not backward and rehash and re-litigate the various debates we had both internally and with the Democrats over the past year."" ___ 2:45 p.m. White House spokesman Josh Earnest is disputing the notion that Thursday's meeting between President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump will have an air of insincerity about it given the harsh things they've said about each other. Earnest said ""I'm not saying it's going to be an easy meeting."" But he said the president is sincere about fulfilling a basic responsibility he has to ensure a smooth transition of power. Earnest said the success of America's democracy depends on all citizens setting aside their partisan affiliations and political preferences, and rooting for the success of the American president. During the campaign, Obama had called Trump unfit and unqualified. ___ 2:25 p.m. Donald Trump is spending the day after winning the presidency holed up in Trump Tower, where sleep-deprived aides appear jubilant as they come and go. The usually buzzing lobby of Trump's residence and campaign headquarters is currently closed to the general public, though an impersonator of the famous ""Naked Cowboy"" --wearing a robe -- was at one point spotted strolling through. The scene outside is chaotic, with protesters and a mass of press gathered in penned-off area. Curious onlookers are clogging foot traffic as they pause to take in the scene. The east side of Manhattan's busy Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th is also closed to the public with dump trucks filled with dirt forming a protective barrier outside the building's lobby. ___ 1:58 p.m. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says President Barack Obama's top priority following Tuesday's election is not his legacy. Earnest says the president is focused on the 20 million people who gained health insurance after the Affordable Care Act went into effect. Earnest is taking questions from reporters about how the election results will affect Obama's legacy on issues such as health care and climate change. Earnest says the president is also concerned about the prospect of protections being stripped from millions of Americans who benefit because health insurers are not allowed to discriminate based on pre-existing health conditions or impose a lifetime cap on expenses. Earnest says the tearing away those protections would negatively affect a lot of people, and ""that's something Republicans will have to consider moving forward.""

Hogan (R) endorsed a handful of Republican congressional candidates, none of whom came close to winning their races in the heavily Democratic state. And he very publicly refused to vote for Donald Trump, his party's presidential nominee, who lost Maryland by a large margin but stunned the country with an upset victory. Maryland Democrats, still reeling from Hogan's 2014 win and soaring approval ratings, were thrilled that the governor's slate lost by large margins -- although Senate candidate Kathy Szeliga and House candidate Aime Hoeber secured more votes than initially expected. Szeliga lost the Senate seat being vacated by Barbara A. Mikulski (D) to Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D), capturing 36 percent of the vote to Van Hollen's 60 percent. Hoeber lost to Rep. John Delaney (D) by 15 percentage points.  [See full Maryland election results]  ""We saw Maryland Democrats who were enthused about their candidates, and they came out and voted for them,"" said Charles R. Connor, executive director of the Maryland Democratic Party. ""We think there is a chink in [Hogan's] armor."" Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, said GOP candidates may have been hurt by appearing on the same ballot as Trump, who was broadly unpopular in the state. ""If you don't have a good top to your ticket, the down-ballot races are really affected,"" Cluster said. ""We won't have that problem in 2018, with Larry Hogan at the top of the ticket."" A recent poll by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland poll found that Hogan has a 71 percent approval rating, including heavy support among white Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who were key to his surprise 2014 victory. Some Democrats speculated that Hogan's disavowal of Trump through this campaign might affect the governor's relationship with the base of his state party, many of whom did support the GOP White House nominee. ""I see Larry Hogan in the middle of a vise grip,"" state Sen. Richard Madaleno Jr. (D-Montgomery) said as he watched election results Tuesday night. ""He ran away from their presidential nominee . . . one who talks about a fondness for revenge . . . It puts him in a very weakened spot.""  [Maryland governor is keeping his distance from state GOP]   But Todd Eberly, who is a political-science professor at St. Mary's College, said Tuesday's results -- including big wins for Trump in rural parts of the state -- are a mixed bag for Maryland politicians.  Eberly said there were ""warning signs"" for Democrats, including that they continue to lose -- ""and not narrowly"" -- entire segments of the state. ""Looking at 2018, nothing in the results says that Hogan has something to be concerned about,"" Eberly said. A the same time, he added, the fact that there will be a Republican in the White House could pose reelection challenges for the governor. ""First midterm elections of a new administration are generally bad for the party,"" Eberly said. ""The first victims typically are Republicans in blue states or Democrats in red states, and Hogan is the governor of one of the bluest states. He is going to have to contend with that reality."" Hogan spokesman Doug Mayer said the governor is ""proud of the candidates and proud of the races they ran . . . [The governor's] focus is on Maryland, doing what he has done since he got here, working for all Marylanders."" Hogan issued a statement on Wednesday congratulating Trump and pledging to work with his administration to ""find real solutions to the problems we face as a country."" Mayer said the governor reached out directly on Wednesday to Vice President-elect Mike Pence and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a friend and ally. Hogan backed Christie (R) at the start of the 2016 campaign, raising money and campaigning for him during the GOP primary in New Hampshire.  [Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan voted for his dad for president]   After Christie left the race and endorsed Trump, Hogan pronounced himself ""disgusted with national politics"" and said he would not pick another candidate to support publicly. In June, the governor said that he would vote for neither Trump nor Hillary Clinton, saying he did not ""think either party put up its best candidate."" On Tuesday, he said he wrote in the name of his father, Larry Hogan Sr., a former member of Congress from Maryland and Prince George's county executive.  Josh Hicks contributed to this report. "
