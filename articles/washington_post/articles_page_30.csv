Another got off easy with only time served plus probation. It fell to U.S. District Judge Michael Davis to mete out justice in the long-running case, which targeted a group of young male friends in Minnesota's large Somali community who prosecutors say helped radicalize each other, watching hours of violent propaganda videos, including beheadings and burnings. Some friends made it to Syria. These nine, whom Davis considered to be nothing less than a ""terrorist cell"" that needed to be stopped, were caught. Davis' spectrum of sentences is expected to set the pattern for other Islamic State-related terrorism cases across the country -- only about half of 110 have been resolved, according to Karen Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University School of Law. He provided some ""much needed"" rationale behind his decisions, too, Greenberg said. He partly followed a standard legal pattern in which defendants who cooperate get less time and those who don't get the harshest sentences, she said. But Davis made it clear early on that he wanted to take a nuanced approach due to the age range -- 19 to 22 -- treating defendants individually and looking for alternatives to incarceration when appropriate. He even traveled to Germany to meet with a noted deradicalization expert.  ""The message he's sending is we can do intervention and here's how to do it. We've been waiting for it for a long time. ... This is really taking the lead nationally,"" she said. The defendant Davis considered most amenable to rehabilitation, Abdullahi Yusuf, 20, was sentenced to time served, 21 months. Abdirizak Warsame, 21, got 21/2 years with credit for 11 months served. Both men cooperated with the investigation and testified against the group despite strong pressure from within their community. Davis said he'll personally keep close watch over their 20 years' supervised release. Yusuf and Warsame were among the six defendants Davis had evaluated by the German deradicalization expert, Daniel Koehler, who also trained local parole officers in his methods. A local civic engagement group also has been working with Yusuf. Davis, who has overseen all of Minnesota's terrorism cases, including several cases earlier involving the Somalia-based terror group al-Shabab, expressed dismay several times in court that no deradicalization programs exist within the federal prison system. So, getting the men programming to keep them from returning to the path of violent jihad meant keeping them out of prison.  ""I hope I'm not wrong,"" Davis told Yusuf at his sentencing Monday. Davis appeared to be less pained sentencing those who refused to cooperate, particularly the three who went to trial instead of pleading guilty. Two received 30 years apiece. Guled Omar, 22, a leader of the group, got 35. Three of the four who pleaded guilty but did not cooperate got 10 years; the fourth got 15. Some have already filed appeal notices. All nine expressed deep regrets. But Davis, the state's first black federal judge, has seen a lot in his 33 years on the bench, including 22 as a federal judge. He wasn't moved by Omar's tearful contrition.  ""Everything you have said here, I don't believe,"" Davis told him Wednesday. Despite Davis' explanations, the wide range of sentences was confusing to many people, especially the longer prison terms, said Mohamud Noor, executive director of the Confederation of Somali Community in Minnesota.  ""It's something many people are still processing,"" Noor said. Building trust between law enforcement and the Somali community has been a priority for U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger, who oversaw the prosecutions and launched an initiative to counter terrorist recruiting. But there's a long road ahead, Noor said, and the heightened anti-Islamic sentiment in today's political climate isn't helping. Still, he said, the work must continue.  ""We want to move beyond. We want to move to the healing process. We want to move to closure,"" Noor said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Marcos' widow, Imelda, clad in black, thanked supporters and local officials who traveled by bus from Marcos' northern home province to pay their respects. She said they had given her family strength as they kept the hope for nearly 30 years to have Marcos buried at the country's Heroes' Cemetery, which is reserved for former presidents, national artists and soldiers. Thousands of pro-democracy activists who rallied in Manila on Friday said the decades-long debate over Marcos' final resting place was far from over, and they were planning more protests in the days and weeks ahead. President Rodrigo Duterte, who gave the go-ahead for the burial, appealed for calm.  ""I know Ferdinand will at last be at rest here at the Heroes' Cemetery,"" Imelda Marcos said in front of a black tomb surrounded by wreaths of white flowers. ""But I know we still have a lot of criticisms to face."" Her daughter, Ilocos Norte provincial Gov. Imee Marcos, and son Sen. Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. also thanked supporters and apologized for keeping the burial secret. The son said there were reports that anti-Marcos groups would create trouble. The burial threatens to open old wounds in the Philippines, where Marcos' 20-year iron-fist rule was marked by massive human rights violations and corruption. He was ousted in ""people power"" street protests in 1986 that sent him and his family into exile in Hawaii, where he died three years later. Vice President Leni Robredo, who ran in May elections under Duterte's rival party, questioned why the burial was carried out even before a Supreme Court decision allowing it has become final.  ""We are alarmed by the brazenness of its execution,"" she said in a speech. ""Hidden wealth, hidden human rights abuses, and now a hidden burial with complete disrespect for the rule of law."" Bonifacio Ilagan, a left-wing activist who was detained and tortured during Marcos' rule, said the dictator was buried ""like a thief in the night.""  ""This is so Marcos style. I want to rush to the cemetery to protest this. I feel so enraged,"" Ilagan told The Associated Press on Friday. A lawmaker considered asking the Supreme Court to exhume the newly buried Marcos. But Duterte, who is attending an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru, said through his spokesman that ""hopefully both sides will exercise maximum tolerance and come to terms with the burial."" The powerful Marcos family has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and after returning from U.S. exile in 1991, Imelda Marcos and two of her children eventually ran for public office and won stunning political comebacks. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ran for vice president in May and lost by a slim margin to Robredo. In 1993, Marcos' body was taken to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, where it was displayed in a glass coffin and became a tourist attraction. But his family fought for his remains to be transferred to the Heroes' Cemetery. Duterte backed Marcos' burial, saying it was his right as a president and soldier.

Less than two weeks after being elected president, he agreed to a $25 million settlement.  ""We definitely detected a change of tone and change of approach"" after the election, plaintiffs' attorney Jason Forge said when the agreement was announced Friday. About 7,000 students would be eligible for refunds if U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel approves the settlement. Under the terms, the Republican president-elect admits no wrongdoing in settling two federal class-action lawsuits in San Diego and a lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat. The agreement came 10 days before jury selection was scheduled to begin in San Diego in the oldest case, which was filed in April 2010. The complaint accused Trump University, which wasn't an accredited school, of defrauding students who paid up to $35,000 a year to enroll in programs that promised to share Trump's real estate secrets. Trump denied the allegations and said during the campaign that he would not settle. He told supporters at a May rally that he would come to San Diego to testify after winning the presidency.  ""I could have settled this case numerous times, but I don't want to settle cases when we're right. I don't believe in it. And when you start settling cases, you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as a settler,"" Trump said at the time. Trump said Saturday that he settled the lawsuit ""for a small fraction of the potential award"" because he needs to focus on the country.  ""The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!"" Trump said on Twitter. Two days after the election, Trump's lead attorney in the San Diego cases, Daniel Petrocelli, said he was ""all ears"" to settlement talks and accepted an offer to have U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller of San Diego broker negotiations. Forge said the agreement was reached an hour before a hearing for Curiel to weigh Trump's latest request to delay the trial until after the Jan. 20 inauguration. The plaintiffs' attorney said Miller's role as a mediator was ""very critical.""  ""We were at each other's throat for 61/2 years and were able to find the common ground with them and do something good there,"" Forge told reporters. The agreement canceled the trial and lifted what would probably have been a major headache for Trump as he works to fill key executive branch positions and get acquainted with foreign leaders. The trial was expected to last several weeks, guaranteeing daily news coverage of a controversy that dogged him during the campaign. Trump's political rivals seized on the lawsuits to try to portray him as dishonest and deceitful. Trump brought more attention to them by repeatedly assailing Curiel, who oversaw the San Diego cases. Trump suggested the Indiana-born judge's Mexican heritage exposed a bias. The thousands of former students covered by the San Diego lawsuits will be eligible to receive at least half and possibly all their money back, as much as $35,000, Forge said. The plaintiffs' attorneys waived their fees. Schneiderman called the agreement a ""stunning reversal"" for the president-elect, saying Trump ""fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. Today, that all changes."" Trump's attorneys said the settlement allows the president-elect to focus full attention on his transition to the White House.  ""He was willing to sacrifice his personal interests, put this behind him, and move forward,"" Petrocelli said. Alan Garten, the Trump Organization's general counsel, said he had ""no doubt"" Trump would have prevailed at trial. The lawsuits allege that Trump University gave nationwide seminars that were like infomercials, constantly pressuring people to spend more and, in the end, failing to deliver on its promises. The San Diego trial would have been pinned on whether a jury believed Trump misled customers by calling the business a university and by advertising that he hand-picked instructors. Court documents unsealed in May revealed strategies for enticing people to enroll even if they couldn't afford it. The documents outlined how employees should guide people through ""the roller coaster of emotions"" after they express interest and told employees to be ""very aggressive during these conversations to in order to push them out of their comfort zones."" Transcripts of about 10 hours of Trump depositions provided additional material to rivals, though Curiel denied a request to release video of Trump's testimony that would have likely been used in campaign attack ads. Trump acknowledged in the depositions that he played on people's fantasies, and he could not recall names of his employees despite his advertising pitch that he hand-picked them. Trump has repeatedly claimed a 98 percent customer satisfaction rate on internal surveys. Plaintiffs countered that students were asked to rate the product when they believed they still had more instruction to come and were reluctant to openly criticize their teachers on surveys that were not anonymous. The settlement came a day after watchdog groups and ethics experts who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations sent a letter to Trump urging him to make a clean break from his business to avoid ""embroiling the presidency in litigation."" One of the authors, Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer at the White House under Republican President George W. Bush, said the Trump University settlement might backfire if lawyers think Trump is eager to settle to avoid court cases while president.  ""The plaintiffs' lawyers,"" he said, ""are going to smell blood in the water."" ___ Klepper contributed from Albany, New York.

Police made him take a psychological exam.	"   (Screen grab via Kevin Allred's Twitter)  Kevin Allred was deeply distraught over the victory of President-elect Donald Trump. So, like many, the Rutgers University lecturer and self-described ""undoer of the status quo"" took to Twitter to vent his frustrations. ""Every single person that voted for Donald Trump is a racist. or saw racism as easily overlooked,"" read one tweet from last week. ""Every morning feels like a punch in the gut,"" read another. Later, he posted a GIF of someone setting an American flag on fire. ""Mood since Tuesday night,"" he said. Then, seemingly angered by the Republican president-elect's stance against gun control, he posed a question: ""Will the 2nd amendment be as cool when i buy a gun and start shooting at random white people or no?"" That last tweet caught someone's eye at Rutgers, who reported his account to university security, NJ.com reported. On Tuesday night, New York City police showed up at his Brooklyn apartment -- not to arrest him but to take him in for a psychiatric evaluation. Officers loaded him into an ambulance and he was transported to Bellevue Hospital in New York's East Side, he told the New York Daily News. Allred posted about the experience en route, saying in a series of tweets (some with language that can't be published here) that it was ""proof positive that Trump's crackdown on free speech has already begun.""   NYPD just came to my house bc Rutgers Police told them i'm a threat based on political statements i've made on campus and on twitter. -- Kevin Allred (@KevinAllred) November 16, 2016   The New York Police Department confirmed that it was, indeed, Allred's tweets that brought them to his residence after they were unable to contact him about the remarks. ""Rutgers police contacted the 94 Precinct and requested a wellness check be conducted on the professor based on comments he made in the classroom and on Twitter about killing white people,"" police said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. ""Based on these comments he was transported to Bellevue Hospital for psychological evaluation."" Allred is best known for a college course he created called ""Politicizing Beyonce,"" which he describes on his professional website as an examination of race, gender, class and sexual politics based on the music and career of the pop star. Allred calls himself a feminist author and educator and lists ""disruptive creativity"" and ""radical honesty"" among his core values. The evaluation at Bellevue lasted about two hours, and doctors quickly agreed he had no psychological problems, Allred told the Daily News ""The doctors were like, 'This is ridiculous, why did they bring you here?'"" he said. ""And I said, 'That's what I thought,' but they told me they had to do it."" Allred said one doctor told him that ""politicians say much worse on live television with no repercussions and they choose to waste resources bringing me in,"" according to BuzzFeed News. Officials at Rutgers told NJ.com that an unidentified student filed a complaint about him but did not provide further details. ""The Rutgers University Police Department responded to a complaint from a student and took all appropriate action,"" university spokesman E.J. Miranda said. By the time Allred was released, people were already erupting over the now-deleted tweet. His account was temporarily suspended. Some users sent him death threats. Allred said he only meant to expose a ""double standard"" about gun control and had no intention of hurting anybody. He conceded that what he wrote was ""incendiary,"" but he accused police of ""intimidation"" over remarks he said were protected by the First Amendment.   YES, my 2nd amendment tweet was incendiary but completely w/in free speech. ZERO direct threat involved. posed as a rhetorical question. -- Kevin Allred (@KevinAllred) November 16, 2016     that tweet was not a threat. it was a hyperbolic question posed to show a double standard-look at context/tone of most every tweet i make. -- Kevin Allred (@KevinAllred) November 16, 2016     expressing anger/rage over politics in whatever form online is MUCH DIFFERENT than making a distinct plan to kill real people. -- Kevin Allred (@KevinAllred) November 17, 2016     @KevinAllred I agree it was protected, but it was quite different than what I expected based on your description of events. pic.twitter.com/i6rEEAWnai -- (((Popehat))) (@Popehat) November 16, 2016   Allred said that on Wednesday morning he had returned to Rutgers to teach classes.

The union that represents city teachers posted the plan on its website and distributed it via an email newsletter to its more than 6,000 members. The school district has more than 57,000 students. It is unclear how many teachers have used the plan outlined by a Mission High School teacher, but it appears to have the tacit support of city education officials. School district spokeswoman Gentle Blythe said the plan is optional and not part of the official curriculum.  ""Educators are entrusted to create lessons that reflect the California standards, support students' social and emotional well-being and foster inclusive and safe school communities,"" she said in a statement that neither praised nor rebuked the lesson plan. San Francisco schools serve diverse populations and teachers are encouraged to include multiple perspectives in lessons, she said. The Republican Party in San Francisco reacted sharply.  ""It's inappropriate on every level,"" said Harmeet Dhillon, an RNC committeewoman from California. She called it ""inappropriate propaganda that unfairly demonizes not only the campaign that Donald Trump, the winner, ran, but also all of the people who voted for him."" The lesson plan was written by social studies teacher Fakhra Shah, who said she hadn't planned for it to spread citywide -- that was a step taken by the teacher's union. She wrote it at 2 a.m. Nov. 9, just hours after results came in, to help teachers at her school struggling with how to answer students' questions and concerns about Trump becoming president.  ""I think a lot of people were lost for words, wondering, 'What do we say? What do we do?' "" said Shah, whose Latino, African American, white, Muslim and LGBTQ students are worried about a surge in hate crimes since the election.  ""We're calling him out,"" she said. ""If he's our president, I have the right to hold him accountable and ask him to take a stance that is anti-hate and anti-racist."" The plan encourages teachers to let students express their concerns and to offer them hope and tell students that they can keep fighting. ""We can uplift ourselves (and) fight oppression here at school even if we cannot control the rest of the country,"" she said. San Francisco is diverse, with many students whose families are in the country illegally and who are worried by Trump's calls for deportation. She warned teachers that some students may use inappropriate words to express their fear and anger.  ""I know that they might curse and swear, but you would too if you have suffered under the constructs of white supremacy or experienced sexism, or any isms or lack of privilege,"" she wrote. About 2,000 San Francisco students walked out of class last week to protest the new president. On Monday, Mayor Ed Lee declared that San Francisco would continue to provide sanctuary for all immigrants, religious minorities and gays and lesbians. The union that represents teachers, the United Educators of San Francisco, defended the plan. Union President Lita Blanc said that even House Speaker Paul Ryan had called Trump's campaign racist and sexist.  ""There is a time and a place for using words that match action,"" Blanc said. She praised the plan's advice for students -- ""to stand up and defend themselves, and speak out for themselves and make a difference."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Despite losing the election, Democrat Hillary Clinton will win the popular vote by more than 1 million votes as she runs up big leads in the biggest, bluest states. Democrats have used Clinton's lead in the popular vote to downplay any mandate Trump might claim. Trump has shot back, tweeting Wednesday: ""If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily."" With more than 130 million votes counted, Clinton leads Trump by more than 1 million votes. The Associated Press estimates there are more than 4 million votes left to be counted. The bulk of those votes are in California, so Clinton's lead is likely to grow substantially. If Clinton continues to receive more than 60 percent of the vote in California, her lead could grow to more than 2 million votes. Most states count votes after Election Day. Often they are absentee ballots that arrive in the final days before Election Day. Some states, like California, count absentee votes that arrive after the election, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. Trump won the vote that counts, in the Electoral College. Trump has 290 Electoral College votes and Clinton has 232, with Michigan still undecided. It takes 270 votes in the Electoral College to win the presidency. Trump leads Clinton in Michigan by about 13,000 votes, according to the Michigan Department of State. That's less than one-half of 1 percent of the total votes cast. The state has until Nov. 28 to make the results official. Trump would be the first Republican to win Michigan in a presidential election since George H.W. Bush won the state in 1988. Under the Electoral College system, each state gets one vote for each member of Congress representing the state. California has the most, with 55. Seven states have only three. The District of Columbia has three, even though the nation's capital has no vote in Congress. There have been occasional calls to scrap the Electoral College, with no success. The latest push came after the 2000 presidential election, in which Democrat Al Gore lost to Republican George W. Bush, despite winning the popular vote. Any calls to scrap the Electoral College aren't likely to go anywhere this time, either, with Republicans controlling both the House and Senate. In the past, Trump has been critical of the Electoral College. In 2012, he tweeted, ""The Electoral College is a disaster for a democracy."" Trump revised that assessment after this year's election. This week he tweeted, ""The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!"" ___ AP election researcher Marisa Carpico contributed to this report. ___ Follow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/stephenatap Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Republican Helen Purcell conceded on Tuesday to Democrat Adrian Fontes in the Maricopa County recorder's race. The county was still tallying ballots but she was nearly 13,000 votes behind when she acknowledged the loss. Purcell, 81, was first elected in 1988 and never before challenged for re-election while serving seven four-year terms as county recorder. Her decision to cut the number of polling places for the March election caused voters to wait more than five hours to cast their ballots. Purcell and Secretary of State Michele Reagan were blamed for the foul-up, but Purcell became the most public face for the decision.  ""I made bad decisions based on the information I had, obviously, or we wouldn't have had long lines,"" Purcell told The Associated Press days after the March election. Her sudden fall in the public eye made her a target, and she barely survived the August primary election, beating back a Republican challenger by just 202 votes. She wasn't so lucky in the general election. Fontes is an attorney in private practice and a former prosecutor who served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He is making his first foray into politics and will take office in January. He promised to push a statewide referendum to make county recorders a non-partisan office to eliminate politics from the election process. He also said he would work with all groups to help boost voter registration and election participation and to avoid long election lines by properly determining the number of needed polling places. Fontes issued a statement Tuesday thanking Purcell for her years of service and for running an honorable campaign. He said he plans to run the recorders' office free of political bias.  ""My job -- this job -- is to call balls and strikes with integrity, with accountability and with a full-throttle effort to make sure every eligible citizen is able to register and to vote,"" Fontes said. Maricopa County had 200 polling places in the 2012 presidential primary, but Purcell cut that number to just 60 in March, thinking large numbers of people would vote by mail. High voter turnout and the fact that independents who can vote in all other Arizona primaries showed up to vote in the closed presidential primary led to long lines. Purcell issued a statement Tuesday congratulating Fontes and thanking her staff and voters who turned out for the Nov. 8 election.  ""It has been the pleasure and privilege of a lifetime, and one I will never take for granted -- just as I hope you will never take for granted this awesome and truly American responsibility of participating in the electoral process,"" Purcell said.

(all times local): 4:50 p.m. North Dakota's governor is criticizing a potential delay in completion of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Gov. Jack Dalrymple said Tuesday that an additional delay ""does nothing but prolong and intensify the public safety issues imposed on Morton County and the state of North Dakota since the beginning of August,"" when protests against the pipeline broke out. On Monday, the Army Corps of Engineers called for more study and input from the Standing Rock Sioux before it decides whether to allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The tribe says the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. In his statement, Dalrymple says a decision on the project easement ""is long overdue."" He says the pipeline would be safe. ___ 3:40 p.m. Environmental attorney and Waterkeeper Alliance President Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is joining the protest against the Dakota Access oil pipeline, saying it's important to ""the future of humanity."" The alliance seeks to protect watersheds worldwide. The Standing Rock Sioux believes the 1,200-mile pipeline that's to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to Illinois could harm drinking water. Kennedy on Tuesday visited the main protest camp, which is near the Missouri River in southern North Dakota. The pipeline route goes under the river, which is the source of the tribe's drinking water. Kennedy's visit came on a day when pipeline demonstrations were held across the country. Kennedy says the $3.8 billion pipeline will benefit billionaires, not the American people. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners says the pipeline is safe. ___ 2:10 p.m. More than two dozen protesters against the Dakota Access oil pipeline were arrested west of Mandan, North Dakota, during a day in which activists held demonstrations nationwide. Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller says about 400 protesters put a pickup truck and tree branches on BNSF Railway tracks Tuesday near a pipeline work staging area. The railroad says trains were delayed three hours. Officers in riot gear used pepper spray and in one instance a stun gun against protesters who refused to leave. Activists called for demonstrations at Army Corps of Engineers offices and at banks financing the pipeline construction. Protests were reported across the country, from California to Vermont. The $3.8 billion pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil to a shipping point in Illinois. Opponents worry it will harm the environment. ___ This item has been corrected to correct number of protesters arrested to more than two dozen instead of 28 based on updated figures from sheriff's department. ___ 11:45 a.m. Hundreds of protesters against the Dakota Access oil pipeline gathered outside a work staging area west of Mandan, North Dakota, and disrupted freight train traffic. Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller says protesters on Tuesday morning put a pickup truck and tree branches on BNSF Railway tracks. It wasn't immediately clear how many trains were affected. Officers in riot gear responded. There were no immediate reports of arrests. Mandan is about 50 miles north of a camp where hundreds of protesters have gathered in recent months to oppose the $3.8 billion pipeline that's to carry North Dakota oil to a shipping point in Illinois. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was slated to visit the camp later Tuesday. He's an environmental attorney and president of Waterkeeper Alliance, which seeks to protect watersheds worldwide. ___ 10:55 a.m. The company building the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline is seeking a federal court's permission to lay pipe under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota and finish the four-state project. The Army Corps of Engineers called Monday for more study and input from the Standing Rock Sioux before it decides whether to allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The tribe says the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners and a subsidiary are asking U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., to confirm the company has the legal right to proceed. The Corps in July granted ETP the permits needed for the crossing, but it said in September that further analysis was warranted given tribal concerns. ETP says additional delay amounts to politic interference. ___ 8:40 a.m. The company building the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline is denouncing a decision by the Army Corps of Engineers to delay an easement to cross a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren said in a statement Monday that the decision is ""motivated purely by politics at the expense of a company that has done nothing but play by the rules."" The Corps wants more studies and tribal input before it decides whether to allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The Standing Rock Sioux says the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. Protests have been ongoing for months. ETP says it will ""vigorously pursue its legal rights."" The 1,200-mile pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois is largely complete outside of the river crossing. ___ 8 a.m. The Standing Rock Sioux chairman says the decision by the Army Corps of Engineers to delay an easement for the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline indicates protests against the project are succeeding. The Corps said Monday it needs more studies and tribal input before it can decide whether to allow the oil pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. The tribe says the pipeline would threaten drinking water and cultural sites. Protests against its construction have been ongoing for months. Chairman Dave Archambault said in a statement that the Corps' decision is encouraging and shows the demonstrations are bringing the tribe's concerns to light. An industry group supporting the pipeline criticized the Corps' decision. The MAIN Coalition called it an attempt at ""death by delay."" ___ 6:15 a.m. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is slated to join protesters of the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota. Also Tuesday, activists have called for demonstrators to protest at Army Corps of Engineers offices and offices of banks that are financing the pipeline project. The protesters want President Barack Obama to permanently halt the construction of the $3.8 billion pipeline. Kennedy is an environmental attorney and president of the New York-based Waterkeeper Alliance, which seeks to protect watersheds worldwide. The pipeline is to run beneath a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota that provides drinking water to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which says the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. The pipeline would deliver oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

She was 61. A former reporter for The New York Times and The Washington Post, Ifill switched to television in the 1990s and covered politics and Congress for NBC News. She moved to PBS in 1999 as host of ""Washington Week"" and also worked for the nightly ""NewsHour"" program. She and Woodruff were named co-anchors in 2013. She moderated vice presidential debates in 2004 and 2008 and authored the book, ""The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama."" The president on Monday praised Ifill for informing today's citizens while also inspiring a young generation of journalists.  ""I always appreciated Gwen's reporting, even when I was on the receiving end of one of her tough"" interviews, Obama said. Ifill took a leave from ""NewsHour"" for a month this spring for health reasons, keeping details of her illness private. Her health failing, she left ""NewsHour"" again shortly before an election night that she and Woodruff would have covered together.  ""Gwen was a standard bearer for courage, fairness and integrity in an industry going through seismic change,"" said Sara Just, PBS ""NewsHour"" executive producer. ""She was a mentor to so many across the industry and her professionalism was respected across the political spectrum. She was a journalist's journalist and set an example for all around her."" NBC News' Pete Williams, a former colleague, struggled to keep his composure Monday when announcing Ifill's death on MSNBC.  ""She had so many awards in her office you could barely see out the window,"" Williams said. U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said he was a member of the Maryland state legislature when Ifill worked for the Baltimore Evening Sun.  ""She always demonstrated thoughtful intelligence, determination to uncover the facts, and an innate talent for knowing what truly interested the public,"" Cummings said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Ifill ""a legend.""  ""Her dignity and grace, intellect and insight set the standard in American media and public life,"" Pelosi said. Shortly before moderating the debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin in 2008, Ifill brushed aside concerns that she might not be fair because she was writing a book about Obama.  ""I've got a pretty long track record covering politics and news, so I'm not particularly worried that one-day blog chatter is going to destroy my reputation,"" she told The Associated Press then. Ifill, who was black, also questioned why people would assume her book would be favorable toward Obama. ""Do you think they made the same assumptions about Lou Cannon (who is white) when he wrote his book about Reagan?"" she said. In a 2007 opinion piece published in The New York Times, Ifill condemned radio host Don Imus' ""nappy-headed hos"" reference to Rutgers University female basketball players.  ""To his credit, Mr. Imus told the Rev. Al Sharpton yesterday he realizes that, this time, he went way too far,"" Ifill wrote.  ""Yes, he did. Every time a young black girl shyly approaches me for an autograph or writes or calls or stops me on the street to ask how she can become a journalist, I feel an enormous responsibility,"" she said. ""It's more than simply being a role model. I know I have to be a voice for them as well."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   This post has been updated. President-elect Donald Trump's decision to appoint Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist in the White House has drawn a sharp rebuke from political strategists who see in Bannon a controversial figure too closely associated with the ""alt-right"" movement, which white nationalists have embraced. Bannon, who was the executive chairman of Breitbart News before joining the Trump campaign in August, will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor for Trump; that will give Bannon authority over the strategic direction of the White House. Bannon will assume a similar role to that of Karl Rove during George W. Bush's administration and recently by longtime strategist John Podesta under President Obama. He and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who will become White House chief of staff, will be among Trump's top advisers. The announcement has produced intense hand-wringing in Washington and sharp denunciations from political observers and strategists critical of Breitbart News's close association with the alt-right, a fringe conservative movement saturated with racially insensitive rhetoric and elements of outright white nationalism.   [Trump pits establishment against populism at the top of his White House team]   The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate-watch group, has accused Breitbart of explicitly embracing ethno-nationalism. After Bannon's elevation was announced, the law center tweeted several controversial stories written by Breitbart under Bannon's control, including a piece published two weeks after a mass killing at a black church in Charleston, S.C., last year: ""Hoist it high and proud: the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage."" ""Stephen Bannon was the main driver behind Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill,"" the law center wrote via Twitter in its first statements on Bannon's elevation. ""Trump should rescind this hire. In his victory speech, Trump said he intended to be president for 'all Americans.' Bannon should go."" Trump's critics, across the political spectrum, immediately blasted the move on social media.   The racist, fascist extreme right is represented footsteps from the Oval Office. Be very vigilant America. -- John Weaver (@JWGOP) November 13, 2016     With a white nationalist senior advisor, Trump is not just ignoring the impact of his rhetoric - he is actively terrifying the country. -- Jon Lovett (@jonlovett) November 13, 2016     Nation exhales because white nationalist only gets second most influential job in White House -- Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) November 13, 2016   The Anti-Defamation League voiced its strong disapproval in a statement Sunday evening, calling Bannon's appointment ""a sad day."" ""We call on President-elect Trump to appoint and nominate Americans committed to the well-being of all our country's people,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL's chief executive. The Council on American-Islamic Relations also denounced the appointment and criticized Breitbart for trafficking ""misogynistic and racist stories targeting women, people of color and immigrants."" ""The appointment of Stephen Bannon as a top Trump administration strategist sends the disturbing message that anti-Muslim conspiracy theories and White nationalist ideology will be welcome in the White House,"" said Nihad Awad, CAIR's executive director. ""We urge President-elect Trump to reconsider this ill-advised appointment if he truly seeks to unite Americans."" Bannon's personal history also has been mired in controversy. Shortly after he joined the Trump campaign, court documents revealed that his ex-wife, Mary Louise Piccard, had accused Bannon of domestic violence and anti-Semitic language in 2007. (The documents were obtained and first reported by the New York Daily News.) ""The biggest problem he had with Archer is the number of Jews that attend,"" Piccard said in a statement to the court. ""He said that he doesn't like the way they raise their kids to be 'whiny brats' and that he didn't want the girls going to school with Jews."" Bannon has denied the accusations. Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who worked closely with Bannon, called him a ""legitimately sinister figure"" in an article he published on the Daily Wire after Bannon joined the Trump campaign. ""Many former employees of Breitbart News are afraid of Steve Bannon. He is a vindictive, nasty figure, infamous for verbally abusing supposed friends and threatening enemies,"" Shapiro wrote.      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   Some of the Trump campaign's most controversial moves in the final months of the campaign were attributed to Bannon, who is known for his combative and unfiltered style. When Trump, before the second presidential debate, invited several women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to hold a news conference, Bannon stood in the back of the room smiling broadly. ""I want to thank President-elect Trump for the opportunity to work with Reince in driving the agenda of the Trump Administration,"" Bannon said in a statement released by the campaign Sunday. ""We had a very successful partnership on the campaign, one that led to victory. We will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda."" Bannon's appointment brings into focus many of the uncomfortable racial tensions surrounding Trump's campaign, stemming from Trump's staunch anti-immigrant rhetoric. Throughout the election, Trump's critics accused him of using such language and the politics of racial grievance to motivate his supporters, charges that he has denied and dismissed. In an interview with CBS's ""60 minutes"" that aired Sunday, he expressed surprise when asked about racial slurs that were being used against African Americans and other minority groups since his election. ""I am very surprised to hear that. I hate to hear that, I mean, I hate to hear that,"" Trump said in the interview, which was taped Friday. ""I would say don't do it, that's terrible, because I'm going to bring this country together. ""I am so saddened to hear that. And I say stop it, if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it,"" Trump added.          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.
