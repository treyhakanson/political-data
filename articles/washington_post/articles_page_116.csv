Under proposals put forward by President-elect Donald Trump, Mexico could see millions of people streaming back with no jobs available; the country might lose some of the billions of dollars in remittances sent home annually; and some jobless deportees could swell the ranks of drug cartels, sparking more violence. Gov. Hector Astudillo of the southern state of Guerrero considered the possible scenario over the weekend. At least a million Guerrero residents live in the United States, many without proper documents, and the state is already reeling from drug gang violence and poverty.  ""Of course Guerrero is not in any condition to receive the million or more than one million migrants"" in the U.S., Astudillo said. ""On the contrary, they have been an important mainstay in supporting the economy of Guerrero."" Migrants sent home almost $25 billion in remittances to Mexico in 2015, and experts say most of that went to support the most basic needs of the poorest Mexicans. Trump has suggested he might somehow seize the funds of those immigrants who are not deported to pay for a border wall. Mexico already has a shortfall of 800,000 new jobs for youths who join the labor force each year, let alone returning migrants, said Alejandra Barrales, head of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party. ""We need to close ranks and create (job) opportunities, not just for people who might be deported, but for the 1.2 million young people who join the labor market each year."" The federal government announced an emergency program this week aimed at encouraging business to hire returning migrants, but Mexico City teacher Armando Osorio doubted that would be enough, given the government's poor track record on job creation. ""These people have no moral authority to say they will receive their countrymen with open arms,"" he said. ""They are the ones who are mainly responsible for the forced exodus of millions of Mexicans who don't have enough to eat."" Even if Trump seems to be walking back the idea of mass deportations, the prospect still remains frightening for people in Mexico. On Sunday, Trump said in an interview on the news program ""60 Minutes"" that ""what we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, a lot of these people -- probably two million, it could be three million -- and getting them out of our country."" Central America's violent gangs, known as ""maras,"" emerged in the 1980s when migrants who had fled El Salvador's civil war were deported by the U.S. after committing crimes as members of street gangs in Los Angeles. The deportees took their criminal knowhow back with them and started new gangs. The U.S. government in 2012 estimated about 1.9 million immigrants were criminals and could face deportation. The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, estimated 820,000 of those are in the United States illegally. Mike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said at least some deportees will likely embrace drug trafficking, using already established U.S. connections to increase the amount of heroin and other drugs sent across the border. Even deporting only the felons would backfire by causing more violence in Mexico and Central America, he said.  ""What's going to happen is that these individuals are going to return back to Mexico and they have no jobs, so they are going to feed the ranks of the cartels there,"" said Vigil, author of the book ""Metal Coffins: The Blood Alliance Cartel.""  ""That would lead to more violence, kidnappings in Mexico, and these areas (of Central America), which would cause a tsunami of undocumented immigrants coming into the United States, probably much more so than what he could actually deport,"" Vigil said. There are cases of deported migrants assuming leadership positions in the region's gangs, such as Martin Estrada Luna, a high school dropout from Washington state with a rap sheet of petty crimes such as burglary. Two years after he was sent back to Mexico in 2009, he had transformed himself into a drug baron known as ""El Kilo,"" leader of a ruthless cell of the Zetas gang who masterminded the mass killings of more than 250 people. While millions of migrants in the United States illegally could ultimately face deportation, the process to find and deport all of them likely won't happen rapidly. Once in office, Trump could move to have immigration agents quickly start arresting people already under orders to leave for being in the U.S. illegally. There were about 88,000 people in that category as of 2015. But for immigrants with no criminal history, the wait for a judge's final deportation order could take years. There are about 521,000 cases pending in federal immigration courts currently, according to public data obtained by Transaction Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Even in Mexico, many believe Trump will have to moderate his plans.  ""Political reality will make it clear that many of the proposals against Mexicans are simply not feasible, neither the deportation of all undocumented migrants, nor the construction of the wall,"" the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico City wrote in an editorial.

(Yuri Gripas/AFP/Getty Images)  A report from international election observers on their preliminary findings on U.S. elections starts off promisingly. ""The 8 November general elections were highly competitive,"" they said, ""and demonstrated commitment to fundamental freedoms of expression, assembly and association."" The observers also commended local election officials for their competence and professionalism. But that's about where the positivity ends. Hundreds of election monitors from around the world fanned out across the United States on Tuesday to ensure free and fair elections, as well as to document the process for the benefit of their home nations. About 300 of them were brought to the United States by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE's report damns the U.S. elections with faint praise, and then gets to the meat of the issue: Too many voting machines are faulty, and huge portions of the population can't vote anyhow. In 13 percent of observations, OSCE representatives noted malfunctions with electronic voting machines. That is roughly 1 in 8 votes. They said possible causes could be lack of pre-election testing of the machines, which may have been outdated or ill-maintained to begin with. In some cases, voters were noted to have complained that their choices were not accurately recorded by functioning machines, which the observers said could play into claims of election rigging in the public's perception. Those instances may have been caused by ""poorly calibrated equipment,"" they said.   [Voters encounter some malfunctioning machines, other headaches on Election Day]   One in 10 voters also had to wait in line for more than 30 minutes to cast their vote, especially at polling stations the observers said were short on staff, particularly during pre-work, morning voting hours. The OSCE observers were able to visit 932 polling stations in 33 states, but were denied access to 17 states, including Indiana, Delaware, Maine, Missouri and New Jersey. Long lines and faulty machines may be aggravating to voters, and feed into suspicions about the integrity of the process, but the report reserves far more serious language for the politically motivated disenfranchisement of entire segments of voters. ""Recent legal changes and decisions on technical aspects of the electoral process were often motivated by partisan interests, adding undue obstacles for voters,"" notes the report. ""Suffrage rights are not guaranteed for all citizens, leaving sections of the population without the right to vote.""   [Hundreds of foreign election monitors are in the D.C. area to observe voting]     Here is the summation of the issue, per the OSCE: Some 4 million residents of U.S. overseas territories and 600,000 residents of the District of Columbia do not have voting representation in Congress. In addition, residents of U.S. overseas territories do not have the right to vote in presidential elections. More than 6 million convicts, including those who have served their sentences as well as many still facing trial, are widely disenfranchised, although several states have recently taken steps to restore their voting rights. These restrictions contravene the principle of universal and equal suffrage, as provided in OSCE commitments. The report then continues to expand the breadth of its criticism, which started with the specific, then encompassed the legal, and ended on the structural. Campaign finance regulations came under particular scrutiny. Generally, the United States has relatively few limits on financial contributions to campaigns. That is especially so in the wake of the 2008 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which allowed corporations, just like individuals and nonprofit groups, to contribute unlimited amounts to political campaigns. Because many of those contributions are routed through political action committees (PACs) rather than the campaigns themselves, their origins aren't required to be disclosed to the FEC, severely limiting transparency regarding where a candidate gets his or her support. The report also touched upon the underrepresentation of women both in American politics at large, as well as in decision-making electoral administration positions; the polarization of the media and a proliferation of fake news articles on the Internet; and the institution of the electoral college, a system that allows for a candidate to win the popular vote and yet fail to become president.

Tuesday's election of Donald Trump as the president of the United States has been called many things -- ""unprecedented,"" ""shocking"" and ""stunning"" among them. Many, though, described the election with different words as it relates to women and people of color: failure, ""disaster,"" ""living nightmare.""   Donald Trump is a microcosm of the American dream; a nightmare for people of color and minorities. -- Mohamed (@FreshcutMo) November 9, 2016   ""I have never been so disappointed in any election ever,"" one Hillary Clinton supporter, 62-year-old Gayle Matteson, told The Washington Post in downtown St. Petersburg, Fla. ""I feel sorry for the Muslims, the Hispanics, the African Americans, and especially women.""   [Live updates from 2016 election fallout]   These people's feelings and fears were perhaps best captured in an off-the-cuff, emotional soliloquy offered by Van Jones, a CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist. As it became clear that Trump was closing in on a projected victory, Jones gave voice to the sentiment many were sharing on Twitter -- that race played an important part in the election, and many feel disenfranchised by the results. ""People have talked about a miracle,"" he began, discussing Trump's upset victory over Clinton. ""I'm hearing about a nightmare.""   Van Jones: ""This was a 'white-lash' against a changing country"" https://t.co/fVi0JzyFOr #CNNElection #ElectionNight pic.twitter.com/mWuTQqN83C -- CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) November 9, 2016   Jones, who is African American, questioned how parents could explain to their children how Americans elected a man widely labeled as a bigot and a racist.   [Donald Trump wins the presidency in stunning upset over Clinton]   ""It's hard to be a parent tonight for a lot of us,"" Jones said. ""You tell your kids, 'Don't be a bully.' You tell your kids, 'Don't be a bigot.' You tell your kids, 'Do your homework and be prepared.' And then you have this outcome, and you have people putting children to bed tonight, and they're afraid of breakfast. They're afraid of 'How do I explain this to my children?'"" This was a common refrain among liberals on Twitter.   .@VanJones68 is saying it perfectly how do we explain to children tomorrow that we elected a racist,bigot,homophobe to lead our country? -- Shane Speidel (@AverageShane) November 9, 2016     How do we explain to children & ppl that not all minority's are thugs, rapists, murderers? -- Karla Lara (@karlamlara) November 9, 2016     Please tell me how we explain to children not to mock people with disabilities when the president does it. #ElectionNight -- Elizabeth Plank (@feministabulous) November 9, 2016   Jones continued, ""I have Muslim friends who are texting me tonight, saying, 'Should I leave the country?' I have families of immigrants that are terrified tonight."" He opined that although the unprecedented election results were partly ""a rebellion against the elites"" and ""a complete reinvention of politics and polls,"" that ""it was also something else"" -- what he called a ""white-lash"" against an increasingly diverse country led by its black president for the past eight years. ""This was a white-lash,"" Jones said. ""This was a white-lash against a changing country. It was a white-lash against a black president, in part."" Added Jones, ""And that's the part where the pain comes.""   [Van Jones to Corey Lewandowski: 'You're being a horrible person right now']   As he spoke, the usually stoic Jones appeared to be choked up, almost fighting back tears on live television. ""When you say you want to take your country back, you've got a lot of people who feel that we're not represented well either,"" Jones said. ""But we don't want to feel that someone has been elected by throwing away some of us to appeal more deeply to others. This is a deeply painful moment tonight."" It's certainly a feeling many agree with. In an op-ed for the New York Times, Roxane Gay wrote, ""I was confident [Trump would lose] because I thought there were more Americans who believe in progress and equality than there were Americans who were racist, xenophobic, misogynistic and homophobic."" She continued: A bigger part of tonight's story is that millions and millions of Americans are willing to vote for a candidate who has been endorsed by the Klan. They are willing to vote for a candidate who has displayed open contempt for women. They are willing to vote for a candidate whose base is openly hostile to people of color, immigrants and Muslims. We cannot ignore the hate that Mr. Trump both encourages and allows to flourish. I am terrified that the more virulent of Mr. Trump's base will see his election as permission to act on hatred. Meanwhile, Vox, a left-leaning outlet, published a piece titled ""Donald Trump's win tells people of color they aren't welcome in America."" Many thanked Jones on Twitter for speaking his mind, including NBA star Stephen Curry. ""Watched Van Jones and couldn't agree more. Where do we all go from here?"" one tweeted. ""Well said, Van. Trump has an obligation if elected as President to represent all Americans,"" another tweeted.   Van Jones....nothing but respect! -- Stephen Curry (@StephenCurry30) November 9, 2016   Many others, though, accused him of furthering the racial divide in America. ""I don't agree with Van Jones 'cos Trump reached out to race and tribe in America,"" one user tweeted. ""Talentless race-bait. Crying on television is not professional, child. Were '08 and '12 BLACKLASH, clueless racist?"" asked another. ""Van Jones continues the division. When will we be AMERICANS? When will you see us all the same?"" tweeted a third.  @CNNPolitics disgusting. This kind of talk will divide us further. -- Bina Soley (@BinaSoley) November 9, 2016  At one point, Jones stated, ""Donald Trump has a responsibility tonight to come out and reassure people that he is going to be the president of all the people he insulted and offended and brushed aside."" To Trump's credit, he did as much in his victory speech from the Hilton Hotel in New York City.   [President-elect Trump: 'It's time for us to come together as one united people']   Calling his campaign, ""a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs,"" he said, ""Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.""      Delivering a victory speech in New York, President-elect Donald Trump thanked Hillary Clinton for her service and called for the nation to come together. (The Washington Post)   Later in his speech, the president-elect said, ""I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me."" Still, a speech wasn't enough to change the feelings of the many who agree with Jones. As David Remnick wrote early Wednesday morning in a New Yorker piece titled ""An American Tragedy,"" Trump ""will strike fear into the hearts of the vulnerable, the weak, and, above all, the many varieties of Other whom he has so deeply insulted. The African-American Other. The Hispanic Other. The female Other. The Jewish and Muslim Other."" On Wednesday morning it appeared that, to some, Trump already has.          1 of 46       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What Election Night looked like      View Photos   Donald Trump, 70, will be the 45th president of the United States.

Donald Trump's vow to build a wall along the border with Mexico, to make Mexico pay for it and to achieve iron-fisted control over illegal immigration stands as his leading promise, one that rang from the rafters countless times. But he owes his supporters -- and now the country -- much more than that. While a lot of his agenda will be a hard sell, he won't have the excuse used by many presidents whose promises have fallen short -- a Congress in the hands of the opposing party. Trump will take office with a unified government, both the Senate and House under Republican control. A look at some of his IOUs: CHILD CARE Trump promises six weeks of leave for new mothers, with the government paying wages equivalent to unemployment benefits. His plan also provides for a new income tax deduction for child care expenses, other tax benefits and a new rebate or tax credit for low-income families. EDUCATION Trump promises to spend $20 billion during his first year to help states expand school choice programs. He wants states to divert an additional $110 billion of their own education money to help parents who want their children to go to other schools. And he owes college students a big, and expensive, leg up. He says he will cap student loan payments at 12.5 percent of a borrower's income, with loan forgiveness if they make payments for 15 years. ENERGY Trump vows to cut regulations as part of his effort to ""unleash American energy."" This means allowing unfettered production of oil, clean coal, natural gas and other sources to push the U.S. toward energy independence and create jobs. In particular, he owes coal miners a revival of their livelihood, even though the industry's decline is in large measure due to the rise of natural gas, which he also supports. He pledges to rescind the Clean Power Plan, a key element of President Barack Obama's strategy to fight climate change. FOREIGN POLICY Trump's ""America first"" ethos means alliances and coalitions will not pass muster with him unless they produce a net benefit to the U.S. He speaks of a less interventionist approach to crises abroad -- with the exception of his vow to crush the Islamic State group. Yet he also promises to spend much more to restore what he sees as depleted armed forces. HEALTH CARE He's vowed to repeal Obama's health care law and replace it with something more affordable. With a Republican Congress, the pressure will be on to do so. It remains to be seen how far lawmakers and the president will actually go to untangle a law that has sunk some roots, and Democrats won't be voiceless on this or other issues. IMMIGRATION One paradox of the campaign is the lack of clarity about Trump's intentions on an issue that defined him out of the gate. He clearly promises to stop the influx of Syrian refugees into the U.S., and somehow to help them overseas. He vows to deport people convicted of serious crimes who are in the U.S. illegally. And there's that wall, which Mexicans insist they won't pay for. But the fate of millions of people who are in the country illegally is a gray area -- he's not promising to deport them but also not saying he would give them legal status. He'd ban immigration of people from areas prone to extremism, but how that would be defined is unclear. INFRASTRUCTURE Trump vowed to double rival Hillary Clinton's proposed spending on infrastructure. Taking him literally, that means a staggering $500 billion over five years. IRAN Trump promises to renegotiate or withdraw from the multilateral deal that eased sanctions on Iran in return for controls on its nuclear program. MINIMUM WAGE He expressed support for $10 an hour, while saying states should ""really call the shots."" It's $7.25 now. SOCIAL SECURITY Trump has promised not to cut Social Security. SUPREME COURT Trump promised to nominate justices who are open to overturning the constitutional right to abortion and who support Second Amendment gun rights. TAXES He owes Americans big tax cuts. He says he'll collapse the current seven income tax brackets, which peak at 39.6 percent, into just three tiers with a top rate of 33 percent, slice the corporate income tax and eliminate the estate tax. Although analysts said the wealthy would benefit disproportionately, middle income people are promised a hefty reduction. TRADE Trump promises to renegotiate or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. He also vows to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and to slap stinging tariffs on countries that the U.S. judges to be trading unfairly. China faces the risk of steep penalties -- and U.S. consumers would pay higher prices as a result -- if his vow is carried through. VETERANS Trump promises to expand programs that allow veterans to choose their doctor -- regardless of whether they're affiliated with the VA -- and still receive government-paid medical care. He's pledged to fire or discipline VA employees who fail veterans or breach the public trust. He also would increase mental health professionals and create a ""White House hotline"" dedicated to veterans. If a valid complaint is not addressed, ""I will pick up the phone and fix it myself if I have to,"" Trump pledged.

Exit polls recorded the simmering discontent of the American electorate. Four in 10 voters said they were hungry for change, and those voters overwhelmingly favored Republican Donald Trump. Smaller voting blocs who were seeking a candidate with good judgment, experience or who cared about them favored vanquished Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton. Nearly 7 in 10 voters said they were unhappy with the way the government is working, including a quarter who said they were outright angry, according to preliminary results of exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. Three-fourths of those angry voters backed Trump. Six in 10 voters said the country is on the wrong track. Other findings from the exit poll: TRUMP'S WORKING-CLASS WHITES TRUMP CLINTON'S COALITION Trump won by dominating among white voters, especially non-college-educated men, trumping Clinton's coalition of women, minorities and young people. Trump, who once famously declared that he loved the uneducated, got plenty of love back from white voters who never graduated from college: He got 7 in 10 votes from non-college-educated white men and 6 in 10 votes from non-college-educated white women. The advantage Trump had among whites without a college degree compared with whites who graduated from college was the largest seen in exit polls for a Republican since the surveys started in 1972. Clinton, meanwhile, got the support of less than a quarter of white men without a college degree; Barack Obama, by contrast, drew about a third of their votes four years ago. Clinton did make some inroads with college-educated white women. Just over half supported her, while four years ago just over half of that group had backed Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. TIMES TWO What kind of impact did third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein have on the race? They siphoned more votes from Clinton than from Trump. A quarter of Johnson and Stein voters said they would have backed Clinton if they had to pick between the two major-party candidates. About 15 percent would have backed Trump. But most Johnson and Stein voters said they would have just stayed home if their only choices were Clinton and Trump. RACIAL SPLIT Even with his tough talk about Mexican immigrants, Trump held on to roughly the same share of Hispanic voters as Romney had claimed four years ago. Likewise, he was drawing about the same levels of support from black voters as Romney won. The Republican was drawing about a quarter of Hispanic voters and about less than 1 in 10 black voters. Clinton did better with Hispanic voters who were naturalized citizens, getting about 8 in 10 of their votes. She got about 6 in 10 Hispanic voters who were born U.S. citizens. Trump was winning more than half of white voters, who made up 70 percent of the electorate. TO BE HONEST ... Neither Trump nor Clinton gets bragging rights when it comes to honesty. About 6 out of 10 voters said they don't view Trump as honest and about the same share felt the same way about Clinton. Opinions were more mixed on the question of temperament. Only about a third of Americans said Trump had the temperament to be president, while more than half felt Clinton did. THE GENDER GAP It was Trump's working-class white men who helped to produce a gender gap with a capital ""G'' for Clinton. Tuesday's election was on track to produce the largest gender gap since the exit poll began: The gender gap for Clinton -- the difference between the number of men who voted for her and the number of women who voted for her -- hit 13 percentage points. Clinton's support among women was roughly even with the support that women gave Obama in 2008 and 2012. The bigger factor in this year's wide gender gap: less-educated white men, who favored Trump far more heavily than they did Romney in 2012 or GOP nominee John McCain in 2008. The only presidential candidate that came close to Clinton's gender gap this year was Democrat Al Gore, who had a 12-point gender gap in 2000. MILLENNIALS VS. ELDERS Clinton largely managed to hang on to the millennials who were such a big part of Obama's winning coalition. Young people age 18-29 supported Clinton over Trump by nearly as strong a margin as their support of Obama over Romney in 2012. Those between 30 and 44 also were much more likely to support Clinton than Trump. Trump won the favor of those 45 and over. PESSIMISM AND ANGER There were grim strains woven into voter sentiments as they cast their ballots. Nearly 7 in 10 voters said they were unhappy with the way the government is working, including a quarter who were outright angry. Six in 10 voters said the country is seriously on the wrong track and about the same number said the economy was either not good or poor. Two-thirds saw their personal financial situation as either worse or the same as it was four years ago. One in three voters said they expect life to be worse for the next generation. HOLDING THEIR NOSES Americans held their noses as they picked between the candidates: More than half of voters cast their ballots with reservations about their candidate or because they disliked the others running. That was true both for those backing Trump and those supporting Clinton, the exit polls showed After a long, hard-fought campaign, just 4 out of 10 voters strongly favored their candidate. The prospect of a Trump victory was downright scary to plenty of voters: Seven in 10 Clinton voters said they'd feel scared by Trump victory. WOMEN'S ISSUES VS. EMAIL ISSUES After all of the sound and fury over Trump's treatment of women, it turned out the issue bothered half of all voters a lot -- and women were more concerned about it than men. About 6 in 10 women were bothered a lot, compared to about 4 in 10 men, the exit poll found. It turned out voters were somewhat less concerned about Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state. That issue mattered a lot to about four in 10 voters, including about 9 in 10 Trump voters. ___ The survey was conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research with 23,583 voters as they left their polling places at 350 randomly selected sites throughout the United States supplemented by 4,404 telephone interviews with mail, early and absentee voters. The results among all those voting have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. ___ Associated Press Writer Bill Barrow contributed to this report. ___ Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)   LATROBE, Pa. -- Before midnight hit on Tuesday, it became clear to the regulars at Sharkey's Cafe that their guy, Donald Trump, would become the next president. As Fox News flashed new numbers on the screen, they took turns excitedly yelling out the victories.  ""If he wins, I want to change to CNN and watch them cry,"" said Kevin Somers, 54, a long-distance trucker who was having a Coors Light with his ex-wife and some friends.  Somers and more than a dozen others waited for Fox News to call the race and for Trump to give his victory speech. A few more people arrived and ordered drinks and pizza. They waited for another two hours. Closing time arrived and the bartenders started turning off televisions and sweeping up popcorn. ""If Trump wins tonight, I'm done with alcohol,"" said Shawn Gracie, 41, who lives in the area and was laid off from the Ford dealership in July. ""And go back on my diet. I feel like crap.""  [How Donald Trump broke the old rules of politics -- and won the White House]  This bar in southwestern Pennsylvania is in the heart of Trump Country and for months has been plastered with Trump signs. Everyone there that night was cheering for Trump to win, even though hours earlier they had mostly come to terms with the fact that the polls were probably right, and that Hillary Clinton would probably be their next president. While they love Trump, they hate Clinton even more -- and, that night, she wouldn't even allow them have a proper victory party.  Sitting in a booth, Margarita Rincon video-chatted with her daughter, who is a freshman at Kent State in Ohio. Rincon made a confession: She voted for Trump.  Her daughter, Margarita Douglas, groaned and rolled her eyes. She had begged her mother to vote for Clinton, telling her that Trump wants to deport immigrants like her and that he doesn't respect women. Rincon immigrated to the United States from Colombia two decades ago and has been a citizen for many years.  ""I tell her: I'm not illegal. That's only illegal people,"" said Rincon, 50, who works for a banquet facility. Rincon then excitedly started chanting: ""Trump! Trump! Trump!""  Her daughter responded: ""Noooooo."" She then flipped her camera to show two of her friends, who were also disappointed in the Trump win. But Douglas didn't request an absentee ballot and didn't vote.  ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" Rincon said again. It was after closing time when Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta came on the screen and told her supporters to go home and wait. ""She is done,"" Gracie said yelled. ""Ain't happening, Podesta."" Gracie soon decided to head home. Others followed him. They were sure Trump was the next president, but they wouldn't fully allow themselves to believe it.  It was a feeling that many wrestled with throughout the day.     Leslie Rossi is the creator and owner of the Trump House in Westmoreland County, Pa. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  Not far from this bar is a shrine to Trump and his movement, a farmhouse on state Route 982 that's painted like an American flag. Standing in the yard is a 14-foot-tall metal Trump. Throughout the day, Trump supporters cast their ballots at polling places across southwest Pennsylvania, then journeyed to the ""Trump House."" Many felt that their lives were about to change, even though the media, polls and pundits were still insisting their candidate had no chance.   [The media didn't want to believe Trump could win. So they looked the other way.]  ""I've never voted in my life until this,"" said Dave Fisher, 49, who used to make good money salvaging metal and taking it to processing plants in the Pittsburgh area. He saw that work dry up eight years ago, forcing him to work construction and a host of odd jobs for a fraction of the pay. ""There's never been anyone I really cared about. He put a spark in everything; he makes you want to be an American again, and that's what I've been looking for."" Fisher voted with his wife in their town of Belle Vernon early in the morning before driving about an hour northeast to the Trump House, and as they watched car after car pull into the makeshift parking lot near the pop-up political shrine, the couple said they didn't understand how he could lose. ""Everyone I talk to is Trump; very few are Hillary,"" said Charlotte Fisher, 52, an EMS communications officer. ""In our neighborhood, everything is Trump.""     The Trump House -- owned, run and financed by Leslie Rossi, a mother of eight who owns more than 60 properties in the area -- is equipped with spotlights and security cameras but no televisions. Those lingering in and around the house got their news from phones, scrolling through Facebook postings and text messages, and as the morning went by, the news seemed so uniformly good for Trump that Rossi and a few volunteers would quickly correct anyone who didn't express 100 percent certainty that he would win. ""I hope he wins,"" said Carlotta Harris, 70, who lives nearby and stopped by about 11 a.m. to get a yard sign to plant near her polling place. ""Get rid of the hope,"" said Barry Kinsey, a military veteran who volunteers at the house. ""He will be president. I know it. I know it in my military mind.""    Leslie Rossi hangs up a ""Deplorable"" shirt that fell from a doorway at the ""Trump House."" (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  As morning gave way to afternoon, though, optimism began giving way to suspicions of fraud, and some people began slowly building a case for why Trump might lose. There was a flurry of phone calls from people who heard that a polling station near St. Vincent College was making voters hide their Trump gear because it might be considered electioneering at the polls, although the poll workers stopped doing so after a series of complaints. There were stories -- usually heard from someone who heard it from someone else -- about malfunctioning voting machines. And there was even a vague report that some polling place in this county had voting machines removed for an unknown reason. Joyce Vargulish, a 77-year-old housekeeper who has worked for the same family for 54 years, said she heard from her boss about a woman he knows who claimed that her vote for Trump was mysteriously changed. ""She voted straight Republican. When she pulled the lever, it said: 'Thank you for voting Democrat,'"" said Vargulish, even though such a display does not appear when voting here. ""I told all of my family, because a lot of them never voted before, and I told them to be careful."" Vargulish said that she wears a Trump shirt every day, except for when she goes to church, and that her front yard is filled with Trump signs. Her daughter, she said, assured her that Trump would win in a landslide, but she was increasingly worried that he might lose. ""It's not about him. It's about her. I just cannot see her being president,"" Vargulish said, referring to Democrat Hillary Clinton as a yellow school bus rolled past with a handful of young boys hanging out the windows and chanting: ""Trump! Trump! Trump!""    Richard Larrabee said Obama isn't his president. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)  Richard Larrabee, 69, overheard Vargulish and jumped in to share something that he had heard about Clinton: ""I just heard this morning that she's taking illegal immigrants on a bus from California, got them voting there, taking them to Nevada to vote again."" Rossi, the owner of Trump House, who has no affiliation with Trump's campaign or the Republican Party, has formed a relationship with Trump supporters in the region by handing out thousands of free Trump hats, T-shirts, bumper stickers and other merchandise. She has registered hundreds of people to vote and counseled those who have been told that they are deplorable for supporting Trump. ""I don't need Mr. Trump to tell me there's media bias or voter fraud, I have proof of it all around me in my small community,"" Rossi said. ""It's in my face. It's real."" The sun set, polls in other states closed and the initial optimism of the day, which had been supplanted by suspicion, was now changing again, this time into anxious excitement. Rossi celebrated having had 1,000 people visit so far since sunrise and sign her guest book. As the flow of cars was reduced to a trickle, she and two of her regular volunteers grabbed a Trump sign and went down to the road to wave at cars. Car after car honked. ""If they don't blow, they're Hillary people,"" she explained. As yet another car honked, Midge Stein, a 69-year-old Democrat who supports Trump, announced to the two other women: ""I think he's going to take it."" A car from Pittsburgh pulled up carrying Michael Loomis, a 52-year-old computer programmer who voted for Trump, and his friend, John Cihon, a 42-year-old utility company employee who voted for a third-party candidate. As soon as they arrived, Cihon sent a friend a text: ""I'm at the Trump House . . . There are no words."" Loomis wore a T-shirt labeling him a ""proud member of the basket of deplorables,"" and he introduced himself as ""a gay supporter of Trump."" He said that he was frustrated by the Affordable Care Act and that he liked Trump's tough stance on fighting Islamic State terrorists. He also said he liked Trump and described him as ""not completely stable,"" but in a good way. And then he said something that broke through the excitement: He wasn't sure that Trump would win. He had been watching the early-voting numbers, especially in Florida, and, to him, Clinton just seemed so far ahead. ""We won Florida,"" Rossi told him. ""We won in like a huge, huge way."" ""Trump won Florida?"" Loomis said. ""I can't believe that."" Loomis pulled up RealClearPolitics on his cellphone. The state had not been called yet -- Rosso was wrong about that -- but Trump was up with about 25 percent of votes having been counted. ""I mean, if he carries Florida, he's going to win this election,"" Loomis said. ""I did not expect him to win."" Just then, Cihon got a text and announced: ""He's winning the general right now."" Loomis hit refresh and saw the same thing in the preliminary results. ""Trump is ahead by 3 percent of the popular vote right now,"" he said. ""And that's a lot of the popular vote."" They stood there, hitting refresh over and over. With only a few hours to go until all of the polls closed, they were sure that it was only a matter of time. Trump was going to win. Everyone at Trump House believed it. Their lives really were going to change.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/08/red-vs-blue-a-brief-history-of-how-we-use-political-colors/	Red vs. Blue: A history of how we use political colors	"   There's a lot to love in the video above, showing ABC's election night coverage from the 1976 elections. The introductory music and wavering animation of a Minuteman's head, the tickertape sound effects, the faces of journalists we recognize, but minus four decades. Harry Reasoner welcomes viewers to ""this first election of our third century,"" a jarring statement, until you remember that any presidential election in 1976 would necessarily be soaked in patriotic recognition of the bicentennial. Then, later in the broadcast, the team shows the current map of who's winning which state. And that, too, is jarring.     The Democrats are blue and the Republicans are ... yellow? Why aren't they red? The answer is: Because the assignation of red-as-Republican, blue-as-Democrat didn't become the standard until the last election of the third century in which America existed: the election of 2000.     There have been a number of good assessments of how the way in which we depict the two parties has evolved. One of the earliest appeared here in the Post, shortly before the 2004 election. There was one shortly after that in Washington Monthly which is often cited; probably the most thorough is this one, from the Smithsonian.     What's clear is that, prior to 2000, talking about ""red states"" and ""blue states"" wouldn't necessarily have resulted in any understanding from your audience. In 1992, David Nyhan of the Boston Globe wrote of his mixed feelings about Bill Clinton's candidacy. ""[W]hen the anchormen turn to their electronic tote boards election night,"" he wrote, ""and the red states for Clinton start swamping the blue states for Bush, this will be a strange night for me."" You'll notice that those colors are backward, by our current understanding. Nyhan is being figurative we can assume, recognizing the standard red-blue split if not the significance of the colors. But by 1992, networks seem to have mostly settled on red-for-Republican, blue-for-Democrat. The first network to use a colored-state graphic for its election night broadcast was not NBC in 1976 (as this NBC-produced book about election nights would have you believe). It appears instead to have been CBS in 1972, which used segments of the country to illustrate how things were progressing. (The color on this is murky; just know that Nixon -- blue -- ended up winning all of these states.)     (It's worth remembering that for several decades, map colors didn't matter, since the footage was in black-and-white. Of course, for the first 40-plus presidential races, there was no television at all. People had to rely on -- shudder -- newspapers.) The Smithsonian article tells a great story about the 1976 NBC map, which was a huge, physical map constructed of wood and plastic. When they practiced lighting up the bulbs, the plastic started to melt, requiring the installation of giant air conditioners. NBC, too, used red-for-Democrats, blue-for-Republicans.     There's some discussion of why networks first drifted toward those colors. Red, the Smithsonian article suggests, was color non grata in American politics at the time, thanks to the Cold War. Red, of course, was associated with the Soviet Union, because it was associated with communism and socialism -- and with left-leaning parties internationally. (See this poll from the upcoming British elections: Labour is red; the conservatives, blue.) NBC kept using red-for-Democrats, blue-for-Republicans until at least 1984. By 1988, no network footage that we found used that combination, instead opting for the now-familiar Republican red, Democratic blue.     Most Americans probably weren't paying very close attention to the decisions made by networks every four years, so it's pretty safe to assume that they, like Nyhan, wouldn't immediately have associated the parties as we do now. Then there was the election of 2000, which, if you were born at any point after, say, 1985, and care even a tiny bit about politics, is seared into your memory. Al Gore won Florida, and then he didn't, and then George Bush won Florida, and then he didn't, and we had no idea who the next president would be for several weeks. This was just at the cusp of the internet/cable news era, so pundits kept busy making and pointing to and discussing maps of the states and how Bush or Gore would end up winning this thing. And those maps, in heavy rotation, looked like the maps from election night: Republican red, Democratic blue. The 2004 Post article by Paul Farhi suggests that ""the 2000 election, NBC's graphics department and David Letterman all played critical roles."" NBC graphics, because that prompted Tim Russert and Matt Lauer to discuss red and blue states shortly before Election Night. David Letterman, because he made one of the early jokes on the subject, while Florida's votes were still being counted. ""The candidates will work out a compromise,"" he joked on November 14. ""And thank God, not a minute too soon. Here's how it's going to go. George W. Bush will be president for the red states. Al W. Gore will be president for the blue states. And that's -- that's the best they can do."" Two things are interesting about that. First, that the audience is expected to understand what it means. And second, that Letterman was hardly the first to make the joke. A letter to the editors of the Post on November 11 from Robert Forman made the same proposal, ""Why not let Gore be the president of the United States of America to include all the blue states east of the Mississippi? Bush could be the president of the Confederate States of America, to include all the red states on both sides of the Mississippi."" The dichotomy had already set in.     There's nothing about the color assignations which are unchangeable, of course. We could just as easily use orange and green, but for the fact that red and blue offer much more contrast (and therefore are good for television). There have been complaints, like Clark Bensen of Polidata's 2004 memo tilting at this color-coded windmill. But it's become so familiar that there's no reason to think it will go away -- and in our ever-so-polarized politics, referring to clusters of votes or states with a shorthand is awfully useful. And a large, color-coded map with electoral totals displayed is to election night what the first-down marker and subtle score indicator are to NFL games: Evolutions of informational design that make it easier for enthusiasts to follow along. When Richard Nixon won the presidency in 1968, this is how NBC tallied the results in each state.     Lots of information, but hardly making the most of the medium. And the red check mark is just coincidental. When Hubert Humphrey won a state on rare occasion, his check mark was also red.  Here, go watch old election night footage: NBC, 1960; CBS, 1968; NBC, 1968; ABC, 1972; CBS, 1972; ABC, 1976; NBC, 1976; CBS, 1980; NBC, 1980; CBS, 1984; NBC, 1984; CBS, 1988; ABC, 1992; CBS, 1992; CNN, 1992; CNN, 1996; CNN, 2000; and NBC, 2000."

On each of his stops for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, he has been greeted by screaming crowds and a palpable nostalgia embodied by the same largely improvised exchange.  ""I love you,"" a voice from the crowd inevitably calls. ""Love you, too,"" Obama always replies. The exchange captures one of the striking paradoxes of this election season: At a moment defined by anger at Washington, voter cynicism and two historically unpopular presidential candidates, Obama's approval rating is the highest it has been since his first days in office. It now stands at 56 percent, according to a Gallup tracking poll released Sunday.     Obama was a symbol for healing America's racial wounds. His legacy will reflect a more complicated story. View Graphic     Obama was a symbol for healing America's racial wounds. His legacy will reflect a more complicated story.  For the first time in decades -- dating back to Ronald Reagan -- a lame-duck incumbent is in high demand on the campaign trail.  The good feelings, meanwhile, extend beyond the president himself. First lady Michelle Obama has been perhaps Clinton's most effective surrogate, campaigning alongside her in North Carolina last month. In crucial swing states such as Florida and Pennsylvania, Vice President Biden's popularity surpasses even that of the president at his eight-year peak. Nearly two-thirds of voters in Pennsylvania, for example, have a favorable view of the vice president and the first lady, according to a recent Bloomberg Politics poll. Some key factors have worked to the president's advantage. Respectable job growth and declining unemployment have helped the public mood, and for the most part, this White House has not been hobbled by any significant scandals in the second term.  But the biggest reason for the late-term surge in presidential popularity may be the election itself. ""I know a lot of you are cynical about politics,"" Obama told a crowd in Miami last week. ""There's a lot about this election that gives you reason to be.""   [Obama veers off script, turns up the passion at Clinton rally in Florida]  Presidential elections often are, at least in part, a referendum on the incumbent. But for months, Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump have been blasting away at each other in what amounts to a contest about character between two highly polarizing figures. Even a recent surge in insurance premiums associated with the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature domestic policy accomplishment, has left the president largely unscathed, and broader Republican attacks on him have not been particularly effective. ""We should have been able to say, 'We're ready for a change,' "" Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said. ""That has not been done successfully by the Trump campaign.""     At a rally for Hillary Clinton in Miami on Nov. 2, President Obama said Sen. Marco Rubio's vote for Donald Trump shows that the Florida Republican ""will say anything or be anything"" to ""get elected or cling to power."" Obama told voters to elect Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) instead. (The Washington Post)   Typically, Obama is Trump's third or fourth target, behind Clinton, the GOP establishment and the news media. Last week, as Trump's plane was taxiing for takeoff in Miami, he spotted Air Force One on the tarmac. ""He's down here campaigning for Crooked Hillary,"" Trump said at a rally later that afternoon. ""Why isn't he back in the White House bringing our jobs back? And helping our veterans? Why? Why isn't he back working?"" Trump, however, has been either unwilling or unable to go after Obama for his handling of foreign affairs, the area where support for the president's policies is weakest. Since 2012, nearly 400,000 Syrians have died in that country's civil war, while nearly 5 million have fled as refugees. Amid that worsening humanitarian catastrophe, the toughest critiques of Obama's approach have come from Clinton, who has questioned the president's unwillingness to arm Syrian rebels early in the conflict or establish no-fly zones to protect American allies from Russian and Syrian bombs. Trump, channeling the electorate's fatalism regarding the Middle East, has broken with Republican Party orthodoxy and suggested outsourcing the crisis to the Russian and Syrian regime forces.  ""Things are not going well in Syria or Iraq,"" said Michael Singh, a former top foreign policy official in George W. Bush's White House. ""But there is no heated partisan debate on how to handle it."" As the rhetoric has grown louder and meaner, Obama also has benefited from a White House message machine built, over the past eight years, for the digital age. Both the president and the first lady have been in heavy rotation on the TV talk-show circuit. Michelle Obama's ""Carpool Karaoke"" appearance with ""Late Late Show"" host James Corden has garnered more than 46 million views since it first aired in July -- an audience that dwarfs any for campaign advertising in the current election cycle.      [Here's why Joe Biden chose Obama to deliver his son's eulogy]  The president, meanwhile, has gone from being a relative newcomer to national politics when he won in 2008 to a more practiced and confident politician.  ""I know what I'm doing, and I'm fearless,"" Obama said in a podcast interview last year.  Jennifer Psaki, the White House communications director and a longtime Obama aide, recently made a similar point in an interview: ""What people are seeing is that he feels liberated, and he's able to be the wonky, optimistic, slightly nerdy president that people elected."" In the final months of his presidency, Obama has played on that public nostalgia, returning repeatedly to the broader themes of the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech that made him a political star and his 2008 inaugural address. ""I'm asking you the same thing I asked of you eight years ago,"" he said in Miami. ""I'm asking you to believe -- not in my ability to change things or one person's ability change things . . . I'm asking you to believe in your ability to change things."" Obama's campaign audiences are often full of young, college-age voters, many of whom were in elementary school when he was elected. The message, however, is the same Obama message. ""You can draw a straight line between that speech in 2004 and the speeches"" he is giving on the campaign trail, said David Simas, White House political director.  The question is whether that loyalty and good feeling will transfer to Clinton.  Obama spent the hours leading up to Election Day trying to rally the vote in swing states where support for Clinton, particularly among young people and African Americans, looks shaky. Several of the president's former campaign aides have started sharing their own video, titled ""Do It for Obama,"" in which they recount war stories and explain why Clinton deserves support. Liz Jaff, who worked on both of Obama's presidential campaigns and helped create the video, has spent more than a week turning out voters in Ohio. As she walked around a parking lot in Columbus near Clinton's campaign office, she worried that a Trump victory would essentially be a repudiation of Obama's presidency. ""If we elected the first African American president and it just opened up more racism in our society, it's just really hard,"" she said, her voice cracking as she started to cry.  ""We did everything for him,"" she said. ""It should be the same for her.""  Jenna Johnson contributed to this report. "

To persecuted journalists in Burundi, it amounts to ""a total loss of dignity."" The government-scripted press of Beijing diagnoses ""an empire moving downhill."" And the spin doctors of the Kremlin see cause for pure and unambiguous delight. The U.S. presidential election -- America's quadrennial chance to showcase for the world how democracy works in the most powerful nation on Earth -- has become instead an object lesson in everything that ails a country long seen as a beacon of freedom and hope. Debates devoid of issues and deep in the gutter of personal insult. Interference from foreign intelligence services. Endless leaked emails, and FBI investigations that could extend long beyond Tuesday. Americans may cringe watching their own election at close range. But the world's reaction has been, in a sense, even more poignant and foreboding. People in small and distant countries who count on the United States to stand up for democratic values have been astonished to see the essential components -- a free press, the rule of law, respect for the outcome of elections -- trammeled.     What do everyday people around the world think of the U.S. presidential election and the Democratic and Republican front-runners? We wanted to know, so seven reporters from Washington Post foreign bureaus asked a random selection of people on the street what they thought of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)   Long-standing allies have been left to wonder whether the essential American character has changed, and whether the United States can be relied on when it counts. Adversaries have looked on with glee, surprised at how easily the country that casts itself as the greatest can be knocked off kilter. And even though the campaign still has days to go -- with the outcome very much in doubt -- the damage to American moral standing may already be done. ""I heard the election is being controlled by Russia. Is it true?"" asked Anas al-Abed, 27, a Beirut cafe worker who said he has been following the campaign closely ever since he read that the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, had bragged about assaulting women. ""America always spoke to Arab countries as if they had so much to learn,"" he said. ""And now we see their own democracy involves choosing between a woman from a dynasty and a man who says the system is manipulated. If that's democracy, then we don't want it.""  [Will Trump be 'Brexit times five'? He may need to be if he wants to win.]  This is not the first time that America's international reputation has been dealt a grievous blow. In recent years, the Iraq War brought global perceptions of the United States tumbling, only to be revived by the election of President Obama -- who remains broadly popular overseas. But political analysts worldwide said that never before have they seen a presidential campaign do so much to directly undermine America's core credibility. ""It's very shocking and disturbing to see this happening on such a scale in the richest country on Earth,"" said Koichi Nakano, a political-science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. It is not, of course, happening in a vacuum. Democracies from Southeast Asia to Western Europe are under pressure from within as populism and xenophobia surge. Autocrats from Moscow to the Middle East, meanwhile, are feeling emboldened. ""It isn't just about this election,"" said Jacob Parakilas, deputy head of the U.S. and Americas program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. ""It fits into a broader framework of rising nationalism and the destruction of existing political norms."" But with the breakdown of those norms happening so vividly in America -- a nation that proselytizes the virtues of democracy more aggressively than any other -- the global swing toward less free and open societies could accelerate no matter who wins Tuesday. ""This campaign makes the implicit argument that the U.S. model of liberal democracy isn't what it's cracked up to be,"" Parakilas said.  [Across Europe, revulsion at Trump but little idea of what to do about him]  America's top diplomat has acknowledged as much. Speaking to students in London on Monday, Secretary of State John F. Kerry called the campaign ""downright embarrassing"" and said that it has already damaged American influence. Thanks to the election, he said, he is greeted with skeptical looks -- or worse -- when he sits down ""with some foreign minister in another country or with the president or prime minister of another country and you say, 'Hey, we really want you to move more authoritatively towards democracy.' "" In the state-controlled media of America's nondemocratic rivals and adversaries, the campaign has only exposed what they long knew the country to be -- a declining and morally bankrupt power. ""We are seeing the failure of U.S. democracy,"" wrote Zhang Zhixin, an expert on American politics at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations. The message is not only that America is floundering but also that China, prosperous and stable, is growing strong in its place. With Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte promising to ""separate"" from the United States and realign with China's ""ideological flow,"" Communist Party-approved writers seem to see an opening for more shifts in China's favor. A recent piece in Xinhua, the state-controlled news wire, cited work by Li Wen, an academic at the Chinese Academy for Social Sciences, who argued that instability in the United States shows the ""twisted mentality of an empire moving downhill."" In Russia, the campaign has not exactly reshaped perceptions of the United States. But it has reshaped Russians' perception of what their country is capable of doing to the United States. Russian observers barely hide their joy at the notion that Americans think that Moscow has the power to affect the outcome of a U.S. presidential election. ""When we hear that we are sitting here in Moscow and interfering in America's life, that makes us all happy,"" said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political consultant who served at the Kremlin between 1996 and 2011. ""We don't need to do anything; we can just sit here and organize elections in the United States."" Like most Russians, Pavlovsky is unwilling to acknowledge the U.S. administration's accusation that Kremlin-sponsored hackers have been meddling in the campaign. But in a country where people feel the United States has overplayed its hand as the world's sole superpower, American officials' consternation over Russia's suspected role is seen as payback -- and a possible political advantage. ""The feeling is that the chaos, the turbulence that all this is causing in the American electoral process is good for Russia,"" said Alexei Venediktov, editor in chief of Ekho Moskvy radio. ""Whoever wins will have to deal with domestic upheaval and internal problems, rather than paying attention to Russia, and that is a good thing.""  [After Clinton, Trump's real enemy is 'globalism']  To U.S. allies, however, it is potentially disastrous. Trump has struck fear into the hearts of European leaders with suggestions that he may not come to the aid of fellow NATO members if they are attacked. Several have broken with protocol -- which calls for strict neutrality -- and denounced the Republican nominee, while praising his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. But Europe is confronting its own backlash against international cooperation. Across the continent, anti-immigration politicians who want to pull their nations out of the European Union have exulted in Trump's success. ""Until about a year ago, when I would meet American counterparts, they'd ask, 'What is happening in Europe?' "" said Marietje Schaake, a member of the European Parliament. She listed far-right leaders and parties that no longer seem so alien in America. ""We're seeing a shared challenge arising: challenges to the open economy and open democracies,"" she said. Among some American allies, the U.S. campaign has even been a strange source of comfort because their own politics no longer look so bad. Israel, known for its bare-knuckles brand of political jousting and for corruption cases that have snared presidents and prime ministers, has been unusually fixated on this year's race. ""Our politicians are perhaps not as crooked or corrupt as yours,"" said Jonathan Rynhold, a political scientist at Israel's Bar-Ilan University. ""Ours are fairly mild by comparison."" In India, too, the effect of such an ugly contest has been surprisingly validating. ""For many middle-class Indians, the U.S. is a model for democracy. But watching the election campaign there now makes Indians feel slightly superior,"" said Shiv Visvanathan, a government professor at O.P. Jindal Global University. It has also been deeply disquieting. ""How can such a trigger-happy nation be part of the great nuclear club, and take global decisions?"" he asked.  [What is the long-term effect of Donald Trump?]  Many in the Arab world are asking similar questions and are particularly unnerved by the rise of Trump, said H.A. Hellyer, a political analyst and author of a book on the 2011 Egyptian uprising.  ""The fact he's a genuine contender has damaged American standing almost everywhere -- not least within the Arab world and the wider region,"" Hellyer said. ""His discourse, which has attacked Muslims . . . is not marginal. It is now mainstream, and that's deeply troubling."" The worry has also been especially acute in Mexico, where opinions toward Trump are overwhelmingly negative -- no surprise given that his signature issue is building a border wall. He also launched his campaign by calling Mexican migrants ""rapists."" Mexicans accustomed to feeling indifferent toward the U.S. presidential campaign have found themselves actively rooting for Trump to lose. ""For the first time there is a distinction: There's an American good guy and an American bad guy,"" said Ilan Semo, history professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. ""It was never like this in Mexico."" The angst over Trump is so deeply felt that the peso plunges every time his poll numbers rise, and there could be an immediate recession in Mexico if he comes to power, said Jonathan Heath, an economist in Mexico City. Anxiety about the presidential contest extends far south of any potential future border wall. Latin America has been shifting back toward the political center in recent years after a long period dominated by left-wing populism. But the new crop of pro-business leaders has found that no one in the presidential race is willing to stick up for the principles of free trade and open markets that the United States has been pushing in the region for years. Political whiplash is happening in Africa, too. For many on the continent, Obama's election had been a triumph, evidence that American democracy could be a model of liberalism and tolerance. Now, eight years later, Trump's threats to jail his political opponent mimics the behavior of some of the continent's own less-than-democratic leaders. Among them is President Pierre Nkurunziza of the small central African nation of Burundi. He was sworn in for a third term in August 2015, and exiled activists have been lobbying the United States to help halt the extrajudicial killings and repression that have characterized his new term. The campaign, however, has offered little cause for optimism in a country such as Burundi, far from America's geopolitical priorities but in dire need of help from a superpower.  Elvis Banyankiye, a 28-year-old Burundian who is now studying in France, said he had once hoped the Americans would do more to pressure his government to stop human rights violations. Watching the U.S. presidential campaign stagger from one new low to the next, his expectations sank. ""The U.S. has been a model for how to conduct elections. We used to see tolerance in the debates,"" he said. ""We are losing confidence in that.""
