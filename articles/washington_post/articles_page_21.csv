Seven candidates are competing Sunday in the first round of the primary. A runoff will be held between the top two vote-getters a week later. The three leading candidates are former president Nicolas Sarkozy and former prime ministers Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe. The candidates have been keeping a close eye on far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, whose criticism of immigration and Muslim practices resonates with many voters. It's the first such primary organized by France's conservatives, making the outcome hard to predict. Candidates previously were designated internally. Results from the first-round voting are expected late Sunday. French conservatives were voting in a nationwide primary Sunday to choose their nominee for next year's presidential election, after a campaign marked by concerns about immigration and Islamic extremism -- and overshadowed by the rise of a populist leader emboldened by Donald Trump's election. Seven candidates are competing in the first round of the primary. A runoff will be held between the top two vote-getters a week later.. The three leading candidates are former president Nicolas Sarkozy, 61, and former prime ministers Francois Fillon, 62, and Alain Juppe, 72. As a new wave of populism sweeps governments in the West, the winner of the conservative primary is expected to have strong chances of winning the April-May presidential election. The campaign has focused on a surge in immigration -- a hotly debated issue throughout Europe -- and security concerns following recent attacks by Islamic extremists. The conservative candidates have been watching the political rise of far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who is hoping anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and anti-establishment sentiment can propel her to the presidency. Le Pen, the official candidate of her National Front party, celebrated U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's victory as a sign of hope for her campaign. Sarkozy hopes to pull votes from people attracted to Le Pen. He has called for stricter immigration rules across Europe, and vowed to ban Muslim women from wearing headscarves at universities and possibly elsewhere. Hijabs already are banned in French schools, like all other visible signs of religion in strictly secular France. Fillon -- who has enjoyed a recent boost in popularity thanks to his image of authority and seriousness compared to Sarkozy's more outspoken, brazen demeanor -- pledges to organize a referendum on a quota system for immigrants. In contrast, Juppe is advocating a more peaceful vision of French society, based on respect for religious freedom and ethnic diversity. On the economic front, all candidates want to lower taxes --especially on businesses-- and reduce the number of public servants. They also all agree to reverse the 35-hour workweek, a measure applied to all French employees since 2000. This is the first time French conservatives are holding a primary, making outcomes hard to predict. Candidates previously were designated via an internal procedure. The Socialist Party organized France's first-ever primary in 2011, a vote won by Francois Hollande, who went on to win the French presidency the following year. Hollande, whose popularity has plunged amid economic stagnation and extremist violence, hasn't said whether he will seek re-election. All French citizens over 18 -- whether they are members of the conservatives' party or not-- can vote in the primary if they pay 2 euros in organization fees and sign a pledge stating they ""share the republican values of the right and the center"" by signing a document. The expected number of voters in Sunday's election varies from 2 to 4 million people, out of over 44 million citizens registered on electoral rolls. They can vote in 10,228 polling stations open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. across the country. Results are expected late on Sunday. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Merkel refused to comment on the possibility during a press conference with U.S. President Barack Obama last week. She said she would announce her plans when the time was right. However, the 62-year-old chancellor is expected to talk about a possible candidacy during a Sunday night news conference at the Berlin headquarters of her political party, the Christian Democrats. Several high-ranking party members and Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel have in recent days said they expect Merkel to run for re-election in 2017. Merkel became Germany's first female head of government in 2005. She also is the first leader of a reunited Germany to have grown up under communism in the former East Germany.

Korean prosecutors say Park conspired with her friend	" SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean prosecutors on Sunday said they believe President Park Geun-hye conspired in criminal activities of a secretive confidante who allegedly manipulated government affairs and exploited her presidential ties to amass an illicit fortune -- a damning revelation that may convince opposition parties to push for her impeachment. Prosecutors are planning to soon question Park, who has immunity but can be investigated, said Lee Young-ryeol, chief prosecutor of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. Prosecutors on Sunday formally charged Park's longtime friend, Choi Soon-sil, on suspicion of interfering with state affairs and bullying companies into giving tens of millions of dollars to foundations and businesses she controlled. In a televised news conference, Lee said that based on the evidence, ""the president was collusively involved in a considerable part of the criminal activities by suspects Choi Soon-sil, Ahn Jong-beom and Jung Ho-sung."" He was referring to two presidential aides who also were formally charged Sunday for allegedly helping Choi.  ""However, because of the president's impunity from prosecution stated in Article 84 of the constitution, we cannot indict the president. The special investigation headquarters will continue to push for an investigation of the president based on this judgment,"" Lee said. Park's office had no immediate comment Sunday. The country's largest opposition party, the Minjoo, issued a statement calling for Park to immediately resigns, saying that a ""criminal suspect"" should not be allowed to lead the country.  ""If President Park continues to refuse (to resign), the people's demand for impeachment will grow. President Park should not throw country into larger confusion and (should) make a decision to voluntarily step down,"" the party said. It questioned whether the prosecution was investigating the allegations thoroughly enough, and asked why bribery charges haven't been pursued against the suspects. Park is facing growing calls to resign over the scandal critics say has undermined the country's democracy. Although emboldened by a wave of mass protests, opposition parties have so far refrained from seriously pushing for Park's impeachment over fears of triggering a backlash from conservative voters and negatively impacting next year's presidential election. However, there are growing voices within the opposition saying that an impeachment attempt is inevitable because it's unlikely Park will resign and give up her immunity. Ahn Jong-beom, Park's former senior secretary for policy coordination, was charged with abuse of authority, coercion and attempted coercion over allegations that he pressured companies into making large donations to foundations and companies Choi controlled. Jung Ho-sung, the other former aide who was indicted, was accused of passing on classified presidential documents to Choi, including information on ministerial candidates. The indictments were made based on evidence such as presidential documents, Ahn's personal notes, and Jung's cellphone records, and also what was confirmed in the questioning of multiple former government officials and the chairmen of nine large companies who had held private meetings with the president, Lee said. According to Lee, Choi and Ahn conspired to pressure companies into giving a combined 77.4 billion won ($65.5 million) to the Mir and K-Sports foundations, two nonprofits that were under Choi's control. The companies couldn't refuse because they feared doing so would result in business disadvantages, such as difficulties in gaining government approval for projects or being targeted in tax investigations, Lee said. Additionally, Choi and Ahn pressured the Lotte Group into giving 7 billion won ($5.9 million) to the K Sports foundation to finance the construction of a sports facility in the city of Hanam, which was to be operated by The Blue K, a company established by Choi, Lee said. Auto giant Hyundai and telecommunications company KT were forced to contract 13 billion won ($11 million) worth of their advertisements to Playground, an ad agency virtually run by Choi, Lee said. Hyundai was also forced to buy 1.1 billion won ($931,000) worth of supplies from an auto parts maker run by Choi's friend. Ahn and Choi also tried but failed to take over the shares of an advertisement company previously owned by steelmaker POSCO, Lee said. Prosecutors are also seeking to indict Cha Eun-taek, a famous music video director who allegedly used his close relationship with Choi to win lucrative government culture projects, and former vice sports minister Kim Chong, suspected of providing business favors to sports organizations controlled by Choi. Kim is also under suspicion of influencing the ministry's decision to financially support a sports foundation run by Choi's niece, who prosecutors detained on Friday. On Saturday, police said about 170,000 people turned out for the latest anti-Park protest in streets near City Hall and a boulevard fronting an old palace gate in Seoul. Demonstrators also marched in streets near the presidential offices, carrying candles and illuminating cellphones, and shouting ""Park Geun-hye step down"" and ""Arrest Park Geun-hye."" Park's term lasts until Feb. 24, 2018. If she steps down before the presidential vote on Dec. 20, 2017, an election must be held within 60 days. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The 84-year-old retired pathologist from Buffalo was aboard the SS St. Louis, the famed trans-Atlantic liner carrying nearly 1,000 Jewish refugees from Germany in 1939 that was rejected by the United States and Cuba and forced to return to Europe. More than a quarter of the passengers ultimately perished in Nazi death camps and the ship's saga became a symbol of Western indifference toward the victims of Nazi persecution. Messinger, who eventually escaped from a French detention camp along with his parents, is among a half-dozen surviving passengers who are in Israel to reflect on their pasts and discuss what can be learned from their experience to cope with the influx of refugees escaping conflicts in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.  ""They are being driven out in a great sense like we were driven out and they also have very few places to go to,"" he said after a conference Wednesday on the topic at Hebrew University. ""It's an outrage that things like this can still happen in our world."" On May 13, 1939, the St. Louis set sail from Hamburg, Germany, for Havana with 937 passengers on board, nearly all German Jews fleeing the Third Reich in the wake of the Kristallnacht pogroms against them. Long before Adolf Hitler plotted the destruction of European Jews, he pushed for their expulsion. The St. Louis offered a powerful propaganda tool, showing that no one else wanted them either -- a move some historians conclude emboldened Hitler to push for their annihilation instead. The ship anchored at sea near Havana, where relatives waited to greet passengers, but was not allowed to dock. After Cuba rejected nearly all the passengers, and one of them slit his wrists and jumped overboard in despair, the St. Louis sailed north toward Florida, getting close enough to Miami to see its palm trees and lights. For three days it lingered as passengers cabled President Franklin D. Roosevelt, begging for refuge and Jewish advocates waged a high-profile campaign on their behalf. After they were turned away, the ship's German captain, Gustav Schroeder, stalled on the return voyage, refusing to return to Germany until he had secured his passengers a safe haven. While at sea, an agreement was reached to disperse them among England, Belgium, Holland and France. Still, 254 eventually died in Nazi death camps. In all, 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. The affair was later adapted into the film ""Voyage of the Damned,"" and the SS St. Louis Legacy Project, which documented the history of the voyage and arranged this week's conference, successfully pushed for an apology from the U.S. State Department. Rebecca Kobrin, a history professor at Columbia University, said parallels could be drawn between the Jewish refugee crisis of the last century and the current migrant crisis, noting the same terminology of a ""Trojan Horse"" was used to describe their perceived danger. Then, the displaced Jews invoked an unfounded fear of communism, while today the Arabs invoke a fear of terrorism, she said.  ""The refugees today, who no one wants, their future is unknown,"" she said. ""The message is that when refugees are given a chance they contribute to the societies that absorb them."" Not all of the St. Louis passengers accept the comparison. Gisela Feldman, a 93-year-old former passenger from Manchester, England, said there were important differences between Nazi-era Jews and today's migrants. She said the Jews, who were fleeing religious persecution and near-certain death, posed a threat to no one, while many of today's migrants were merely seeking economic opportunities. She also warned that the huge numbers of today's refugee crisis have already created an anti-immigrant backlash that contributed to Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump.  ""The refugees from Hitler were in danger for their lives,"" she said. Scott Miller, of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, said American policy leading up to World War II was particularly intransigent. He said most of the St. Louis passengers were on waiting lists for entry permits, but the U.S. would not let them in early. The St. Louis' legacy is that ""there are individual consequences to a less than generous refugee policy in a time of crisis,"" he said. Messinger, an only child who turned 7 while on the ship, recalls speaking through a porthole to his relatives, who had come from America to greet them in Havana, his mother tossing them a bar of German chocolate and lamenting that ""at least that made it."" Later, he said he stood against the railing of the upper deck with his father looking out toward South Beach -- a memory that still makes him emotional every time he visits Miami. The family was dispatched to Belgium and fled to Paris just before the Nazis arrived. From there, they were placed in a detention camp near the Spanish border. ""My mother and I escaped on Christmas Eve, because the French soldiers were drunk. And my father escaped on New Year's Eve because the French soldiers were drunk,"" he said with a smile. Messinger and his parents made it to New York in 1942. He said he tries to avoid politics when speaking of refugees and he hopes authorities will do the same.  ""Try to treat immigrants as family if at all possible, and try to do for them what you would do for your family,"" he said. ""Because, in effect, all human beings really are family."" ____ Follow Aron Heller on Twitter at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Thomas told 1,700 people at a dinner in honor of Scalia that the Supreme Court has too often granted rights to people that are not found in the Constitution. He cited the decision in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal across the country. Thomas said he and his longtime friend and colleague formed an ""odd couple"" of a white New Yorker and a black man from Georgia. He paraphrased Lincoln's Gettysburg address to exhort the audience to ""be dedicated to the unfinished business for which Justice Scalia gave his last full measure of devotion."" Thomas and Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito were the bookends of the Thursday meeting of the Federalist Society, at which conservatives were reveling in Donald Trump's unexpected victory in the presidential election because it is likely to result in the appointment of conservative judges to the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Alito issued his own rallying cry to conservatives, describing religious freedom and gun rights as among ""constitutional fault lines,"" important issues at stake in the federal courts. The conference of conservatism's leading legal lights took on a new air of importance with Trump's victory, and included a list of judges the president-elect has named as candidates to fill the vacancy created by Scalia's death last February. In their remarks, Thomas and Alito didn't mention the election or the vacancy, rather using the platform to pay tribute to Scalia, a longtime colleague and conservative ally in high-court battles on hot-button social and political issues. Alito said Scalia, a hero to many of the group's 40,000 members, is sorely missed on the court. ""We are left to ask ourselves WWSD,"" what would Scalia do, Alito said. The lettering is a play on the phrase ""WWJD,"" for what would Jesus do. In the halls of the conference there was little formal talk of the election or the fight to seat a new justice. But attendees packed a lunchtime panel moderated by Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, one of 21 people on Trump's list, and the Supreme Court vacancy was the talk of hallway chatter among lawyers who ranged from Trump backers to those who proclaimed they would never vote for him. Larsen served as a Supreme Court law clerk to Scalia and said he valued his clerks' frank assessment of his work. ""It was a formidable task to stand up to Justice Scalia and say, 'You have gone too far.' But he valued that,"" Larsen said. Later, she declined to discuss her status on Trump's list, saying she intends to complete her state court term, which runs through 2018. ""That's really where my focus lies,"" she said in a brief conversation with The Associated Press. Other sessions were moderated by Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras and federal appellate judges William Pryor and Thomas Hardiman, all on Trump's list. Before the conference ends Saturday, nine judges on the list are expected to appear. The court has been operating with eight justices since Scalia's death because Senate Republicans blocked action on President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. The conference turned into an impromptu job fair for spots in the new administration.  ""The mood has changed. Everyone is going to be thinking, 'Maybe someone here is going to be filling Justice Scalia's shoes,'"" said Abbe Gluck, a Yale Law professor who is not a member of the group but will participate in the conference. The Federalist Society got its start on college campuses when Ronald Reagan was in the White House. It was conceived as a way to counter what its members saw as liberal domination of the nation's law-school faculties. Its influence was pronounced during the presidency of George W. Bush, when its leaders helped rally support for Senate confirmation of Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts. The group was so successful that it spawned copycat liberal organizations. Speaking at a Federalist Society event in the Bush years was akin to an out-of-town preview of a Broadway show for conservative lawyers looking for administration jobs or judgeships, author Mark Tushnet has written. Over the past eight years, the group provided a forum for opponents of Obama's court choices and policies, although the Federalist Society itself does not endorse candidates or take policy positions. Some of its leaders backed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's refusal to act on Garland's nomination. That political strategy paid unexpected and huge dividends for conservatives with Trump's election. Now the society's star again appears to be on the rise.  ""Anytime there's a major shift in the power of government, it's an enormous opportunity for what is probably the collection of the smartest, most talented and most publicly minded lawyers in the country to roll up their sleeves and help advance the cause of constitutional government,"" said Leonard Leo, the group's executive vice president. Leo met with Trump in New York on Wednesday and said afterward that Trump has yet to pare down his long list of names of Supreme Court hopefuls. Nan Aron, the president of Alliance for Justice, said the Federalist Society ""promotes a way of looking at the law which upholds the rights of the powerful and the wealthy."" Aron said it is ""regrettable that so many nominees on Trump's list are going to attend Federalist Society events."" Yet a conservative legal scholar who has been critical of Trump said the group's involvement in identifying candidates for judgeships and other jobs in the new administration is not something to fear.  ""In fact, if the Federalist Society does play a role in identifying the president-elect's nominees, that could be comforting to some who have reservations about Donald Trump's administration, because such a role would suggest, at least in this area, continuity with longstanding, mainstream Republican practice,"" University of Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett said in an email. ___ Associated Press writer Sam Hananel contributed to this report.

Billings, a former aide to Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie and a key author of the Clean Air Act and other landmark environmental laws, has died. Billings, 78, died Tuesday in Nashville, Tennessee, after suffering a stroke while visiting family. Born in Montana, Billings moved to Washington in 1962 and had a 50-year career in politics and public policy. As the first staff director of the Senate Environment subcommittee, Billings was a primary author of the 1970 Clean Air Act, one of the first and most influential environmental laws in U.S. history and a foundation for current air pollution laws. Billings also played a key role in the 1972 Clean Water Act, the primary federal law governing water pollution, and 1977 amendments to both the air and water pollution laws. Billings served as Muskie's environment adviser for more than a decade and later was the Democrat's chief of staff in the Senate and when Muskie was secretary of state under President Jimmy Carter. Billings also taught politics at the University of Southern California and served in the Maryland Legislature from 1991 to 2003, focusing on environmental issues. He later ran a consulting firm and taught college courses on the Clean Air Act and other laws. Tom Jorling, who was Republican staff director on the Senate subcommittee while Billings led the Democratic majority, said Billings ""had tremendous skills legislatively and politically. He was respected and trusted by all members of the committee, majority and minority. His talent and skills led to the enactment of the foundational environmental laws of that era."" Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator William K. Reilly, who worked in the Nixon White House when the clean air and water laws were signed, called Billings ""an architect of the new order"" who did ""great work that the public health has benefited enormously from."" Billings' son, Paul, said his father learned the importance of advocating for social justice from his parents.  ""There was no greater public health champion. Our air and water are cleaner and Americans are healthier because of Leon Billings,"" said Paul Billings, senior vice president of the American Lung Association. Billings is survived by his wife, Cherry Billings, of Bethany Beach, Delaware, and three children. His first wife, former Maryland Del. Patricia Billings, died in 1990. Leon Billings was appointed to her seat before winning election in his own right. Jorling said Billings was disappointed to see clean air and water laws come under attack from Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, but said the laws have survived previous attacks from the White House and Congress. Trump has called climate change a hoax and vows to cut back the role of the Environmental Protection Agency, which he describes as a job killer.  ""Leon's work helped prevent any wholesale efforts at eliminating or rolling back those statutes"" in previous administrations, Jorling said. The current fight ""would have been a new challenge for Leon."" ___ AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He told fellow Republicans he had President-elect Donald Trump's support, and heralded ""the dawn of a new, unified Republican government.""  ""It feels really good to say that actually,"" Ryan told reporters. ""This will be a government focused on turning President-elect Trump's victory into real progress for the American people."" While victory was the GOP unifier, Democrats were verging on disarray. House Democrats abruptly announced Tuesday that they were delaying their own leadership elections set for Thursday until Nov. 30 to give lawmakers more time to process disastrous election results. It's not clear whether the election delay might morph into a real challenge to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. She has led House Democrats for more than 12 years and has consolidated support with strong fundraising and an ability to deliver votes, but there's long been grumbling from Democrats who say new leadership is needed at the top. As for Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican still has to win a floor vote for speaker in January, when all members of the House will cast ballots, including Democrats. But he secured the nomination at a closed-door GOP conference vote Tuesday afternoon with the strong backing of his fellow House Republicans, even though a few conservative dissenters pushed unsuccessfully to delay the balloting. Those grumblings of dissent could hardly be heard over the buzz of enthusiasm as House Republicans convened for their first regular conference meeting since Trump won the presidential election. Even though a number of House Republicans, including Ryan, had opposed Trump or were critical along the way, most said they're now firmly on board and prepared to try to enact Trump's agenda on immigration, infrastructure, energy and jobs. Republicans also backed California's Kevin McCarthy to continue as majority leader and Steve Scalise of Louisiana to stay on in the No. 3 job of House whip. Lawmakers trooped out of their morning meeting in the basement of the Capitol smiling, pledging quick action to roll back President Barack Obama's accomplishments and clutching red ""Make America Great Again"" hats.  ""That was a nice fun touch. Now here's my problem: Every member wants it autographed,"" said GOP Rep. Chris Collins of New York, who has been tapped as congressional liaison to the transition team. ""I'm going to have to say, 'President-elect Trump, bring out your Sharpie, we've got to do a lot of autographing.'"" During the meeting, Ryan told colleagues that he'd spoken Tuesday morning with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who said that he and Trump ""are very supportive of the leadership team and are looking forward to working with them,"" said Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo. Coming after a campaign full of very public GOP infighting and clashes between Ryan and Trump, it's ""a validating moment,"" said Lummis. Republicans had widely been seen at risk of losing the Senate and suffering major losses in the House, but instead lost just two Senate seats and a half-dozen in the House, giving them full-scale control of Washington for the first time in a decade. For Democrats, ill-feeling was only magnified in defeat.  ""Everything's not good. Business as usual is not gonna work,"" said Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. ""This is about our constituents. Saying we have heard you. We have clearly missed the mark with regard to legislation and messaging."" For Republicans, though, it was heady times after they've spent years watching their legislative priorities get stymied, if not by Democrats in the Senate then by Obama's veto pen. The situation also brings risks since Republicans will have no one to blame but themselves if they can't deliver on Trump's promises. Already GOP leaders and Trump himself have been shifting on some of his pledges, including the border wall and a full repeal of Obama's health care law. On Tuesday, Ryan refused to answer directly when asked if Congress would go along with Trump's plan to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. ""These are things we're working on. ... The point is Donald Trump wants jobs,"" he said. Ryan also avoided a direct answer on Trump's appointment of Stephen Bannon to a senior White House role. Bannon's Breitbart website, which embraces white nationalist currents, has frequently singled out Ryan himself for attacks.  ""Look, I would just simply say that the president is going to be judged on his results,"" Ryan said. ""I'm not looking backwards, I'm looking forward."" In the Senate, Republicans and Democrats were meeting separately Wednesday to pick their leadership teams. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is keeping his job in a chamber that Republicans will control by 52-48. Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is retiring after a 30-year Senate career and will be replaced by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ___ Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Alan Fram contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/15/why-republicans-might-have-wanted-donald-trump-to-lose/	Why Republicans might have wanted Donald Trump to lose	"   Protesters opposed to Donald Trump walk through downtown Santa Ana, Calif., on Nov. 13. (Ana Venegas/The Orange County Register via AP)  After last week's election, Democrats and liberals are rightly dispirited about their short-term political prospects. Republicans control the presidency, both houses of Congress, most state legislatures and governorships, and will soon have the opportunity to appoint at least one Supreme Court justice, setting the body's course for a generation. However, Democrats have some reasons for hope. Chief among these, ironically enough, is President Donald Trump himself. In polarized times, the president's brand has become inextricably linked to his party's brand. When the president is popular, his party benefits. But in an era where split-ticket voting is uncommon, even at the local level, an unpopular president can have disastrous effects for his party.   [This is why Senate Republicans might not go nuclear]   If Trump stumbles, Democrats may benefit. This logic is familiar to many Democrats. Just a decade ago, they took control of both houses of Congress. Two years later, in 2008, they increased their majorities and took the presidency, while simultaneously making big gains in state legislatures. While these gains may be attributed in part to messaging and organizing, Democrats also benefited from an increasingly unpopular President George W. Bush. Before the 2006 midterm election, Bush's approval rating was at 37 percent. By the end of his presidency, his approval rating had dropped to an anemic 28 percent. Similarly, after a brief honeymoon, President Obama lost popularity after the battle over and passage of the Affordable Care Act. In part as a result, Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in 2010.   [Chief Justice John Roberts had a very good election night]      Political scientists call the mechanism by which this works ""macropartisanship,"" which means distribution of voters of one party or another within the national electorate. Party identification is generally stable. But when presidents are popular and doing well, people become more likely to identify with his (or, someday, her) party -- and to dis-identify when he or she becomes unpopular.  For most people, partisanship -- which party they identify with -- determines whom they vote for in a general election. When the president's party loses support, it suffers -- as happened in 2006, 2008 and 2010. In the figure above, you see the share of respondents who identified with the Democratic Party, as a percentage of everyone who said they identified with either the Republicans or Democrats. The data are from Gallup and CBS-New York Times polls during the Bush and Obama years. You can see that when Bush was less popular before the 2006 midterm election, many more voters self-identified as Democrats. The reverse happened when President Obama's popularity dipped before the 2010 midterms, and fewer voters identified as Democrats. It's no coincidence that control of Congress changed hands in both these years.   [Even in defeat, Hillary Clinton's campaign could still inspire young women]   The Republicans did well in 2002, gaining seats in the House and taking back control of a divided Senate. Many expected the Democrats to do well that year, since voters often punish the incumbent party in a midterm year. But Bush's personal popularity rose after 9/11. Setting aside 2002, there are a variety of explanations for why the president's party historically suffers midterm losses. One theory has it that the American people are just more amenable to divided government and uncomfortable having a single party controlling Congress and the presidency. Another is that the president invariably becomes less popular after being elected because he's plunged into the messiness of building legislative coalitions, making deals and incurring the public's skepticism toward major policy changes.   [What does Donald Trump need for a successful presidency? Bureaucrats.]   It is difficult to tell the future of a Trump administration. He will be unlike any president the United States has seen before. We do know, however, that Trump will be coming into office with the lowest favorability ratings of any newly elected president in modern history. According to Gallup, 64 percent of voters hold an unfavorable opinion of Donald Trump. By comparison, President Obama came into office with 65 percent favorability rating among voters, the inverse of Trump's lack of popularity. Some aspects of Trump's legislative agenda -- which includes apparently bipartisan agenda items such as infrastructure spending and unorthodox items such as renegotiating trade deals and building a border wall -- will surely be resisted by his own party, leading to divisions despite Republican control of both houses of Congress.   [This new book helps explain the rise of Donald Trump]   The president-elect and the congressional GOP might agree on repealing the Affordable Care Act. But 20 million people stand to lose health insurance if the act is repealed; doing so could be politically costly. And aside from policy considerations, Trump's personal style may continue to be controversial. No matter who won Tuesday night, the victor was bound to face enormous challenges. The country is politically divided. The results suggest a general dissatisfaction with political elites and institutions. Don't be surprised, however, if Trump falls victim to this dissatisfaction himself, and if the Democrats reap the political rewards down the line.

Footage posted to YouTube shows the pilot addressing passengers over the intercom, telling them to ""let cooler heads prevail"" following a politically charged dispute on board the flight, which was headed from San Francisco to Puerta Vallarta, Mexico. Jon Bauer, the YouTube user who posted the video, said a scuffle broke out when someone with a ""'plaid shirt and camo cap' said something racist (about being 'glad to have kept his guns') to an African American lady"", and the woman began to cry. In the video, the pilot can be heard banning political discussion on his plane, at a time when tensions have erupted over Donald Trump's election. ""We're gonna be in a metal tube at 35,000 feet,"" the pilot says. ""I understand everybody has their opinions, that's fine. If you support him, great. If you don't, I understand. However, we're out here to go to Puerta Vallarta to have a good time."" In an emailed statement, United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy confirmed that a United pilot intervened in a situation aboard the flight. ""Our pilot was attempting to diffuse an argument between two customers and get everyone safely to their destination,"" she wrote. McCarthy did not elaborate on what prompted the intervention. The pilot can be heard imploring passengers to be respectful of one another, and keep their political views to themselves for the duration of the flight. ""Let cooler heads prevail and we can talk and realize that we're all human beings, and we all can stick together and we can all feel for this country in our own way and that's what we should do,"" he said. ""If there's anybody that has a problem with this...there's another flight tomorrow. You're not gonna be on this one."" Following the message, the passengers break into applause, and one can be heard shouting ""hear, hear."" McCarthy said no one was removed from the flight, and she was not aware of any other similar post-election incidents on United flights."

Yet somehow, the Republican National Committee chairman would come to earn the trust and confidence of President-elect Donald Trump, who on Sunday named Priebus as his chief of staff, along with flame-throwing media executive Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist. The position puts Priebus at the power center of the new Trump administration. The 44-year-old Wisconsin political operative will help guard access to the president-elect, guide policy and political decisions, and if past practice holds true, will often be, along with Bannon, the last person Trump consults before making major decisions. Priebus has no governing experience in Washington. Yet his extraordinary ability to build and maintain relationships with his party's power brokers and grassroots sets him apart from other prospective chiefs of staff. The affable and slow-talking Priebus maintains a particularly close relationship with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is also from Wisconsin. Yet Priebus may have been almost as popular among the Republican National Committee's 168 members, who represent many different factions of the GOP and come from every state in the nation. The two met in the late 1990s when Priebus was a party activist in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, and Ryan was running for Congress. Priebus eventually became the party chairman of Kenosha County, the First District (the speaker's district) and then Wisconsin party chairman. He's been a friend and adviser to Ryan all these many years. Priebus was already the longest serving chairman in party history, having worked in that role since January 2011, but he easily could have been re-elected early next year had he wanted to seek another term. More than anything, he served as the chief fundraiser for the Republican National Committee, a job he did very well. He used the tens of millions of dollars he helped raise to create a nationwide voter outreach operation that fueled Trump's stunning victory. Still, his status as a party insider caught the attention of Trump supporters such as tea party leader Jenny Beth Martin. She warned on Saturday that, ""No Washington insider, regardless of who it is, should serve as President Trump's chief of staff.""  ""It's time to drain the swamp -- not promote insiders beholden to the Washington establishment who helped create it,"" she said. Priebus' ability to earn Trump's trust and confidence ultimately outweighed any political concerns. He was perhaps the only major establishment leader to stand with Trump over the campaign's final weeks as much of the political world predicted the Republican nominee would lose the election. Priebus became Trump's regular traveling companion and confidant. He was optimistic until the very end.  ""I don't buy this conventional wisdom that somehow or other, things are bad. I think things are going well,"" he told The Associated Press a few days before the election. Priebus, a big Green Bay Packers fan, likes to talk sports, he plays the piano and is quick to poke fun at himself. His easygoing personality, self-deprecating humor and lack of knowledge of the legislative process, mark a particularly sharp contrast with President Barack Obama's first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. He married his high school sweetheart, Sally. They have two school-age children. Priebus' favors a ""big-tent"" political philosophy that encourages the GOP to welcome voters of all shapes and sizes. He condemned Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigrants in December.  ""I think it's the party for everybody. It's for everyone,"" Priebus told the AP days before Trump's victory. ""That the message that we're trying to get out across the country, which is it doesn't matter what the color of your skin is, what your faith is, what gender you are, or what age you are. This is a party of freedom, opportunity and equality. That's what our party is."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
