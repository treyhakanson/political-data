On Thursday, he became a U.S. citizen. Kouandjio was one of 34 individuals to receive U.S. citizenship at the U.S. District Courthouse in Buffalo Thursday morning.  ""I finally made it,"" Kouandjio said. ""It's been a long time coming. It's been 19 years. It's a good day."" Kouandjio and his family came to the United States from Cameroon in 1997. Kouandjio was given permanent residency status for political asylum. He became a standout offensive lineman in college at Alabama and was chosen 44th overall by the Bills in 2014. Kouandjio has served as a backup offensive tackle for most of his time with the Bills.  ""I'm just glad I'm now a part of the American process,"" Kouandjio said. ""I'm American. I can vote, I can do things. I can be a part of the democracy and be a part of this great nation. I feel really blessed."" He became the final member of his family to earn U.S. citizenship. His brother, Arie Kouandjio, became a U.S. citizen in September. Arie Kouandjio plays for the Washington Redskins.  ""I was the last piece of the puzzle in my family,"" Kouandjio said. ""Everybody's glad that it's finally over with.""  ""I see the value of being a part of a country where they value the pursuit of happiness and liberty and freedom. I always want to put an emphasis on the fact that I love this country because they respect every individual as a human being and this is the land where you make your dreams reality. I'm just glad to be here. You have a future when you're here ... I'm just glad there's a country that represents these principles that I grew up in."" Making matters even better for the 23-year-old, Kouandjio has a chance to see extended playing time in Buffalo's game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. Offensive coordinator Anthony Lynn said that the Bills may utilize a three-man rotation at right tackle, which would include Kouandjio, Seantrel Henderson and Jordan Mills.  ""Winning this game would be a perfect ending to the week,"" Kouandjio said. ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Tim Kaine says he'll seek re-election in 2018 but is ruling out a presidential bid in 2020. The former Democratic vice presidential nominee said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday that his place is in the Senate and his decision not to run in 2020 is final.  ""Period. Full stop,"" Kaine said. With a heightened national profile after campaigning across the country for more than three months as Hillary Clinton's running mate, Kaine could have chosen to pursue his own White House ambitions or tried and play a leading role charting a reeling Democratic Party's direction in the Donald Trump era. But the first-term senator and former governor said he belongs in the upper chamber, where he will be part of a Democratic minority whose ability to filibuster will be ""the only emergency brake there is"" on Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. Kaine has already been a vocal critic of Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon as a senior advisor. Kaine said Bannon's ties to white nationalism and anti-Semitism disqualify him from a senior role in the White House. Kaine said he would continue to guard against the ""normalization"" by Trump of what Kaine said were un-American values, but he added that he's keeping an open mind about the billionaire businessman's presidency.  ""I have a lot of concerns, but I don't think it's fair to the administration to just assume everything that was said during the campaign will be done,"" Kaine said, noting that Trump had already shown some post-Election Day flexibility on issues like gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act. Kaine said there were some issues Democrats could work with Trump on, including increased infrastructure spending and raising the tax rate on carried interest, which is often used by managers for private equity firms and hedge funds to reduce tax payments. Kaine said he plans to use his higher national profile to continue to advocate for issues he's long cared about, notably on increasing Congress' role in war-making powers.  ""I've been willing to stand up and do that with a president of my own party and I tell you, I'm sure going to be willing to stand up to President Trump,"" Kaine said. Kaine has twice come close to being vice president. He was on President Barack Obama's shortlist in 2008 and many expected Clinton to win this year. On the campaign trail this year, the deeply spiritual Kaine often told supporters that the election would work out the way things are supposed to. Kaine said Clinton's loss was ""hard"" to take but didn't shake his faith that the outcome was for a reason, even if not immediately obvious.  ""Maybe the whole reason I'm in the Senate was less being in the Senate when there was President Obama, who was a friend of mine. Maybe the reason I'm in the Senate is for the next four years,"" Kaine said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Education Department data show average earnings of those with certificates from public schools were nearly $9,000 higher than those with for-profit certificate programs. The report also found nearly a third of for-profit students graduated from programs with median earnings below the federal minimum wage, which now stands at $7.25 an hour. That's compared with only 14 percent in the public sector.  ""College is the best investment a person can make in their long-term future,"" Education Secretary John B. King Jr. said as the report was released. The earnings information ""is an important thing for students to pay attention to as they decide what programs to pursue and where to pursue them."" About 1.3 million students are enrolled in career college programs in a variety of fields from nursing, welding, and culinary arts to certificate programs for auto mechanics, pharmacy technicians and dental assistants. Community colleges in particular, the report said, offered programs that outperformed similar programs at for-profit schools. The report said certificate programs at public undergraduate schools usually had more students enrolled in high-earning fields, such as nursing. Graduates of those public programs also tended to have higher incomes than grads in the same fields of study at for-profits. That was true for most of the 14 fields of study examined. A few, including culinary arts and cosmetology, had better average earnings at for-profit schools. The report didn't address why that is. The report looked at career programs at about 3,700 public and for-profit schools that are covered by the ""gainful employment"" regulations that went into effect last year soon after the troubled for-profit giant Corinthian Colleges filed for bankruptcy protection. The rules require career training programs to show that students can earn enough money after graduation to pay off their student loans. They're aimed at shutting down programs that make phony promises to prospective students, push them to take out government-backed loans, and then leave them with mountains of debt and sometimes worthless degrees.  ""For far too long, some career colleges have made dubious promises about the employment prospects of their graduates, promising high salaries that rarely live up to the hype,"" said Undersecretary of Education Ted Mitchell. ""The earnings data released today shine a light on how graduates are actually faring when they enter the job market."" The data reflect 2014 earnings data for students who graduated between 2008 and 2012, depending on the size and type of their program. Average annual earnings over the 14 fields of study ranged from $33,835 for nursing at the top of the list, followed by welding at $29,587, down to cosmetology at the bottom of the list with mean earnings of $14,130 per year. In January, the department plans to release student debt-to-earnings data for college career programs. If the programs don't meet the new ""gainful employment"" requirements and fail to improve, they will lose eligibility for federal student aid. More than 80 percent of students at for-profits borrow federal student loans to pay for college, compared to fewer than half of students at public schools who do the same.

Nov. 10, 2016  President Obama talks with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        Now that the tears of joy and grief have dried, the reality of Donald Trump's electoral college win is sinking in. For the disbelievers, his victory must be true because there he was Thursday, meeting in the Oval Office with Barack Obama, whose presidency Trump tried mightily to emasculate with his racist birther crusade. But now, Trump says he has ""great respect"" for the president. Obama didn't return that compliment, but he does have respect for the peaceful transfer of power, even to someone he accurately recognizes is ""uniquely unqualified to be president; is temperamentally unfit to be commander-in-chief."" This transition is all the more important because Trump is so unprepared for the White House. With no governmental experience, his learning curve will be steeper than other presidents-elect. Plenty of assistance, starting with a gracious Obama, is available. He set a tone that many still reeling from election night will find difficult to accept. ""My number-one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our president-elect is successful,"" Obama said as the two met with reporters, a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. over Trump's right shoulder.      Speaking from the Oval Office, Nov. 10, President Obama said he was ""very encouraged"" following a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Trump said the meeting lasted longer than expected and easily could have gone longer. (The Washington Post)   To get a sense of what Trump should do to fill his deficits, the Federal Insider asked transition experts to suggest a to-do list for him. For an in-depth list of things to do, Trump can consult a wealth of materials published by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Max Stier is president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, which created a Center for Presidential Transition. There are three main items on the center's list:  Prioritize key appointments: Get started on the 4,000 political appointees, especially the 1,100 requiring Senate confirmation. ""President-elect Trump should have his White House staff and top 100 agency leaders in place immediately after Inauguration Day.""   Prepare to turn campaign promises into policy: ""The transition team should build out the new administration's policy agenda and develop a management strategy for implementing those priorities.""   Learn from career federal employees: Go beyond the rhetoric and recognize that the federal workforce ""has many great and committed people,"" as a Trump campaign statement said, is Stier's advice. Trump should view federal employees, ""the real engine of the government,"" as ""your most important asset,"" he added by phone. But Trump would subject agencies to a poorly considered federal hiring freeze, his first 100-day ""Contract With the American Voter"" promises. ""Job No. 1 is to bring in a qualified and effective team quickly,"" Stier said. The transition ""begins with people.""  The center's 208-page Presidential Transition Guide should be required reading for Trump and his team. Its chapters cover everything from the ""fundamentals of getting organized"" to ""transition planning for the first family."" The Partnership for Public Service also offers ""seven smart strategies"" for the new administration, including creating ""cross-agency teams required to make the promises real"" and improving employee engagement. Dan Blair, president and CEO of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) and a former acting Office of Personnel Management director, said Trump should ""turn from a campaign mindset to a governing mindset.  Begin the process of building coalitions needed to establish a working majority for the president-elect's agenda. This includes inviting leaders of the opposition party on the Hill to sit down privately with the President-elect."" With Obama's commitment to working with Trump and a law now facilitating the transition process, ""the President-elect will find a much more Transition-prepared government than ever before,"" Blair said by email. ""This allows the act of governing, once the President-elect takes the Oath, to be potentially seamless, or at least avoid the mistakes of past Transitions."" NAPA's Transition 2016 initiative includes a report that, among other things, covers recruiting highly talented political appointees, a critical area especially for a president-elect who is a government rookie. Another transition resource worth consulting is the human resources guide published by the Office of Personnel Management. It covers many in-the-weeds workplace topics that Trump probably won't want to read, but somebody on his team should. The GAO's transition resources include a new smartphone app for easy access to many recommendations. The app and a website reflect GAO's in-depth work in a variety of areas and provide information on key issues, high-risk problems and a proposed management agenda. Obama promised Trump that the administration will do ""everything we can to help you succeed -- because if you succeed, then the country succeeds."" If Trump succeeds at killing the Affordable Care Act, banning Muslims and overturning the president's executive orders, Obama might rethink that last line.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) delivered an emotional speech to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations on Nov. 10, promising to fight against a Republican-controlled Congress. (AFL-CIO)   President-elect Donald Trump had barely touched down in Washington on Thursday when two of Democrats' progressive stars positioned themselves to be Lecturer-in-Chief on why the party crashed and burned Tuesday. In an interview with the Associated Press published Thursday, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said the party's failure to reach out to white working-class voters was ""an embarrassment."" He critiqued the party for not having ""the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class,"" and then he didn't rule out a 2020 run. ""Four years is a long time from now,"" he said. ""We'll take one thing at a time, but I'm not ruling out anything."" At pretty much the exact same time that the AP article was published, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was across town giving a fiery postmortem election speech to labor leaders. Warren gave Trump credit for resonating with working-class families ""deeply frustrated about an economy and a government that doesn't work for them."" And she added: ""The truth is that people are right to be angry. ... He spoke to the very real sense of millions of Americans that their government and their economy has abandoned them."" (The implication being that Democrats didn't successfully do that.) It's not a coincidence that Sanders and Warren reactivated their populist megaphones on the same day that America's new president-elect toured Washington. Democrats are a body without a head right now. Sanders and Warren are two of Democrats' most high-profile figures left standing, and they know it. There's never been a better moment for either of them to try to fill the political vacuum with their left-wing, populist, ideological message. ""People are angry, they have a right to be angry,"" Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday. ""But we have to channel that anger against the people who caused the decline of the middle class, and so many people living in poverty, not take it out on our neighbors who happen to be Muslim or Latino or women."" Both Sanders and Warren proved during the campaign that when they flex their political muscle, the party listens. They each succeeded in their own way of pushing Hillary Clinton to the left -- Sanders by running against her, Warren by not endorsing her during the primary season. And so the Democratic platform in 2016 was the most liberal in years. But from Sanders and Warren's perspective, that wasn't the reason the party fell short -- the problem was, it didn't move even further to the left. And both of them have prescriptions for how to make that happen. (Apparently, so does former Vermont governor and 2004 presidential candidate Howard Dean, who's thrown his hat in for chair of the Democratic Party.)   The dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again. -- Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) November 10, 2016   It's also not a coincidence that both Warren's and Sanders's postelection analysis focused heavily on the white working class, a segment of America that a growing number of Democrats think abandoned them. Exit polls suggest they might be right. The Fix's Philip Bump points out that Trump got more support from white men without a college degree than Mitt Romney did in 2012.    (Philip Bump / The Washington Post)  And the leaders of the labor movement whom Warren spoke to? Bump found that union households went for Trump in numbers not seen since the Reagan era.    (Philip Bump / The Washington Post)  ""There are many millions of people who did not vote for Donald Trump because of the bigotry and hate that fueled his campaign rallies,"" Warren told the executive council of the AFL-CIO. ""They voted for him despite the hate. They voted for him out of frustration and anger and also out of hope that he would bring change."" Their case having been made about where the party went wrong, both Warren and Sanders have moved to set themselves up as chief antagonist to Trump. (A position that would also serve as a prime 2020 launchpad.) Warren promised in her speech to fight ""bigotry. ... In all its forms, we will fight back against attacks on Latinos, African Americans, women, Muslims, immigrants, disabled Americans -- on anyone."" Sanders tweeted this:   If Donald Trump takes people's anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare. -- Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) November 10, 2016   When you boil it down, Sanders and Warren are really saying the same thing: Democrats lost because they failed to communicate a populist message that resonated with the white working class. The only question is who gets to spend the next four years as the loudest voice."

Both candidates in the presidential runoff are economists in their 40s, but the similarities end there. Here's a look at them and the issues: WHERE IN THE WORLD? Moldova is a landlocked, agricultural nation of 3.5 million, bordering Ukraine and European Union member Romania. In politics, there's widespread public anger over high-level official corruption in one of Europe's poorest states -- particularly about $1 billion that was looted from Moldovan banks just before the 2014 election. More than 30 mainly junior officials are being investigated over the heist but many say the probe is too slow and hasn't targeted senior figures. ___ WHICH WAY TO GO? Igor Dodon, the favorite in the presidential race, wants the ex-Soviet republic to return to the Russian orbit, while rival Maia Sandu believes the country would secure a more prosperous, predictable future in Europe. ___ WHAT IS DODON'S PLAN? Dodon is trying to channel Donald Trump's U.S. victory into Moldova's runoff. The 41-year-old who paints himself as a traditional family man is harnessing anger with the pro-European government that has been in office since 2009. Socialist Dodon plans to cozy up to Russia, which has punished Moldova with a trade ban on Moldovan wine, fruit and vegetables for signing an association agreement with the EU. Dodon says Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, is Russian territory, a comment that didn't go down well in Ukraine. But he's hedged his bets recently, saying he also seeks good relations with the EU and Ukraine. Dodon is backed by the pro-Moscow branch of the Moldovan Orthodox Church. Despite Trump's three marriages and two divorces, Dodon calls Trump ""a supporter of Christian values."" ___ WHAT DOES SANDU WANT? Ex-World Bank economist Sandu is running on an anti-corruption ticket, which resonates with many after $1 billion bank heist. Supported by young voters and Moldovans working in Western Europe, Sandu, 44, has been criticized by an Orthodox cleric for being unmarried and childless. Sandu is known for her uncompromising approach to corruption, which cost her the nomination to be prime minister in July 2015. She was education minister from 2012 to 2015, winning praise for reforms, such as updating textbooks and introducing cameras into exam rooms to stamp out rampant cheating. Sandu says a crackdown on graft will lead to improved living standards, decent wages and pensions above subsistence level. ___ HIGH TURNOUT HELPS WHO? Sandu's best chance of a victory is a high voter turnout. Some 800,000 Moldovans work abroad and send remittances back home. They can vote if they go to their local embassies or other special voting stations. ___ WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT DO? The Moldovan president represents the country abroad, sets foreign policy and appoints judges, but needs parliamentary approval for major decisions. The change in the way the president is being elected, however, is expected to bring the post more authority. ___ Alison Mutler in Bucharest, Romania contributed to this report.

Binali Yildirim's comments on Friday came a day after he discussed with Devlet Bahceli, leader of the Nationalist Movement Party, or MHP, plans for a presidential system that would give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's largely ceremonial presidency executive powers. Until now opposition parties had opposed a presidential system, saying that would allow Erdogan to rule unchecked. But Bahceli said on Twitter late Thursday that Yildirim's proposals were ""positive and reasonable."" Yildirim said: ""God willing with the MHP we will change the constitution and accomplish a presidential system."" Party officials have said parliament could debate reforms early next year and hold a referendum on the issue in April. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Wilcox told the Chicago Tribune that it began Wednesday about 1 p.m. at the corner of Kedzie Avenue and Roosevelt Road, when a black sedan scraped along the side of his Pontiac Bonneville, scratching it. ""I stopped and parked. And I asked if they had insurance, and the next thing that I knew they were beating the s-- out of me,"" Wilcox told the paper. In the video, several men and women threw him to the concrete and kicked him repeatedly, sometimes in the face. The laughing group threw haymakers at the Wilcox's head, as he desperately tried to crawl and limp back to his Bonneville. The door hung open until one of the young men climbed into the driver's seat and slammed the door. A subsequent video obtained by the Tribune showed Wilcox grabbing onto the open back window of the car, as the young man drove off. Wilcox hung from the window, his feet dragging along the concrete as the Bonneville picked up speed. ""The guy took off. He was doing 70 or 80 down Roosevelt, swerving. He was trying to have me fall off, and I knew if I somehow let go, I was going to die,"" Wilcox told the paper. ""Then he slowed down. I was looking at oncoming traffic. He probably slowed to about 45. God was watching over for me. I rolled about five or seven times into the oncoming traffic lanes."" Wilcox said he did vote for Donald Trump, but that no one would know this just by looking at his car. He said of Trump, ""He's gonna bring back the economy. I believe he's gonna be the one to protect the [nation]. I know he doesn't speak politically correct sometimes, but 95 percent of the country doesn't."" He claimed someone at a nearby bus stop yelled, ""Yeah, it's one of them white boy Trump guys,"" during the attack. Alderman Michael Scott Jr. told DNA Info the scene was ""very disturbing."" ""It is very disturbing to see any act of violence, especially an act of violence [that may have been based] on a man's political preference or views,"" Scott said. ""This is something I and the people of North Lawndale will not tolerate."" ""Regardless of who said those statements, the department is taking this very seriously, and that type of divisive rhetoric is not acceptable,"" Anthony Guglielmi, chief police spokesman, told the Tribune. In a Facebook post that was liked more than 1,500 times, the Rev. Michael Pfleger of St. Sabina on Chicago's South Side wrote: A video was posted this morning showing a man being pulled from his car and beaten by a group of teens at Roosevelt and Kedzie . . . while shouting YOU VOTED FOR TRUMP......This is Unacceptable and must be condemned by Everybody.....VIOLENCE is NEVER an acceptable response! . . . Emotions are raw coming out of this election but frustration, anger and despair do not give permission to be violent........Let us not surrender to evil, rather rise above it!!!!! According to the Associated Press, no one was in custody for the assault or the grand theft auto on Thursday afternoon. Police are investigating. ""What's happening to America?"" Wilcox asked in a recorded interview with the Tribune. ""You're supposed to be able to vote in peace. It's supposed to be part of our democracy, and what happened is I vote for somebody, and I get beaten, robbed, and my car stolen, and I have no way of getting my wife to and from work safe anymore.""

Henry Rollins is here to raise it.	"More than three decades after he moved to Los Angeles to join the hardcore band Black Flag, Washington remains a special city to Henry Rollins.  The 55-year-old punk icon keeps plenty busy: Although he no longer plays music, Rollins writes a column for LA Weekly, hosts a weekly radio show on KCRW, and continues to act and lend his voice to animated shows such as Cartoon Network's ""Adventure Time."" But he makes time to return to the District at least twice a year. That's when Rollins, who grew up in Glover Park, takes long walks and visits old friends and familiar haunts. ""I love Washington -- it's my favorite city. It's the most beautiful city I've ever been to,"" Rollins said last week. ""I just love the trees, and the smell of the air. ... It still smells the same, when you walk from Calvert to Wisconsin."" His latest tour has taken him all over the world. But it lands back home in Washington for a show at the Lincoln Theatre on election night, after polls on the East Coast have closed. The Post asked Rollins about the long presidential election cycle, his relationship with his audience, and his home town. This Q&A has been lightly edited for clarity and length.    Henry Rollins, who'll perform at the Lincoln Theatre on Nov. 8: ""Looking at this election, it's been depressing."" (2011 photo by Kyle Gustafson for The Washington Post)  Did you choose Washington on Election Day intentionally? Yeah. I thought it would interesting to be with what few people show up so they can all distractedly look at their cellphones throughout the show, and we can all walk into this next administration together. I was curious about that: Are you going to be encouraging checking results throughout? I don't think I can stop them, and, you know, I'm not a politeness monitor. So I'm going to say, look, you're going to do it, I'm going to stand up here and talk. And so let's just all agree to get along. I read earlier this year that you had come out in support of Bernie Sanders. How are you approaching the election now? I liked his ideas about campaign finance reform and putting the knuckles into Wall Street, and I like his ideas on education. I just knew that it would be a hard to impossible sell to the American people. When you say ""socialism,"" there's a lot of people, they just pull back from that word without hearing someone out. What I think Mr. Sanders was offering Americans was a cold water flat with a five-floor stair hike to get up to. When you're 19, and you have that great summer when you're living with all your friends in that crazy house where nothing works, and it was awesome, but by September, it sucks and you want some central heating and some convenience. What Bernie Sanders was offering was a little too spartan and a little bit too changeful for him to be able to edge out a hardcore political operative like Hillary Clinton. And so, looking at this election, it's been depressing. And usually I look at these elections with a great deal of scrutiny and interest. This time around, Donald Trump, and the things he says, and the lowering of the bar of conversation. The debates were appalling, just pathetic. Because you might not be the biggest fan of Hillary Clinton, but she really does know the issues. She wanted to have a debate on the issues, but there was one person on that stage who didn't, who did everything he could do to avoid it. It was pretty damn obvious. And when I see that, I'm not exactly out; I'm not out of here. I'm going to vote. But I'm kind of done with American democracy the way we're doing it now. We had eight years of a guy who was elected twice by a solid majority, and America had eight years to support Barrack Obama and the things he wanted to do, and I think a lot of Americans congratulated themselves when he became president and they went back to the hammock. ""Well, we elected a black guy."" And they thought the work was over, when the work had just begun. So this whole thing has turned into a political ""WWE Smackdown,"" because of Donald Trump. It's been such a turnoff. Election Day for me will be like putting the bullet in the dog's head after it's been hit by the car, to put it out of its misery. So with your shows in the last year and a half, has politics figured more into what you're talking about? A little, but I realize who I'm talking to. With my audience, I'm talking to adults. I'm not trying to sway them. The Bernie Sanders people reached out to me multiple times to get on stage with Bernie and do all this stuff with Bernie. The Sanders people were on me like a cheap suit, like, ""Hey, we dig you, and you dig Bernie, so ..."" And I'm like, nope. Because I vote. Young people write me, and ask who they should vote for. And I'm like, ""Son, I don't tell anyone who to vote for. I just hope you vote."" And I don't think Trump jokes are funny. If anything, I like to poke a little fun at Hillary Clinton as she tries to not act like a freaking replicant from ""Blade Runner 2"" when she speaks. I find her amazingly robotic, and I could never connect with her, although I think she's a good person. But I've been leaving the politics out, [except to say] this country is yours, and it's never been more yours than right now. And the individual being extraordinary, now is the time. Because the government is not around. You are truly on your own, which is not the end of the world -- it's the beginning of something. It seems like you have a wide base of fans, people of all stripes. Have any of them taken offense to anything you've said this year? The reason I ask, is because you see confrontations at rallies, and then there was the Amy Schumer incident in Florida, where she made remarks about Donald Trump; fans booed and walked out. That was interesting to me, because if I had 200 people walk out of my gig, that would be about two-thirds of the audience, so I'd be kinda screwed. So I'm amazed that she does shows where they need a huge screen next to her, she does places so big. That'll never happen to me. I'm okay with that. I'm never going to be in front of 16,000 people with what I have to say. But during the Bush Administration and during the Iraq War, about every 10 shows, someone would stand up and let loose some vitriolic sailor-speak stream and go storming out. But no, because basically, I preach to the perverted, people who agree with me. You're not going to pay $35 [to see me] if you love Donald Trump because you're probably not going to get what you want, because I speak in full sentences and use a lot of polysyllabic words. It might befuddle you. Also -- and this is my contention -- I don't say anything controversial. I'm not trying to shock anyone. I don't advocate for the shooting of cops. Or murder. Or anarchic overthrow of government. I'm not into any of that. Did you see this coming? Were you able to predict this polarization, the vitriol -- the movement, for lack of a better word? Yeah, I did. And I'm not Nostradamus, I think it was pretty obvious. Anyone who pays attention to the news and who cares, saw this coming.    Henry Rollins on Hillary Clinton: ""I'm not her biggest fan, but I think she'll be a very steady and very status quo president, and I think she has good intentions."" (Heidi May)  The reason I ask: A lot of people put themselves in a bubble, but you're around the country, on the air, talking to people. You're around the world. An interesting way to assess America is to leave it and look at it from 5,000 miles away. What I saw in the first four years of the Bush administration, the country was already somewhat polarized, people were drawing lines in the sand. By the time second four years started, people are drawing lines in the concrete. And then you get a black president ... that's when I started noticing, like, wow, we've got a lot of racists in this country. ... You've got a lot of angry Americans, and they weren't served well by their education system. When I saw Donald Trump talking during the [2012] election, people really liked him, and I watched him on CNN -- because I was on tour, on this damn bus -- and people go, ""I like Donald Trump!"" [Note: Rollins is using an accent here.] And I'm like, I bet you do. Because he sells it very well, he sells that anger and turns it around. What you have now is a very wounded, very angry America, where if you wave a white flag to negotiate in the middle, I don't think people -- Congress being an example -- I don't think people even want to show up for that. Like, how come it's been so many months and we don't have a ninth supreme court judge? We have become so polarized that you can't have an NPR-type rational conversation that lasts longer than eight seconds without someone barging in and saying ""shut up,"" or ""you're nasty"" or ""you're a communist."" The art of negotiation is over. ... and I don't know how that gets better. Because there's only one thing American excels at better than racism, and that's misogyny. We kick ass in misogyny. And people love to hate Hillary Clinton -- like, in the womb, people hated Hillary Clinton. When you come to D.C., is this still home for you? It's not coming home, in that I have that idea of it. My home has been vans, hotels, tour buses, hydrofoils, trains, camel, whatever, for many years. I love Washington -- it's my favorite city. It's the most beautiful city I've ever been to. I just love the trees, and the smell of the air. So when I come back, the idea of home is the faces of the people I grew up with who I still visit. I'm best friends with Ian MacKaye, and his amazing family, and some of the MacKayes have kids now, so I hang out with the kids, and they're amazing. And so what I enjoy about Washington is the familiarity, the kind of inner joy I get from walking on familiar streets. And just how it still smells the same, when you walk from Calvert to Wisconsin, which was kind of my old nexus when I was growing up in Glover Park, and how much joy I get just walking down to Wisconsin and Hall, where the Starbucks is, getting a cup of coffee and sitting and looking at my old street that I used to bike down, skateboard down and then take my car down. And that familiarity, at 55 years of age, it resonates. I've gone through a lot and seen a lot, but to look at those sidewalks and go, wow, that's the sidewalk I walked up to go to the train station to audition to be in Black Flag, which is kind of the reason I'm on the road today, because I got in that band. But to still walk up and down that sidewalk once or twice a year is relevant to me. And not in a way that I wish I was 20 again, I'm very happy at my age. But that is a sense of home. Are there still restaurants or places you like to visit? Oh hell yeah! My last straight job I ever had was at a Haagen-Dazs, which is now the Avocado Cafe at Wisconsin and O streets, across from the CVS. The owner knows me and he's very kind to me, because he knows I used to work there. He used to have a photo of me on the wall, but someone jumped over the counter, grabbed it and ran out. Henry Rollins's ""Election Night Spoken Word"" show is Tuesday, Nov. 8 at 8 p.m. at the Lincoln Theatre, 1215 U St. NW. thelincolndc.com. Tickets are $40."

"    On Nov. 3 in El Paso, Leonardo Wong, 71, voted for the first time in his life. (David Weigel/The Washington Post)   EL PASO -- On Wednesday, shortly after El Paso County broke its record for early voting, Andres Villalobos walked into the downtown courthouse and cast a ballot for ""Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats."" He was 65 years old and had earned American citizenship after years of crossing back and forth across the Mexican border, a few blocks away. But he had never voted before. Nothing had compelled him to vote until Donald Trump ran for president. If Trump won the presidency, he predicted the absolute worst. ""Maybe chaos,"" he said. ""It would be ugly -- very, very bad for the economy, for the city, for everyone. It would be bad for the border. It wouldn't work."" Leonardo Wong, 71, was also casting his first vote. He had registered while renewing the passport that let him walk back and forth across the border, and he had gotten behind Hillary Clinton. ""I don't think everybody's a rapist and everybody's a narco like Trump says,"" Wong said, referring to Trump's claims that many Mexicans crossing into the United States are violent criminals. Texas is expected to go Republican this year, as it has in every presidential election since 1980. At Trump's lowest point, when he was buried by his own gaffes and debate performances, the state closed to single digits in polling; the latest polls have him leading by closer to 10 points.  [As race tightens, Clinton campaign is counting on minority support]  But Democrats have watched a turnout surge wash over the state's most urban, least white areas. In 10 days of early voting, more than 115,000 ballots were cast in El Paso County, blowing past the record set in 2008. Turnout was up by 64 percent over 2012; it was up by close to 40 percent around Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio.      As the presidential race tightens, Democrats are going after voters in the Republican stronghold of Georgia. In Gwinnett County, a rising number of minorities could be changing the political landscape. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)   Turnout has also grown in the deep red suburbs, but in El Paso, Democrats are no longer struggling to get their voters to the polls. According to We(Fillintheblank), a student-run political group that conducts the area's only exit polling, Clinton is on track to win 71 percent of the vote in El Paso, better than any Democrat since the Texas Republican Party became competitive. The Trump candidacy has challenged a Republican project that had succeeded in Texas more than in any state -- a coalition between conservative whites and culturally conservative Latino voters. Republicans, who have controlled every statewide office here since 1998, have won supermajorities of white voters and courted enough Latino votes to make the Democratic Party irrelevant.  [Early voting by Latinos may help Clinton in several states]  It was supposed to show Republicans the way to a one-party future. In 1998, during a reelection campaign designed to prove his appeal to voters beyond Texas, then-Gov. George W. Bush campaigned hard in the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso. ""I want it to be known that a conservative candidate can carry the Hispanic vote,"" he told reporters. He did so, and won El Paso, a feat he did not repeat in his campaigns for president. In Bush's wake, even as the national party abandoned immigration reform, Democrats struggled to activate Latinos in Texas the way that they had in California, or Arizona, or the Midwestern states where there were more recent immigrants. The struggle won national attention -- the bad kind -- in 2014. Battleground Texas, a political action committee created by Obama-campaign veterans, was launched on the theory that early spending and organizing could activate a slumbering nonwhite vote. ""Texas isn't as red of a state as people say it is, if you look at the numbers,"" senior adviser Jeremy Bird said at the launch event. The numbers did not change. Republican Greg Abbott, elected governor in a landslide two years ago, out-campaigned Democrat Wendy Davis with Latinos. Ads in the Rio Grande Valley played up Abbott's marriage to a Mexican American. Turnout in El Paso fell by more than half of its 2012 total, allowing now-Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.) to flip a House seat that Democrats had considered safe. Then came Trump. Some Texas Republicans had been edging toward his rhetoric, away from the Bush approach. Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor elected in 2014, did not sound different from Trump on the border, or when he crusaded against college tuition for undocumented immigrants in Texas. But voter awareness of Patrick was minimal; Trump blotted out the sun. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), who in 2012 defeated an incumbent who had relied on the teetering Democratic machine, had never encountered a line for early voting. The line was 45 minutes long this year.    Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.) at the Kentucky Club in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on Nov. 4. (David Weigel/The Washington Post)  ""There wasn't even a whole lot that someone like me needed to do to encourage that,"" O'Rourke said. ""Finally, there was a very clear reason to vote."" In the summer, El Paso County Judge Veronica Escobar began to notice that people who crowded into the semiannual citizenship ceremonies dashed across the courthouse to get registered to vote. ""I think everyone understands how closely tied we are to Mexico,"" Escobar said, sitting in her office near one of the voting sites. ""We lived through the devaluation of the peso, and when it happened, our economy was devastated. Insulting our most important economic partner and wanting to isolate it from us -- most people here realize there'd be an economic price, and we would pay it."" The border described by Trump simply did not resemble the one many El Pasoans see. The Republican nominee was not wrong about the drug wars in Ciudad Juarez or the smugglers constantly changing their tactics to get opium and meth into the United States. But El Paso is growing. Unemployment is sinking. Thanks in large part to a policing buildup on the border, someone in Dallas or Houston was twice as likely to be a victim of violent crime. What was Trump talking about? ""He's an embarrassment,"" said Ana Morales, 31, a victims advocate who works with noncitizens and frets about how a Trump presidency would affect them. ""I think he would put up a lot of barriers. There are very vulnerable people who would be hurt by him."" Said Edna Ortega, 42: ""It would be like East Berlin. He would bring in an authoritarian type of government -- very racist.""    Judge Veronica Escobar in her office in El Paso on Nov. 4. (David Weigel/The Washington Post)  Republicans, who do not need El Paso to win the state, said that Trump's impact would be overrated. On Thursday, the local Republican Party headquarters was quiet but active. One volunteer made calls, near signs that advertised the summer social-media campaign to bring Trump to El Paso. (He never came.) Adolpho Telles, the county chairman, insisted that plenty of Democrats were quietly telling him that they would buck the tide and vote for Trump. ""People don't necessarily like the fence idea, the wall idea, whatever you want to call it,"" he said. ""But when the cameras are off, they will tell you: They don't believe in illegal immigration. They do believe in securing the border."" In dozens of interviews at the polls, Trump supporters were happy to talk. None said that they were voting Republican because of Trump's immigration policy. Mike and Destiny Tipton, 32 and 34, said Clinton's record at the State Department put them off. ""These email things never seem to go away,"" said Mike Tipton, referring to a later-retracted Fox News report that Clinton risked indictment. ""I'm disappointed with her over the whole Benghazi thing,"" Destiny Tipton said. Those sentiments were usually outweighed by genuine terror of Trump -- and often admiration for Clinton. Some voters who spoke only Spanish talked about a hypothetical Trump presidency the way that tea party conservatives once discussed President Obama's reelection -- a world-shattering event, the end of America as they knew it. At a polling station inside the Bassett Place mall, the Thursday lunch hour found a steady stream of voters entering, filling out their ballots quickly and exiting to explain why they had voted for Clinton. Frank Noriega, 72, accompanied his wife as she voted for Clinton, then stayed behind to finish some errands. He had long ago decided to oppose Trump. The mystery, to him, was why more people didn't seem to trust Clinton. ""She's out there with regular public. She talks to them,"" he said. ""For all the stuff that's come out, they've never proven she did anything wrong. If they had the proof, she couldn't be running.""  Ed O'Keefe in Washington contributed to this report.   "
