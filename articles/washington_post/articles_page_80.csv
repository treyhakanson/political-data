The figures released Wednesday by the Obama administration represent steady sign-ups but no enrollment surge so far. Still, officials said they have seen an outpouring from consumers wanting to make sure the government knows how important the endangered program has become in their lives.  ""Health insurance is linked to independence and economic freedom,"" said Andy Slavitt, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the nation's major coverage programs. Overall, the new number is fairly comparable to early sign-ups last year, but the share of new customers is down. They accounted for 24 percent of the total so far this year, compared with 34 percent in the first two weeks of last year's open enrollment season. Nearly 1.1 million people had enrolled last year by about the same time. The 2017 early sign-up figures are for Nov. 1-12, while the closest numbers from last year cover a full two weeks, which may explain some of the shortfall. The administration said 53,000 more customers signed up in the first 12 days this year than in the same period last year. Still, several other statistics were also down, including call center volume, the number of HealthCare.gov users, and consumers window-shopping on the website. Slavitt said the numbers are line with his expectations, and he noted that outreach to consumers didn't start until after Election Day. The White House is hoping that robust numbers will translate into a strong closing argument for keeping many of the law's essential parts. Even before the election that put Republicans in charge, the health care law was facing stiff headwinds in 2017. The remaining uninsured are harder to reach and persuade. Premiums for a standard plan are going up an average of 25 percent in the 39 states served by HealthCare.gov, and insurer exits have left about one-third of U.S. counties with only one carrier. President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress are pledging to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, although it has reduced the nation's uninsured rate to a historic low of about 9 percent. It's shaping up as the most volatile open enrollment season since HealthCare.gov went live in 2013 and the computer system didn't work. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell has set a goal of signing up 13.8 million people through the federal HealthCare.gov and state-run insurance markets, which offer taxpayer-subsidized private coverage to people without access to health care through their jobs. That would be an increase of about 1 million from the last open enrollment, so attracting new people is crucial. Even though premiums are going up significantly, administration officials say most people will be cushioned from the impact because they receive subsidies designed to rise as their insurance costs increase. But an estimated 5 million to 9 million people who buy individual policies outside the law's markets face the full brunt of increases. During the campaign, Trump said the health overhaul was a ""disaster,"" but now he is signaling that he doesn't want to take away coverage from the millions of people who have benefited. Independent studies estimated that Trump's campaign plan would have caused 18 million to 20 million people to lose health insurance. Republicans in Congress are puzzling over how to follow through on their promise to repeal the health care law while at the same time maintaining popular provisions, including protections for people with medical problems and allowing young adults to stay on parental coverage until age 26. Stripping away coverage could trigger a political backlash. Open enrollment season for 2017 ends Jan. 31, but consumers who want their coverage to take effect at the start of the year have to act by Dec. 15. That's traditionally the biggest day for HealthCare.gov. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Here's what you might not already know about her. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)    We might as well start with Ivanka, as we plumb the present and future of Trumpism, the Trump Cabinet, the Trump family, the Trump brand. Because -- Ivanka. The most personable, palatable, fashionable, Trump-lite member of the future first family. The most inscrutable, yet most weirdly relatable. Some people think she'll be the real first lady, with her telegenic personality and her copacetic pet causes, and her lifestyle website, already dedicated to being a gracious host and professional woman.  Last week, her father formally named her to his transition team; early this week, rumors swirled -- which Donald Trump later denied -- that the president-elect had requested top-secret security clearance for Ivanka and her brothers. On Monday evening, CNN's Dana Bash went on air and read out loud an incredulous text message from a friend: ""What clandestine operation is Ivanka going to run?""  All the operations, Dana. We can't shake the feeling that Ivanka is the key to this all.  What is going on here? is a question everyone is asking about everything happening at every moment in Washington right now, and possibly until the end of time. On Tuesday, major news outlets reported that the transition team was a mess; on Wednesday, Donald Trump tweeted that the transition ""is going so smoothly,"" and we are reduced to scouring Ivanka Trump's Instagram feed to figure out the future of the country. Here is a video of Ivanka's daughter singing a song about pineapples, posted at the same time that a former national security official warned the world to ""stay away"" from the ""arrogant, screaming"" transition team.  Here is Ivanka, 35, in a Snapchat-filtered floral headdress. Here is a current article on her pastel, aspirational lifestyle website, headlined ""5 tips for mixing work and family."" (Family dinner agenda: appoint new attorney general; secretary of state?)  Ivanka sat for a ""60 Minutes"" interview with the rest of her family this week and folded her hands primly across her lap, one wrist bedecked with a heavy gold bracelet. ""I'm going to be a daughter,"" she said firmly when Lesley Stahl asked whether she would be seeking a job in the Trump administration.     ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl, left, interviews President-elect Donald Trump and his family at his home: wife Melania, daughter Ivanka, seated right, daughter Tiffany, seated second row from left, and sons Donald Jr. and Eric. (Chris Albert/AP)   The next morning, a sales representative from her jewelry line sent out a notice to journalists that the aforementioned gold bangle was Ivanka's ""favorite."" It could be purchased for $10,800 through the Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry website. Daughter-slash-businesswoman? Businesswoman-slash-presidential adviser?  What does it all mean, Ivanka? Journalists debated whether the bracelet event was an outright conflict of interest or a slightly murky but also savvy move. The mystery of Ivanka is that she always does seem to be running some kind of clandestine mission -- blowing some kind of dog whistle or bleating some kind of Morse code, or becoming the attractive vessel into which both parties poured their own hopes and dreams. ""Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat,"" she said while introducing her father at the Republican National Convention in July. ""More than party affiliation, I vote based on what I believe is right, for my family and for my country.      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka said her father is a ""fighter"" will fight for America. (The Washington Post)    Could Ivanka be reasoned with? wondered the commenters who viewed her father as too unpredictable and were seeking reassurance. Was Ivanka the one secretly running the whole show?  When there are no answers, it's easier to ask questions and adapt wild conspiracy theories as the answers.  ""Are Ivanka and Jared Kushner concocting a House of Cards-style game of their own?"" Vanity Fair asked this week, in an article about the hypothetical machinations of Ivanka and her husband. They were, the essay argued, ""positioned to become the de facto first couple."" Ivanka was the one who stayed focused. She was the one who had a politician's poise, and she held her highest cards close to her vest.    President-elect Donald Trump and his daughter. Ivanka seems like the steeliest of the Trump clan, the kind of person who might bring a stiletto to a knife fight. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)   What do we make of her? What is her endgame, when she insists that she is not a political person, while advocating for politically divisive causes, like equal wages for women and paid maternity leave? When, while working on the transition team for the highest office in the land, she is simultaneously posting videos online of her with her officemates, goofing around, doing the mannequin challenge? Ivanka: is the fairest of them all, but she also seems like the steeliest, the kind of person who might bring a stiletto to a knife fight. Ivanka: poised to fight for child-care reform, amid her own online pregnancy photos that revealed she was one of those women who looked as though she tucked a soccer ball down her size 2 dress and emerged nine months later with a baby.  Ivanka: in those other photos where -- and we realize that cameras are always catching things at weird angles and odd moments -- but those photos where the president-elect always seems to be patting around his daughter's butt. ""She does have a very nice figure,"" Trump once said of his daughter. ""I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps, I would be dating her."" Oh, Ivanka. Oh God, Ivanka. Speak to us. We are listening. This entire election has been about large portions of the electorate puzzling over whether their candidate really intended to do the things he said he was going to do, trying to read the election's burned entrails for the future of the country. The country needs someone who is an expert in shadowy operations, who can report back from the inside what is really going on.  The country needs Ivanka.

He argued it wasn't too late for a course correction. On his last foreign trip as president, Obama has repeatedly tried to draw lessons from Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election, hoping it can serve as wake-up call in the U.S. and abroad. Conceding that many feel left behind by globalization, Obama said there was an understandable impulse toward isolationism and that if people feel their futures are at risk, ""they'll push back.""  ""People have to know that they're being heard,"" Obama said in a speech to the Greek people in Athens. But, he added, ""We can't look backward for answers. We have to look forward."" While fewer people in the U.S. are looking to Obama for direction now that his successor has been chosen and his agenda largely rebuked, Obama has retained significant clout abroad. His message Wednesday appeared aimed at other world leaders facing pressures of nationalist movements and economic anxiety, exemplified by Britain's recent vote to leave the European Union. From Greece, Obama took a short flight to Germany, which has emerged as one of the strongest voices for preserving a unified, inclusive Europe. Yet even German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces her own threat from a nationalist right-wing movement, fueled in part by anger over her generous policy toward resettling Syrian migrants pouring into Europe.  ""We cannot sever the connections that have enabled so much progress,"" Obama said. Obama's argument centered on the notion that economic inequality, while a growing problem, can be addressed without a full rejection of globalization. Rather, he said it demanded a ""course correction.""  ""In the years and decades ahead, our countries have to make sure that the benefits of an integrated global economy are more broadly shared by more people and that the negative impacts are squarely addressed."" Obama argued nations must strengthen alliances and expressed his confidence that the U.S. would remain loyal to NATO despite Trump's suggestions to the contrary during the 2016 presidential campaign. He elicited nervous chuckles as he acknowledged that he and the president-elect ""could not be more different."" But in a message of reassurance, Obama argued that democracy is bigger than any one person.  ""As long as we retain our faith in democracy, as long as we retain our faith in the people, as long as we don't waver from those central principles that ensure a lively, open debate, then our future will be ok,"" Obama said. And to listeners at home fearful about Trump, he offered a path out of the wilderness, albeit a long and winding one.  ""Any action by a president, or any result of an election, or any legislation that is proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy,"" Obama said. Though Obama's trip to Greece was planned before the election results were known, the White House hoped the setting would form a powerful reminder of the basic tenets of democracy: fair elections, a free press and tolerance for ethnic, religious and sexual minorities. Before his speech, Obama climbed up the Acropolis, the ancient citadel that serves as a monument to free thought and artistic expression. He strolled through the Propylaea, the complex's monumental gateway, and gazed up at the famed Parthenon temple dating to the 5th century B.C. The entire site was closed to the public for Obama's visit, which has played out amid stringent security measures. Demonstrations were banned in parts of Athens, and road and subway stations were shut down for the first official visit of a sitting U.S. president since Bill Clinton came in 1999. Obama said concepts like minority rights and equality under the law ""grew out of this rocky soil"" in a democratic project not yet complete. He said inequality, on more vivid display due to widespread technology, now posed one of the biggest threats to democratic nations, their stability and prosperity. Even in Greece, there were parallels to the deep divisions now on display in America. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras won elections last year on what critics say was a populist platform, though one on the left of the spectrum. He pushed his formerly small party to the forefront by telling Greeks weary from six years of financial crisis that he would reject austerity measures imposed in return for bailouts. But after the near-collapse of negotiations with Greece's creditors, Tsipras performed a political about-face: He signed up to a new bailout and more austerity to prevent his country being forced out of the euro. Greece's government hoped Obama would help persuade some of Greece's more reluctant creditors to grant debt relief -- a message they hoped he'd stress in Berlin -- and also pressure other European countries to share more of the burden of the migrant crisis. Appearing receptive to Greece's woes, Obama repeated his belief that debt relief should be granted. ___ Associated Press writer Elena Becatoros contributed to this report. __ Follow Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP and Elena Becatoros on https://twitter.com/ElenaBec Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

This column originally ran Jan. 11, 2012.  Dear Carolyn: What is the best way to end a friendship -- to back away slowly and quietly, or to be upfront about why you are unhappy? My close friend has become the Patron Saint of Stressed Mothers over the last two years. All of the friends in our group have pitched in to help her adjust to this new lifestyle by babysitting, bringing over meals, listening patiently to all of HER problems, and politely tolerating her constant berating of her husband and mother for the slightest child-rearing offense. Before she was Stressed Mom, she was very fun, although she always had to be the center of attention, also politely tolerated because we all love her husband so much. Now her rudeness is extending to friends, with comments such as, ""Well, now you know what MY life is like,"" after seven hours of babysitting for her. Or better yet, you bring over meals and she complains that you did something wrong or she had to turn on her oven. We all realize that part of this is related to the hormonal adjustment and just being plain tired, but she recently stopped working, and we hoped things would improve. They have not. Is it time for an intervention, or should we move slowly away and then explain when she finally realizes we've had enough? Ready to Bail on a Friendship  Ready to Bail on a Friendship: Seven hours? My former new-mother self just fainted. My current incarnation is finding it hard to believe there isn't one truth-teller in your entire group. ""Actually, the thing to say to a person who just watched your child gratis for seven hours is, 'Thank you, O madly merciful one.' "" ""If there's a problem with my dinners, say so, because I'll gladly stop feeding you."" ""Perhaps you don't realize how you sound, but you are being really tough on your husband/mom lately."" ""I'm concerned about how negative you sound. Have you talked to your doctor about your mood changes since the baby?"" These are plenty solicitous and completely clear -- steel wrapped in flannel. You're still her friend (for now), so try using this formula to tell her kindly whenever she crosses a line; then wait a reasonable interval to see whether she gets this overdue message. ""Reasonable"" is in the eye of the beholder, but don't expect her to have an epiphany with the first limit you set, and if she hasn't had one by the 17th, then consider that you're patient to excess. Even if you cave on everything else, please call her on the way she treats her husband; what you describe is verbal and possibly emotional abuse, and ""politely tolerating"" is not a valid response. If she responds by tearing into you, then remember you went into this prepared to end the friendship, and calmly explain to her exactly what you think of her attitude. And if she doesn't confront you but persists in taking you for granted, then just stop offering yourself up for her use. You're the only one of your put-upon friend group signing this letter, but all of you owe it to yourselves, and to Momzerella, to stop being her coach mice. How will she ever figure out the world doesn't revolve around her when your actions tell her it does?  Write to Carolyn Hax at tellme@washpost.com.

Here’s the data.	"   Supporters cheer for President-elect Donald Trump at his 2016 U.S. presidential election-night event at the New York Hilton Midtown on Nov. 8. (Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto Agency)  Just as journalism is the first draft of history, exit polls let us take some first stabs at understanding public opinion. On the matter of politics and race, Donald Trump's victory will provide plenty of fodder for opinion columns, in-depth survey analyses, fieldwork and historical studies. Given the various studies already conducted, factors such as racial resentment and immigration conservatism will likely play important roles in explaining white voting behavior, in addition to factors such as economic anxiety and distrust of political elites. Our understanding of race and presidential voting, however, also needs to look comparatively across groups. Looking at the exit poll data from the 2016 election, and comparing them over time, the story on race and presidential voting gets a bit more complicated.   [Why the gender gap doomed Hillary Clinton]   One caveat about the national exit polls: They are designed to broadly represent the American electorate. Their sample design and lack of Asian language support may not be accurate in estimating the absolute support of subgroups in a given election. But the comparisons across years should give us a decent sense of how those groups move from year to year. It's also important to note that polling firms Latino Decisions and Asian American Decisions found much higher support for Clinton among Latinos and Asian American voters in a survey fielded in the week prior to Election Day. As I've noted before, it's possible that differential turnout on Election Day among Democrats and Republicans might account for part of this discrepancy.   [In record numbers, Latinos voted overwhelmingly against Trump. We did the research.]   There are different benchmarks one can use to see how Trump performed compared with prior Republican nominees. Comparing yesterday's results with 2012, as this Washington Post feature does, shows that Trump actually performed slightly worse among white voters than Mitt Romney did. He did, however, perform better than Romney among blacks, Latinos and Asian Americans, making it more difficult to claim that racial resentment was the dominant factor explaining Trump's support nationally.   [5 key lessons from Donald Trump's surprising victory]   The 2012 election was not an open one, however, since Obama was running for reelection. When we compare Republican nominee performances in prior open elections, we see that Trump made important gains among black voters as well as whites. The figure below presents net Republican support, meaning voter support for the Republican nominee minus voter support for the Democratic nominee. The GOP advantage among white voters was 9 points higher in 2016 than in 2008, which may be due as much to whites' reluctance to vote for Obama in 2008 as to their enthusiasm for Trump in 2016.       At the same time, Trump performed better with black voters than McCain did in 2008, and on par with Bush's performance in 2000. Trump performed as well as McCain did with Latino voters in 2008, and did only somewhat worse than Bush in 2000 -- which is surprising given the way that Trump launched his campaign with incendiary remarks about Mexican rapists, kicked out a prominent Mexican American journalist from a news conference, and questioned the fairness of Hispanic judges. Finally, among Asian Americans, Trump performed significantly worse than Bush did in 2000, and marginally worse than McCain did in 2008.   [What a President Trump means for foreign policy]   How do we explain these time trends? Why were many Latino voters apparently willing to overlook Trump's string of disrespectful remarks, including ones that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan characterized as ""the textbook definition"" of racism? Asking this very question might cast doubt on the exit poll findings about Latinos. But we should also remember that Clinton also failed to win the majority of white women, despite Trump's many negative remarks, ranging from Megyn Kelly to the Access Hollywood tape to various assault allegations, all of which got wide news coverage. Absent final turnout numbers, it is still too early to assess whether these shifting vote patterns are the result of differential turnout among Clinton and Trump supporters or the result of genuine voter conversion. It's possible that a sizable chunk of Latino Clinton supporters, in addition to white women, African Americans, and Asian Americans, did not show up on Election Day. It's also possible that a significant portion of these voters were willing to overlook Trump's incendiary remarks and vote for him based on other factors, like the need to shake up ""politics as usual."" Time will tell how well the national exit polls reflect the vote choices of women, Latinos, African Americans, and Asian Americans. Still, comparisons of the national exit polls over time reveal some important, and potentially unsettling, questions about what we presume to be true about voting among America's racial minorities. Did Hillary Clinton have an even tougher road with African Americans than Al Gore did in 2000, or did she benefit from multiple campaign appearances by Barack and Michelle Obama? Is immigration still a litmus test for Latino voters? And can we expect Asian Americans to shift back toward the Republican Party in future elections, or is their party identification hardening and making them more immune to big shifts in candidate choice?   [Trump's victory has enormous consequences for the Supreme Court]   This week's exit polls, in light of prior elections, raise these important questions about race and public opinion -- not just about whites, but also about blacks, Latinos and Asian Americans. And it will be up to a new generation of research -- done not just through surveys, but also through case studies and community fieldwork -- to help us better understand what happened this week, and what it will mean for the future of U.S. politics.

The police have laid siege to the town for months, a sign of the lingering standoff between Bahrain's Shiite majority and its Sunni monarchy more than five years after Arab Spring protests were crushed. The ongoing crackdown has seen some activists imprisoned, others exiled, and a major Shiite opposition group dismantled. But there was no sign of the unrest as Prince Charles and his wife Camilla took in the sights as part of a three-nation tour of the Gulf. The Prince of Wales inaugurated a new naval base on Thursday, the first permanent British military presence since its withdrawal from Bahrain in 1971. The royal visit and the military base suggest Britain, which has long had influence with Bahrain's own monarchy, may not be pressing it on human rights. Tensions continue to grow amid the crackdown, with some worried a larger crisis could loom in Bahrain, which is home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet.  ""You will reach the level where people realize they have nothing left to lose,"" one local activist told The Associated Press. Bahrain, a small island off the coast of the Arabian Peninsula, has long drawn revelers to bars across the causeway from dry Saudi Arabia. Its history as a port town for pearl divers and shippers has drawn an eclectic mix of Sunnis, Shiites, Iraqi Jews, Christian missionaries and Hindus. The 2011 Arab Spring protests were backed by the Shiite majority and others, and were aimed at demanding more political freedoms from the ruling Al Khalifa family. The government put down the demonstrations with help from Saudi and Emirati troops, and later pledged to reform. While low-level unrest persisted for years, things remained largely peaceful until April, when Bahrain's military announced it was ""ready to deal firmly and with determination with these sedition groups and their heads"" after a gasoline bomb killed a police officer. Since then, authorities suspended the country's largest Shiite opposition group, Al-Wefaq, and doubled a prison sentence for its secretary-general, Sheikh Ali Salman. Famed activist Nabeel Rajab was imprisoned and now awaits sentencing on a charge of spreading ""false news."" Zainab al-Khawaja, the daughter of well-known activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who himself is serving a life sentence over his role in the 2011 protests, was forced into exile. The standoff in Diraz began in June, when supporters of Shiite cleric Sheikh Isa Qassim surrounded his home after the government revoked his citizenship. Police now control entry to the town and film incoming local drivers, while Western expatriates blissfully jog past armored personnel carriers. Graffiti on nearby side streets demands ""death"" for King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, while others show crude drawings of Pearl Square, the epicenter of the 2011 protests, which was later demolished by the government. Internet access cuts off nightly here, an outage researchers blame on government interference. Bahrain has blamed its unrest partly on Shiite power Iran, though a government-sponsored investigation said there wasn't a ""discernable link"" between the 2011 demonstrations and Tehran based on the information the government gave them. Posters throughout Bahraini highways show heavily armed SWAT teams from a Gulf-wide police exercise on the island, part of recent military maneuvers designed as a deterrent to Iran following last year's nuclear deal. Low oil prices have hurt the local economy, and forced Saudi Arabia to scale back its international aid. Two activists who spoke Wednesday to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of facing criminal charges said Bahrain's rulers were inflaming sectarian tension through their crackdown.  ""They are betting on the silence of the West because of the supply of the facilities,"" one activist said, referring to the British and American bases. ""They are compromising other things for this."" In a statement to the AP, Bahrain's government said ""no individual in Bahrain will, or can be, prosecuted for his or her political views due to the freedom of expression protections explicitly stated in the constitution,"" despite the cases to the contrary. The British Foreign Office, while declining to address Prince Charles' private conversations, said United Kingdom officials have ""frank discussions with the government of Bahrain about human rights concerns both in public and in private.""  ""We believe that it is not good enough to merely criticize other countries from the sidelines,"" the statement to the AP said. ""Only by working with Bahrain are we able to bring about the changes we would like to see in the country."" However, even the day after the royals arrived, activists said prosecutors brought in several people for questioning likely ahead of filing criminal charges against them. Activists also offered a list of over 20 people recently put on a travel ban list, while independent news gathering grows more difficult. On Thursday, Prince Charles traveled to the British Navy's new Mina Salman Support Facility, which the British Defense Ministry estimates will cost the U.K. at least 6.4 million pounds ($7.9 million), with Bahrain covering the rest. Prince Charles and Bahraini Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa both wore military uniforms as they visited the site, still largely under construction. The two royals later boarded the HMS Middleton docked at the base, both smiling. Afterward, the crown prince drove himself away in a luxury SUV as Charles spoke to the sailors. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

From Viennese cafes to hard-luck coastal French towns to the ex-Communist flatlands of eastern Germany, anti-immigrant Europeans with views similar to Trump's said they could no longer be ignored by a political and media elite that unites conventional wisdom on both sides of the aisle. They exulted in their power to win their nations' highest offices in a marathon of elections that starts next month with the Austrian presidency and circles across some of Washington's most important partners. The new order has already begun, in a wave of congratulatory messages from European leaders who had little choice but to meekly declare readiness to work with the new American leader. France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy all face major ballot-box choices in the coming months -- and top politicians are now contending with pressure at home and from the world's biggest superpower. If Europe's mainstream leaders cooperate with an anti-immigrant, anti-trade President Trump, they will have little choice but to cooperate with far-right politicians at home, politicians and analysts said.  [Trump's victory promises to reshape U.S. political landscape]  ""He reclaimed democracy for the American people,"" said Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch far-right Party for Freedom, which is topping opinion polls ahead of March elections. ""It can indeed be an enormous incentive in Europe and the Netherlands to see that if people start moving in a certain direction, it can be done,"" Wilders said in an interview.   ""They have rejected the status quo,"" said Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Front, vowing to repeat Donald Trump's feat in the upcoming French elections. (Martin Bureau/AFP/Getty Images)  Now, he said, national leaders across Europe will have to contend with Trump's ideas -- and that means they will also have to engage with European far-right parties that share the same skepticism toward open borders for people and trade.  ""They have to take us seriously,"" he said. ""Politics will never be the same again after yesterday. I'm sure about that. It's a kind of new era that we entered."" The cheers began early Wednesday, when French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen was among the first world politicians to congratulate Trump on Twitter, just as he started to pull away in the battleground states.  ""They have rejected the status quo,"" Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, said later in the day, vowing to repeat the feat in France. ""What happened last night was not the end of the world, it was the end of a world."" Le Pen far outpolls President Francois Hollande ahead of springtime elections, and though it remains unclear whether she can pull off an outright victory, fewer people are ruling it out after the Trump upset. Le Pen has already surged after Islamic State attacks in France, which were largely perpetrated by French and Belgian citizens whose families had immigrated from North Africa.  [World gasps in disbelief after Trump's win]  ""If ISIS throws three bombs at Paris between the first and the second round of the elections, then it's Le Pen. They're not stupid,"" said Ulrike Guerot, director of the Department for European Policy and the Study of Democracy at Austria's Danube University Krems. ""You could be really cynical and say the only people who are really united right now in Europe are these people."" That view is shared by many of the far-right leaders themselves. ""This election result gives courage to Germany and Europe, because Trump has the maps for a political turnaround in his hand,"" said the leader of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, Frauke Petry, who has been climbing in opinion polls ahead of national elections next year. Euroskeptic leaders said they would study Trump's freewheeling campaign and seek to replicate it in their own nations. Nigel Farage, a leader of the successful campaign to lead Britain out of the European Union, hit the campaign trail with Trump and plans to fly to the United States on Thursday. And Dutch politicians say they were inspired by Trump's improvised election effort.  ""He has such a small campaign staff, so he relied very heavily on the ground on people in cities, organizing things. That kind of civic spirit is something we'd love to take to our campaign. That's something I'm trying to copy,"" said Thierry Baudet, a Dutch Euroskeptic leader who was one of the organizers of a successful April referendum in which Dutch voters rejected an E.U. trade agreement with Ukraine.   [What America's choice of Trump really means]  Austria may be the next country poised to elect a nationalist leader who has many positions on immigration and trade that are similar to Trump's. The anti-immigrant Freedom Party is poised to seize the Austrian presidency Dec. 4 -- and it just sent a delegation to the United States to study the Trump campaign, one official said. But in a hint at some limits on Trump's effect on European politics, the far-right Austrian presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, took a careful line on the U.S. president-elect on Wednesday, offering him congratulations but little more. Analysts said that domestic anti-Americanism dictated the careful line. ""The overall narrative that we have to stick it to the elites, that the country was usurped by the elite and we need to return it to the people, also works in Austria,"" said Reinhard Heinisch, head of the political science department at the University of Salzburg. But ""the Freedom Party has to form a coalition, and to form a coalition it has to play well with others,"" he said. No matter the local considerations, for many Euroskeptic leaders the Trump victory was a delightful glimpse into future electoral possibilities. ""When it rains in the United States of America, you feel the drops here in Europe,"" said Filip Dewinter, a leader of Belgium's far-right Flemish Interest party, which has campaigned on an anti-immigration platform. ""It will be very tough for the political elite in Europe.""  James McAuley in Paris, Annabell Van den Berghe in Brussels and Stephanie Kirchner in Berlin contributed to this report.

An Upper Marlboro resident who owns a stake in home-healthcare business in Louisiana, he started moonlighting for the ride-share company one day a week because his accountant told him it would allow him write off maintenance costs for his 2011 Chrysler. But on Tuesday, as Butler ventured inside the Beltway to ply his trade, he found his silver sedan transformed into a wheeled political salon. By noon, he said, he had already taken 10 passengers to polling stations across the District. Most were on their way to vote -- and they were talkative about the contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. ""People have been more than vocal about it,"" Butler said.  In his clientele, he believed he had observed a microcosm of political opinion -- representing, at least, a left-leaning swath of the District and Maryland. ""I have seen the Trump supporters, but primarily Clinton supporters,"" he said. ""I've even had people who say they're going to write in a candidate."" He added: ""It has been close. I haven't taken a poll."" What are voters saying? Butler filled in a reporter mid-day Tuesday on a trip through Southeast Washington. ""As far as Trump goes, a lot of people who are supporting him are interested in how he can change the state of the government,"" Butler said. As he talked, he was only slightly ruffled by the insistent honks of a white sedan with New York plates, which careened around him on the entrance to Interstate 295. ""I don't know where I was supposed to go,"" Butler remarked to the receding vehicle, before resuming his observations on the electorate. Clinton's supporters, he said, seemed united in their belief ""that she was qualified for the job, that she has better temperament to lead as far as foreign policy goes."" ""A couple people said they were sick of hearing about the emails,"" he added. Some of the views expressed inside Butler's Chrysler don't differ much from what has been heard for months on cable TV. But Butler also heard some distinctive political rationales. One passenger, he said, was angry with Republicans in Congress over the 2013 shutdown of the federal government, which was precipitated by a dispute with the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act. As a result, he said, the woman told him she planned to vote for Trump as a change agent.  ""She's thinking that Trump is going to come in and all these older senators are going to go away in some magical way,"" he said. His eyes, reflected in the rearview mirror, conveyed skepticism. Will Butler reveal his own choice for president? A 46-year-old registered Democrat who is African American, Butler said Trump's arguments did not leave him unswayed. He liked what the GOP nominee had to say about keeping businesses in America and shaking up the country's political class.  The Manhattan real-estate magnate's assorted tax dodges weren't of particular concern to Butler, who after all took up Uber in hope of a tax write-off. ""He obviously took advantage of some things,"" Butler said. ""If Americans are honest, we all take deductions. We all take advantage of some things."" In the end, he said, he voted for Clinton because he doesn't trust Trump to keep his cool while running the country. He knows the value of that quality himself as a semi-professional navigator of Beltway traffic. ""It just wasn't the temperament of a leader that I can see sitting across from another leader of a foreign country and being respected,"" he said. Butler pulled up at Hendley Elementary School, where voting was underway. Behind him, cars were honking again. Men and women thronged the sidewalks on their way to the polls. After dropping off his passenger, he eased his sedan off along streets sprinkled with golden leaves.  Another ride had been requested, this one from a polling place. Butler had more work to do. "

RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images)  Today is a celebration of American democracy. People proudly display their ""I voted"" stickers to show that -- Democrat, Republican or other -- they have participated in the electoral process. I am not one of those people. As regular readers of this blog know, I don't vote -- and never really have. (I think I voted for my friend James Fogarty for the neighborhood commission when I was an undergrad at Georgetown.) When I tell people about it, they are stunned. Like, floored. ""How could you not vote?"" ""You spend your whole life with this stuff!"" ""People fought and died for this right."" All full of common sense. But, I still don't do it. I've given a variety of answers over the years for my stance on voting. [Sidebar: I am under no illusion that any large number of people care deeply about whether I or any journalist votes. But (a) it's Election Day (b) I have been thinking a lot about it, and (c) I have a political blog. So ...] When I was younger -- before I was a reporter -- it was sheer laziness. All people in their late teens and early 20s know what I am talking about. Then once I started working as a journalist and then got hired at The Post, it was more of a principle thing. The editor in chief when I started at The Post in late 2005 was the legendary Len Downie, who, himself was a non-voter. Here's how Len explained his view on voting in an online chat in 1998: We work hard here to not be biased and not appear to be biased. All our reporters and editors, for example, are prohibited from engaging in any political or interest group activity except voting. And I even refuse to vote so that I never make up my mind which party, candidate or ideology should be in power. Mike Allen, the longtime face of Politico, is also a non-voter. He wrote a piece about it in 2008, saying in part: I'm part of a minority school of thought among journalists that we owe it to the people we cover, and to our readers, to remain agnostic about elections, even in private. I figure that if the news media serve as an (imperfect) umpire, neither team wants us taking a few swings. There's a tendency to assume that reporters who don't vote make one of two mistaken assumptions: 1. Not voting means you are truly objective. and/or 2. It makes you superior to your voting colleagues. I believe neither. Most of the reporters I know vote. That they do so has zero impact on their merits as reporters. One of the great things of our Internet age is that all of our work as journalists is publicly available -- you can see for yourself whether they are biased in some way shape or form. And, the simple act of refusing to vote tells you nothing about whether a reporter is rooting for one side or the other. In fact, if you wanted to throw people off the scent of a bias in your coverage, not voting would be a smart way to do it. As I got older then, my principled (sanctimonious?) stance on voting evolved. And it became this: I don't vote these days out of defensiveness. As a political reporter, people online (and off) are forever trying to ""out"" you, to show what your real politics are beneath your veneer of objectivity. They try to find shreds of evidence whether in your biography (I worked for George Will in college!) or your writing (Donald Trump has run a remarkably poor campaign) that are the tells for your ""real"" political views. Anything can be a clue -- even (or especially) things that really say nothing about your beliefs. Voting is the biggest touchpoint for people who believe they can divine your secret political agenda. Who did you vote for in the last election? they ask. If you aren't willing to tell them, it's taken as confirmation of the fact that you are actually a closet [whatever the opposite is of their party.] I reject the idea that who you vote for in any given election speaks to some broader set of biases/views you carry that color your journalism. My two favorite politicians are Lindsey Graham and Chuck Schumer -- one Republican, one Democrat. I don't like Schumer or Graham because of their party affiliations. I like them because they are consistently interesting on both politics and policy. But, I am also a pragmatist. I don't deal in the world as I would like it to be, but the world that is. And, over the past five years or so -- essentially, as social media has come to dominate politics and political journalism -- the attempts to ""prove"" reporters political biases has become a near full-time job. So, I stay in my defensive crouch -- a position I am not proud of but one that I feel has been forced upon me by the political world in which I exist. That has the ring of martyrdom to it -- which is not my intent. Simply put: I am not biased. Never have been. Never will be. But, I am also deeply committed to transparency in journalism, and I would never want to not answer honestly or fully if/when I am asked whether I voted and who I voted for. So, I take the path of least resistance. Of course, I could not care what people say or how they try to twist words or votes to fit their own partisan conclusions. Maybe that will come sometime soon. Or maybe when I turn 50. But, in 2016, I will sit it out -- as I have every election since I've been eligible to vote. I don't expect you to agree with me. But I do hope you might now understand my stance better."

If you've seen the critically acclaimed Broadway musical ""Hamilton,"" then you've heard the song ""Farmer Refuted."" It's based on a letter a young Alexander Hamilton wrote -- he was barely 20 -- offering a passionate defense of individual liberty and the brewing American Revolution. Yet he did not sign it under his own name, instead writing as ""a sincere friend of America."" This overlooked fact deserves greater attention. Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical has renewed Americans' appreciation of Hamilton, one of our nation's most dynamic founders. Never before have his life and views, from his defense of individual rights to his opposition to slavery, been so celebrated. But Hamilton's frequent use of anonymous speech has received scant attention, even though it has a significant bearing on American politics today. Anonymous speech was a frequent feature of Hamilton's life -- and of the American founding overall. Arguably the single most influential piece leading to American independence was ""Common Sense,"" the pamphlet penned by Thomas Paine anonymously. Just over a decade later, Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay co-wrote the Federalist Papers as ""Publius."" These were not unconnected or uncommon occurrences. The United States was built in large part on the exchange of ideas circulated anonymously. In the years before the Declaration of Independence, anonymous speech was one of the greatest weapons the colonists used against the tyrant King George III. As for the Constitution, had Publius and others not anonymously dialogued in newspapers about the equally revolutionary document, it might never have been adopted, nor would have the subsequent Bill of Rights with its First Amendment guarantee of free speech. The bottom line is that it is highly probable that the United States would not even exist without anonymous speech. Sadly, we have forgotten this lesson somewhere in the intervening years. Today, anonymous speech is too often demonized, derided as ""dark,"" or otherwise dismissed for its lack of ""transparency."" Although there are many examples, the brunt of these attacks centers on the anonymous speech used by nonprofit organizations on both the right and the left. These groups reach out to the public with messages on a wide number of issues, and they can be supported by individuals, corporations, unions and more. The nationwide campaign against anonymous speech is, by and large, a campaign to force these supporters' identities into the open.  That was one impetus behind the Senate's 2014 push for a constitutional amendment that would have given Congress unprecedented authority to regulate -- and therefore ban -- speech that touches on politics. Although the measure was defeated, it still received the support of 54 senators and the president. At the federal level, the Federal Election Commission has issued or debated several rulings designed to roll back anonymity in political speech. The threats are even more numerous at the state level. In recent years, elected officials in New York and California have demanded that nonprofits hand over lists of their supporters to government officials. In other states, legislative proposals or proposed ballot initiatives would force disclosure of all supporters to nonprofit organizations that talk about political officeholders and issues. No matter what form they take, these efforts would curtail the very speech that Hamilton used so effectively. Political speech is a prerequisite for a free and democratic society. In many ways, anonymous political speech may be the most important form of speech we have. It enables all of us to air our opinions, doubts and thoughts without fear of retaliation from hostile members of the community, from employers or from the government itself. Some opponents of anonymous political speech claim it enables businesses and individuals to advocate in secret for government policies that benefit themselves. But an idea aired in the public forum -- whether it's suggested by an individual, nonprofit or business -- doesn't mandate an action. It asks people to evaluate the merits of the argument and to decide for themselves if the proposed change would advance society. As then-Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission in 1995, "" 'the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.' . . . Don't underestimate the common man. People are intelligent enough to evaluate the source of an anonymous writing."" Perhaps we should have more faith that voters -- and reporters -- are smart enough to smell a rat. When anonymous speech flourishes, ideas that are unpopular, controversial and revolutionary have a much better chance of finding their way into the public square and gaining wider public acceptance. Absent anonymous speech, America's political discourse would become less vibrant, more impoverished. Hamilton proved it.    Read more:   Bertram J.
