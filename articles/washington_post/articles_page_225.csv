Las consultas legales ven como aumentan sus clientes. En las escuelas publicas se responder a la lluvia de preguntas de padres y estudiantes. Desde las elecciones, las duras afirmaciones del presidente electo en Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, sobre inmigracion han creado ansiedad a los migrantes de todo el pais, sin importar su estatus legal. Acuden a abogados, escuelas, grupos de derechos y oficinas del Congreso en busca de ayuda.  ""Estamos operando con muchas incognitas, y hay ciertos temores asociados a eso"", dijo Vanessa Esparza-Lopez, abogado en el National Immigrant Justice Center de Chicago. En Chicago, una linea telefonica gestionada por el mayor grupo de derechos de migrantes del estado recibio mas de 330 llamadas en la semana posterior a las elecciones, frente al centenar que recibe normalmente. En Denver, autoridades escolares enviaron una carta a los padres en respuesta a sus dudas sobre los efectos de los comicios presidenciales sobre los estudiantes que viven en el pais de forma ilegal. El Legal Assistance Group de Nueva York dijo que recibe entre 40 y 60 llamadas diarias sobre inmigracion, desde las 20 a 30 anteriores. La Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights de Los Angeles reporto 19 consultas en un solo dia, todas preguntas sobre ciudadania. Las dudas mas urgentes proceden de jovenes que se benefician de un programa federal instaurado en 2012 por el gobierno del presidente Barack Obama que permite a los migrantes que llegaron al pais de forma ilegal cuando eran menores evitar la deportacion y obtener permisos de trabajo. Unas 740.000 personas participan en el sistema Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA, por sus siglas en ingles). Abogados senalan que el programa es vulnerable porque fue creado a traves de una orden ejecutiva del presidente, sin el respaldo de una ley, lo que hace que los posibles nuevos solicitantes duden sobre si inscribirse en el. Andrea Aguilera, una estudiante universitaria de 20 anos en un suburbio de Chicago, se siente en el limbo ya que la documentacion que obtuvo a traves del DACA expira el proximo ano. Entro al pais cruzando la frontera con Mexico clandestinamente cuando tenia cuatro anos y mantuvo su estatus migratorio casi en completo secreto hasta que hace cuatro anos pudo obtener un permiso de trabajo gracias al DACA. Desde entonces trabajo como cajera de un supermercado y becaria en una empresa financiera del centro de la ciudad. Dos de sus hermanos estan tambien en el programa; otro es ciudadano estadounidense.  ""Ha sido dificil centrarse en la escuela"", dijo Aguilera. ""No se que nos va a pasar"". Durante la campana electoral, Trump prometio deportar a los 11 millones de inmigrantes que se estima viven en el pais sin la documentacion pertinente y construir un muro fronterizo. El republican no ha explicado como va a proceder y recientemente rebajo el numero de expulsiones del pais. El Center for Immigration Studies, que aboga por una menor inmigracion, explico que el aumento de la actividad se debe a la incertidumbre por si el gobierno de Trump aplicara las leyes ya existentes. Jon Feere, analista legal de la organizacion con sede en Washington D.C., dijo que los inscritos en el DACA eran conscientes de los riesgos cuando entraron al programa. Otros deberian preocuparse un poco.  ""Los que cumplen la ley no tienen nada de que preocuparse"", declaro. Sin embargo, incluso los migrantes con estatus legal permanente tienen dudas desde las elecciones. Abogados y organizaciones de inmigrantes sostienen que los titulares de la ""green card"" -- la tarjeta de residencia permanente para inmigrantes -- sienten una nueva urgencia para asegurarse de que tramites como la solicitud para renovar el documento estan en orden por el miedo a que la ley pueda cambiar con el nuevo gobierno. La mayoria de los migrantes puede solicitar la ciudadania entre tres y cinco anos despues de obtener la tarjeta verde. Unos nueve millones de migrantes con tarjeta verde podrian optar ahora a la ciudadania, segun los datos mas recientes del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional. Algunos buscan aclarar cuestiones sobre cuando pueden patrocinar a familiares que residen en el extranjero.  ""La gente necesita tranquilidad"", dijo Irina Matiychenko, que dirige la unidad de proteccion a migrantes en el Legal Assistance Group de Nueva York. ""La gente necesita orientacion"". En Phoenix, los lideres locales planearon un encuentro el fin de semana acerca de ser un inmigrante en Arizona como un esfuerzo para ""guiarnos en el camino de la confianza y la unidad"". Personal de la oficina del congresista democrata de Chicago Luis Gutierrez reportaron un incremento de actividad con al menos 60 nuevas solicitudes de ciudadania en las dos ultimas semanas. Distritos escolares, incluidos Chicago y Denver, utilizaron las elecciones para recordar cual es su politica. El superintendente de Denver, Tom Boasberg, dijo que se enviaron cartas en cuatro idiomas a las viviendas de los 90.000 estudiantes del distrito en respuesta a lo que los profesores escuchaban de alumnos y padres. El texto reitero que las autoridades escolares no preguntan por el estatus migratorio de los ninos al realizar la matricula.  ""En un momento de temor y preocupacion, se extienden muchos rumores y desinformacion"", dijo. ""Y por eso es tan importante dar informacion objetiva precisa a nuestras familias de una fuente muy fiable"". ___ Los periodistas de The Associated Press Astrid Galvan en Phoenix, Colleen Slevin en Denver y Amy Taxin en Santa Ana, California, contribuyeron a este despacho. ___ La periodista de AP Sophia Tareen esta en Twitter en http://twitter.com/sophiatareen.

That's just the immediate fallout from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surprise effort to stamp out corruption by making cash hoards in large denomination bills worthless. But what lies ahead could be even worse, some analysts say.  ""Basically, you've created chaos,"" said Steve H. Hanke, an applied economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and a global authority on currency policy. ""India is a cash economy. It's not like Europe or the U.S. where everyone is running around with a credit card. That's not the world of India.""  ""It doesn't look like this thing was thought through at all,"" he said. Every day or so, soothing assurances about India's overnight currency reform spill from the offices of top government officials.  ""Enough cash is available,"" Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said Thursday during a nationally televised press conference, as millions of people waited in hours-long lines. A few days earlier, the finance minister urged patience with what he called ""a period of inconvenience."" But the decision to ban India's highest denomination bills, 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee notes worth about $7.50 and $15, goes far beyond an inconvenience. India's economy has become one of the world's largest in recent years, but millions of businesses, and hundreds of millions of people, lack bank accounts and use cash to pay for everything from groceries to hospital stays to land purchases. The shadow economy -- countless transactions hidden from the authorities -- is believed to amount to about a quarter of the country's gross domestic product. The government used a similar demonetization in the late 1970s. But it failed to curb corruption, and the underground economy has grown immensely larger since then. Plenty of Indians do use cash transactions to hide their wealth and avoid taxes -- less than 3 percent of the population pays income taxes -- and the authorities occasionally arrest businesspeople or corrupt officials with currency hoards that can fill trucks. But plenty more people use cash because of habit, poverty or a lack of easy access to banks. So instead of just aiming squarely at wealthy tax dodgers, the demonetization is also hammering the poor, the working-class and small business people whose lives have been turned upside down during the transition to new currency notes. Across India, people are waiting in lines that often form hours before banks open and last well into the afternoon, though the government has limited most withdrawals and currency exchanges to a maximum of $30 a day.  ""It is unclear whether this exercise will achieve any lasting results other than having created a national economic crisis, destroying confidence in the national currency and unleashing tremendous suffering for ordinary Indian citizens,"" Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at HIS Global Insight, said in an email.  ""This will have a direct negative effect on retail sales and industrial output during the coming weeks,"" Biswas said. A research report this week from the banking giant HSBC predicted that imports of consumer goods would fall, but added that could be offset by a spike in demand for gold, as unsettled Indians look for ways to store their wealth. In worst-case scenarios, the effects of demonetization could last for years, driving the country into recession and pushing Indians to keep their wealth in more stable currencies, such as the euro or U.S. dollar.  ""When you don't trust a currency and you don't trust a government you start using foreign currencies,"" said Hanke. ""That's what this is going to do, I think: People will not trust the rupee."" Raghuram Rajan, the former head of India's central bank and one of the country's most respected economists, warned in 2014 that demonetization programs can easily stumble.  ""It's not that easy to flush out black money,"" he said after a speech, while he was still the country's top banker. He added, ""my sense is that the clever find ways"" to get around currency overhauls. Rajan has instead suggested better monitoring of financial transactions, such as using government ID cards to track major purchases, and improved tax enforcement. Hanke was surprised that India would even try a demonetization program, given that its failure in the 1970s is well-known in currency policy circles.  ""They're usually done in some kind of crisis situation and panic,"" said Hanke, ""and they ultimately have all kinds of negative unintended consequences."" ___ Follow Tim Sullivan on Twitter at http://twitter.com/ByTimSullivan Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Resources to process the immigrants, detain them and to try their immigration cases in court are extremely strained. Now, federal officials say they are releasing Haitian immigrants who have been entering the country in large numbers, backtracking on a pledge to jail them before they are deported. A U.S. government official told The Associated Press that the decision to free Haitians arriving in Arizona and California is in response to a lack of jail space. The official said releasing immigrants with orders to report later to immigration court is a tactic used when detention space is scarce, under certain humanitarian conditions or as part of efforts to keep families together. Before the Haitians are released, they are subjected to a criminal background and national security check. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on speaking on condition of anonymity. Federal immigration officials announced Thursday they are opening a large processing facility in west Texas next week in an effort to deal with the large number of families and young children coming through the border. The facility in Tornillo, outside of El Paso, can hold up to 500 people and will be up and running by next week, officials say. The influx of migrants and lack of jail space on the border will be one of the most immediate immigration challenges for Trump. Among the issues Trump will face is growing opposition to conditions at Border Patrol holding cells and ICE detention centers. For example, the Border Patrol in Arizona faces a lawsuit from immigrants who say its holding cells are overcrowded, dirty and extremely cold. A federal judge in Tucson on Tuesday said he was inclined to direct the Border Patrol to improve sleeping conditions, although he hasn't issued a directive yet. Immigrants who enter through Texas also report that Border Patrol holding facilities - known as ""hieleras"" - the Spanish word for ""freezers,"" are difficult to sleep in. CBP has said it is ""committed to the safety, security and welfare of those in our custody, especially those who are most vulnerable."" In California, thousands of Haitians have arrived at the U.S. border with Mexico in recent months, many after traveling 7,000 miles by foot, taxi and bus from Brazil through eight nations. They present themselves to U.S. border inspectors, often at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry, the nation's busiest crossing. About 5,000 Haitians had showed up at San Ysidro from October 2015 through late September, overwhelming border inspectors. Another 40,000 were on their way, officials have said. The Department of Homeland Security last week said there were about 41,000 people in immigration detention facilities, compared to a typical population of 31,000 to 34,000. It was unclear how many Haitians have been released since the change, although ICE says it has deported 203 Haitians to their home country and that about 4,400 remain detained. ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea said in a written statement it is removing Haitians in accordance with its enforcement priorities.  ""ICE prioritizes the removal of national security threats, convicted felons, individuals convicted of significant or multiple misdemeanors, and individuals apprehended at or between ports of entry while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States,"" she wrote. The decision to release Haitians will likely add to the growing backlog of more than half-a-million cases already pending in immigration court. That backlog has effectively meant that immigrants routinely wait years for a judge to decide if they should be kicked out of the country. At a bus station in Phoenix on Thursday, several Central American women said authorities released them on condition that they promise to appear in immigration court. Yarely Cobon of Guatemala was wearing an ankle monitor and was with her 4-year-old daughter. Cobon, 22, said she left Guatemala over three weeks ago and crossed the border in Texas. She turned herself in to the Border Patrol and was detained for about six days. Her family paid for a bus ticket to join them in Los Angeles, where she has a court hearing next week. Cobon said the Border Patrol holding cell where she was held with her daughter was packed with women in children.  ""I was just standing, sitting, desperate. There's children crying. It was dirty,"" Cobon said. Ana Lidia Dubon Martinez is nearly eight months pregnant with twins and left Honduras with her 11-year-old brother almost a month ago. The pair swam across the river in Matamoros, Mexico, and turned themselves in to border agents in the U.S. Dubon Martinez is headed to Los Angeles via bus. The U.S. policy shift announced in September lifted special protections that Haitians got after their country's 2010 earthquake and treats them like immigrants from other countries and regions, including Mexico and Central America. Central Americans, particularly adult men, are often detained until they can be flown home. Mexicans are typically turned around immediately, made possible by their country's shared border with the U.S. Women with children such as Cobon and Dubon Martinez are often released and given a court date similar to how the government is handling the Haitians. The new posture hit hurdles when a powerful hurricane struck Haiti, raising more questions about the ability of the Caribbean nation to accept large numbers of its people. The U.S. temporarily suspended deportation flights to Haiti on Oct. 4 but Johnson vowed that Haitians would continue to be detained. ___ Spagat reported from San Diego, Caldwell reported from Washington, Galvan reported from Phoenix Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

He did, and in January the Republican will become the nation's youngest governor at age 42. Sununu, whose birthday was last week, is seven months younger than Republican Eric Greitens, who was elected governor of Missouri on Tuesday, and two years younger than South Carolina's Republican governor, Nikki Haley, who currently holds the ""youngest"" title. Sununu, whose father, John H. Sununu, served three terms as governor starting in 1983, downplayed the significance of his age. He said this week he's glad voters chose him for his experience. He couldn't be reached Friday for further comment. Haley said she's looking forward to working with Sununu.  ""Chris won by the will of the people, and he should continue to follow his instincts that won him the trust of so many,"" she said. ""His drive, knowledge, and experience will allow? him to be a great governor."" The Democratic candidate for New Hampshire governor this year, Colin Van Ostern, was even younger than Sununu -- 37. During their campaign, each tried to portray the other as inexperienced businessmen. Van Ostern has worked for political campaigns, Stonyfield Yogurt and Southern New Hampshire University; Sununu is a former environmental engineer who more recently helped buy and operate the Waterville Valley ski area. While Sununu will be the nation's youngest governor, he won't be the youngest ever to serve New Hampshire. That distinction goes to Republican Hugh Gregg, who was 35 when he was elected in 1952. His son Judd, who later served as governor, congressman and U.S. senator, was only 5 years old when his father was elected and doesn't remember any talk of his dad's youthfulness. But he noted that was a different era. Before becoming governor, Hugh Gregg had served as mayor of Nashua and was a veteran of World War II and the Korean War, and it wasn't unusual for people his age to be seen as leaders.  ""I think that time, there was a huge group of people his age who'd been through war, so I don't think anyone considered his youth an issue because of that experience,"" he said. Gregg said he is confident Sununu has the ability and talent to do the job well, given that he ran the ski area in both good winters and bad.  ""That's about as New Hampshire of an experience as you can get for a small business,"" he said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Chinese news website 64Tianwang and citizen journalists Lu Yuyhu and Li Tingyu are also being honored by the international advocacy group Reporters Without Borders, the organization said Sunday. Abdallah, who publishes on social media networks such as Facebook and Telegram, is known for his harrowing, on-the-spot reporting about government airstrikes and artillery attacks. He is often at the scene before the dust settles, despite the threat of so-called ""double tap"" attacks -- follow-up strikes that target the rescuers responding to the initial attacks. Dozens of media activists have died covering Syria's war.  ""This prize honors the Syrian journalists who have offered their lives in order to convey the truth to the people,"" Abdallah said in remarks to The Associated Press. Abdallah was wounded in an apparent attempt on his life last June by a bomb planted outside his apartment building that killed his cameraman, Khaled al-Issa. Abdallah has travelled to some of the war's fiercest fronts with rebel factions. His detractors say his ease with the groups is evidence of his affiliation with al-Qaida, an accusation commonly leveled by government supporters against opposition-minded Syrians. But Abdallah is unapologetic about his association with ""revolutionaries"" fighting to topple President Bashar Assad.  ""I warn that if the international community continues to fail us, the area will be on fire. If the Nusra Front and al-Qaida offer us help we will take it,"" he said after the government seized the rebel stronghold of Qusair, in his home province of Homs, in 2013. The group formerly known as the Nusra Front, which was al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria, detained Abdallah for several hours last January in the rebel-held province of Idlib on the charge of broadcasting music on the radio. Abdallah communicates often with foreign journalists, who rarely travel to Syria's opposition areas because of security concerns, particularly after kidnappings picked up in 2014. Reporters will check his reports against other sources.  ""I consider getting this prize a victory for the media of the Syrian revolution against the media of Assad and his allies,"" he told the AP on Tuesday. Reporters Without Borders' Freedom Prize was awarded to Syrian journalist Zaina Erhaim last year. Abdallah will not be attending the ceremony, to be held later Tuesday in Strasbourg. He says the Assad government has flagged his passport with Interpol, making it impossible for him to travel internationally. Erhaim also could not attend her ceremony.

5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/08/google-data-indicate-potential-for-record-turnout-this-year/	Google data indicate potential for record turnout this year	"   Early-morning voters wait in line on Election Day at Grady High School in Atlanta. (Jessica McGowan/Getty Images)  The long national nightmare of the 2016 campaign is finally coming to a close. There's been a lot of talk about the potentially irreparable damage this acrimonious contest has done to our civic fabric. But if there's any silver lining to the campaign, it may be that all the outlandish and divisive rhetoric is serving to get more people engaged with the political process. Here's one data point that speaks to our current level of civic engagement, from Google Trends: Peoples' interest in finding out where to vote has never been higher.    Google searches for ""where to vote"" spike during presidential-election years, but never more than in 2016.  The Google data shows that searches for ""where to vote"" account for about twice as much Google search volume this November as they have in previous presidential election years in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Broader search queries, such as ""voting,"" show a similar pattern -- though those searches could be related to such information as early-vote tallies or to non-election voting for things like TV shows (America's Got Talent, etc.). A person wanting to know ""where to vote,"" on the other hand, is probably looking for specific, practical information on where to cast a ballot. The related queries that Google shows for this search bolster that assumption -- they include queries on how to register, how to vote and voter eligibility.   [Is voting a waste of time? Not if you do the math.]   Other signs point to higher-than-normal voter turnout in 2016. More than 47 million voters have cast early ballots this year, smashing the previous early-voting record of 32 million in 2012. Some of that increase is due to simple population growth, and some of it comes from more states adding early and no-excuse absentee voting this year. Early voting also indicates that Latino participation may hit record levels this year. This is likely to be a boon for Hillary Clinton, given Trump's record-low support among Latino voters. Political betting markets have also recently taken a turn toward predicting higher turnout. At PredictIt, the odds for a turnout of 145 million voters -- or more than roughly 63 percent turnout -- have spiked in recent days. A number of that magnitude could be higher than the turnout in any election since the 1960s. High turnout could be favorable for the Clinton campaign. ""Most often, higher turnout favors Democrats,"" political scientist Michael P. McDonald told Factcheck.org earlier this year. This is because demographic groups that historically have low turnout rates -- minorities and young people chief among them -- tend to prefer Democratic candidates.

6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/08/the-7-charts-that-explain-the-2016-presidential-election/	The 7 charts that explain the 2016 presidential election	"We've written a bajillion words -- that's not an estimate, that's an exact figure -- in this space about the 2016 election. So, rather than write even more words on this Election Day, I asked each member of The Fix (Aaron Blake, Philip Bump, Amber Phillips, Callum Borchers and Peter Stevenson) to give me the one (or two or three) charts that they thought said something important about this election and/or the state of the country. They're below -- with a short explainer for why each matters. 1. The disappearing swing voter     Wrote Aaron: ""There are simply fewer and fewer swing voters. The Monkey Cage's John Sides in November pointed to a study by Michigan State University's Corwin Smidt showing the number of swing voters -- labeled here as ""floating voters"" -- has declined from as much as 15 percent of the population in the late 1960s to about 5 percent of voters today. 2. Republicans demographic problem     Wrote Philip: ""Even without creating a path to citizenship for people who immigrated illegally, Republican candidates need to do a better job of appealing to a Hispanic citizen population which is projected to be among the fastest growing in the country. The Census Bureau estimates how the population will grow over the next few decades. The number of Americans overall will increase, and the percentage of the population that is Hispanic will grow more rapidly than the population as a whole. At the same time, the number of people age 65 and over will also grow -- including whites in that age group, a population that currently makes up a lot of the Republican base."" 3. The downballot Trump effect     Wrote Amber: ""Senate Republicans don't necessarily need Donald Trump to win for them to hold onto their majority. (In fact, some of them are campaigning on a Trump loss.) They just need him to avoid a blowout loss. And as the presidential race tightens, there's evidence that if Trump loses to Hillary Clinton by roughly 3 to 5 points, Senate Republicans could hang on. According to the latest polling averages from RealClearPolitics of the 13 most competitive Senate races this cycle, Republicans are outperforming Trump in nine states. Sometimes by as much as 8, 9, even 13 points. It's a trend we've been noticing since September, when Senate Republicans polled ahead of Trump by an average of four points."" 4. The racial divide    (Philip Bump / The Washington Post)  Bump: ""During the Clinton administration, white Americans were about four points more likely to say they were Republican than Democrat. In 2013, according to Gallup, the margin was nine points. While the Democratic Party is more racially diverse, black Americans are not very politically diverse. Pew Research regularly surveys to figure out the partisan blend in the country, and in 2014 it determined that whites were more likely to identify as Republican than Democrat, 49 percent to 40 percent -- a margin that mirrors Gallup. Blacks, on the other hand, were over seven times as likely to say that they're Democrats."" 5. Everyone hates the media. In their own way.     Wrote Cal: ""Attacking the media is a universal strategy in politics -- there's no better way to reduce the impact of an unwelcome message or stories than by attacking the messenger -- but as the Pew data shows, the way to do it right depends on whether you are appealing to Democrats or Republicans."" 6. Millennials are ""meh"" about Trump and Clinton     Fix token millennial Peter: ""As someone who witnessed the Obama craze as a college student in 2008, I was very struck by the way young people flocked to Sanders but not Trump or Clinton."" 7. The Hispanic turnout factor     Bump: Historically, Hispanic registered voters have turned out to vote at much lower rates than white voters. (The chart above, using data from the United States Elections Project, includes only non-Hispanic whites.) In fact, Hispanics vote in presidential races at about the same rate as whites do in midterms. For years, whites turned out more than any other demographic group, which helped shape American politics -- especially since whites are the largest demographic group in the country . . . . . .Pew Research already anticipated that Hispanic voters would make up more of the electorate now than in years past simply by virtue of there being more Hispanic Americans than in elections past. (This trend is one reason that the percentage of the electorate that was nonwhite in 2014 was equivalent to the percentage that was nonwhite in that 2008 election.) That's without considering a possible spike in turnout among Hispanic voters."

(Video: Reuters)     MIAMI -- Five undocumented domestic workers, all named Maria, fanned out across Little Havana delivering a desperate, last-minute plea to Hispanic voters: We can't vote, but you can. Vote early to ensure a President Trump does not deport us. In Hialeah, a traditional stronghold for Cuban American Republicans, backers of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton drove a colorful, Colombian-style chiva party bus with bongo drums and rumba dancers handing out Cuban pastries and ""Hispanics for Hillary"" signs. And in ritzy Coral Gables, Maria Ballaster, a 60-year-old Cuban American who has always voted Republican reflected on why she had just split her ballot -- sticking with her party's nominee for the U.S. Senate, Marco Rubio, while casting a vote for Clinton. ""I trust Rubio, but I don't trust Mr. Crazy,"" Ballaster said.  Here in Florida and across the country, there are early indications that Hispanics have mobilized for this election like no other in U.S. history. Activist groups and Clinton allies, motivated largely by a deepening fear of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, are deploying new voter outreach strategies and hoping to take advantage of growth in the Latino electorate. In Nevada, thousands of voters lined up outside an early-voting site at a Latino market Friday night, prompting voting hours to be extended at the end of what has been a record-breaking early-voting surge in the state. Turnout was so high in Clark County, home to Las Vegas, that Democrats enter Tuesday with an advantage similar to the one they held there four years ago when President Obama won Nevada by seven points.  Similarly heavy early-voting turnout among Hispanics in Colorado and Arizona has given Democrats hope in those battleground states, too. Early voting is not necessarily an indication of final results, given that those who have turned out so far are highly motivated and that the election will be decided by the millions more who cast ballots Tuesday. Some analysts say it is possible that Latino early voting will draw from Election Day turnout rates. Nonetheless, the increase has taken place even in states such as Texas, where Democrats have not focused on galvanizing voters. The spike appears to be the result of the rising number of Hispanic voters and the increasingly aggressive efforts to organize what has long been considered a potent voting bloc whose numbers have never lived up to their potential. Adding to the fervor is widespread anger at Trump's incendiary rhetoric about Hispanics and Mexico, suggesting that Clinton could outperform Obama's 71 percent share of the Hispanic vote from 2012. ""Trump has built a wall, indeed,"" said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster who specializes in Latino voters. ""And it is a new firewall for Democrats."" Experts who closely track Hispanic voters caution that the turnout numbers so far seem to reflect anticipated growth rates expected to continue into the 2030s. ""This year's historic turnout in some respects is not unusual,"" said Mark Lopez, Pew Research Center's director of Hispanic research. About 11.2 million Hispanics voted in 2012, representing just less than 50 percent of all eligible Latino voters. Since then, the number of eligible Hispanics has jumped by about 4 million voters, which is on par with the overall growth rates of the Hispanic population, according to Pew.      As the presidential race tightens, Democrats are going after voters in the Republican stronghold of Georgia. In Gwinnett County, a rising number of minorities could be changing the political landscape. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)   In Colorado, the steady growth of the Latino vote has fueled a narrow edge for Democrats. Obama's campaign registered thousands of Hispanics there in 2008 and 2012, and many more have been registered by Clinton's campaign and that of her Democratic primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and groups such as the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. In every part of the state, Democrats have found Latino voters who have not been active in recent elections or had voted for more moderate Republicans. Damian Alcazar, 46, was registered with the Republican Party and had backed the 2008 presidential bid of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). But by Friday night, when he stopped by a GOP get-out-the-vote rally in Aurora, he had already cast a ballot for Clinton. ""Trump's way too risky,"" he said. In Colorado Springs, the center of the state's largest Republican stronghold, Democrats were targeting and turning out Latinos. Over lunch at El Ranchito 2, a supermarket and restaurant, an entirely Latino clientele was divided between those who could not vote and those who had already voted for Clinton. ""The Democrats sent me mail, but I didn't really need it,"" said Jaime Valdez, 70. ""I was going to vote for Hillary.""    Resident Valentina Perez, 73, gets a visit from Maria Bilbao, 50, and her son Thomas Kennedy, 25, in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood as they canvass for Clinton on Friday. (Angel Valentin/For The Washington Post)  In Florida, early-voting data suggests that Hispanics are emerging as a larger force in the state's electorate -- and that many Latinos are participating for the first time. The Hispanic share of overall early voters is sharply higher this year, reaching about 15 percent from about 10 percent at this stage four years ago, according to an analysis by University of Florida political scientist Daniel A. Smith. Another examination of the numbers, by Democratic strategist Steve Schale, found that more than half of the Hispanics who have voted so far have either never voted before or voted only once previously. The diversity of the state's Hispanic electorate has long presented a challenge for campaigns in both parties. Cuban Americans, particularly in Miami, have been Republican stalwarts, though younger generations have been trending toward the Democrats. People with roots in Central America and Mexico have favored the Democrats historically. In the past, Republicans have made some inroads with the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans who have settled largely around Orlando and have been a swing bloc. Overall, the polls in Florida are tight. The Trump campaign and its allies have been working to mobilize voters in the state's more rural and conservative areas. Trump and his backers have also predicted that many Hispanics will turn out for him Tuesday. ""I don't believe the polls,"" said Nelson Diaz, the Miami-Dade County GOP chairman. ""There's been an incredible intensity for Trump and long lines in our Hispanic Republican precincts. There's a big misunderstanding of what's happening. There's a silent majority and first-time voters that the polls aren't capturing, and I think he's going to end up doing well here."" On Saturday, the Democrats' efforts to court Cuban Americans was on display in Hialeah, the heart of the exile community. In addition to the chiva bus, Clinton allies parked a van blasting hip-hop and reggaeton music. They also handed out guava pastries from a tent. Waiting for them were a group of Trump supporters who started yelling, ""Lock her up!"" The Democrats started shouting back, comparing the GOP presidential nominee to the reviled Cuban dictator: ""Castro, no! Trump tampoco!"" They also chanted another Spanish phrase that suggested Trump and Castro were funded by the Russians.    Clinton supporters rally in Miami. (Angel Valentin/For The Washington Post)  Across Miami-Dade County, Hispanics seemed to be heavily favoring Clinton. Marilyn Ralat-Albernas considered the stakes in the election so high for her Hispanic community that she took a month off work to volunteer for Clinton. Ralat-Albernas, a 62-year-old registered nurse of Puerto Rican descent, said she has spent days knocking on doors, canvassing neighborhoods, attesting to the benefits of the Affordable Care Act and proclaiming the threat posed by Trump to millions of undocumented immigrants. ""When he insulted Mexicans, he was insulting all of us,"" said Ralat-Albernas, referring to Trump's description of Mexican immigrants as rapists. ""He doesn't understand our culture. We need to come together and show him that our community is powerful."" In Florida, a network of immigrant rights organizations, unions and leftist nonprofits aligned to bring out the vote for more than a year, according to Maria Rodriguez, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition. In the past year, they knocked on 1 million doors of low- and mid-propensity voters throughout the state, nearly 60 percent of whom were Latino. In the trendy Miami Modern District, they handed out cups of Cuban coffee near a mural depicting Trump as a flying pig, to attract young Latinos to vote; they invested in ads on salsa radio stations on Pandora that encouraged listeners to vote early. They scoured areas with large Central American populations to interact with Honduran and Nicaraguan voters who are not typically targeted. The community seemed ready to engage, according to Monica Russo, executive vice president of the local Service Employees International Union. Those voters who answered the doors were already concerned with raising the federal minimum wage and immigration reform. By the time Trump captured the Republican Party's nomination, Russo said these voters were already inspired to make a difference. ""Folks don't seem afraid,"" Russo said. ""They seemed determined.""      View Graphic      Lorella Praeli, the Clinton campaign's director of Hispanic outreach, said the campaign sought to recruit ambassadors inside communities -- the owner of the local bodega or Spanish grocery and the matriarchs and abuelas who might have an affinity for electing the first female president. ""We look forward to welcoming some of the most influential Latinas in the country as we build our path to la victoria para Hillary,"" read one advertisement. ""Latinos will shape the future of our pais."" When Praeli produced the ad, she said some asked why they would publish something in the informal Spanglish. ""This is a part of our culture,"" Praeli said. ""It shows that we understand how families speak with one another."" One of the most persuasive strategies for Clinton allies has been to send undocumented workers to knock on the doors of potential Hispanic voters to explain the stakes of the election. On Friday, Maria Bilbao and her son, Tomas Kennedy, jumped into their old Mercedes with broken air conditioning to explain what a Trump presidency might mean for their family. She was one of the five undocumented Marias canvassing around Little Havana. ""To be honest, I'm not voting,"" said one woman, Maria Figueroa, 56, upon opening her door to see Bilbao and Kennedy. ""They are both liars."" Kennedy explained that he agreed the candidates were not the best, but one candidate was better than the other. ""This is my mother, and she is undocumented,"" Kennedy told her. Their family moved from Argentina in 2001, when its economy was collapsing. They were told the wait list to move legally lasted 17 years. Kennedy received a reprieve through the Obama administration's decision to shield from deportation many people who came to the country as young children. His mother is still at risk. ""If Trump is elected, we don't know what he will do,"" Kennedy continued. ""He's going to pull our family apart."" ""He is crazy,"" Bilbao added, circling one finger around her ear. Figueroa finally agreed she would vote. She wrote down the address for her polling place. ""It's true,"" Figueroa said, ""he cannot be a president."" As the sun beat down that afternoon, the Marias stood on the sidewalk and traded stories of their interactions with voters. ""I told her I cannot vote, but this country needs you to vote,"" Maria Lima said, recalling another woman she persuaded. ""Our dreams of better life rest on you."" She lifted her sunglasses to wipe the moisture from her face. It was a mixture of sweat and tears.  David Weigel in Colorado and Ed O'Keefe in Washington contributed to this report. "

(Photo by James Hohmann)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: KISSIMMEE, Fla. -- Barack Obama narrowly won Florida in 2012 by expanding the electorate. Hillary Clinton, with help from her allies, is trying to do that again in 2016.  Indicators on the ground and in the early ballot numbers suggest that many low-frequency voters, particularly Latinos, will participate in this year's election. Every poll shows that the Sunshine State, which gave the country Bush v. Gore, is once again within the margin of error. The president carried the state four years ago by less than one percentage point. Donald Trump, who has been relatively strong in Florida all year, needs the state's 29 electoral votes in any realistic scenario that gets him to 270. The attention being paid to the state reflects its special, quadrennial importance: Clinton rallies today in Tampa, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale. Trump has events scheduled tomorrow in Miami, Orlando, Pensacola and then, on Thursday morning, in Jacksonville. Pro-Clinton forces undeniably have a better ground game than pro-Trump forces, which were slow to ramp up. It is helpful to think of get-out-the-vote operations like a special teams unit in football. It will not win you the game if you're down a few touchdowns, but it can make the difference at the end of a close matchup. Right now, Clinton really just needs a field goal to block Trump's path to the presidency. But it's not totally clear how many yards she has to kick the ball. That is why the kind of canvassing work that Leticia Nieves is doing in this working-class suburb of Orlando could prove pivotal. Two months ago, the 37-year-old was unemployed and living in Mount Pocono, Pa., when she saw an ad offering $15 an hour to knock on doors in Florida. Now she is one of nearly 500 paid canvassers working in Florida for the Center for Community Change Action. The progressive group has spent the past four months targeting a very specific universe of 384,000 Florida Latinos. They are low-propensity voters who are likely to support Democrats. That means they are registered but have either never participated or only cast a ballot in one of the previous four elections (typically the presidential in either 2012 or 2008).    Mobilization matters more right now than persuasion. This sign hangs in the group's field office. (James Hohmann)   I spent a shift shadowing Nieves, who was born in the Bronx and spent her teenage years in Puerto Rico, as she tried to convince about a hundred folks that they should vote in 2016. Speaking their native Spanish, she was an effective messenger -- but it also seemed to be a surprisingly easy sell. Edgardo Casiano, a cable technician who is registered to vote but has not done so since moving to Florida, initially said he was supporting Trump when Nieves knocked on his door. His wife walked up from behind and smacked him on the arm. She told the visitors at her door that he was just joking around, and that they both support Clinton. ""If he doesn't vote for Hillary, I will divorce him! Seriously,"" said Marlin Colon, a Mary Kay beauty consultant, as their two kids watched TV in the living room. The conversation that followed with the 29-year-olds showed the value of these face-to-face encounters -- and the challenges of mobilizing hard-to-reach voters. The husband said he would go online to vote early. Nieves had to explain that you cannot vote on the Internet but must do so in person. That surprised him. She told him exactly where he could go and talked about how easy it was. ""Anytime from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.,"" she said. Then the wife, who loves the idea of Clinton being the first woman president, spoke up to say she filled out paperwork with someone at the mall so she could vote, but she received a letter from the board of elections saying that her registration did not go through because the Social Security number on her form was invalid. She wondered if it was too late to vote this year. The canvasser gave her the website and phone number for the local elections office and urged her to follow up as soon as possible.    Leticia Nieves knocks on 40 doors before allowing herself a drink of water at the start of her canvassing shift. It keeps her focused and motivated. (James Hohmann)   And so it went for much of Nieves's six hours at the door last Friday, from 2 p.m. until nearly 8 p.m. These low-propensity voters were incredibly enthusiastic about voting, but they often did not know basic information about how or where to do it. She explained patiently the requirement to bring a photo ID and why it is important to not just vote for the presidential candidates but also in the U.S. Senate race. Many of the conversations were in Spanglish. Past a Honduran pupuseria and a Dollar Store, in a modest subdivision of single-family homes, one middle-aged woman hesitantly cracked open her door. Suspiciously eyeing her visitors, she asked: ""Are you a Democrat?"" When Nieves said yes, the door opened wide and the woman smiled broadly. She said she already voted for Clinton. Then she fretted that her 27-year-old daughter does not see the point. ""We need to push her because she is lazy,"" her mother said with a sigh. ""So lazy!"" She promised that she would keep nagging her daughter, who still lives at home, until she votes. Nieves next persuaded a man named Jose, who works in the service industry, to vote early. He said he would go on Tuesday, his day off. A few houses later, a man who has not voted since the 2008 election said he will definitely vote for Clinton. ""If I opened the garage, you'd see a bumper sticker for Hillary,"" he said. ""No Trump, no Trump, no Trump,"" an apron-clad woman named Consuela, who was preparing a dinner of chicken and chickpeas for her grandchildren, said on the next block. An Ecuadoran immigrant in her late 70s answered the door in a bathrobe. ""You can leave whatever you want as long as it is not for that crazy loon,"" she said in Spanish, referring to Trump, when she saw the pile of political brochures in Nieves's hand. ""I am for Hillary,"" the canvasser replied. Then the woman's husband, Humberto Nunes, came to the door and heard the pitch. The couple agreed to go vote for Clinton and Senate candidate Patrick Murphy first thing the next morning.    The Center for Community Change Action field office in Kissimmee, which used to be an Einstein's bagel shop, proudly flies a Puerto Rican flag. It's next to a gold buyer's shop and shares a parking lot with a mini-golf course. (James Hohmann)   -- The influx of Latinos into the Orlando area has been dramatic. Kissimmee is in Osceola County. In 2004, George W. Bush beat John Kerry in this county by five points. In 2012, Obama crushed Mitt Romney by 25 points. Many Puerto Ricans fleeing the debt crisis in the U.S. territory have settled here. They are already American citizens so can easily register to vote in Florida. The state's Puerto Rican population, in excess of 1 million people, has doubled over 15 years. Experts say 1,000 new Puerto Rican families are resettling in the state every month. Kissimmee is in Alan Grayson's House district. Grayson vacated the seat to unsuccessfully seek the Democratic nomination for Senate. He threw his support behind his wife in the open primary to succeed him, but she lost to a Puerto Rican state senator. It is just the latest way that an emerging community is flexing its muscle.  -- Various efforts to register new voters have already paid off for the left. Only 45 percent of the 493,000 people who have registered to vote in Florida since the start of August are white. Democrats expanded their voter registration advantage by almost 70,000 over the course of the summer, so they go into this election with a 327,000 registration advantage statewide. -- A surprising number of low-propensity voters have voted early so far. About 3.73 million ballots have already been cast in Florida, compared to a total of 8.5 million votes that were cast in 2012, including on Election Day. More than 400,000 of the registered Democrats who have voted early have either not voted in the past three elections or voted just once. Among Republicans, that number is 336,000. Of the nearly 200,000 registered Hispanic Democrats who have already voted, 50 percent fall into that category. Through the weekend, 70 percent of early voters have been white, compared to 14 percent Hispanic and 11 percent African American. (Hispanics account for about 16 percent of Florida's registered voters.) Mobilizing the voters who are with you is far more important than persuading new ones to support you at this point. ""This is a state all about managing these micro margins,"" said Steve Schale, a Tallahassee-based operative who directed Obama's efforts in Florida and has been crunching these numbers every day. ""She has a one-point to 1.5-point demographic advantage built in. The blocking and tackling at the doors ... is where we are at in this election. It's a huge funnel of people. You're just trying to get as many people out of the bottom as possible."" -- The Florida canvassers with Center for Community Change Action have faced off with humidity and Hurricane Matthew. When the Zika virus became a problem, the door knockers who work out of the three offices in Miami-Dade County got extra rations of mosquito repellant. They have learned many lessons during four months on the ground. When they first started knocking on doors in June, the walkers carried fliers that included a big picture of Trump. It was an unflattering image, but they discovered that it made the Hispanics less likely to engage. Seeing the picture and not speaking English, they assumed the people coming to their door were representatives from the Trump campaign. Trump's image now does not appear in any of their materials. Nieves said she was chased by dogs in one development recently. In another, someone anonymously called the cops on her. Organizers are advised not to wear black, gold or red -- to avoid being mistaken as somehow affiliated with area street gangs. She goes with the noncontroversial color gray. -- CCCA has similar, but smaller, programs to drive low-propensity turnout in Nevada and Colorado. Using the most sophisticated social science research on social pressure, the group is experimenting with various efforts to make sure these voters follow through when they commit to vote. During phone banks, canvassers do what they call ""catch-and-release calls."" If someone agrees to vote, they are asked to record a brief message about why it is important. Before Election Day, they receive an automated call and the message is replayed to them. Mailers are going out in the days before the election that detail their voting history in comparison to their neighbors. This makes people uncomfortable, but it is effective. ""Most campaigns don't want to invest the money to get the hardest voters,"" said Chris Torres, the national campaign director for the group's Immigrant Voter Project. ""Everything we're doing is additive to what the campaign is going to be doing.""    Hillary Clinton campaigns in Cleveland yesterday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   -- The Clinton campaign, which cannot coordinate with these groups, has carefully customized its own pitch for Latinos. Its field office in Kissimmee opened in August and is full of bilingual staffers. You cannot listen to Spanish-language radio stations here without hearing ads from Clinton about Puerto Rico's debt crisis. The campaign took special care to get the accent of the narrator just right. (The speaker in Clinton's ad in Miami has a Cuban accent.) Trump has run no ads in Spanish. The communications team has also worked to pitch stories to Puerto Rican newspapers, in hopes that the people who have moved to Orlando still read their traditional news sources from San Juan. In places such as Arizona and Nevada, which have large numbers of Mexican Americans, Clinton's ads emphasize Trump's promise to build a border wall. If you listen carefully, that's not part of the Clinton paid media in Florida. Puerto Ricans are already citizens, and the wall is not a concern for the Cuban community. But many are offended by other insensitive remarks Trump has made about the broader community. -- One week out from Election Day, a red flag for Brooklyn: Nationally, early voting has increased sharply among Hispanics -- a sign that anti-Trump backlash will indeed materialize at the polls. ""But African Americans are turning out in smaller numbers than they did with Obama on the ticket,"" Dave Weigel reports. ""Early returns show a boost in turnout in heavily Latino counties and a decline in largely African American ones (in Florida). In a state such as Nevada, where Democrats are relying heavily on Latinos, early returns show they are voting in similar numbers as in 2012, boosting Democratic chances. But in battleground states such as Ohio where Democrats are counting on African Americans to put them over the top, they could be in trouble....""

He insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire. ... But newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the [IRS] would most likely declare it improper if he were audited. Thanks to this one now-outlawed maneuver, Trump potentially escaped paying tens of millions of dollars in federal personal income taxes. Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents ... said Mr. Trump's tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time.

But Republicans remain on the defensive, and Democrats have many routes to gaining the four seats they need.... The reemergence of Hillary Clinton's email issue puts the former secretary of state on the defensive and gives ammunition to GOP House and Senate candidate.... The Republicans' problem is that, unless they win the Nevada Senate race, they'll need to win at least four of the five tightest contests.... Comey's letter ... gives GOP strategists reason for hope, and a race-by-race assessment ... suggests that anything from a Democratic gain of as few as three to as many as eight seats is possible. But given the much greater Republican vulnerability, Democrat gains of four to seven seats now looks most likely. And that would flip the Senate."" -- Democrats filed lawsuits in Arizona, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania, alleging that Trump, Republican state parties and militia groups led by vocal Trump supporter Roger Stone are conspiring to intimidate and block minorities from voting.

Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.' It maintained that Trump 'and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.' It claimed that Russian intelligence had 'compromised' Trump during his visits to Moscow and could 'blackmail him.'

Corn broke Mitt Romney's 47 percent tape four years ago for the liberal magazine. -- But, but, but: Law enforcement officials insist that no investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct links between Trump and the Russian government, the New York Times reports.

""But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display. Despite her faults, Mrs Clinton is eminently qualified...""    Hillary Clinton on her plane in Cleveland. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)   THE LATEST ON THE NEWLY DISCOVERED EMAILS: -- The Justice Department tried (and failed) to quell outrage and frenetic speculation surrounding James Comey's Friday disclosure that the FBI resumed its investigation of Clinton's private email server. From Sari Horwitz, Tom Hamburger and Ellen Nakashima: ""The department signaled that it now wants the politically charged investigation to follow standard procedures, including a strict limit on official comments about the probe and the provision of updates to Congress through routine channels. But after Comey's highly unusual disclosure last week ... it may prove impossible for Justice to lower the temperature and regain control over how the investigation is conducted and depicted to the public."" -- Lawmakers who pressed Comey for details -- including the number of emails involved, and when FBI officials will know how many emails are duplicates -- received a lame, three-paragraph note in response. ""We assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,"" the DOJ liaison to Congress wrote. -- The Clinton campaign accused Comey of practicing a ""double standard"" after CNBC reported that he delayed the release of an FBI statement blaming the Russians for seeking to influence the presidential race on the grounds that it would be ""too close to the election."" From John Wagner, Jenna Johnson and Abby Phillip: ""There is no case,"" Clinton herself declared during a campaign stop in Ohio, predicting that the new inquiry will reach the same conclusion as the FBI investigation in July.  -- Criticism of Comey continued to mount, with both Democrats and Republicans amplifying demands that he and Attorney General Loretta Lynch provide a more detailed account of the investigation. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said the amount of detail in Comey's Friday letter ""did not go far enough"" and was thus unfair to all parties involved: ""Unfortunately, your letter failed to give Congress and the American people enough context to evaluate the significance or full meaning of this development,"" he wrote. ""Without additional context, your disclosure is not fair to Congress, the American people, or Secretary Clinton."" (Tom Hamburger) -- Huma Abedin has told colleagues that she was ""taken aback"" when she learned that the FBI found her emails on a laptop belonging to her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, and doesn't know how the messages got there. (Politico's Josh Gerstein) -- ""Comey Role Recalls Hoover's F.B.I., Fairly or Not,"" by the New York Times's Scott Shane and Sharon LaFraniere: ""Since [Obama] named [Comey] director of the F.B.I. in 2013, the 6-foot-8 former prosecutor has spoken often of dark chapters in the bureau's history, notably J. Edgar Hoover's order to wiretap the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and use the tapes to try to drive the civil rights leader to suicide. 'The reason I do those things,' Mr. Comey [once said], 'is to ensure that we remember our mistakes and that we learn from them.' His point: The nation's leading law enforcement agency must preserve investigations from any taint of political motive or extralegal influence. So it may be especially painful to Mr. Comey that today ... some critics and historians are comparing him to Hoover. The parallels to Hoover, who ran the F.B.I. and its predecessor from 1924 to 1972 as a fief that reflected his personal and political views, may be quite a stretch. Indeed, it may be his determination to be the anti-Hoover, transparent and above politics, that has gotten Mr. Comey in hot water.""

Trump holds up a rainbow flag with ""LGBTs for TRUMP"" written on it at a campaign rally in Greeley. (Reuters/Carlo Allegri)   THE DAILY DONALD: -- Trump has flip-flopped several times on whether or not he voted for George W. Bush, according to newly unearthed audio from CNN: In 2009, he agreed with radio host Don Imus when he told him he didn't vote for Bush: ""I didn't either, by the way,"" Trump reassured him. ""You're good. I just thought that guy was a dimwit. You looked at it, and he just didn't look like he was all there. You look at his eyes, I mean he'd make a speech and you'd look at him and you'd say, 'Does he even know what he's reading?' This guy, he was a horrible president,"" said Trump. Four years earlier, however, he claimed the exact opposite: ""I voted for Bush because I think he's got certain things that are excellent, including a tax policy that's excellent and going to prove to be excellent,"" Trump told Bill O'Reilly in 2005. As recently as January of this year, Trump said he voted for Bush in both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. (Andrew Kaczynski) -- Trump is refusing to pay his own campaign pollster three quarters of a million dollars, with FEC filings showing the campaign is disputing nearly $767,000 owed to veteran pollster Tony Fabrizio. (Matea Gold) -- The Trump Organization executive charged with overseeing development on the Old Post Office hotel in D.C. stayed through construction of the project -- but quit one day after it opened. David Orowitz, who worked for the company for eight years, declined to offer details on his departure. (Jonathan O'Connell) -- A defense attorney, in closing arguments, blasted Trump transition chairman Chris Christie and his inner circle as ""COWARDS"" for not testifying in the Bridgegate trial. From the AP's David Porter: ""In an emotional presentation ... Michael Critchley cast client Bridget Kelly as a single mother faced with an administration more concerned with keeping Christie's nascent presidential hopes alive than with exposing the truth when details of the scandal surfaced three years ago. In a rebuttal summation, a prosecutor urged jurors to ignore the insinuations about Christie and others and focus on the evidence against the two defendants, which he called 'devastating.' Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, a former Port Authority executive, both face up to 20 years in prison on the most serious counts."" -- The Trump campaign said the candidate will be disciplined and focused on talking about Obamacare today, specifically at a joint 11 a.m. appearance with Mike Pence in Valley Forge, Pa. Also scheduled to attend the event: Ben Carson, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.), Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), Rep. Mike Burgess (R-Tex.), Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.).    WHAT PUNDITS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE FBI MELODRAMA: -- ""If anything, it's easier to gauge the impact of this development on the atmosphere in Washington AFTER the election,"" writes Wall Street Journal bureau chief Gerald F. Seib. ""It's bound to make what already figured to be a nasty environment even worse. Let's assume the Comey bombshell produces some dramatic change in the race and opens the way to a Trump victory. Democrats, not Mr. Trump, will be the ones charging the system was rigged and the election stolen.... On the other hand, if the development is insufficient to derail what appeared to be a Clinton march toward victory, Republicans ... already have served notice that they will launch from there a series of investigations into the newly disclosed trove of Clinton emails and why they weren't discovered previously. In that case, the acrimony of an angry campaign will carry into a new administration and a new Congress."" -- The Post's Editorial Board urges voters to stay calm and, in a modified version of the Hippocratic Oath, do no further harm. ""[This] consists in large part of recalling what we already know: that Ms. Clinton, foolishly and arrogantly, ignored State Department guidelines and used a personal email server while working as secretary of state. That a thorough FBI investigation found no harm to national security in the practice, virtually no mishandling of classified information.... At this point, there is no reason to believe that new emails, if any, would be inconsistent with the story that has emerged. Meanwhile, here's something else we know: Mr. Trump is the least qualified and most dangerous major-party nominee for president in our lifetimes.... Nothing Mr. Comey said Friday changes that, either."" --  Richard Nixon's former White House lawyer, John Dean, blasts Trump for comparing the email scandal to Watergate: ""Whatever mistakes Mrs. Clinton made, her actions bear no similarities whatsoever to Nixon's criminalization of his presidency, and his efforts to corrupt much of the executive branch,"" he writes in a New York Times op-ed. ""To compare them to Watergate is more than historical ignorance."" -- Hillary must commit to preserving White House records if elected, argues Timothy Naftali, former director of the Nixon Presidential Library: ""Should she win, as it still seems likely she will, Mrs. Clinton ought to consider taking very public steps, very soon, to reassure Americans of her commitment to the protection of official records and transparency. No one wants to have to worry that some of her future White House electronic records will go missing,"" he writes in a Times op-ed. -- The New York Times' Editorial Board calls the news sadly fitting: ""In an election that has featured the obliteration of one long-accepted political or social norm after another, it is sadly fitting that one of the final and perhaps most consequential acts was to undermine the American people's trust in the nation's top law enforcement agencies."" -- The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza offers a counterpoint: ""What the anti-Comey arguments ignore is that if Lynch (and Obama) had maintained a more scrupulously non-partisan approach over the last two years, Comey perhaps would not have had to insert himself as publicly as he has in order to defend the FBI from allegations of political interference. Comey became the face of the investigation, to the public and to Congress, because his superiors -- Obama and Lynch -- could not. It's far better for the public to have this information now than after the election. Perhaps it's possible that this revelation will swing the election to Trump. But it seems highly unlikely. ... Clinton is still favored to win, and, if she does, Comey will have done her a favor."" WAPO HIGHLIGHT: -- ""U.S. plans operation against Islamic State in Syria despite obstacles,"" by Missy Ryan and Karen DeYoung: ""The Obama administration is racing to settle questions that could scuttle a planned offensive against the Islamic State in the Syrian city of Raqqa that Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has said will begin 'within weeks.' Senior administration officials have attributed the newly described urgency to Raqqa's symbolic role as the 'capital of the caliphate' claimed by the militants and intelligence indicating that it is the center of Islamic State planning for terrorist attacks in Europe and the U.S. But the officials acknowledged a wealth of problems that could derail the offensive, including the need to gather and train additional Syrian forces. More ominously, they cite the explosive dynamics between two allies: Turkey and Syrian Kurdish fighters, who form the bulk of the existing offensive force. ... 'This is one of the situations in which we have contacts and influence over all the actors,' said one official. 'But we're not in perfect control.'""
