Because of Bernie Sanders.	"   Sen. Bernie Sanders  (I-Vt.) stands behind Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Nov. 16 on Capitol Hill. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)  Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) says he's backing a Minnesota congressman to lead the Democratic National Committee for a simple reason: because Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) likes him. Schumer, in an interview Friday, said he's supporting a bid by Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to run the DNC because he comes with the support of Sanders, a key liberal voice in the Senate who also earned a spot this past week on Schumer's new 10-senator leadership team. Schumer is set to become the first New Yorker and first Jewish man to serve as a Senate leader and has been a staunch defender of Israel throughout his four decades in public service. But Ellison has been an outspoken critic of Israel and its relationship with Palestinians in the past. Earlier in his career, Ellison apologized for or withdrew a number of controversial statements, including likening former president George W. Bush's consolidation of power after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks to the rise of Adolf Hitler, to defending the leader of the Nation of Islam, to labeling his own 2012 reelection opponent a ""lowlife scumbag.""   [Keith Ellison would be a bold pick for DNC chair -- and a controversial one]   Some of those moves would seem to put him at odds with Schumer, his strong support for Israel and the strong support he enjoys from Jewish voters across New York. ""I'm not worried about the Israel stuff even though he and I disagree,"" Schumer said Friday when asked about Ellison's past statements. Schumer said that Ellison came highly recommended by Sanders. The two senators have known each other since they attended James Madison High School together while growing up in Brooklyn. (That same school also graduated Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and former senator Norm Coleman (R-Minn.).) After the Democratic presidential primaries that Sanders lost to Hillary Clinton, ""Bernie said we need an organizing tool. We can't win the wars,"" Schumer said. ""Our issues are right, although they should be bolder and more progressive, he would say, but we need organizing and not just during presidential campaign. So we thought maybe the [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] should do some of that, assuming Hillary was going to win. When the DNC [chairman's job] opened up, he called me and said we need to make the DNC not a fundraising and political organization but a true organizing tool. I said, you're exactly right."" Whether that's exactly how it transpired may be up for dispute, but either way, Schumer, Sanders, outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and other top Democrats have quickly endorsed Ellison's bid. The DNC has yet to set a date for the chairman's election, which is expected to happen sometime next year. Other Democrats are also in the running, including former Vermont governor Howard Dean; Henry Munoz III, the DNC's finance chairman; outgoing Labor Secretary Tom Perez; and Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley said this week he's no longer going to run for the job. Party rules currently dictate that the DNC chairman must be a full-timer. Former chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was able to hold the job on a part-time basis while serving as a Florida congresswoman because President Obama appointed her to the job and, well, presidents get to break the party rules. Dean has cited the full-timer rule as a reason why someone like Ellison shouldn't be picked to serve. But Schumer said Friday that Ellison shouldn't need to step down from his House seat to lead the party. ""No, I don't believe that. He's a very good organizer, and I think Bernie will have a lot of say in the DNC, which I welcome, and they will find good full-time organizers,"" Schumer said. ""I said to [Ellison], the number one person you should hire who is the executive director should be the best organizer we can find, and he agreed."""

The drone, named ""Quad copter"", was targeted after it intruded 60 meters inside Pakistan along the Line of Control in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, the army spokesman Lt. Gen. Asim Saleem Bajwa said. His statement added that the drone fell near a Pakistani post and troops seized it. There was no immediate comment from the Indian army. The latest development came after police said the cross-border firing had killed four villagers. Mohammad Shafqat, a police official from Pakistan's part of Kashmir, said three members of a family were among those four people who were killed on Saturday. A fourth person who was critically wounded this week died at a hospital, he said. Pakistan's army also confirmed the account, saying its troops were returning fire and were carrying out a ""befitting response"" after coming under attack. However, an Indian army officer blamed Pakistan for initiating the firing, and also described the Indian troops' response as ""befitting"". The officer spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to brief reporters. Although such shootouts are common, the latest came a day after Pakistan's navy said it had intercepted Indian submarines entering the country's territorial waters in the Arabian sea. India quickly denied the claim. Pakistan's foreign ministry spokesman, Nafees Zakaria, posted a tweet to express his sympathies for those who lost their loved ones in the cross-border firing. Pakistan has said India is escalating tension to divert the world community's attention from its human rights violations in Indian-controlled Kashmir, and says its army responds with restraint when under attack. Elsewhere in the country, gunmen shot and killed two paramilitary soldiers and a police officer in the southwestern city of Quetta on Saturday, according to a statement released by the Frontier Corps force. ___ Associated Press writer Roshan Mughal in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, contributed to this report.

Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller on Sunday said the report of shots fired was received Saturday morning, when about 500 people were demonstrating outside a work yard for the pipeline in Mandan, a community adjacent to the state capital of Bismarck and about 50 miles north from an area where hundreds of protesters have been camping in for months. No one was injured in the incident. Keller says authorities are trying to determine who fired the weapon. Nobody was arrested during Saturday's protest. The four-state, 1,200-mile pipeline is complete except for under the Missouri River in North Dakota. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Advocates of LGBT rights and abortion rights now fear setbacks instead of further gains. But the outcome emboldened the anti-abortion movement and breathed new life into the religious right's campaign for broad exemptions from same-sex marriage and other laws. Kelly Shackelford, head of First Liberty Institute, a legal group that specializes in religious freedom cases, said that, for his cause, the environment will transform from ""brutal"" under the Obama administration to friendly given GOP control of both Congress and the White House. His clients include two Christian bakers in Oregon who were fined for refusing to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding.  ""Many of us who fight for religious freedom have felt in the last four or even eight years there was a lot of overreaching that was wrong,"" said Shackelford, who was among hundreds of religious conservatives who met with Trump last June. ""To have someone who is president-elect, who says I'm going to put an end to this ... we're going to go back to a country built on religious freedom. That makes us very hopeful."" Among the election's repercussions will be a renewed campaign, in state legislatures and in Congress, to pass tough anti-abortion legislation. Religious conservatives will press for far-reaching conscience protections and a repeal of regulations they said violated their religious liberty. And the push to let transgender students use the bathroom of their choice at school, strongly backed by President Barack Obama, may wither in the face of GOP resistance.  ""There's no question a lot of transgender students and their parents woke up Wednesday morning really scared,"" said Sarah McBride, a 26-year-old transgender activist who is national press secretary for the LGBT-rights group the Human Rights Campaign. ""I'm feeling the way a lot of folks are feeling -- worried that the heart of this country isn't big enough to love us, too."" McBride in July became the first openly transgender person to address a national political convention when she spoke to the Democrats' gathering in Philadelphia. Comparable worries surfaced among abortion-rights supporters.  ""My colleagues across the country are deeply disheartened,"" said Dr. Willie Parker, an Alabama-based physician who provides abortions in three Southern states. He predicts intensified efforts to lay the groundwork for a challenge of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion.  ""We're disappointed, but not defeated,"" said Parker. ""Like the civil rights movement, we're in it for the long haul."" Anti-abortion leaders initially were wary of Trump, who in the past had supported abortion rights. They rallied behind him -- and launched a massive door-knocking campaign in several battleground states -- after he pledged to support several of their key goals. These include defunding of Planned Parenthood, a ban on most late-term abortions, and the appointment of Supreme Court justices who might weaken or reverse Roe v. Wade. Marjorie Dannensfelser, leader of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List, hailed the GOP sweep as ""an historic moment for the pro-life movement,"" putting its goals within reach. Yet some wariness remained.  ""We are well aware that promises are not deeds,"" said Troy Newman, the president of Operation Rescue. ""We will work to hold the new administration's feet to the fire throughout Trump's presidency, to ensure that promises are kept."" Planned Parenthood, whose services include birth control, sex education and abortions, has been a longtime target of Republican politicians, and is now bracing for intensified challenges.  ""There are almost no words to capture the threat that this election result poses,"" said the organization's president, Cecile Richards. ""We will not give up, we will not back down."" On social media, many women were broaching the option of acquiring long-lasting intrauterine devices as their form of birth control, on the possibility that birth-control pills would no longer be available free if Obama's health care act is repealed.   The GOP triumph was a heavy blow to the Human Rights Campaign and other gay-rights organizations which had worked vigorously on behalf of Hillary Clinton. They embraced her campaign as unprecedented in the breadth of its outreach to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.  ""It hurts,"" said Rachel Tiven, CEO of the LGBT-rights group Lambda Legal. ""Our beautiful, slowly improving, two-steps-forward-one-step-back country took a giant step backward."" LGBT activists are now wondering if same-sex marriage -- legalized nationwide by a 2015 Supreme Court ruling -- is in jeopardy given the prospect of Trump appointing conservative justices who might reconsider that decision. Activists also are worried by news that Ken Blackwell, a former Cincinnati mayor, was being tapped to handle domestic issues for Trump's transition team. Blackwell is a senior fellow with the Family Research Council, a staunch foe of same-sex marriage and other LGBT-rights causes. On same-sex marriage and other issues, the Obama years brought one defeat after another for religious conservatives, who saw the president and his supporters on an inexorable march to curtail the rights of people of faith. Liberals considered these fears overblown and said the First Amendment already offered significant protection for religious groups. But conservative Christians were deeply anxious about their future. Their only major victory came when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled two years ago in favor of Hobby Lobby, the Christian-owned arts and crafts chains with faith objections to the birth control coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act. Now, advocates see a transformed landscape.  ""We now have more equilibrium between the so-called competing sides -- between the LGBT rights movement and the religious freedom proponents,"" said Tim Schultz of the 1st Amendment Partnership, a Washington-based group which advocates for religious exemptions. In a letter last month to Catholics, Trump decried what he called hostility to religious freedom and pledged, ""I will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, business owners and academic institutions."" During the campaign, he promised to repeal the Johnson Amendment, an IRS rule barring pastors from endorsing candidates from the pulpit. Due to the election results, Schultz expects the Justice Department will be friendlier to religious conservatives, and Congress more willing to enact legislation that advances conscience protections. Retired Navy Chaplain Wes Modder, a Pentecostal minister, was the target of a complaint that he was disrespectful in counseling gay sailors when discussing his religious opposition to same-sex relationships. The First Liberty Institute took him on as a client and successfully challenged the complaint as a violation of Modder's religious freedom. The case became a rallying cry for Christian conservatives upset about the Obama administration's support for LGBT rights.  ""No military chaplain should have to go through what I went through,"" Modder said of his fight to avoid being ousted from the Navy. Modder, among military veterans who met with Trump in September, said he was very hopeful that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a religious conservative, will advance policies that would prevent recurrences of what happened to him. Trump ""understands the importance of religious liberty,"" said Modder, who recently retired from the military to become a pastor in Chicago. ""The team that he is assembling, the people he is surrounding himself with, I think are going to give him the right messaging."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The prosecution has called 27 witnesses as it lays out its case against Michael Slager in the April 2015 shooting death of Walter Scott as he ran from a traffic stop. Testimony resumes Monday with the court observing Veterans Day on Friday. The final witness of the week was Lt. Charles Ghent of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, who described interviewing the defendant after the shooting. Ghent says Slager described being afraid for his life and shooting after Scott got control of his stun gun. Ghent said he was one of the SLED officers who later arrested Slager after showing him a bystander's cellphone video of Scott being shot in the back. ___ 3:10 p.m. The brother of Walter Scott says he was worried when Scott bought a 1990 Mercedes Benz because he lived in North Charleston, South Carolina, which is known for profiling black motorists. Anthony Scott took the stand Thursday at the trial of Michael Slager, the white former North Charleston patrolman charged in the death of Walter Scott. The motorist was shot and killed while running from a traffic stop in April of 2015. Anthony Scott says he worried that his brother, who was in the process of buying the car at the time he was shot, had fallen behind in child support payments. The day of the shooting Anthony Scott said he went to the scene of the shooting and saw his brother's car. As he testified: ""When I saw the vehicle and I saw the tape around the car I knew it wasn't a good scene."" Scott also testified about how his family learned about a cellphone video made by a bystander, which captured dramatic footage of Slager shooting Scott. ___ 12:20 p.m. An expert is testifying that there was no DNA from a former white police officer found under the fingernails of a black South Carolina motorist who was fatally shot while fleeing a traffic stop. Samuel Stewart of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division testified Thursday during the murder trial of fired North Charleston patrolman Michael Slager, who was videotaped shooting Walter Scott. The defense contends the two men struggled over Slager's stun gun before fleeing the scene. But Stewart testified that DNA from the dead man's fingernails contained none of Slager's DNA. An analysis of the Taser was less conclusive. Stewart testified that there was a mixture of the DNA of two individuals on the weapon and that DNA from both Slager and Scott could not be ruled out. Stewart said blood stains on Slager's uniform shirt and pants also were analyzed. He testified that the blood contained Slager's own DNA, and that while there was another person's DNA, there was not enough of it to analyze its source. ___ 10:20 a.m. A state crime scene investigator says there was nothing nefarious about officers swabbing a Taser for DNA but not taking fingerprints from the stun gun an officer used before shooting an unarmed black motorist who was running away. Almon Brown, who works for the State Law Enforcement Division, testified at the murder trial of fired North Charleston officer Michael Slager on Thursday that the weapon was processed according to lab protocol. Brown, who combed the scene for evidence following the April 2015 shooting death of Walter Scott, says there is no doubt from the evidence that there was a struggle between Scott and Slager. The defense earlier questioned Brown about why no fingerprints were taken from the officer's Taser, which the defense contends Scott got control of before the shooting. A dramatic cellphone video seen worldwide shows Scott running away without the spent Taser and falling to the ground dozens of feet away from Slager after being shot five times in the back. ___ 3:20 a.m. The prosecution is calling witnesses for a sixth day in the murder trial of a former South Carolina police officer charged in the death of a black motorist. Former North Charleston patrolman Michael Slager is charged in the shooting of 50-year-old Walter Scott as he ran from a traffic stop in April 2015. Cellphone video that captured Scott being shot in the back stunned the nation. As testimony begins Thursday, the prosecution has called 23 witnesses to lay out its case that although Slager may have been provoked by Scott running away, there was no justification for shooting him five times. The defense has countered that the investigation was botched. Defense attorney Andy Savage noted Wednesday that people using a toy metal detector found bullets at the scene missed by state investigators. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Thank -- or blame -- the Founding Fathers for creating the possibility of a so-called ""divergent election"" when they set up the Electoral College. A look at how and why the U.S. selects its presidents this way: ___ ORIGINS The Electoral College was devised at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It was a compromise meant to strike a balance between those who wanted popular elections for president and those who wanted no public input. Alexander Hamilton wrote, ""If the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent."" At the time, the country had just 13 states, and the founders were worried about one state exercising outsized influence, according to a white paper from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Small states were worried that states with large populations would have extra sway. Southern states with slaves who couldn't vote worried that Northern states would have a louder voice. There were concerns that people in one state wouldn't know much about candidates from other states. The logistics of a national election were daunting. The thinking was that if candidates had to win multiple states rather than just the popular vote, they would have to attract broader support. ___ HOW IT WORKS The electoral system has been tweaked over the years, but the gist endures. The president is selected by a ""college"" of 538 electors from the states. Each state gets as many electoral votes as it has members of Congress, and the District of Columbia gets three. To be elected president, the winner must get at least half the total plus one -- or 270 electoral votes. Most states give all their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins the state's popular vote. So while Clinton is leading Trump in votes nationwide 47.7 percent to 47.5 percent, Trump's total in the Electoral College stands at 279, with races in Michigan, New Hampshire and Arizona yet to be called. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore narrowly won the popular vote but lost to Republican George W. Bush in the Electoral College 271-266. Overall, there have been four such cases of divergent elections. ___ THE PROS A lot has changed since the Electoral College system was established, making many of the original reasons for its existence outdated: The U.S. now manages to run national elections quite well. Voters nationwide have no shortage of information about candidates. Slavery no longer exists. But there are still concerns that small states and rural areas would be ignored in favor of those with bigger populations if the race hinged strictly on the popular vote. ___ THE CONS In 1967, a commission of the American Bar Association recommended that the Electoral College system be scrapped, finding it to be ""archaic, undemocratic, complex, ambiguous and dangerous."" Fifty years later, critics are still complaining, arguing that the system results in huge swaths of the country being ignored while candidates focus on a dozen or so battleground states.  ""It's a terrible system,"" says George C. Edwards III, a Texas A&M professor who's written a book on the subject. Edwards tracks every campaign stop by the major candidates, and he says big states that are sure to vote for one candidate or another -- say, California for the Democrats or Texas for the Republicans -- now get completely ignored, and small states largely get overlooked, too. ___ IS CHANGE AFOOT? Don't count on it. Republicans have benefited the most from the system in recent years, and they're in control of Congress. However, there is an effort underway to get around the winner-take-all aspects of the system without abolishing the Electoral College. A group called National Popular Vote is pushing an interstate compact under which states would pledge to deliver all their electoral votes to the nationwide winner of the popular vote. Over the past decade, 11 states have approved such a bill. John Koza, chairman of the group, is quick to point out that both Trump and Clinton are on record in recent years saying the system is flawed. He's hopeful Trump's election won't make Republicans less amenable to changing it.  ""We're talking about a policy change that's largely dictated by the need to create a 50-state campaign for president instead of a 12-state campaign for president,"" says Koza. ___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Few presidential candidates attracted as much A-list support as did former first lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But rallies in Ohio with LeBron James, Beyonce and Jay Z did not prevent Republican rival and President-elect Donald Trump from prevailing in a state President Barack Obama had won twice. A joyous election eve gathering in Philadelphia, featuring a performance by Bruce Springsteen, did not prevent Clinton from losing Pennsylvania, where no Republican had won since 1988. Meanwhile, Trump's notable guests in the days leading up to his stunning victory included rocker Ted Nugent, whose last top 20 album came out in 1980. The Democratic National Convention featured appearances by Meryl Streep, Katy Perry, Lena Dunham and many others. One of Trump's few celebrity endorsers at the Republican gathering was Scott Baio of ""Happy Days"" fame. And it didn't seem to matter.  ""The overwhelming majority of voters know who they're going to vote for long before the election and don't decide based on celebrity endorsements,"" says Jon Wiener, a history professor at the University of California, Irvine whose books include ""How We Forgot The Cold War"" and ""Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files.""  ""I know it's hard to believe but there were more powerful political forces at work in Pennsylvania than Bruce Springsteen."" On Thursday, celebrities themselves were still absorbing the election's results. Actress Kyra Sedgwick, a self-described ""lefty, liberal, living in New York and California,"" said she yearned to visit ""Trump country"" and find ""what binds us together."" Singer and stage actress Deborah Cox said she was living through ""a real sobering moment.""  ""It's a tough time. It's a real sobering moment, I think, for the country,"" she said. Trump, the former ""Apprentice"" star and the candidate with the longest background in entertainment since Ronald Reagan, apparently only needed his own endorsement. During the campaign he seemed to spend more time fighting celebrities than being praised by them. He continued his feud with Rosie O'Donnell, had harsh words for Jay Z and defied the wishes of the Rolling Stones, Adele and other artists by playing their music at his campaign appearances. But the entertainment industry's distaste for Trump may also have contributed to his image as an outsider shunned by the country's elite.  ""I'm here all by myself,"" he said during a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania. ""Just me, no guitar, no piano, no nothing."" Wiener says that getting support from a celebrity like Beyonce can ""help create excitement -- and headlines"" but is less important than inspiring people to vote. In Cleveland's Cuyahoga County, for instance, turnout appeared to be down significantly from 2012, with preliminary results showing Clinton receiving some 60,000 fewer votes than Obama did four years earlier. The effectiveness of celebrity campaigners has varied over the past few decades. Frank Sinatra's support of John F. Kennedy in 1960 has often been credited for helping the Democrat in a race in which he narrowly defeated Richard Nixon. Years later, Sinatra's shift to the Republican Party and his backing of Reagan seemed to stand for millions of Democrats who also had turned more conservative. In 2008, Oprah Winfrey's enthusiasm for Obama led The New York Times editorial board to declare that she deserved a ""good chunk of credit"" for his success by boosting his standing in ""middle America."" But A-listers can do little for candidates the public isn't in the mood for electing. George McGovern's challenge to President Richard Nixon in 1972 was avidly supported by many of the biggest names in music, movies and literature, including John Lennon, Barbra Streisand, Jack Nicholson, Paul Simon and Warren Beatty. One Madison Square Garden show featured Tina Turner and Mama Cass. Nixon officials were so concerned about a planned Lennon protest tour that it attempted to have the ex-Beatle deported. In the end, McGovern was defeated in a landslide. ___ Associated Press entertainment writer Mark Kennedy contributed to this story. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/08/democrats-are-now-basically-extinct-in-the-south/	Democrats are now basically extinct in the South	"   Color Kentucky red now.  As of Tuesday night, consider the political realignment of the South from blue to red complete. Kentucky Democrats just lost control of the state house they had held on to for nearly a century -- and with it, the party's last Southern legislative chamber. The development was a year in the making. Democrats' control of the chamber had been hanging on by a thread as Republicans swept most other statewide offices in the 2015 elections. The GOP wave was led by Gov. Matt Bevin, a businessman whose outside appeal and flare have been likened to Donald Trump and who came from behind to become only the second Republican to lead the state in four decades. (Speaking of Trump, the GOP nominee won Kentucky on Tuesday with more than 60 percent of the vote.) After Kentucky Democrats lost the governor's mansion and several statewide offices, they nearly lost the state House due to party defections. Two Democratic state representatives switched parties, claiming they could no longer support President Obama and his policies. And two more Democratic state representatives resigned to accept appointments by Kentucky's new Republican governor, Bevin. Suddenly four seats in the chamber were open. And four just happened to be the magic number Republicans needed to take control of it (Democrats held control at 50-46). But Democrats held off Republicans in a special election in March for those four vacancies, winning three of the four. They even added a seat to their majority. And then they lost it in an election eight months later. In one of the biggest blows of the night for Kentucky Democrats, their House speaker, Greg Stumbo, lost to his Republican challenger, Larry Brown. But Republicans bested Democrats in Eastern Kentucky state House races as well. Now, Kentucky Republicans control the executive and legislative branches of government in the state. Which means they have a clear path to pass a range of conservative bills that had been stopped by the Democratic statehouse -- such as restrictions on abortions, limits on transgender individuals' use of bathrooms and limiting the power of unions. As recently as 2010, Democrats held a 65-to-35 advantage in the state house. But even though Bill Clinton won the state twice, Republican Mitt Romney won the state in the 2012 presidential election, and GOP candidates triumphed in the 2014 Senate election and the 2015 gubernatorial race -- often by wide margins. University of Louisville political science professor Jasmine Farrier told The Fix in March that she thinks all this should be a wake-up call for the Democratic Party, which has struggled to bridge the urban-rural divide in heavily rural states like Kentucky. It hasn't really found a way to reach across the cultural divides that separate former Southern Democrats with today's Northern ones. ""What has the Democratic Party done for poor, conservative, evangelical white people?"" Farrier said. ""And the answer is not much. On God, guns and gays, poor, white evangelical conservatives would say the Democratic Party walked away from them, and not the other way around.""   [Kentucky, once an Obamacare exchange success story, now moves to shut it down]   It also didn't help Democrats that during the Obama years, Republicans absolutely dominated state politics. By the end, they controlled some of their largest majorities of governors' mansions, state legislative chambers (69 of 99) and Congress since the Great Depression.  (Though that could change some Tuesday, as Democrats are expected to pick up seats.) But not in Kentucky. It is no longer a Democratic bulwark in a conservative South. It IS the conservative South, a state now better described one of the last to realign with the country's new political reality, that Democrats dominate the North -- and Republicans now rule down South."

A remarkable election that propelled Republican Donald Trump to the White House also resulted in Republican wins in a trio of governorships previously held by Democrats in Missouri, New Hampshire and Vermont. The only potential Republican setback came in North Carolina, where Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper declared victory over Gov. Pat McCrory in a race that remained too close to call Wednesday. If Cooper's slim lead holds, Republicans will control 33 of the 50 governors' offices -- one shy of their record set in 1922. Republicans also appeared likely to maintain control of about two-thirds of the state legislative chambers, meaning that in many states they will have the power to enact whatever policies they choose. In Missouri, for example, newly elected Republican Gov. Eric Greitens has pledged to enact a right-to-work law barring mandatory union fees in the workplace -- a long-sought priority of GOP legislative leaders that had been vetoed by Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon. Newly elected New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu also could be paired with a Republican-controlled Legislature. The GOP held its majority in the state Senate, and House Republicans also claimed victory. Republicans last saw such a sweep in 2002. In Vermont's gubernatorial election, Republican Lt. Gov. Phil Scott defeated Democrat Sue Minter, a former transportation secretary for outgoing Gov. Peter Shumlin. Scott campaigned on making government more efficient but also appealed to voters in the liberal-leaning state by embracing abortion rights and gay marriage. The Republican Governors Association spent more than $50 million on this year's races, primarily targeting seven states. That almost doubled the estimated amount of money coming from the Democratic Governors Association, though Democratic candidates in some states outraised their Republican opponents. Democrats are hoping for better results in the next two years, when 27 of the 38 governors' office up for election are held by Republicans.  ""It's clear that Democrats need to rebuild,"" said Democratic Governors Association spokesman Jared Leopold. Democrats did have a few bright spots Tuesday. Despite a dominant victory by Trump in West Virginia, Democratic businessman Jim Justice won the governor's race over Republican state Senate President Bill Cole. And although Trump easily carried Montana, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock retained his seat against a challenge from Republican businessman Greg Gianforte, who poured millions of his own money into the race. ___ Follow David A.

Sen.-elect Chris Van Hollen spoke at a news conference with the senator he will replace in January -- Sen. Barbara Mikulski -- and Sen. Ben Cardin.  ""I do believe that Donald Trump ran an incredibly divisive campaign, and it's going to be essential that he reach out -- not just in word, but in deed,"" said Van Hollen, who has served seven terms in the U.S. House. Mikulski, the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress who is retiring after 30 years in the Senate, passed a baton with flashing lights to Van Hollen before the two hugged. Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton was especially tough for Mikulski, who has been one of Clinton's most staunch supporters, but she said Van Hollen's win over Republican Del. Kathy Szeliga was a bright spot in an otherwise dreary Election Day.  ""He is a worker,"" Mikulski said. ""He is someone who likes to dig into the issues, not for the issues' sake but to solve real problems that real people face."" Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, who did not support Trump's candidacy, said it was time to work with the new administration on behalf of all the state's residents.  ""As we move forward, I encourage both parties to leave behind the divisive politics that have marred this election season and our nation for far too long and focus on doing what is best for America,"" said Hogan, who wrote in his father, Lawrence Hogan, for president during early voting. Cardin, a Democrat, pledged a willingness to work with Republicans, but he also expressed wariness about positions taken by Trump during the long and contentious presidential campaign.  ""A lot of things were said in this campaign that give me great concern, but I can assure you that we will be working to make sure that the values that we hold so dear in our state and nation are carried out by our congressional representation in the United States Congress,"" Cardin said. The election also was noteworthy in Maryland because the state will be without a woman in the state's congressional delegation for the first time in more than 40 years. Mikulski, who is considered the dean of Senate women and a mentor to female lawmakers, said Van Hollen and Cardin have strong records of supporting women's rights.  ""I have a saying that says: 'Men of quality always support we women as we seek equality,'"" Mikulski said. ""These men have a fabulous voting record and life commitment to the advancement, empowerment, of women and girls and, also though, of others."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
