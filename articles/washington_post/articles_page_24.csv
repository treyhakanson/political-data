On Saturday evening, a tweet was posted on Trump's account that said it was ""very rude and insulting of Hamilton cast member to treat our great future V.P. Mike Pence to a theater lecture."" The comment echoed several messages posted on Trump's Twitter feed earlier in the day. But after about half an hour, the post was deleted. An email asking staff why the tweet was taken down did not immediately get a response. Pence attended the blockbuster show Friday night. After the curtain call, he got an earful from star Brandon Victor Dixon, who spoke from the stage, saying the multiracial and multicultural cast is ""alarmed and anxious"" about the new administration. ___ 8:10 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump is wrapping up a day of meetings in Bedminster, New Jersey. Visitors to Trump's golf course late in the day Saturday included Todd Ricketts, co-owner of the Chicago Cubs, and restaurant executive Andy Puzder. Rounding out the day were financier Lew Eisenberg and health-care billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong. Asked about possible administration appointments, Trump repeatedly praised the ""talent"" available and said he was ""getting close."" Some of the visitors avoided questions, but Puzder said: ""I would be proud to serve in any position this president asks me to serve in."" ___ 5:00 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump has concluded a meeting with retired Gen. James Mattis, calling him ""the real deal."" Mattis is considered a contender to lead the Pentagon. He was one of a series of people who met with Trump Saturday at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump wouldn't say if he was offering Mattis a job, saying ""we'll see."" But he called Mattis a ""brilliant wonderful man"" and said ""what a career."" Trump also briefly bantered with reporters watching the comings and goings. ""Everything ok out there?"" he asked. ""Need some chocolate, need something? I'll send some stuff. I'm not allowed to do that but I will."" ___ 3:45 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump is meeting with education activists at his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Michelle Rhee, a former chancellor of Washington, D.C., schools, came to meet with Trump Saturday. She was accompanied by her husband Kevin Johnson, a former professional basketball player and the Democratic mayor of Sacramento. Rhee was considered a polarizing leader, who fought teachers unions in pushing for charter schools. Trump also met with Betsy DeVos. She's a Republican donor from Michigan and an advocate for school vouchers. The meetings come as Trump is starting to appoint top administration officials. ___ 2:39 p.m. Mitt Romney says he had a ""far-reaching conversation"" with President-elect Donald Trump. The 2012 GOP presidential nominee met privately with Trump for about an hour Saturday at Trump's private golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. Romney told reporters afterward that the two had a ""very thorough and in-depth discussion"" and said he appreciated ""the chance to speak with"" Trump. Romney did not respond to questions about whether he would consider joining the administration. Trump walked Romney out at the end of the meeting and said ""it went great."" The sit-down comes after an acrimonious election year. Romney was a harsh critic of Trump, calling him a ""con man."" Trump called Romney a ""choke artist"" because of his loss to President Barack Obama. Trump and Romney have been trying to mend fences since then. ___ 2:30 p.m. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach is lining up to meet with President-elect Donald Trump. Kobach spokeswoman Desiree Taliaferro told The Associated Press on Saturday that Kobach is on his way to New Jersey. She says she could not confirm details of the planned meeting. Kobach served as an adviser to the Trump campaign on immigration issues and has a background in designing laws cracking down people who are here illegally. ___ 1:10 p.m. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has arrived for a private meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf course. The 2012 nominee was greeted by Trump and his Vice President-elect Mike Pence on the front steps of the club house. ""How are you sir,"" said Romney, before shaking hands with both men. Romney was an outspoken critic of Trump during the election, calling him a ""con man"" and a ""fraud."" But the two have started to make amends since the election. Romney called Trump to congratulate him after his win. ___ 12:04 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have arrived at the clubhouse at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf course to start a day of meetings. Trump gave a thumbs-up to reporters assembled outside the building. He said he had ""a lot of meetings."" Pence added ""indeed."" Trump's agenda Saturday includes meeting with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. But since Trump's victory, the two have begun to mend fences. ___ 12:00 p.m. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is threatening political payback if congressional Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump try to undo President Barack Obama's major legislative achievements. Senate Democrats' leader-in-waiting told The Associated Press in an interview on Friday: ""They will rue the day"" they repeal Obama's health care law. Trump, after meeting with Obama, said he'd like to keep popular pieces of the six-year-old law, including the requirement to extend coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and the provision allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26. But Schumer said it was non-starter to start picking off favored pieces of the Affordable Care Act. ___ 9:23 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump says he agreed to settle lawsuits over Trump University ""for a small fraction of the potential award because as president I have to focus on our country."" Trump made the comment on Twitter Saturday. He also tweeted that ""the ONLY bad thing about winning the presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U."" It was announced Friday that Trump had agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve three lawsuits over Trump University, his former school for real estate investors. The lawsuits alleged the school misled students and failed to deliver on its promises in programs that cost up to $35,000. Trump has denied the allegations and has said repeatedly he would not settle. ___ 9:11 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump says the cast of the Broadway hit Hamilton should apologize to his Vice President-elect. Mike Pence attended the blockbuster show Friday night. After the curtain call, he got an earful from star Brandon Victor Dixon, who spoke from the stage, saying the multiracial and multicultural cast is ""alarmed and anxious"" about the new administration. On Twitter Saturday, Trump said Pence was ""harassed"" and ""this should not happen."" In another message, Trump said ""the Theater must always be a safe and special place"" and said the cast was ""very rude."" He added: ""Apologize!"" Dixon plays Aaron Burr, the nation's third vice president. He said in an interview on Broadway.com that he hopes the show left an impact, saying he hopes ""he thinks of us every time he has to deal with an issue or talk about a bill or present anything."" ___ 2:40 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump has picked Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signaling a sharp rightward shift in U.S. security policy as he begins to form his Cabinet. Trump on Friday also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism. The selections form the first outlines of Trump's Cabinet and national security teams. Given his lack of governing experience and vague policy proposals during the campaign, his selection of advisers is being scrutinized in the U.S. and abroad. Trump's initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam's role in stoking extremism. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Talking on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Peru, Duterte also gave Putin a scathing review of America's military endeavors in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and the Korean peninsula. He said the United States has given unequal treatment of the Philippines as a treaty ally and added that his country wants to engage more with Europe. Duterte told Putin that he previously has been identified with the Western world. But, he added: ""Of late, I see a lot of these Western nations bullying small nations. And not only that, they are into so much hypocrisy."" An obviously elated Putin congratulated Duterte. He called the May 9 election that Duterte won ""indeed a very bright day,"" noting it came on the Russian holiday marking victory over Nazi Germany. Putin said the Philippine leader has done much quickly in ""developing the all-round partnership between our countries and with respect to promoting greater trust and confidence between us."" ___ 6:50 p.m. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has promised his Chinese counterpart that he will align his foreign policy toward China-led Asian economic development, further reinforcing his shift toward China amid his hostile stance toward the U.S. Duterte met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit in the Peruvian capital of Lima. He also talked to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, whom he has called his political idol. Duterte first met Xi in a state visit to Beijing last month, where their governments forged mostly trade and economic accords. They also discussed longstanding territorial disputes in the South China Sea. After his China trip, Filipinos were allowed back to fish in the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which Chinese coast guard vessels have guarded since seizing the rich fishing area in 2012. In their meeting in Lima, Duterte told Xi that ""we will cooperate with you."" He added: ""With my thrust of an independent foreign policy, we will find ourselves mutually agreeing in so many things and align our foreign policy towards the development of Asia, strengthening of ties among the countries in the region, with China leading the way in the economic development."" ___ 5:50 p.m. APEC summit host Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has managed to win a smile from the normally stern-faced Vladimir Putin by speaking to the Russian president in a foreign language the two leaders share: German. With cameras rolling at the start of their one-on-one meeting, Kuczynski asked the Russian leader: ""In what language should we speak?"" Putin suggested the two speak in their native languages and use translators. Kuczynski replied, ""But you speak German."" That got a gleeful Putin to say, in fluent German, ""Then we can speak Deutsch, if you prefer."" Putin worked for the KGB in East Germany before the collapse of the Soviet Union, while Kuczynski is the son of Jewish doctor from Germany. ___ 5:30 p.m. Peru's almost octogenarian president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, has had his first experience with virtual reality, trying it out during the annual meeting of the 21-nation Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Lima. As he emerged groggy-eyed, he told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: ""I didn't like the Tyrannosaurus Rex."" Kuczynski tried out Facebook's Oculus Rift virtual reality device headset in which dinosaurs, debris and crashing cars jump out at the participant. It was an ""incredible"" experience, according to Kuczynski, who is better known for more sedate tastes like playing the classical flute and reading history books. A video of the encounter posted by Kuczynski's office on his social media site has gone viral, attracting more than 368,000 views. That is the most replays of any video provided by the president since he took office in July. Afterward Kuczynski and Zuckerberg posed for a selfie, with the Facebook founder promising to help Peru boost internet connectivity in far-flung, rural parts of the South American country. ___ 5 p.m. And they're off to Vietnam. President Tran Dai Quang of Vietnam closed a meeting of business leaders in Peru by inviting them to his Southeast Asian nation in 2017 for the next meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum nations. Leaders from APEC's 21 nations have finished their speeches for Saturday and will gather later for a dinner at a downtown Lima park. But with the closure of the APEC CEO summit, most leaders will hide themselves in bilateral meetings and Sunday's closed-door sessions. ___ 12:15 p.m. New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key says that if Donald Trump tries to withdraw the U.S. from trade deals, he shouldn't expect the rest of the world to follow suit. Speaking to business leaders, Key said he had sensed ""tremendous despair"" among attendees of the APEC summit about Trump's position on trade. He said it's still possible to save the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by the Obama administration by introducing cosmetic changes making it acceptable to the incoming U.S. president or crafting a more limited pact among willing signatories that leaves out the U.S.  ""Even if the United States doesn't want to engage in free trade, President Trump needs to know other countries do,"" said Key. ___ 12 p.m. Mexico's president is taking a cautious approach to Donald Trump's pledges to break up the North American Free Trade Agreement and build a wall to keep out millions of Latino immigrants. Addressing business leaders at APEC, President Enrique Pena Nieto refused to antagonize the incoming U.S. president even as he strongly defended trade between the two countries. He said the United States and Mexico ship to each other $1 million worth of goods every minute, generating benefits to companies and workers on both sides of the border that must not be jeopardized.  ""In the face of Trump's positioning, we're now in a stage of favoring dialogue as a way to build a new agenda in our bilateral relationship,"" Pena Nieto said. ""Mexico, like the entire world, is about to initiate a new stage with the U.S. and in commercial terms we want to give the right value to this strategic relationship between Mexico and the U.S."" ___ 10:30 a.m. China's President Xi Jinping is calling for a free trade agreement across the Asia-Pacific region to promote more equitable global growth. Xi made the forceful call against protectionism in a keynote address to business leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Peru on Saturday. Xi said that China has contributed to 40 percent of global growth since the global financial crisis. China's economy is now cooling as it seeks to rebalance growth away from exports to more domestic sources of growth, but it remains an engine of global growth. Xi said that more than 700 million Chinese tourists will fan out across the globe in coming years and the country will invest billions abroad. Still, he said the measure of globalization has to be an improvement in peoples' lives and a reduction of poverty. He said a proposed free trade area encompassing all 21 APEC members can contribute to that goal. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

On Friday night, Pence came face-to-face with a symbol of the new America: A hit musical called ""Hamilton"" that celebrates the principles of the nation's founding but reimagines the revolutionary period with multiracial actors playing the statesmen and the contributions of immigrants central to the story. As he took his seat in New York's Richard Rogers Theatre, Pence heard an impassioned, sustained boo. He sat through a performance celebrating the country's multiculturalism. And when the show was over and he headed for the exits, the cast was not quite finished. ""We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir,"" said Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor who played Aaron Burr, reading a statement the cast members had drafted together. ""But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us,"" he continued.   Vice President-elect Mike Pence, top center, leaves the Richard Rodgers Theatre after a performance of ""Hamilton"" in New York on Friday. (Andres Kudacki/AP)  The remarkable moment crystallized the cleavage wrought by a toxic presidential campaign, in which millions of aggrieved white Americans propelled Donald Trump and Pence to the White House and left millions of others -- blacks and Latinos, gays and lesbians, Muslims and Jews -- fearful of what might become of their country. ""It was this collision of two different Americas and two different visions and two different sets of experiences, happening at once, and happening in a rather dramatic way,"" said Peter Wehner, a former speechwriter to President George W. Bush and a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. By Saturday morning, Trump decided to respond. He could have chosen to offer assurances that he would be a president for all Americans -- that he would respect everybody regardless of race or gender or creed. But Trump being Trump, the president-elect punched back. ""The Theater must always be a safe and special place,"" Trump tweeted. ""The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!"" There was a certain irony to Trump's demand, considering that as a candidate he rarely if ever apologized for the blizzard of insults he sprayed across the country. ""Have you ever apologized? Ever? In your lifetime? Close your eyes, think back to Baby Donald . . . ,"" Jimmy Fallon asked Trump on NBC's ""Tonight Show"" in September 2015.   President-elect Donald Trump, left, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, right, with retired Marine Gen. James Mattis at the Trump International Golf Club in Bedminster Township, N.J., on Saturday. (Aude Guerrucci / Pool/European Pressphoto Agency)  ""I fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong,"" Trump replied. He added, with a laugh, ""I will absolutely apologize sometime in the hopefully distant future, if I'm ever wrong."" Trump did apologize in October for the comments he made in 2005 to ""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush bragging about having grabbed women by their genitals. As a candidate, Trump set off hand grenades with provocative tweets at moments of his choosing to attract the attention of the news media. Regardless of whether this was Trump's intent Saturday morning, his shot at the ""Hamilton"" cast served to distract from a negative news story that broke late Friday: The president-elect had agreed to a $25 million settlement to end the fraud cases pending against Trump University, his defunct real estate seminar program. Trump tweeted Saturday that he had settled the case because he had to ""focus on our country."" ""The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!"" Trump tweeted, although there was no clear indication whether he would have prevailed had the case gone to trial. In many ways, ""Hamilton"" has become a touchstone in America's ongoing culture wars. Hillary Clinton embraced the musical -- its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, openly supported her candidacy -- and recited its lyrics in her speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination. Talk about ""Hamilton"" is different in Trump's orbit, however. Last Thursday at Trump Tower, when a reporter asked Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) how long he intended to be in New York, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway interjected: ""Have you seen 'Hamilton'?"" ""I have not,"" replied Sessions, who the next day would be announced as Trump's attorney general nominee. Trump's handling of the Pence incident is in keeping with how he confronted past cultural controversies and could presage how he will act in the White House. Although he is a billionaire who lives in a three-story apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, he long has felt excluded and shunned by the New York and Washington elite. Trump is sensitive to perceived snubs -- and has mastered the art of snapping back at criticism from coastal liberals as a means of ingratiating himself with his middle-America base. On Saturday, Trump's defenders rushed to condemn the ""Hamilton"" cast and voice outrage at perceived disrespect. His supporters started a ""#BoycottHamilton"" campaign on Twitter -- although ""Hamilton"" tickets are such a hot commodity that the production is sold out well into next year. ""The arrogance and hostility of the Hamilton cast to the Vice President elect (a guest at the theater) is a reminder the left still fights,"" tweeted former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal Trump adviser. Gingrich went on to liken Trump to former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher: ""Lady Thatcher aroused the same bitter hostility because like Trump she was a threat to the establishment's claim to moral superiority."" Presidential historian Robert Dallek said Trump's Twitter retort was a striking act of divisiveness by an incoming president struggling to heal the nation after a bitter election. ""Instead of doing what a Franklin Roosevelt or a John Kennedy or a Lyndon Johnson would have done, he's exacerbating the differences by saying they owe him an apology,"" Dallek said. ""For what? What were they asking for? They were asking for a kind of regard for minorities. It wasn't as if they were asking him to give up the office."" Said Wehner: ""He's not the sole reason that the campaign was ugly and divisive, but he's the main reason it was. . . . And now, having won, it falls on him to bind up the wounds. Even if you feel what happened by the cast of 'Hamilton' was wrong or inappropriate or indecorous, he's the leader of the country."" Although Trump won a clear majority in the electoral college, he garnered just 47 percent of the popular vote -- more than 1 million votes short of Clinton, with millions of votes still to be counted in primarily liberal states.  ""I don't think Trump understands that beneath the surface of his electoral college victory, there's a lot of people who simply are not willing to accept the rhetoric of his campaign as the language of government,"" veteran Democratic strategist Tad Devine said. ""Trump has opened Pandora's box,"" he added, ""and we're looking for hope at the bottom.""  "

Presenting his budget request for next fiscal year, Attorney General Matt Denn said Thursday that his top priority is adding another criminal prosecutor in New Castle County. Denn, who is also asking for an additional juvenile delinquency prosecutor and other staff additions, says Department of Justice attorneys are struggling with heavy caseloads, including homicides, other violent crimes, and gang cases. He noted that there are murder charges pending against 116 defendants. Overall, Denn's general fund request of $37.7 million for fiscal 2018 represents a 3.4 percent over current year funding.

Marion Christopher Barry, known as Christopher, died in August at age 36. A spokeswoman for the D.C. Medical Examiner, LaShon Beamon, said Thursday that Barry died of acute phencyclidine toxicity. The synthetic drug is commonly known as PCP or angel dust. Beamon says the death was ruled accidental. Christopher Barry had struggled with drug abuse and was given probation in 2011 for PCP possession. His father also had substance abuse problems, and was famously arrested in 1990 after he was caught smoking crack cocaine in an FBI sting operation.

Bannon talks about immigration issues while hosting ""Breitbart News Daily"" on July 20. (Kirk Irwin/Getty Images for SiriusXM)  The morning after the presidential election, Trump campaign chief executive Steve Bannon called into the Breitbart.com radio show he had hosted when he ran the conservative website. His voice was rough, and slowed by fatigue, but there were scores to settle. ""The hobbits finally had a chance to speak,"" Bannon said to the site's editor, Alex Marlow. He recalled a cable news segment on which some reporter asked why Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain's successful campaign to quit the European Union, had introduced Trump at one rally. ""Nigel Farage is a real hero to those people,"" Bannon said, ""and they know because they read Breitbart and they listen to this show.""   [Trump faces backlash over appointing Bannon as a top aide]   As most American media outlets analyzed the most shocking election since 1948, ""Mr. Brexit"" did not often figure in. But days later, Farage would fly to New York and post a Twitter photo with a tieless Trump, telling his followers that the new president had a ""very positive reaction to [the] idea that Sir Winston Churchill's bust should be put back in Oval Office."" The next day, French National Front politician Marion Marechal-Le Pen tweeted that she too had been invited to meet with Trump. Until mid-August, Bannon had never been part of any political campaign. Little of what he did made sense to political reporters looking for the normal tokens of a winning effort -- not the Farage rally, not the surprise news conference with Bill Clinton's accusers.      Here's what you need to know about the man who went from Breitbart News chairman to Donald Trump's campaign CEO before his appointment as chief White House strategist and senior counselor. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   ""Trump has gone from 2012 GOP style loss to a 2008 GOP style loss,"" wrote Republican pollster Matthew Dowd on Oct. 10. ""The rhetoric that Bannon is feeding Trump makes it increasingly likely that Trump will lose in a landslide,"" wrote the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza on Oct. 16. A few weeks, an FBI letter and tens of thousands of WikiLeaked emails later, Bannon will be the chief strategist and senior counselor to President Donald Trump. Democrats have laced into him, accusing him of ""anti-Semitic"" views; Republicans, taking the lead of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, have not mentioned Bannon at all, not even to point out that many Breitbart staffers are Jewish. Some of the highest praise for the move came from the white nationalist thinker Richard Spencer. ""Bannon will answer directly to Trump and focus on the big picture, and not get lost in the weeds,"" Spencer wrote last night on Twitter. ""Bannon is not a 'chief of staff,' which requires a 'golden retriever' personality. He'll be freed up to chart Trump's macro trajectory."" If Bannon's past is prologue, he will not care about criticism. Under his leadership, Breitbart became an anti-""globalist"" news site clearly aligned with the European far right. Under the site's founder, the late Andrew Breitbart, accusations of ""racism"" were dismissed as ""cultural Marxism."" The attacks lobbed at Bannon, one plumbing an 2007 divorce record for evidence of anti-Semitism, resemble the ones that failed to stop Trump's rise. There is even talk of more Breitbart reporters joining Bannon at the White House, in roles that do not require Senate confirmation. Since 2012, when Bannon became Breitbart's chief executive, the site has defied doubts about what it could be without its charismatic founder and survived several tumultuous scraps with former staffers. The latest, just nine months ago, was telling of how Breitbart and Bannon viewed the press. After a Trump victory speech, Michelle Fields, then a reporter for Breitbart, was shoved out of the way by Trump's then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Within a week, she was gone; within a few months, Breitbart was running pieces about her being unable to defend her story. From the outside, the moves looked chaotic. But chat logs published by BuzzFeed found Breitbart staffers agreeing that the scuffle looked bad but that going to ""war"" over it would reflect poorly on a greater cause. That cause was the Trump campaign. Bannon had joked a year before he was hired that he was effectively Trump's campaign manager because the Republican front-runner was a ""nationalist."" He identified Breitbart as a home for the ""alt-right"" for the same reason. In a revealing August interview with Sarah Posner, Bannon allowed that, possibly, there were ""some people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right."" That, he said, could no more define ""alt-right"" than the presence of extremists on the left could identify their movement. By and large, the alt-right was not racist, he said. ""If you look at the identity movements over there in Europe, I think a lot of [them] are really 'Polish identity' or 'German identity,' not racial identity,"" said Bannon. ""It's more identity toward a nation-state or their people as a nation.""   [Trump's win may be just the beginning of a global populist wave]   In Europe, the far right was dealing with the same sort of media coverage as Bannon. Accusations of racism were constant; internal power struggles were seen as proof of the whole project falling apart. But Breitbart, which launched a London branch in early 2014, had seen this before. The site's editor, Raheem Kassam, became chief of staff to Farage as his United Kingdom Independence Party surged. The Brexit vote this summer was seen, at Breitbart, as nationalism's great validation. In an analysis by Allum Bokhari and Milo Yiannopoulos, two of the site's U.K. writers, the failure of the ""Remain"" campaign in Britain -- one that united most both of the country's major parties and most of its experts -- proved that the masses wanted a revolt against ""globalism."" Warnings about what the wrong vote would do to markets, or that it would make people think of voters as racists, meant less than nothing to the antiglobalist working class. ""They think about political sovereignty, independence, and national pride,"" Bokhari and Yiannopoulos wrote. ""Elites sneer at these concerns as the foolish, provincial preoccupations of 'low-information voters,' yet they are deeply embedded in human nature, particularly in the search for belonging."" For an American reader, Breitbart was the place for news on the revolt against the ""globalists."" European far right politicians like Geert Wilders and the Le Pens earned regular write-ups on their doings. A typical headline: ""Marion Marechal-Le Pen: Either We Kill Islamism or It Kills Us."" Their politics were seen as necessary because of the litany of migrant crimes screaming across Breitbart. To name just four since the election: Previously-Deported Illegal Alien Caught on Camera Destroying Trump Signs While 'at Work' Syrian Migrant Accused of Multiple Machine Gun Terrorist Murders Police Warn of Child Rape Epidemic in Migrant-Occupied Malmo Migrant who Kayaked to UK Accused of Raping Aid Worker Coverage like that turned Breitbart into a powerhouse; according to the New York Times, it earned more Facebook impressions on election night than Fox News or CNN. More importantly, Bannon helped shape a Trump message that won the condemnation of the Anti-Defamation League -- and helped him in swing states. Trump's closing ad, a two-minute edit of a speech he had given attacking the ""global financial powers,"" struck the ADL as hitting ""anti-Semitic themes."" In the wider media, it was seen as stirring and populist. ""I played the clip for like five different people and I said, is that anti-Semitic?"" said MSNBC's Joe Scarborough last week. ""No. There are dog whistles, but ... play that ad to 100 Americans in Middle America, 99 of them will go, that's cool."" Further on the political fringe, Bannon and Breitbart were credited with honing Trump's message against globalism, and unleashing his say-anything approach to talking about terror and immigrant crime. On Alex Jones's online show, after the election, sometime Trump adviser Roger Stone suggested that Bannon become Trump's chief of staff to keep the momentum of the campaign going. ""I think he has the big picture viewpoint that Trump needs,"" Stone said. ""He knows exactly who the bad guys are. He knows exactly who those who won this victory are. And he knows the value of InfoWars.com. He is the right man to be the gatekeeper."" In a separate video released this week, Jones -- who has said that the attacks of 9/11 and the massacre at Sandy Hook were both hoaxes of one form or another -- told subscribers that Trump was going to continue coming on his show. ""Donald Trump gave me a call, and I told him: Mr. President-elect, you're too busy. We don't need to talk,"" Jones said. ""But we still spent over five minutes. He said, to me: 'Listen, Alex. I just talked to kings and queens of the world, world leaders, you name it, but it doesn't matter. I wanted to talk to you.'"" Every modern president has tried to wind around the traditional media to spread his message. None has been as well-equipped as Trump, who generated headlines this week just by attacking protesters on Twitter. Another preview of how Bannon's network could help Trump came on the morning after the election, when Yiannopoulos -- the site's biggest star since the death of Breitbart himself -- released a video of him running through the media rooms at Trump's victory party. Gripping a Miller Lite in one hand, he rifled through an ice cream freezer at Fox News's media section and bit into it while showing that most of the media desks had been abandoned. The reporters who had left were reporting and updating stories, but to Breitbart consumers, it looked as it they were trying, one more time, to sabotage the candidate that Yiannopoulos called ""daddy."" ""Once the narrative falls apart, once it self-destructs under the reality of a Trump victory, they just leave,"" Yiannopoulos said. A few hours later, in the call-in to Breitbart's radio show, Bannon was more circumspect. The election, he said, proved the limits of the major news networks when they tried to ""weaponize media to mind control simple people."" The solution, said Marlow, the Breitbart editor, was to grow the site's readership as Trump took power. ""So long as people do what I recommend, and tell 10 friends and family members about Breitbart.com, I think we've got a fighting chance to gain some ground back in Washington,"" Marlow said."

With 10 months before the vote, bid leaders from Los Angeles, Paris and Budapest, Hungary, have traveled to Doha to pitch their case to the general assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees -- a meeting attended by more than 1,000 delegates from around the world. The Los Angeles bid team may have the most at stake in Tuesday's 20-minute presentations, which will occur exactly a week after Trump's election victory over Hillary Clinton. Trump's comments during the campaign about Muslims and Mexicans and his foreign policy plans could hurt the U.S. city's standing with some of the IOC's 98 members, who represent a wide range of countries and cultural and religious backgrounds. Los Angeles bid leader Casey Wasserman, who was a prominent Clinton supporter, said his group has already been in contact with members of Trump's transition team.  ""My personal support of Clinton isn't an indictment of president-elect Trump's ability to support our effort,"" Wasserman told The Associated Press. ""We're fully confident that he will be an enthusiastic supporter of the Olympics and our bid.""  ""Having said that, I think the Olympics are at its best when they rise above politics,"" he added. ""It has the ability to unite people. Our bid isn't a political bid. It's a private bid with political support. We are privately funded and privately operated. We are one step removed from the politics and the ups and downs of politics."" While details have been kept secret, the Los Angeles presentation -- which includes Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat -- is likely to deal head-on with the U.S. election result and seek to reassure Olympic officials that the bid represents openness, diversity and inclusiveness.  ""We're not going to pretend like there wasn't an election but we're not going to be defensive about it,"" Wasserman said. ""I think there are some things we're going to say that will surprise some people."" Perhaps as a contrast to Trump's image, the bid team selected sprint star Allyson Felix, a Los Angeles-born African-American athlete who has won six Olympic gold medals and three silvers -- as one of its key speakers for the presentation. Felix won two relay gold medals and a silver medal in the 400 meters in Rio de Janeiro in August.  ""She's born, bred, raised and developed in Los Angeles. She's a hometown girl,"" Wasserman said. ""I can't think of anybody better to tell our story."" The Doha audience will include officials from 205 national Olympic committees, dozens of international sports federations and, most importantly, dozens of members of the International Olympic Committee, which will vote on the host city next September in Lima, Peru. Under tighter IOC rules, these are the first of only three presentations during the two-year bid race. The second will be at a private technical briefing for IOC members in Switzerland in July, and the third will be the final presentations on the day of the vote in Lima. Whether Trump will be part of the Los Angeles bid team in Lima remains to be seen. President Barack Obama went to Copenhagen in 2009 to speak on behalf of Chicago's bid for the 2016 Olympics, but his appearance didn't help as the city went out in the first round of an election won by Rio de Janeiro.  ""We're getting way ahead of the game,"" Wasserman said. ""We're going to make the right judgment at the right time for our bid."" Paris and Los Angeles, which have each held the Olympics twice, have been viewed as close front-runners in the 2024 race. Paris last held the games in 1924, with Los Angeles hosting in 1984. Paris bid leaders said they plan to use Tuesday's presentation -- which includes Mayor Anne Hidalgo and two-time Olympic judo champion Teddy Riner -- to announce plans for collaboration with national Olympic committees.  ""We are feeling the excitement,"" Paris bid co-chairman and three-time Olympic canoeing gold medalist Tony Estanguet said Monday. ""I feel like an athlete. I feel the adrenaline."" Like Los Angeles, the Paris bid could be influenced by a presidential election. Far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen is among the contenders in next spring's French presidential race. Estanguet downplayed any concerns over a potential Le Pen victory, saying the bid has support across the political spectrum in France. He said France was also working hard to guarantee security following a spate of deadly attacks in the country.  ""It can happen anywhere in the world, but we have a strong base and lots of experience in security,"" he said. Budapest, meanwhile, is expected to portray itself as the right-sized, affordable alternative from central Europe.  ""Holding the Olympic Games in Budapest would help to pave the way for a greater range of mid-sized cities to host the games, in addition to the larger capitals and mega cities that have hosted the games in recent times,"" bid chairman Balazs Furjes said.

A new limit of three consecutive terms for officeholders, overwhelmingly approved by Montgomery voters this past week, creates an unprecedented four open seats on the nine-member County Council and one in the county executive's office. A new publicly financed campaign system will allow eligible candidates to leverage small individual contributions into bigger donations from taxpayers. The rule changes are unlikely to alter the partisan makeup of political leadership in a county where Democrats enjoy a 3-to-1 voter-registration advantage over Republicans. But they will open the door to a new group of decision-makers charged with addressing traffic congestion, overcrowded schools, economic development and other urgent issues in a rapidly urbanizing county. ""This has the potential to be a transformational election,"" said first-term council member Tom Hucker (D-Eastern County). He and others say they anticipate a deep and unusually diverse field of candidates competing to replace the small, well-financed incumbent political class that has dominated county government for years.   Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett (D), center, is sworn in for his third term in 2014. He says he is retiring in two years, even without a new term-limits law. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)  The two potential game changers -- term limits and public campaign finance -- were born at opposite ends of the county's political axis. Public funding, passed by the council in 2014, was championed by then-council member Phil Andrews and progressive groups such as Common Cause. The petition drive that put term limits on the ballot was spearheaded by Republican activist Robin Ficker with assistance from Help Save Maryland, a group opposed to county policies that are friendly to immigrants who are in the country illegally. The measure passed by a margin of 70 percent to 30 percent, boosted by fatigue with the county's culture of incumbency and a degree of the antipathy toward government that swept President-elect Donald Trump into the White House. Taken together, they seem likely to create a number of crowded Democratic and Republican primary races, featuring veteran politicians who are term-limited but seeking new posts, candidates backed by a business sector eager to promote new ideas, and hopefuls who may lack a deep donor base but see the possibility of competing with small contributions and matching funds. ""A lot of people are salivating over it,"" said Gabriel Acevero, an organizer for United Food and Commercial Workers and vice president of the African American Democratic Club of Montgomery County. ""For a lot of folks, particularly candidates of color and women, this is a great opportunity."" Corporate influence The county's business leaders, most of them in the real estate sector, have been a major source of campaign contributions in Montgomery. But they will be limited in their ability to directly fund candidates who choose to enter the public finance system, which bars PAC money and caps individual contributions at $150. The county's influential public employee unions will be subject to the same limits. Big special-interest dollars are unlikely to be shut out of the political process completely, however. A new set of independent expenditure (IE) committees not bound by the small-donor law could spring up to support favored candidates. ""2018 could be the year of the IE,"" said Steve Silverman, a former council member and county economic development director who now lobbies for corporate and nonprofit clients. There are signs that the business sector will be newly aggressive in recruiting and supporting candidates of its own, who might bypass party primaries to run as independents. Private-sector leaders have become increasingly outspoken about their unhappiness with recent increases in property and recordation taxes, a higher minimum wage and what they consider a lackluster county record of attracting and retaining jobs -- Marriott International's decision to remain in Bethesda notwithstanding.  ""The business community is very concerned that we have not been hitting the ball down the middle of the fairway,"" said Charles K. Nulsen III, president of Washington Property Company, which has extensive holdings in Bethesda, Silver Spring and Northern Virginia. Last year Nulsen and other corporate leaders founded Empower Montgomery, a tax-exempt nonprofit intended to foster voter engagement and education around key issues. As a 501(c)(4) under federal tax law, Empower Montgomery cannot directly contribute to campaigns, but it can express support for or opposition to candidates as long as that is not its principal activity. It is not required to disclose the names of donors. Silverman, an adviser to the group, said its focus will be on issues. One executive involved with the group, health-services entrepreneur David T. Blair, is said by political insiders to be considering a run for council or county executive. Blair did not return phone messages last week. Another, more familiar business name in play is David Trone, the wine merchant who spent a record $13.4 million this spring in an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination to represent Maryland's 8th Congressional District. Multiple people in county politics, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said Trone is considering a run for county executive, among other options. Through a spokesman, Trone said in an email: ""The campaign for Congress strengthened my commitment to be in public service. A number of people have suggested opportunities in that regard, and I am in the process of deciding on my next step."" Another group trying to recruit business-friendly candidates is headed by land-use attorney Robby Brewer and Barbara Henry, managing director of the Committee for Montgomery, which pursues a legislative agenda for the county in Annapolis. Henry declined to comment last week; Brewer did not return a phone message. Political openings The object of all the behind-the-scenes jockeying is the unprecedented lineup of open seats created by the passage of the term-limits ballot question. Four council members, all Democrats, are barred from running for reelection: four-term at-large representatives George L. Leventhal and Nancy Floreen, and three-term lawmakers Roger Berliner (Potomac-Bethesda) and Marc Elrich (At-Large). County Executive Isiah Leggett (D), one of just two people to have held the office over the past 22 years, is serving his third term and said even before the term-limits vote passed that he would retire after 2018. Political chatter in the county is filled with the names of hopefuls who are looking hard at the opportunities -- including term-limited council members who appear undeterred by the anti-incumbent sentiment that helped fuel the ballot amendment. Both Leventhal and Elrich plan to run for county executive, and Floreen and Berliner may, as well. Council member Craig Rice (D-Upcounty), a two-term incumbent, also is weighing a bid, which could make him the only African American candidate in the field. Leventhal is first out of the gate. His fundraiser in Silver Spring this coming Saturday limits contributions to $150 so he can qualify for matching funds. Elrich is expected to do the same. The openings on the council and in the executive's office also have attracted wide interest from many who have run before and lost, and from members of the county's state legislative delegation. At least two Democrats in Annapolis, state Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. and Del. Benjamin F. Kramer (Montgomery), whose father, Sid Kramer, was county executive from 1986 to 1990, said they are looking seriously at the executive's race. Both would have to relinquish safe seats to make the race, and a state lawmaker who became county executive probably would have to give up any outside employment. Anyone elected as executive or to the council could hold the post for no more than 12 years. But the incentives are just as strong: a higher profile, no leadership to defer to, and a hefty raise over their current part-time government salaries of $46,000. (The county executive makes $190,000; council members will make $136,000 by the end of 2017). ""I think probably every state legislator in Montgomery County is going to give it some thought,"" said Del. Alfred C. Carr Jr. (D-Montgomery), who is thinking about Berliner's 1st District seat.  Other Democrats considering Berliner's job are Dels. Ariana B. Kelly (Montgomery) and Marc A. Korman (District 16), as well as Andrew Friedson, a senior aide to Comptroller Peter Franchot and former campaign adviser to Trone. Those weighing at-large bids for council include Del. Charles E. Barkley (D-Montgomery) -- who might also run in Upcounty's 2nd District if Rice becomes a candidate for county executive -- and at least two top county officials, Recreation Department Director (and former county Democratic chair) Gabriel Albornoz and White Oak planning director (and former Kensington mayor) Peter Fosselman, who said he also is considering the 1st District contest. A chance for newcomers Public financing also is expected to attract a less prominent group of Democratic activists who lack the established fundraising networks needed to run competitive campaigns. To qualify, candidates for executive need to collect at least 500 contributions that add up to at least $40,000. At-large council candidates must get 250 donations worth $20,000. District seat candidates are required to secure 125 contributions totaling $10,000. All contributions are limited to $150 per person. Those who qualify would have their donations matched with public money. The first $50 from each donor would be matched at the highest ratio: 6 to 1 for an executive candidate and 4 to 1 for a council contender. The bill caps public contributions to county executive candidates at $1.5 million -- $750,000 each for primary and general elections. At-large council hopefuls are limited to $250,000, and district council contenders to $125,000 -- sums large enough to run sustainable campaigns in Montgomery. ""I'd be lying if I said I wasn't paying attention,"" said William Roberts, 30, president of the Montgomery County Young Democrats. While he also may opt for an open state House seat, he said the public financing model will open the race for others. ""Now's the time for young people who are serious about helping move the county forward to be able to run,"" he said. "
