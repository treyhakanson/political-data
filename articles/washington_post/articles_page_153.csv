Local media outlets report that Pfc. David Winchester, of Adamsville, Alabama, was found Wednesday. Agents with the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command are investigating. The Army said in a release Friday that Winchester was a biomedical equipment specialist. He joined the Army in April 2015 and was assigned to Fort Bragg last June. Lt. Col. Aric Bowman says Winchester ""was the embodiment of what every commander hopes for in a soldier."" Bowman says Winchester was ""an enthusiastic, high-performing member of our medical maintenance team, and he touched many lives."" Winchester's awards include the Army Commendation Medal, the National Defense Service Ribbon, the Global War on Terrorism Service Ribbon, and the Army Service Ribbon.

The brief shootout at a mobile home in rural Long County killed a deputy U.S. marshal as well as the man his team was trying to apprehend. The U.S. Marshals Service said Patrick Carothers, deputy commander of the agency's Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force, died after being shot twice as the officers entered the mobile home.  ""Pat is a hero,"" David Harlow, deputy director of the Marshals Service, said in a statement Friday offering condolences to Carothers' wife and five children. Carothers had served 26 years with the agency. The slain suspect was identified as Dontrell Montese Carter, 25. He had been wanted in Sumter County, South Carolina, since mid-September on charges of attempted murder, domestic violence and illegally discharging a weapon. The agency said Carothers and his team had tracked Carter to a mobile home just outside Ludowici, about 55 miles southwest of Savannah. Carothers was shot as they were entering the home. Law enforcement officers returned fire and shot Carter multiple times, the Marshals Service said. Both men were taken to area hospitals, where they were pronounced dead. Carter had been on the run since he fled South Carolina in mid-September. According to Sumter County Sheriff's reports, Carter assaulted his girlfriend on Sept. 18 and fled their home in rural Dalzell before officers could arrive. Carter then drove about 10 miles to the home of the woman's uncle. Carter drove by the home twice, firing at least seven times at the uncle and others who were standing outside. No one was struck. Carter then led officers on a car chase at speeds up to 110 mph, according to the reports, and crashed into an embankment when he tried to make a turn too fast. He fired shots at the officers from a ""high-powered rifle"" as he left his vehicle and escaped on foot into the woods. Sumter County Sheriff Anthony Dennis offered condolences in a statement Friday. His office declined further comment. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, in a statement Friday, said she was ""deeply saddened"" by Carothers' death.  ""He stayed true to his oath to the last, laying down his life to keep his community safe and his neighbors secure,"" Lynch said. ""I know that his legacy will live on in the proud annals of the U.S. Marshals Service and in the memory of his fellow law enforcement officers from coast to coast."" Carter has had numerous encounters with the law since at least 2010, when he was arrested for unlawfully carrying a weapon. In 2013, Sumter police charged Carter with firing a gun into a home and attempted murder. The following year, he was charged with grand larceny, according to his South Carolina arrest record. It also shows misdemeanor charges that include driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, trespassing and driving under suspension. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

""Today we stand in wonderment, bewilderment, amazement and ask: What happened?"" said the Rev. Dr. Marie Phillips Braxton, who offered the guest sermon at the historic Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in the District. The nearly 180-year-old church, just blocks from the White House, with roots in the anti-slavery movement, has hosted multiple sitting presidents, including President Obama and Bill Clinton. But many said they did not know how to come to terms with Donald Trump as president.  ['I've never seen anything like that': Confederate flags at California Veterans Day parade]  For millions of Americans, President-elect Trump's campaign will be remembered for its racist overtones and threats to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, ban Muslims from the United States and to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The days since the election have been marked by an uptick in racially tinged attacks and threats across the country, along with counter-protests. In Silver Spring, the predominantly Latino congregants of the Episcopal Church of Our Saviour were greeted by hateful graffiti when they arrived for Sunday services. Outside the sanctuary, on the back of a church sign strung between a tree and a telephone pole, someone had printed ""Trump Nation"" and ""Whites Only."" The same message was scrawled on a brick wall in an alcove outside the church.  [Donald Trump plans to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants]  ""It touches my heart,"" said Nilton Diaz, 55, who is from El Salvador and worships at the church. Standing outside near the graffiti and choking back tears, Diaz, who has been in the United States for 33 years, said: ""I love whites. I love blacks. I love all kinds of people. This is a beautiful country for everybody, because God is for everybody."" Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who visited the church to celebrate an afternoon mass in Spanish, decried the vandalism during the service and again later, speaking to reporters. ""We have just concluded our worship services in a church that has been desecrated by violence,"" she said. ""Hate speech has covered the signs of this church, and we stand here to say that we are firm in our rejection of such violence.""  [University of Michigan student wearing a hijab was threatened to be set on fire, police say]  All around her, on the church's driveway and sidewalks, congregants of all ages, from first-graders to grandparents, had written messages of peace in colored chalk: ""We Love Jesus"" and ""God Is Love"" and ""Love God, Love All."" Budde said: ""I would call especially upon the president-elect and those who voted for him to separate themselves from acts of violence and hate that are being perpetrated in his name. We believe that the majority of Americans want a nation of peace and of unity across the spectrum of our glorious people."" Nearby, at Grace Episcopal Church in Silver Spring, the Rev. Andrew Walter said he had spent the week fielding calls from congregants fearful and upset that Trump's election would provoke more acts of violence. He cited the graffiti at the Episcopal Church of Our Saviour, as well as the scrawling of a swastika in the boys' bathroom at Westland Middle School in Bethesda on Friday, as among the events that had shaken people.  ""A lot of people are angry, but they are also scared,"" Walter said.   [Middle school administrators find swastikas in a boys' bathroom]  During service Sunday, Walter addressed the children of the diverse congregation with an affirming message: ""No matter where you are or where you come from, no matter the color of your skin, no matter your religion, your faith, no matter your political affiliation, you are made in the image of God and God loves you, just the way you are.""  At many churches, the message was about empowerment and showing solidarity with vulnerable communities.  The Rev. Grainger Browning, pastor of the Ebenezer African Methodist Church in Fort Washington, preached a sermon entitled ""Birth of a Nation,"" inspired by the recently released Nat Turner biopic, about the slave who led a rebellion.  At All Souls Unitarian Church in Northwest Washington, people sat shoulder to shoulder in pews on two levels and rose to applaud as the Rev. Robert M. Hardies called for the church to be a ""sanctuary"" for people who are threatened or disempowered by the new administration. Church of the Pilgrims, a Presbyterian Church on P Street, displayed a new Black Lives Matter banner.   [Kellyanne Conway: It's up to Clinton, Obama to calm anti-Trump protesters]  And at Temple Micah, a Reform synagogue in the District, Rabbi Daniel G. Zemel told a crowded service Friday night that ""we will return to life"" after this time of mourning. ""To be a Jew is to have a long memory, he said. ""We know history and we know the long term. What have we not endured?"" At Metropolitan AME, Braxton similarly drew upon African Americans' long history of oppression.  She told worshipers that ""God is a compassionate God"" who had been there throughout slavery and segregation and the civil rights battles of the previous generation and this one. Braxton brought people to their feet as she told them to move from singing the blues to finding hope and looking to ancestors for a spirit of resistance.   [As nation seethes, a charged clash on a Metro subway train]  ""Stuff doesn't happen to us; we make stuff happen,"" she said.  Among the visitors at the historic Metropolitan AME were a dozen members of the Sixth and I Historic Synagogue. Rabbi Shira Stutman sat at the pulpit with the clergy of the church. She said the first person she texted Wednesday morning after the election was the Rev. William H. Lamar IV, the pastor of Metropolitan AME, with whom she works often on social justice issues. ""Our words, basically, were, 'My God. My God,' "" she said.  Lamar said that religious leaders of many faiths are organizing now to figure out how to move from prayer and reflection to action in their work.  ""I am not going to dress it up in religious language: This is battle,"" he said.  After the service, Robie Beatty, a lawyer, said that after the political deadlock and disrespect shown to Obama during his presidency and the long and hateful campaign, she was only ""kind of sorta"" surprised that Trump won.  Black people have endured a lot of struggle; this is just the latest example, she said. Just as she prayed before, she would continue to pray, she said.  ""If we believe in the Lord, we have a way to get through it,"" she said.   Hamil Harris, Valerie Strauss, Sydney Trent and Julie Zauzmer contributed to this report.  "

While repeal now seems likely, that may take Congress months. A replacement for the 2010 health care law could take even longer, and may retain some of its features. Republicans are saying they want to protect people who now are covered from losing health care in the shift. While Congress labors, look for the Trump administration to use its regulatory powers to make changes. Voters ""don't want Washington to fix Obamacare, they want to make health care affordable,"" said House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, whose committee oversees much of health care. ""I'm confident we will have more truly affordable health care for just as many Americans.""  ""It's our goal to dismantle Obamacare and actually focus on lowering the cost of coverage for people,"" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., a member of the Republican leadership. ""It's a commitment on behalf of Congress and the president-elect to get this done."" The rhetoric may sound familiar, but the circumstances couldn't be more different. Up until now, repeated Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act have been practice runs. This will be real, and so will the consequences. Trump will have a four-year term in the White House, but Congress faces the voters again in two years. With HealthCare.gov's sign-up season underway, there's little chance the program will come to a crashing halt. Still, that's not very reassuring for people like Lodiza LePore of Bennington, Vermont, a photographer who pays about $80 a month for her policy. The coverage is skimpy, she says, but it's there if she has a health problem.  ""I think they are just going to destroy everything Obama has done, and that's going to leave a lot of people with no health care,"" said LePore. ""It's going to turn this country into a Third World country."" As many as 30 million people could be affected. Most directly hit would be some 10 million who like LePore have private coverage through the law's subsidized markets, and about 9 million covered under its Medicaid expansion. Another 5 million to 9 million people who buy individual policies outside the health law markets are exposed to its ups and downs. Republicans don't want to make millions uninsured, said Mike Leavitt, Health and Human Services secretary for former President George W. Bush. ""There is a widely held aspiration that people have health insurance, and that the solution isn't simply to say that it's OK if some people don't,"" he said. Can they deliver? There's no final GOP plan and no decisions have been made. But here's a look at some of the major pieces in a complex puzzle: ___ REPEAL: THE 'EASY' PART? Republicans don't have 60 votes in the Senate, so to pass a repeal bill they would have to use special budget-related procedures that allow a simple majority to work its will. There's a template for that in the GOP repeal bill that Obama vetoed this year. Trump would sign it. But using the special procedures means Congress must first pass a budget, which can take several months. Going that route also would leave in place parts of the health care law that are not related to the budget. Congress may delay the effective date of a repeal law to give it time to pass a replacement for the ACA. ___ REPLACE: A CHANCE FOR BIPARTISANSHIP?  ""Obamacare's"" requirement that individuals get insurance or face fines doesn't stand a chance, but other provisions would likely survive in a replacement bill. That includes keeping young adults on parental plans until age 26 and doing away with lifetime dollar limits on coverage. Republicans also want to avoid a return to the days when people were denied coverage because of medical problems. They would protect those who maintain ""continuous"" coverage and fund ""high-risk"" insurance pools for patients who fall through the cracks. House Speaker Paul Ryan has proposed tax credits to help people buy health insurance. Republicans and Democrats may also be able to find common ground on dealing with the health law's Medicaid expansion, which a number of GOP-led states have adopted. ""Medicaid is going to be the crucial issue,"" said GOP economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin. ""There is a practical political reality there."" Democrats are going to be striving to keep as many people covered as possible. A replacement bill could take a couple of years to hash out. ___ TRUMP UNILATERAL While Congress labors away, expect the Trump administration to take administrative and regulatory actions to chip away at his predecessor's signature law, or reshape it. Those could include making it harder for people to sign up for coverage outside of open-enrollment season, supporting legislation that would waive tax penalties for uninsured people in communities with no choice of insurers, or even supporting a lawsuit by GOP lawmakers that challenges some of the law's subsidies. ___  'POTTERY BARN' RULE The old retail store rule is ""if you break it, you buy it."" The same applies to health care. Obama and the Democrats have paid a political price for trying to fix the problems of the uninsured and having some of those fixes generate their own complications. The same could happen to Republicans if they're not careful.  ""If people get mad at you, they will find a way to get you,"" said GOP economist Gail Wilensky, a former Medicare administrator. ""If you really miss the mark of where the people are, they will get you."" ___ This story has been corrected to say that Rep. Kevin Brady is from Texas, not California.

I'm not by nature an angry person, so I will try the latter. Trump remade the political map with a huge surge of support from working-class whites, particularly in rural communities. Let me be honest, this is a world I don't know -- and many people probably don't know very well -- and that's part of the problem. We have all managed to ignore the pain of rural America.  An essay on the satirical website Cracked, by David Wong (who grew up in a small town in Illinois), gives voice to the rage of rural Americans. ""The whole goddamned world revolves around [America's cities],"" he wrote. The vast majority of the country's pop culture is all about city dwellers. Most new movies, shows, songs and games are about New York or Los Angeles or Chicago or some fantasy version of them. Nearly every trend comes from a metropolis. All the hot new industries are in hip cities. ""If you live in [rural America], that f---ing sucks,"" he wrote. Cities get disproportionate attention from media and other elites, who also all live in and around a handful of cities. Wong writes that Hurricane Katrina, in the popular imagination, is all about New Orleans. ""To watch the news (or the multiple movies and TV shows about it), you'd barely hear about how the storm utterly steamrolled rural Mississippi. . . . What's newsworthy about a bunch of . . . hillbillies crying over a flattened trailer? New Orleans is culturally important. It matters."" ""To those ignored, suffering people, Donald Trump is a brick chucked through the window of the elites. 'Are you a------- listening now?'""     Early on the morning of Nov. 9, Republican President-elect Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York, declaring victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)    [Trump won because college-educated Americans are out of touch]   In fact,  many more people died in New Orleans  than in rural Mississippi,    and the bulk of physical destruction took place there  as well .   And there was a lot of coverage of the devastation of rural areas. But the broader point is true:  Cities capture our attention in ways that rural communities do not.  Over the past three or four decades, the United States has sorted itself into a highly efficient meritocracy, where people from all economic walks of life can move up the ladder of achievement and income (usually ending up in cities). It is better than using race, gender or bloodlines as the key to wealth and power, but it does create its own problems. As in any system, some people won't ascend to the top, and because it is a meritocracy, it is easy to believe that that's justified. A meritocracy can be blind to the fact that some people don't make it because they have been unlucky in some way. More profoundly, it can be morally blind. Even those who score poorly on tests or have bad work habits are human beings deserving of attention and respect. The Republicans' great success in rural communities has been that even though they often champion economic policies that would not help these people -- indeed, policies that often hurt them -- they demonstrate respect, by identifying with them culturally, religiously and emotionally. So, the great sin of the modern left is elitism. But another sin was also highlighted in this election: racism. Trump won among whites without a college degree by a staggering 39 points, but he won those with a college education by four points as well. He won working-class whites but also middle-class whites. As Nick Confessore and Nate Cohn put it in the New York Times, ""He electrified the country's white majority and mustered its full strength against long-term demographic decay.""  In this respect, Trump is not unusual. Right-wing populism is on the rise across many Western countries. It is rising in countries in Northern Europe, where economic growth has been robust; in Germany, where manufacturing jobs have stayed strong; and in France, where the state provides many protections for the working class. The one common trait everywhere is that white majority populations have faced a recent influx of immigrants.          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump is doing on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

Consider, for example, that 72 percent of registered Republican voters still doubt that Barack Obama was born in the United States, according to an August NBC News poll. Donald Trump's political skill was to speak defiantly about both of these sensitive issues -- elitism and race -- in simple, direct and politically incorrect ways that connected with white voters, particularly white men. But in doing so, he also terrified tens of millions of other Americans. It is important that we have a serious conversation about elitism and rural communities. But it is also important that we not shy away from a conversation about race. There are other ignored and suffering people in the United States as well.

Obama saluted the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers for rallying from behind to defeat the Golden State Warriors and end a Cleveland pro sports title drought stretching back to 1964. Obama honored the Cavs on the South Lawn of the White House, squeezing in another sports champion before he leaves office. He opened with: ""That's right. I said world champion and Cleveland in the same sentence."" The Cavs came back from a 3-1 deficit to win the championship against a Warriors team that set an NBA record for wins during the regular season.  ""The first team in history to dig themselves out of a hole like that,"" Obama said. ""The comeback was remarkable, and you learn about people when they're down."" That comment came shortly after Obama met with Donald Trump, who won the White House race to succeed him after a campaign in which the president declared the businessman unfit. Obama singled out several players for praise, but particularly focused on LeBron James, who won the Most Valuable Player award during the championship series. Obama called James one of the greatest players of all time and said it's not just power and speed that make James great, but his unselfishness and work ethic. ""You saw it in those last three games,"" the president said. Obama said the Cavs also exemplified a growing generation of athletes who are using their platforms to speak out. He noted, as examples, that Kevin Love has worked to combat sexual assault and James has worked to reduce gun violence. He said the team met earlier Thursday with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett to discuss steps the Cavs are taking to help build better relations between law enforcement and the Cleveland community.  ""It is part of a league-wide effort to build stronger communities all across the country, including holding open conversations so we can begin to bridge divides,"" Obama said.

Stewart, the one-time chairman of Trump's Virginia campaign, said that despite the fact that Clinton beat Trump by nearly five percentage points in Virginia, Republican primary voters will reward him for being Trump's biggest cheerleader in the state. And he figures the Trump administration will be in accord with his stance that illegal immigrants who have committed crimes be deported. ""If you're an illegal alien in Prince William County, I'd get out,"" said Stewart, who chairs the county's board of supervisors. ""It's the very first thing I'm going to do with a friendly Trump administration. Now we're going to find out where each and every one of these guys is, and we're going hunt them down and we're going to deport them."" ""It's a game changer,"" Stewart said of Trump's win. ""It just propelled me into front-runner status for governor.""     Donald Trump's presidential campaign fired its Virginia state co-chairman, Corey Stewart, on Oct. 10 after he took part in a protest in front of Republican National Committee headquarters. The protest drew dozens of Trump supporters. (WUSA)   It's not at all certain that Trump's White House victory will help Stewart in next year's race for governor in Virginia. Trump's loss in Virginia could benefit Republican candidates who kept their distance from the presidential candidate. That number includes Ed Gillespie, the best known of the four who have declared so far. The others in the race are U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman and state Sen. Frank Wagner. Virginia and New Jersey are the only states holding gubernatorial races next year. In New Jersey, where Gov. Chris Christie (R) will leave office because of term limits, the Republican brand has been tarnished by the Bridgegate scandal, analysts say. That makes Virginia the first real test to be faced by a Republican Party in the coming Trump era. In a quandary that mirrors the national GOP's, the state party will have to contend with a three-way fracture between the establishment wing, Trump supporters and the tea party. One great unknown -- how well Trump governs -- looms over all of it. But his victory is already shaping the issues on the front burner, the candidates and the people who ultimately will turn out to vote. Trump's victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton means her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, will not vacate his Senate seat. Had Kaine become vice president, there would have been a Senate race on the ballot in 2017 to fill the remainder of his term. Democrats -- Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) chief among them -- had been counting on a Senate contest next year to energize Washington-oriented Democrats in Northern Virginia, who have helped turn the state blue for the past three presidential elections but do not turn out as faithfully during off-year elections. A Senate race would have greatly boosted prospects for Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, so far the only Democrat running to succeed the governor, McAuliffe said. A Senate race also could have thinned the Republican field. Wittman had mulled bowing out of the governor's race to seek Kaine's seat if it came open in 2017. With that opportunity gone, the field stays crowded -- something that could benefit Stewart if the other three split the mainstream Republican vote. The four GOP contenders have relationships with the president-elect that are varied and complicated, to say the least. At one extreme is Stewart, a brasher-than-Trump figure who embraced the nominee with such abandon that the campaign ultimately gave him the heave-ho. At the other extreme, Gillespie, one-time counselor to President George W. Bush who stumped with Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, but studiously avoided appearing with Trump. Wittman and Wagner fell between, belatedly getting on board with Trump but showing up at his rallies and lending their names to his state leadership team. Those differences -- already the source of caustic sniping not just between Stewart and Gillespie, but also between Stewart and the Trump campaign leaders who fired him -- could be critical to winning over voters in the June GOP primary and the general election a year from now. Whether it pays to play up ties to Trump or keep him at arm's length will depend in large part on how well Trump performs as president. The fact that Republicans will choose their nominee this year in a statewide primary rather than in a closed convention should give the edge to a more moderate candidate. But the electorate that votes in off-years tends to be smaller and more conservative than in presidential contests.  ""From the Democrats' standpoint, it could wind up being a plus for the governor's race,"" said state Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax). ""The president-elect has got a tendency to say things best left unsaid. That may help him with the base in middle America. But we ain't talking anymore about Kansas or the area between Pittsburgh and Philly. We're talking about Virginia, a state [Clinton] carried by 186,000 votes."" But former Republican attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II, who narrowly lost the 2013 governor's race to McAuliffe, said Trump's national victory will make it hard for Democrats to demonize his supporters. ""Certainly the Democrats are gearing up to try to wrap him around Republicans' necks as a huge negative,"" he said. ""That looks pretty dubious today."" In fact, when Wagner formally launched his bid for governor Wednesday, he promoted himself as ""statewide Trump campaign co-chairman."" He was one of 17 co-chairmen, as was Wittman. Wittman and Gillespie walked a finer line. After winning reelection to Congress on Tuesday, Wittman issued a statement that did not mention Trump by name. ""The Congressman is excited about Republican victories across the board,"" said Wittman's political director, Garrison Coward. As the election results rolled in Tuesday night, Gillespie was at a victory party for his friend Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock, where he watched Trump's improbable rise flash across his Twitter feed. Asked about the impact of Trump on the Virginia governor's race, Gillespie said he was focused on his own campaign. ""I'm running for the Republican nomination for governor on my ideas, my plans, on what I believe we need to do,"" he said. ""I'll put it forward, and I'll let the voters decide."" Trump's victory exposed the extent of the discontent among many, Gillespie said. ""I think it shows you that there are a lot of voters out there who are very concerned about being left behind in this economy, the frustration over stagnant wages and the economy,"" he said. Gillespie, who came close to toppling Sen. Mark R. Warner in 2014, has positioned himself as someone who can unite a splintered GOP and appeal to swing voters. During and after his Senate bid, he courted tea party activists as well as the GOP establishment, racking up campaign donations and endorsements. Stewart contends that Gillespie will pay for keeping his distance from the nominee. ""Ed Gillespie treated Donald Trump like he had typhoid,"" Stewart said. During the campaign, Stewart positioned himself as more Trump than Trump himself. Critics, including some inside the Trump campaign, accused Stewart of grandstanding. In July, when Stewart blamed Clinton and Northam for a Dallas police massacre, the campaign disavowed his comments. In October, it fired him for participating in a protest outside of Republican National Committee headquarters and accusing ""establishment pukes"" of starving the Virginia campaign of resources.  [Trump's Virginia chairman blames Clinton, Northam for Dallas massacre]  Stewart never blamed Trump for his firing, saying it was the work of the RNC. He wore his ouster as a badge of honor, using it as the basis of a fundraising appeal for his anti-establishment campaign.  [You're fired: Trump campaign dumps Virginia state chair Corey Stewart]  Mike Rubino, Trump's senior Virginia adviser, said Stewart should not expect support from the president-elect. ""To be honest, Mr. Trump doesn't even know who Corey Stewart is,"" Rubino said. ""He went rogue. He never followed orders. He never did what the campaign asked him to do. He was so preoccupied with running for governor that we had to fire him. . . . This guy was a cancer to the organization in Virginia, and we've been paying for it ever since.""  [Trump's Virginia chair: Trump 'acted like a frat boy, as a lot of guys do']  Stewart said he was floored by Rubino's criticism, which he chalked up to finger-pointing over Trump's loss in Virginia, the only Southern state that went blue. ""I worked my tail off"" for Trump, he said. ""If he's looking for a scapegoat, he should look at the establishment that sat on their haunches and diverted [resources] away from Virginia."" John Fredericks, the conservative radio host who became chairman of Trump's Virginia campaign after Stewart's ouster, said Stewart and Gillespie will have to repair their relationships with Trump voters. And for that reason, he said, ""This is a wide-open race.""  Jenna Portnoy contributed to this report. "

Emails from the hacked file of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta also showed the network asking Democrats to suggest questions for an interview with Ted Cruz. The communications could infer a coziness with Democrats, particularly in the wake of previous reports that former CNN contributor and current Democratic National Committee chief Donna Brazile had communicated with the Clinton campaign about potential questions to be asked in campaign forums. But CNN said it does the same with Republicans as part of efforts to present the best interviews.  ""When preparing for interviews, we are regularly sent suggestions from rival campaigns and political parties, both solicited and unsolicited,"" said CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas. ""Casting a wide net to ensure a tough and fair interview isn't just common media practice, it's smart."" She did not immediately provide specific examples of Republicans being asked for similar help. A representative from the Republican National Committee did not respond to a request for comment. WikiLeaks has not similarly targeted Republican officials in their release of private communications. The WikiLeaks communications showed an email chain involving several officials at the Democratic National Committee that discussed Blitzer interviewing Trump in April on the eve of a foreign policy address. It wasn't clear who at CNN had communicated the request. The interview was subsequently cancelled. The email chain had 17 suggested questions, including, ""Would you order U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea, and if so, how quickly?"" and ""Which international organizations should the United States be a member of?"" Another April email, from DNC research director Lauren Dillon to five colleagues titled ""Cruz on CNN,"" said that ""CNN is looking for questions. Please send some topical/interesting ones."" Frank Sesno, a former CNN Washington bureau chief and now a professor at George Washington University, said that when he was working as a journalist, he would ask political opponents for similar help.  ""When doing research for an interview, you go behind enemy lines to both learn what the opposition is thinking and what the pressure points might be,"" Sesno said. ""If they were colluding with them or trading some kind of favors, that would be different."" For example, giving a candidate questions that they would be asked in an interview or suggesting they could get easy treatment in return for some help would be wrong, he said. Similarly, media ethicist Kelly McBride at the Poynter Institute said she had no problem with the practice, as long as CNN is doing the same for others -- like asking the Trump campaign for suggestions when interviewing Clinton.  ""The side that is working against a candidate has targeted a certain group of voters and is pushing a specific message to these voters,"" McBride said. ""As a journalist, you want to speak to these voters in a way that is informed and reasonable."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
