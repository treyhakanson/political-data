Ali is a Muslim who lives and works in one of the most diverse places in the U.S., and yet the ascension of Donald Trump to the White House left her wondering how other Americans really viewed her.  ""Half of America voted one way and half of America voted the other, and you're like, 'Which half am I looking at?'"" she said. ""You become almost like strangers to the people you've worked with. Is this person racist? Do they like me? Do they not like me? Because that's what this election has done."" American Muslims are reeling following the election of Trump, whose campaign was rife with anti-Muslim rhetoric and proposals that included banning Muslims from entering the country and heightened surveillance of mosques across the nation. Now, among many of the 3.3 million Muslims living in the U.S., there is significant fear, along with some reports of harassment; one hijab-wearing student at San Diego State University said she was briefly choked by suspects who made remarks about Trump's victory.  ""There are lots and lots of people who aren't going out of the house,"" said Eboo Patel, a Muslim who heads the Interfaith Youth Core, a Chicago-based organization that works with colleges and government officials to build interreligious relationships. At New York University late last week, hundreds of people sat shoulder-to-shoulder on a grand staircase of a student center to express solidarity after the word ""Trump!"" was scrawled on the door of a Muslim prayer space at the school. Students spoke of friends who wore headscarves or other traditional clothing and were afraid to take public transportation home for fear of being harassed. Sana Mayat, a 21-year-old senior who wears the hijab, said the election made her realize ""there was a large part of this country that didn't want me here.""  ""There is an intense state of anxiety about the future,"" said Rami Nashashibi, a parent of three and executive director of Chicago's Inner-City Muslim Action Network, which has been inundated with calls seeking support since Election Day. ""I grappled with the conversation I had to have with my children."" The outcome was especially bitter following an unprecedented voter registration drive by American Muslims, including get-out-the-vote sermons at mosques and the creation of a political action committee, Emerge USA, to mobilize Arabs and Muslims. Enas Almadhwahi, a 28-year-old Yemeni immigrant who has been in the U.S. since 2008, became a citizen this year and voted for the first time. To mark the occasion, she brought her 7-year-old daughter, along with some co-workers.  ""At that moment, I was so happy,"" said Almadhwahi, who lives in Brooklyn, New York, and works at an Arab-American community organization. The next day, when she told her daughter Trump had won, the girl cried. A friend had told the little girl that if Trump won, it would mean they couldn't talk anymore.  ""Everything feels like it's upside down,"" Almadhwahi said. ""I still like to hope Trump will change his words about Muslims."" Trump's policy plans remain a mystery, but his administration could radically reshape the Justice Department, which has been an ally under President Barack Obama in protecting Muslim civil rights. Trump could also repeal a key Obama program that prevents the deportation of some immigrants, including Muslims, living in the country illegally. Muslims had far from a perfect relationship with the Obama administration. For years, the president kept the community largely at arms-length, sending surrogates to meet with them amid a stubborn misapprehension, fueled in part by his critics, that Obama, a Christian, was secretly Muslim. Many U.S. Muslim leaders were uncomfortable with his foreign policy in Iraq and elsewhere, and objected to his program to fight extremism at home, saying the focus on Muslims ignored other threats from right-wing, anti-government extremists. Still, Muslim leaders had built solid ties with many government officials. Now, they face not only the loss of those connections, but potentially a closed door to their concerns.  ""The friends we have are going to be fewer,"" said Farhana Khera, president of the California-based civil rights group Muslim Advocates, which has represented clients suing over the New York Police Department's surveillance of American Muslims. ""I think we'll be very much in a defensive posture."" Since the election, mosques and Muslim groups have organized community meetings and conference calls focused on how to move forward. The Indiana-based Islamic Society of North America, the largest communal Muslim group in the U.S., issued a statement inviting Trump to engage with the community, saying ""many American Muslims are traumatized by the result of the election and the fear of what is to come."" The group said there was no immediate response from Trump's office. Sheik Omar Suleiman, resident scholar at the Valley Ranch Islamic Center in Irving, Texas, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an anti-defamation group, distributed suggested sermons for juma, or Friday prayers at mosques, stressing Quranic verses about remaining strong in the face of hardships.  ""Have hope in the people because Allah may turn their hearts toward you,"" was among the verses they cited. Faisal R. Khan, founder of a youth advocacy and peace organization near Chapel Hill, North Carolina, attended four Trump campaign rallies over the last year, in part to protest but also to speak with the Republican's supporters. Khan lived years ago in the Midwest, where he knew people who had grown resentful over losing Rust Belt jobs, and said he understands what drew so many working-class whites to the president-elect. Khan has created a Facebook page called ""Talk To Me America,"" hoping to start a conversation that can combat anti-Muslim bias.  ""Peaceful protest is good, but at a certain point, we have to sit down and talk,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, we're all human beings. We're all Americans."" ____ Zoll is the AP religion reporter. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Elliott County, Kentucky, had followed the rest of the country into a deep recession, and Pennington ""thought somebody young could bring new ideas in for the country.""  ""But we didn't get new ideas. We didn't get anything,"" she says. On Tuesday, Pennington was one of the voters who helped the county shift from voting for Democrats since its founding in 1869 to choosing Republican Donald Trump in 2016. Seventy percent backed Trump in a county Barack Obama won twice. In interviews Thursday with The Associated Press, Elliott County residents provided clues to the results that handed Trump the presidency: They felt left behind the nation's recovery, disappointed in Obama and infuriated by Clinton's vow to put coal miners ""out of business."" They like the way Trump talks and they like what they heard him say: That he'll create jobs, and correct what they see as the wrongs of NAFTA and corrupt government. The New York City businessman made the sale with these rural voters who still reject congressional and state Republicans when there are other choices.  ""If Trump was able to win in Elliott County, that really underscores how his message resonated across the country,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky's longest-serving U.S. senator -- who has never been able to win Elliott County in his 31-year Senate career. ""He ended up being able to do what most of us thought was impossible, which was to appeal to significant numbers of white working-class voters, many of them, I suppose, never had voted for any Republican before."" In theory, Pennington and her neighbors could be the best-represented Americans in Washington next year. They are Trump's base -- nearly all-white and working class. Despite vexing McConnell with its ""resistance,"" the county by definition has as its advocate the most powerful man in the Senate. The House of Representatives and the White House are also Republican. But what residents of the county's hollows want from those soon to be in power is rooted in its coal-infused past. The aftermaths of the Civil War and the Great Depression hit hard here, offset by the New Deal's government-supported projects, organized labor, agriculture and the coal industry -- now more a cultural influence than the economic engine it was for generations. That's why Clinton's remark at a town hall event in West Virginia -- ""We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,"" stung -- even after she apologized, said U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers, a Republican who represents the county.  ""The super PACs did an excellent job of playing that quote over and over and over, and that's all anyone could think about after a while,"" said state Rep. Rocky Adkins, a Democrat who represents Elliott in the state House. ""That tells people, 'That person is against me. That person is not for my family."" Over the last decade while most of the country pulled itself out of the recession, Elliott County did not. AK Steel, one of the largest employers in the region, idled its plant in nearby Ashland. The Big Sandy power plant in Louisa, which once propped up the eastern Kentucky economy with its massive coal purchases, started using natural gas. Now one of the county's largest employers is a state prison just outside of town, and many of the county's residents have to travel out of state to find work. Unemployment in Elliott County stands at 11 percent, more than twice the national rate of 4.9 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Median household income is just north of $28,000, a bit more than half of the national median. More than 85 percent of registered voters in Elliott County are Democrats. Republicans make up 8 percent. In Tuesday's election, Elliott went with other parts of the state to elect Trump and send Rogers, who was unopposed, back to Washington. But it's still a rebel county in some ways. Trump was the only Republican to win a contested race in Elliott County. Jim Gray, a gay, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate, beat Republican Sen. Rand Paul by more than 12 percentage points in the county, while Paul won re-election. And though 17 incumbent Democrats lost their state House seats and handed Republicans control for the first time in 96 years, Elliott County re-elected Adkins with more than 85 percent of the vote. With Trump, Pennington said she finally found a candidate she believed spoke directly to her.  ""He talked and talked like the other candidates would have liked to have said, but they never did. He was just plainspoken,"" she said. For Phillip Justice, Trump fits snugly into his worldview. The 54-year-old retired state worker and small business owner sees injustice everywhere, whether it is who starts for the local high school basketball team or his son's ability to get a college scholarship.  ""I'm tired of putting in my 8, 10 hours a day and being dependable, and you go home and your neighbor has got as much or more that don't do nothing,"" he said. ""I look for (Trump) to say, 'Hey, you people that are on the draw, you are going to go to work and earn your check.'"" Justice is not a Republican voter, although he votes for Republicans. Eugene Dickerson, an Elliott County native who owns a coal mine in West Virginia, has been voting for Republican candidates since 2000. He said Trump's surprising surge there could be attributed to the county's conservative mindset, abetted by its abundance of churches, that unites people around issues like abortion and gay marriage.  ""I think appointment of Supreme Court really was the driving force behind Donald Trump carrying Elliott County,"" he said. Others see Trump as someone who represents their interests.  ""I'm not expecting (Trump) to be a pastor,"" Justice said. ""But I'm not expecting him to be a dictator."" ___ Beam reported from Sandy Hook, KY, and can be followed on Twitter at https://twitter.com/adambeam.

Several of Catalonia's lawmakers are facing court cases sought by the Spanish government for having staged a secession referendum in 2014 in disobedience of a court order and for other regional laws designed to prepare a path toward secession. Those politicians include Catalonia's former regional president, Artur Mas, and the current speaker of the regional parliament, Carme Forcadell, who both attended Sunday's protest. Grassroots groups said they organized a fleet of around 150 buses to bring protesters in from the countryside and smaller towns to participate in the rally held near the Plaza de Espana in Barcelona. Jordi Cuixart, the president of Omnium, a separatist grassroots group, told the crowd that teemed with pro-independence flags that he had ""a message for the Spanish state.""  ""If you attack our democratically elected representatives, you attack our institutions, all our people and our sovereignty, and we will never allow that,"" Cuixart said. ""Our cause is democracy and we will never let our elected representatives down."" Separatist sentiment has been on the rise in recent years in the wealthy northeastern region that speaks Catalan along with Spanish. Separatists complain that Catalonia pays more taxes than it should to the central government. In 2014, then-president Mas ignored an order by Spain's Constitutional Court to suspend a mock referendum on Catalan secession. Mas' regional government went ahead with the informal poll anyway, staffing voting stations with volunteers. Nearly 90 percent of the ballots were in favor of independence, but only 2 million of the 5.4 million eligible voters cast ballots. Polls consistently show that Catalonia's 7.5 million residents are about equally divided on breaking century-old ties with the rest of Spain. Catalonia's current regional president, Carles Puigdemont, plans to call another referendum on independence by September.  ""These are situations that can only be solved politically,"" Puigdemont said at a separate rally in his home village on Sunday. Spain's government has consistently said that regions don't have the constitutional right to hold a referendum concerning the integrity of the country. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with The Associated Press that this ""would lead to a kind of detente in Europe."" But unfortunately, he said, Russia now sees ""NATO's muscles ... getting bigger and bigger and closer and closer to Russian borders."" At a NATO summit in July, the Western alliance said it is building up positions in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in response to what it sees as escalating tensions with Russia. The United States is sending 1,000 troops to Poland next year. Trump has praised Putin as a strong leader and suggested that the U.S. could abandon its NATO commitments, which include mutual defense in case of attack. The president-elect says NATO was created to confront a threat -- the Soviet Union -- that no longer exists and has called the alliance ""obsolete"" and a bad deal for America. He argues that the U.S. gets too little out of decades-old security partnerships like NATO, which is anchored in Europe but traditionally led by the United States. Peskov, who is considered one of Putin's closest aides, called NATO ""an instrument of confrontation."" When its forces are being enlarged and deploying closer and closer to Russia's borders, he said, ""we do not feel ourselves safe.""  ""Of course, we have to take measures to counter,"" Peskov said. As ""confidence-building measures"" to reduce U.S.-Russia tensions in a Trump presidency ""let's say slow down or withdrawal of NATO's military potential from our borders potentially would ease this situation,"" he said. It's highly unusual for Peskov to travel abroad separately from Putin, but he is chairman of the board of the Russian Chess Federation and came to New York to attend Friday's opening of the world championship match between Russia's Sergei Karyakin and Norway's Magnus Carlsen. The organizers invited Trump to attend but he did not show up. On other global issues, Peskov said in an interview Thursday at the venue for the championship that there is no possibility of ""a breakthrough"" to end the more than five-year Syria conflict unless the so-called moderate opposition is separated from ""terrorist groups"" including the Nusra Front and Islamic State extremists. The U.S. was supposed to do this under a Russia-U.S.-brokered cease-fire, but Peskov said Washington, unfortunately, was unable to do so. The cease-fire collapsed in September as the Syrian army launched an offensive on rebel-held eastern Aleppo under the cover of Russian warplanes. Peskov said if the cease-fire agreement is implemented, ""there will be another chance for a breakthrough.""  ""We are still convinced that without real interaction, real cooperation between Moscow and Washington, it will be very hard to make further steps in a political settlement in Syria,"" Peskov said. ""Unfortunately, we don't have cooperation there."" Peskov said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are in constant contact, ""but unfortunately, sometimes it seems that not everyone in Washington wants a real breakthrough on the road ... to political settlement."" He refused to say which U.S. officials Moscow believes are blocking progress to ending the conflict. Russia, meanwhile, is continuing to support the Syrian government and army ""because we have only two alternatives ... either we have President (Bashar) Assad in Damascus or we have Nusra and Islamic State,"" Peskov said. Putin's spokesman addressed another issue which sparked a serious downturn in U.S.-Russian relations and U.S. sanctions -- Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, which led to a conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 9,600 people. A 2015 agreement has helped reduce the scale of fighting, but clashes have continued and efforts to negotiate a political settlement have stalled. Peskov disputed calling Russia's action in Crimea ""annexation,"" insisting it is a region of the Russian Federation and stressing that ""no one in Russia -- never -- will be ready to start any kind of discussion about Crimea."" Asked how the issue could be addressed differently in a Trump administration, Peskov said, ""we understand that it will take time for our partners in Europe, for our partners here in the United States to understand that. We are patient enough to wait until this understanding occurs here in Washington, in the States, in Europe."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told reporters he made the request during his Capitol Hill meeting with Trump a day earlier.  ""That's the kind of thing that I hope he'll be looking at, and we're helping him look at -- things that he can do quickly on his own,"" McConnell said. ""Because much of what President Obama did that slowed our economy he did on his own, either executive orders or regulations.""  ""So one of the ways to get this economy growing again, I think, is to deal with regulatory changes,"" McConnell added. Trump touted the stalled Keystone project during a late October campaign swing through Florida, saying: ""We're going to approve energy infrastructure projects like the Keystone pipeline and many more."" He listed the project among his top priorities for the first 100 days of his administration, saying it could provide ""a lot of jobs, a lot of good things."" McConnell said he's confident the new Trump presidency will ""get off to a good start."" Obama rejected the proposed Keystone XL pipeline last November, declaring it would have undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal at the center of his environmental legacy. The 1,700-mile pipeline would carry oil from tar sands in Alberta, Canada, to refineries in the Houston area, passing through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. The $7 billion pipeline has been a contentious issue. Project supporters, including unions and lawmakers from both parties, tout the jobs it would create and demand its approval, while environmentalists urged the president to reject it, saying it would carry dirty, carbon-intensive oil. Obama's decision marked an unambiguous victory for environmental activists who spent years denouncing the pipeline, lobbying the administration and even chaining themselves to tractors to make their point about the threat posed by dirty fossil fuels. It also placed the president and fellow Democrats in direct confrontation with Republicans and energy advocates heading into the 2016 presidential election. The president said he agreed with a State Department conclusion that Keystone wouldn't advance U.S. national interests. He lamented that both political parties had ""overinflated"" Keystone into a proxy battle for climate change but glossed over his own role in allowing the controversy to drag out over several national elections.  ""This pipeline would neither be a silver bullet for the economy, as was promised by some, nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others,"" he said. McConnell said Friday that Obama's opposition was ""a bow to his extreme environmental supporters."" The Kentucky senator used the widely disputed figure of 20,000 jobs to be created immediately from the pipeline. In fact, the project's developer, Calgary-based TransCanada, has said the pipeline could create as many as 13,000 construction jobs -- 6,500 a year over two years. The State Department put the number of construction jobs at 3,900 on an annual basis. That figure doesn't include an estimated 4,000 workers that TransCanada says it has hired for a 485-mile southern segment of the pipeline already under construction and nearing completion. The prospect of an all-Republican government next year boosts the chances for Keystone. McConnell said Republican leaders are still sorting out priorities for next year, adding: ""The American people expect us to pursue the agenda that we talked about, and I'm confident that's what we're going to do."" McConnell also said Friday he expects the next Congress to take up legislation to revamp the nation's tax system.  ""I think he's very interested in tax reform,"" McConnell said of Trump. ""My assumption is we'll deal with taxes in a comprehensive way in some kind of major tax reform bill sometime in the coming year."" ___ Associated Press Writers Donna Cassata and Matthew Daly contributed to this report.

""Four years is a long time from now,"" said the 75-year-old Vermont independent, noting that he faces re-election to the Senate in 2018. But he added: ""We'll take one thing at a time, but I'm not ruling out anything."" Democrats have begun postelection soul searching, with Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., urging the party to embrace a more populist economic message. As some Democrats protested across the country, the party's liberal wing began jockeying for power, arguing that Clinton's loss could be attributed to her reluctance to fully focus on economic inequality and tougher Wall Street regulations.  ""The final results may have divided us -- but the entire electorate embraced deep, fundamental reform of our economic system and our political system,"" Warren told the AFL-CIO on Thursday. ""Working families across this country are deeply frustrated about an economy and a government that doesn't work for them."" Warren laid out the principles she believes should govern Democrats during the Trump era: Standing up to bigotry, pushing for economic equality and combatting the influence of Wall Street.  ""We will fight back against attacks on Latinos, African Americans, women, Muslims, immigrants, disabled Americans -- on anyone. Whether Donald Trump sits in a glass tower or sits in the White House, we will not give an inch on this, not now, not ever,"" she said. The sweeping Republican gains have thrown the future of the party into uncertainty, as Democrats process the scale of their losses and try to figure out the best way to come back in the 2018 elections. The Democratic National Committee may end up being ground zero for the fight, with no clear successor in line to replace interim chairwoman Donna Brazile. Sanders is backing Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. Warren and Sanders were articulating the frustrations among many liberals in the aftermath of Trump's stunning triumph over Hillary Clinton. But their influence underscores another problem facing Democrats: Many of the party's leading voices are senior citizens, older than their core constituencies of young and minority voters. Warren is 67. Sanders said that millions of working-class voters' decision to back Trump was ""an embarrassment"" to the party and Democrats must take a strong stand against the role of corporate interests in politics. He said the party as a whole was unable to make a strong enough case to struggling workers, particularly in the industrial Midwest, who sided with Trump.  ""You cannot be a party which, on one hand, says we're in favor of working people, we're in favor of the needs of young people, but we don't quite have the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class. People do not believe that. You've got to decide which side you're on."" While Clinton pushed for greater financial regulation and higher taxes on the wealthy, she shied away from his more populist rhetoric. And she also largely ignored white working-class male voters in favor of trying to boost turnout among minority and female supporters. The decision infuriated former President Bill Clinton who argued to campaign officials that they should pay greater attention to the voters who twice boosted her husband to office. During the long primary slog against Sanders, he insisted the campaign make stops in Wisconsin, which ended up being the last time either Clinton appeared in the state. Wisconsin voted for Trump, shocking many in her campaign. ___ Follow Ken Thomas on Twitter at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/11/09/political-commentators-remember-to-turn-your-clocks-back/	Political commentators, remember to turn your clocks back	I plan to write more soon on Donald Trump and the presidency, but here I wanted to make a more lighthearted post about the politics of changing administrations. Longtime readers may remember that on the night of the 2008 presidential election, when the election was called for Barack Obama, I published this snarky post: Memo to Political Commentators for the Next Four Years With a switch from Republican to Democratic control of the White House a few weeks away, I thought I would remind political commentators of the new ground rules. 1) Republicans Must Now Oppose Executive Power; Democrats Must Be In Favor Of It. In the last few years, Republicans have been the defenders of executive power: A muscular executive has been needed to fight the war on terror. On the other hand, Democrats have opposed a strong executive on the ground that it threatens the rule of law. Please note that these arguments must now switch. Republicans must now talk of the dangers of executive power; Democrats must now speak of how a strong and agile executive branch is necessary to a modern democracy. 2) Republicans Must Now Oppose Judicial Confirmations; Democrats Must Be In Favor. In the last few years, Republicans wanted an up-or-down vote on judicial nominees; one of their leading blogs on the judicial confirmations was ConfirmThem.com. On the other hand, Democrats focused on the importance of carefully evaluating judicial candidates. Please note that these arguments must now switch, too. Republicans should now visit RejectThem.com (still an available domain name, btw -- won't be for long!), and Democrats should emphasize the need for a quick up or down vote. 3) Republicans Must Now Favor Legislative Oversight; Democrats Must Now Oppose It. You get the point by now. Yup, everyone has to switch sides on this one, too. If we all stick to the script, in 6 months the old arguments of the Bush era will be long forgotten. (Oh, and extra credit to those who charge the other side with hypocrisy for changing sides without noting that they have changed sides, too.) Given that post, I feel obligated to remind commentators to turn their clocks back -- to 2008. Trump being a different kind of president will likely interrupt that easy partisan narrative somewhat. But for a lot of commentators, the old rules will be new again.

Some of Trump's most dramatic undertakings -- such as canceling Obama's ""illegal"" executive actions -- can be done in his first hours as president. Other priorities, such as repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act or building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, will require the approval of Congress, which will be controlled by Republicans but could still squabble over details. Others still could run into political or legal obstacles that may be difficult to overcome.  For Trump, the transition from proposing severe changes on the campaign trail to trying to navigate the complex gears of government to implement them will serve as a jarring early test of his tenure in the White House.  Two of Trump's ideas could probably be realized as early as his first day in office: scrapping executive orders issued by Obama -- including those that shielded from deportation some immigrants who are here illegally -- and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate vanquished Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.   [GOP sweep imperils Obama's signature health-care law]      How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea View Graphic     How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea  The former is a common tactic for new presidents whose predecessors belong to the opposing political party. Obama signed an executive order ending a ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research imposed by George W. Bush early in his first term.  The latter would be a political risk. By going after the opponent he just defeated, Trump could imperil his chances of broadening his appeal to the millions of Americans who did not vote for him.  ""He certainly could do it, but it could have a major, devastating impact on her and would create a very bad precedent like we see in Third World countries"" where election winners often imprison their rivals, said John F. Banzhaf III, professor of public interest law at George Washington University and a scholar on administration law. Repealing the ACA would take an act of Congress, as would levying some types of tariffs on corporations that move operations overseas, ending regulations that limit pollution and coal production, getting rid of gun-free school zones, and renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal. He would have the authority to renegotiate trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement that he has long railed against -- and to withdraw with six months' notice if he wished -- but such a move could be catastrophic for stock markets and the economy. For years, Republicans on Capitol Hill have tried to shred Obama's signature health-care law, only to be stopped by the president. But after holding their majorities, they are finally in position to make it happen in conjunction with the new Republican president.   [Iran nuclear deal could collapse under Trump]  While Trump spent countless hours on the campaign trail assailing the law, he has yet to fully articulate what he would offer as an alternative. Trump said that he would encourage health savings accounts, allow insurers to sell policies across state lines and convert Medicaid from an entitlement program to a block grant to states -- ideas long favored by GOP conservatives. As for the rest of Trump's plan, he has assured supporters that it will be something ""terrific"" that is ""so much better, so much better, so much better.""          1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flared up across the country Wednesday evening as opponents of President-elect Donald Trump expressed dismay with the election results, underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting a fractured country.

Trump also has no power to force Mexico to pay for it, as he has repeatedly promised to do, although he could pressure the Mexican government with threats to limit trade or drug-related law enforcement activities. History shows it can be hard to fulfill vows that sounded easier to make in front of cheering crowds on the campaign trail. For example, Obama immediately issued an executive order closing the military prison for suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, but members of both parties in Congress voted to block its closure. In the final months of Obama's presidency, the prison remains open.  Heavily surveilling mosques in the United States in the way Trump has advocated would require courts to reinterpret constitutional protections and rights. And if he wants to follow through with his proposal to ban most Muslims from entering the country -- which he stopped talking about in the final months of the race even as it remained on his campaign website -- would immediately be challenged in court as either unconstitutional or against current law, legal experts said.  But Trump would probably have the ability to ban a narrower group of Muslims living in certain parts of some countries controlled by Islamic State terrorists because the immigration statutes afford some discretion on national security grounds.  [Donald Trump will have the power to move swiftly on trade promises]  Another category of Trump's promises amounts to changing the priorities of agencies. That would require getting Congress to allocate more money for programs already underway, such as deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records and broader promises to ""fix the Veterans Administration"" and ""start taking care of our military."" In the area of national security, where presidents traditionally have more leeway, Trump could order his top military chiefs to come up with a plan within 30 days to stop the Islamic State, as he has promised. But if the plan would require the deployment of troops to Iraq and possibly an invasion of Syria, a war-weary Congress eventually would need to sign off and agree to fund a large and open-ended increase in military spending. Even if the plan were to rely on the CIA's covert action authority and be carried out in secret, Trump would face limits on what he could do and what the professionals at the CIA, the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies might be willing to do. For example, if he tried to order the use of torture against terrorists, as he has pledged, Trump would immediately run into legal impediments and a buzz-saw of resistance from CIA lawyers and operators still smarting from a decade of revelations and public criticism over waterboarding and secret prisons, intelligence officials said. Trump would have to persuade Congress to overturn the ban on waterboarding instituted by George W. Bush in 2006 and the congressional ban on any interrogations that go beyond the restrictive ones outlined in the Army Field Manual. He could ask the intelligence community and White House lawyers to come up with a new set of harsh interrogation methods that they believe do not violate U.S. law and do not amount to torture, which is prohibited under U.S. and international law, said John Rizzo, longtime acting general counsel at the CIA. But, Rizzo and half a dozen former intelligence officers warned, ""There would be such pushback"" from many at the CIA, given the damage that revelations over extreme measures did to the agency's reputation. At his final campaign rally, in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Monday, Trump said he would put in place ""the largest tax cut since Ronald Reagan"" and offered less specific ideas such as eliminating ""every unnecessary, job-killing regulation,"" protecting religious liberty and rebuilding the military and law enforcement. ""Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration,"" he told the crowd.    Priest reported from Washington.

Reuters/Mike Segar  This opinion piece is by Russell Moore, the president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. The 2016 presidential election is now over, and, in what very few could ever have imagined, Donald Trump is elected president of the United States. No matter what our differences politically or religiously, surely we can all agree that this campaign has been demoralizing and even traumatizing for most of the country. So what should evangelical Christians do now? The first thing, of course, is to pray for our soon-to-be President Trump. The Bible commands us to pray for ""all who are in high positions"" (1 Tim. 2:1-2). Moreover, the Scripture tells us to give ""honor to whom honor is due"" (Rom. 13:7). Many of us have deep differences with our new president, and would have no matter which candidate had been elected, but we must pray that he will succeed in leading our country with wisdom and justice. The sort of conservatism that many of us had hoped for -- a multiethnic, constitutionally anchored, forward-looking conservatism -- has been replaced in the Republican Party by something else. On the one hand, there's a European-style ethno-nationalist populism, opposed by an increasingly leftward progressive movement within the Democratic Party. In both of these movements, moral concerns -- certainly personal character and family stability questions -- are marginalized. We now have a politics of sexual revolution across the board. This means that conservative evangelicals are politically homeless--whether they know it or not.   [White evangelicals voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, exit polls show]   That is not the worst situation we could be in. Political power -- or the illusion of it -- has not always been good for us. Such influence has led us to conform our minds to that of the world about what matters, and who matters, in the long-run of history. We should, as missionary Jim Eliot put it a generation ago, own our ""strangerhood."" What can we do now? We can, first of all, maintain a prophetic clarity that is willing to call to repentance everything that is unjust and anti-Christ, whether that is the abortion culture, the divorce culture, or the racism/nativism culture. We can be the people who tell the truth, whether it helps or hurts our so-called ""allies"" or our so-called ""enemies."" Moreover, no matter what the racial and ethnic divisions in America, we can be churches that demonstrate and embody the reconciliation of the kingdom of God. After all, we are not just part of a coalition but part of a Body -- a Body that is white and black and Latino and Asian, male and female, rich and poor. We are part of a Body joined to a Head who is an Aramaic-speaking Middle Easterner. What affects black and Hispanic and Asian Christians ought to affect white Christians. And the sorts of poverty and social unraveling among the white working class ought to affect black and Hispanic and Asian Christians. We belong to each other because we belong to Christ. The most important lesson we should learn is that the church must stand against the way politics has become a religion, and religion has become politics. We can hear this idolatrous pull even in the apocalyptic language used by many in this election -- as we have seen in every election in recent years --that this election is our ""last chance."" And we can hear it in those who assume that the sort of global upending we see happening in the world-- in Europe, in the Middle East, and now in the United States -- mean a cataclysm before which we should panic.   [If Donald Trump has done anything, he has snuffed out the Religious Right]   Such talk is not worthy of a church that is already triumphant in heaven, and is marching on earth toward the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ. Will we face difficult days ahead? Yes. The religious liberty concerns will continue. The cultural decline we have warned against is now part of every ideological coalition in the country. But the question we must ask is who ""we"" are. We are not, first, Republicans or Democrats, conservatives or progressives. We are not even, first of all, the United States of America. We are the church of the resurrected and triumphant Lord Jesus Christ. We have survived everything from the rage of Nero to that of Middle Eastern terrorist cells. We have, in fact, often done best when we are, what one historian calls, the ""patient ferment"" of a church alive with the Gospel. The church must be, as Martin Luther King Jr. taught us -- the conscience of the state. But we do that from a place of gospel power, not a place of cowering fear. That means that we -- all of us -- should see this election as important for our country, but not ultimate for our cosmos.   [Why Christians must speak out against Donald Trump's Muslim remarks]   We should be ready to pray and preach, to promote the common good and to resist injustice. We will pledge allegiance to the flag, but we will pledge a higher allegiance to the cross. We can pray and honor our leaders, work with them when we can, while preparing to oppose them when needed. We do not need the influence that comes from being a political bloc. We have more than influence; we have power -- the power that comes through the weakness of the crucified. Our rallying cry is not ""Hail to the Chief"" but ""Jesus is Lord."" Perhaps this electoral shakeup means that President Trump will lead America to be great again. I hope so. But regardless, whatever happens to America, we must seek the kingdom first again. Want more stories about faith? Follow Acts of Faith on Twitter or sign up for our newsletter.
