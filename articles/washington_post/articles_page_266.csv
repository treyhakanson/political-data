Google doesn't publish the exact number of people who are searching for the infamous and often violent white supremacist group, or for any other topic. But comparisons to other, presumably high-volume search terms give some sense of the magnitude. For several days this month, about as many people were searching for the Ku Klux Klan as were looking for Kim Kardashian and college football, combined. In November, interest in the Ku Klux Klan is about twice as high as it was at its previous 12-year peak back in March of this year, when Donald Trump did not immediately renounce an endorsement from former Klan leader David Duke. Interest in the Klan also spiked in November 2008, after the election of the first black president. The hate group has maintained a high profile this election year. The campaign of President-elect Donald Trump has energized white supremacists who see him as a leader who will champion their causes. Notable white supremacists have endorsed Trump on the campaign trail, and they've funded ads supporting him in several key states. Duke ran a long-shot campaign for a U.S. Senate seat this year, saying at the time that he was ""overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that I've championed for years."" Duke ultimately won 3 percent of the vote in Louisiana's senate contest. In the aftermath of the presidential election, Klan leaders praised the results and planned to hold a victory parade in celebration. Trump's reaction to all the attention from these quarters of America's political landscape has been mixed. He initially declined to disavow an endorsement from Duke, later blaming the episode on a misunderstanding due to a faulty earpiece. Several times he shared tweets from white supremacists on the campaign trail. He's allied himself with several hard-right leaders, including Stephen K. Bannon of Breitbart News and Frank Gaffney, an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist who believes that Muslims hostile to U.S. interests are infiltrating all levels of the U.S. government. Trump has repeatedly denounced the support of the Ku Klux Klan. After the group's official newspaper devoted its front page to the candidate earlier this month, Trump's campaign released a statement saying, ""Mr. Trump and the campaign denounce hate in any form. This publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign."" Google's data doesn't indicate peoples' sentiment toward the Klan when they search for it -- whether they view it positively or negatively. It does, however, illustrate how the Klan is now seen as part of current events, rather than a relic of the past. In 2006, for example, people who searched for the Ku Klux Klan were also searching primarily for topics related to history and racism, according to Google's data, suggesting attempts to situate the clan within the country's history. In the past year, however, people searching for the Klan were also looking for information on Trump, Hillary Clinton and African Americans in general, according to Google. The Southern Poverty Law Center estimates that between 5,000 and 8,000 Americans identify as members of the Ku Klux Klan, divided among nearly 190 local chapters clustered primarily across the South."

(Photo by Michael Robinson-Chavez/The Washington Post)  With the appointment of Stephen K. Bannon as Donald Trump's chief strategist, Breitbart News is boasting that it is ""going to be the best place for news on the Trump White House"" -- or, as conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes sees it, something akin to a state news outlet. But Trump's media reach might not stop with Breitbart. The president-elect is reportedly considering conservative commentator Laura Ingraham for the role of White House press secretary, and Ingraham sure sounds open to the job. ""If I could be of help in this administration and the role makes sense for me, then I would definitely entertain that, and it would be a great privilege to be asked,"" she said Tuesday on ""Fox & Friends.""    Ingraham, consistently rated among the nation's most important talk radio hosts by Talkers magazine, would be walking away from a very lucrative and influential gig, which is one reason I did not put her on a list of press secretary candidates last week. The other reason was the fact that Ingraham's supportive voice could be more valuable to Trump on the air than at the podium in the White House briefing room. But the choice of Ingraham in the media or Ingraham in the White House might be a false one. Trump could have both. Ingraham last year launched a conservative news site called LifeZette that could continue to operate without her day-to-day management, just as Breitbart will go on without Bannon, who was its chairman until he took a leave of absence to join Trump's campaign in August. LifeZette is newer than Breitbart and has a much smaller audience, but Ingraham wasn't fibbing when she said on ""Fox & Friends"" that the site is ""going gangbusters.""  Interest in the election obviously boosted LifeZette -- as it did many news outlets -- but Ingraham's site is clearly building a following. With Ingraham and Bannon on his team, Trump could have direct pipelines to two increasingly powerful conservative media operations that combined to attract almost 21 million unique visitors last month. Ingraham's resume (former Reagan administration speechwriter, Supreme Court clerk, successful commentator) certainly qualifies her for the press secretary job. But she also brings to the table an opportunity for Trump to expand his media reach even farther."

But someone has to answer all the angry phone calls these days.	"    Miriam Vincent, staff attorney at the Office of the Federal Register, has been bombarded with emails from citizens inquired about the workings of the electoral college in the wake of Donald Trump's election. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)  Tuesday of last week was quiet. Wednesday was quiet, too. The pitchforks started arriving last Thursday, about 36 hours after the presidential election was called. They were virtual pitchforks, but still. Email after email. Tweets. Phone calls. Facebook posts. Some profane. Some pleading. One subject line: ""electoral votes are wrong"" Another: ""Vote in Hillary Clinton Dec. 19"" Another: ""Letter to America"" Another: ""HELP"" So it goes at the Office of the Federal Register, which administers the electoral college and now finds itself at the center of a populist brouhaha.  The electoral college is not an actual place -- no grassy quad, nor group of people sharing a space. It exists for one day every four years and then vanishes, like Brigadoon, until the next presidential election. The closest thing to a physical headquarters is this office, one half of the seventh floor of a neoclassical brick building over an Au Bon Pain, six blocks north of the Capitol, in a neighborhood historically referred to as Swampoodle. Over the past week, the Office of the Federal Register has been inundated by Americans wanting to learn about -- or somehow control -- the college, which is composed of 538 party officials who will actually go about the formal business of electing Donald Trump president Dec. 19, based on the popular votes of each state.   Many people have something to say about that, partly because Hillary Clinton won the most votes nationwide, partly because Donald Trump is Donald Trump. ""It's just that they keep coming,"" says Miriam Vincent, staring at her inbox Wednesday morning. ""And every time we get close to having a handle on it, we get more. It goes on. And on."" Her email pings. ""And on.""    The electoral college is not a physical space until itself. But it is administered by this Washington agency, the Office of the Federal Register, north of Capitol Hill. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)  Vincent has 558 unread emails, a grande chai in her hand, and a big bottle of Excedrin Migraine on her cluttered desk. She is a staff attorney in the Legal Affairs and Policy Division in the Office of the Federal Register under the National Archives and Records Administration.  [The president-elect typically stays here before inauguration. Take a look inside]  What that really means, right now, is that she is dealing with the nation's collective freakout about the electoral college. Millions of Trump haters who can't handle Clinton's loss are signing petitions to persuade electors to vote as the plurality of Americans did, which would be completely permissible and also pretty unprecedented. Actual electors are being lobbied and harassed, according to the Idaho Statesman, and this frantic energy has also funneled toward the Office of the Federal Register, whose website is the second Google hit when you search ""electoral college."" Death threats. Promises of civil war. Inappropriate photographs. Students with homework questions. A daughter of Holocaust survivors who called to sob into the ear of a government bureaucrat. A woman in Florida who wanted Vincent to do something about Russian hacking. Only four employees work in Vincent's division. In the past week, each has taken on the role of civics teacher, and the role of therapist. ""You really need a thick skin,"" says Amy Bunk, the division director. ""People are venting their frustration. This woman, who didn't understand the system at all, ended up accusing me of interrupting her and thinking she was stupid."" She sighs. ""I spent an hour on the phone with her.""     The Office of the Federal Register, photographed on Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)     Electoral college paperwork on file in the legal section of the Office of the Federal Register. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)    The Office of the Federal Register has pale blue walls and a ceiling of fluorescence. It looks like any warren of nonpartisan bureaucracy: Cubicles. Giant binder clips. Stacks of blank paper. Boxes labeled ""FAA Airworthiness Directives."" Boxes of material labeled ""BURN."" An old-fashioned card catalogue for the president's executive orders. An email from Troy, Mich., sent 93 minutes before Trump was declared the winner last week: ""OK I little confused. . . . . . . . . tell why do we have a general election if our vote does not count for the Presidential election?""  The normal work in this office is the publishing of the daily Federal Register, which includes government agencies' notices and proposed rules, plus presidential documents such as speeches and proclamations. It's America's paper trail, wide open for anyone to see, textual government transparency in action. They've processed over 28,000 documents so far this year. They publish every business day, even if D.C. is closed for snow, even if the government is shut down. ""And every four years we have this dropped on us,"" Vincent says. It goes back to a 1950 government reorganization that moved administrative responsibility for the electoral college from the State Department to the National Archives. ""And we have it because the archivist said, 'You're doing it.' Maybe the [Register] director was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time."" After a presidential election, on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, the electors gather at their respective state capitals to cast their votes. Who are they? Just regular people, entrenched in party politics, who have been selected by their parties for this very specific task. Among other standing requirements, they cannot have fought for the South in the Civil War.    An emailed response to one of the many citizens who has recently contacted the Office of the Federal Register with questions about how the electoral college works. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)  They sign their state's electoral certificates, which are then sent to Congress and to Vincent's division. There are usually a handful of states that screw something up. Either the governor didn't sign the certificate, or they didn't put the state seal on it, or they got the election date wrong -- in which case Vincent's division says ""try again."" Then she and her colleagues compare its 51 certificates to the ones received by Congress, to make sure everything checks out. And then we have a president.  [Did Trump get a debate question in advance? Megyn Kelly says no, but questions linger]  The past three elections were easy for Vincent's office. The election of 2000 was a challenge. Citizens kept showing up to scrutinize the signatures on Florida's certificate, which had been laid out for public inspection. This year, though, is unreal. A tweet to @ElectoralCollege from a woman named Jeanne: ""Please do not discard my Ohio vote. Trump IS my president."" A tweet from an anonymous 18-year-old: ""F--- YOU. Hillary got the most popular votes and then you chose a guy who can't even do his fake tan right."" But Vincent and Bunk are not in charge of choosing the president. Their role here in this moment is simply to respond to these emails with information, excise offensive posts from the Facebook page, and screenshot the threats to send to the inspector general. ""We're really sick of the phrase 'We the People,' "" Vincent says. ""On both sides,"" Bunk adds. ""Someone sent us the text of the Declaration of Independence,"" Vincent says. ""What happened to civics in school?"" Bunk says. ""I'm serious about that."" ""A lot of people have been asking or advocating or yelling that we need to go back to the popular vote, but there is no 'back,' "" Vincent says. ""Because this is how it's been since 1789."" For now, then, there are emails to deal with, callers to educate, and a process to follow that helps to formally elect a president. And a couple weeks after the inauguration, Vincent will enjoy her first vacation since August, on the beaches of Miami, far from the paper and the pinging. "

PAUL, Minn. -- Philando Castile was fatally shot July 6 during a traffic stop in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights. The gruesome aftermath was streamed live on Facebook by Castile's girlfriend, who says Castile was shot while reaching for his ID after he told the officer he had a gun permit and was armed. Family members claim Castile, a 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker who was black, was racially profiled when he was pulled over by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez, a Latino. Here's a timeline of some key events: July 6: Castile is fatally shot after Yanez stops his car in Falcon Heights. Castile's girlfriend livestreams the aftermath on Facebook and the widely shared video draws protesters to the scene. July 7: Protesters converge overnight at Gov. Mark Dayton's official residence in nearby St. Paul. The Democratic governor says he doesn't think the shooting would have happened if Castile had been white. More than 1,000 people gather that evening at the school where Castile worked, and hundreds walk back afterward to the governor's residence. July 8: Ramsey County Attorney John Choi says he'll decide later whether he or a grand jury will decide on any charges against Yanez. July 9: Attorney Thomas Kelly says Yanez was reacting to the presence of the gun when he opened fire on Castile. He says the shooting had nothing to do with race. Police use chemical irritants to clear rock-and-bottle-throwing demonstrators from Interstate 94 in St. Paul. Officers arrest over 100 people. Police say 21 officers were hurt; none seriously. July 10: The governor condemns the shutdown of I-94 as ""unlawful and extremely dangerous."" July 11: Forty-six people are charged with rioting for the I-94 protest. Kelly says Yanez thought Castile looked like ""a possible match"" for a suspect in a recent armed robbery. July 12: Castile's family says they will file a lawsuit in his death. July 13: Police arrest 42 protesters who block traffic on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis during the morning rush. July 14: A funeral for Castile at the St. Paul Cathedral draws thousands of mourners. July 26-27: Police arrest 69 protesters outside the governor's residence as officers clear out the blocked street in front of the mansion. July 29: Choi adds former U.S. Department of Justice attorney and former Hamline University Law School dean Don Lewis, who is black, to his team as a special prosecutor in a bid to enhance trust in the results of the investigation. Aug. 24: The St. Anthony Police Department says it put Yanez back on administrative leave after he had briefly returned to limited duty, citing ""concerns and other feedback from the community."" Sept. 28: The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension says it has completed its investigation and turned over its findings to Choi. Nov. 16: Prosecutors announce that Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in Castile's shooting. The announcement comes one day after the anniversary of the high-profile killing by police of another black man in Minnesota, Jamar Clark in Minneapolis. No charges have been filed in that case.

Dede Westbrook (Sue Ogrocki/Associated Press)  Like in politics, a week is an eternity in a college football season, so any thought tossed out here might look like sheer folly by Sunday morning. But here's a notion which seemed silly just a few weeks ago: Is it time to start thinking about Oklahoma as a possible playoff team? Yes, that Oklahoma. The same team that opened the year 1-2 and was left for dead after getting trounced at home by Ohio State. The same team that is undefeated in Big 12 play but still must deal with West Virginia and Oklahoma State in its final two regular season games. Perhaps more to the point, the Sooners (8-2, 7-0) are operating in a Big 12 that remains unquestionably down. Baylor and Texas Christian aren't as good as they were a year ago. Texas Tech is staring at a losing season. Kansas State and Texas remain in orbit of .500. Iowa State, while exhibiting signs of competitiveness, is still Iowa State. And it's basketball season at Kansas. Heck, it was basketball season at Kansas before the autumnal equinox. That's the pack of teams Oklahoma beat up on during its current seven-game winning streak. But thanks to the magic of inertia and the dwindling number of one-loss playoff contenders to complement undefeated Alabama, the Sooners are up to No. 9 in this week's dog-and-pony show playoff committee rankings.   [The latest playoff rankings are out, and they're pointless]   Two things must happen to propel Oklahoma into the playoff in consecutive years. The first is the obvious: win out. Oklahoma State and West Virginia would represent the Sooners' most notable triumphs, and it would get them home at 10-2. The second is for Ohio State to win the Big Ten rather than get shut out of its league title game at 11-1. While the committee has a professed love for conference champions, would the Buckeyes really get passed over for an Oklahoma team they beat on the road? And one with an extra loss on its ledger? It would be an extreme leap of logic, especially with only a dozen data points per team. But if those two things happen? And, say, Washington absorbs another loss, as do either Clemson or Louisville? The Sooners could be right there. Unless -- or is it until? -- things change again this weekend. CLINCHING SCENARIOS A spin through the eight FBS leagues with divisional setups and the rough outline for clinching scenarios this week in each:  American Athletic: Navy (7-2, 5-1) would lock up the West Division with a victory at East Carolina. It defeated Houston and Tulsa, which are a game back. Temple (7-3, 5-1) can seal the East with a victory over Tulane coupled with a South Florida stumble at Southern Methodist. The Owls defeated both South Florida and Central Florida, which remain in contention. Atlantic Coast: The Atlantic Division gets settled this week. If Clemson (9-1, 6-1) wins at Wake Forest, it heads back to the ACC title game. If it loses, Louisville wins the division for the first time. With both North Carolina and Virginia Tech playing nonconference games, the Coastal won't be decided until next week. Big Ten: The East Division isn't getting sorted out this week, but Wisconsin (8-2, 5-2) could clinch the West if it defeats Purdue (which it almost certainly will) while Nebraska falls at home to Maryland and Minnesota loses at Northwestern. Conference USA: Western Kentucky (8-3, 6-1) is off this week, but will clinch the East Division if Old Dominion loses at Florida Atlantic. Louisiana Tech (8-3, 6-1) also has a bye week but has wrapped up the West Division. Mid-American: The West Division will go down to the final week, with the Toledo-Western Michigan matchup on Nov. 25 doubling as a de facto division title game. The East Division will get sorted out Tuesday, when Ohio and Miami (Ohio) host regular season finales. Both are 5-2 in the league, with Ohio holding the tiebreaker. Mountain West: San Diego State (9-1, 6-0) is three games clear in the West Division with two to play. Who it will face in the league title game won't be sorted out until next week; Boise State, New Mexico and Wyoming all are in contention. Pac-12: The day-after-Thanksgiving Apple Cup will determine the North Division winner unless Washington State (8-2, 7-0) beats Colorado and Washington (9-1, 6-1) falls at home to Arizona State this week. Colorado (8-2, 6-1) can clinch the South, but only if it beats Washington State and both Utah (at home against Oregon) and Southern California (at UCLA) lose to sub-.500 teams. Southeastern: Alabama (10-0, 7-0) clinched the SEC West last week, while Florida (7-2, 5-2) can wrap up the East with a victory at Louisiana State. If the Gators lose, it opens the door for Tennessee to earn a rematch with the Crimson Tide if it closes with triumphs against Missouri and Vanderbilt.  FIVE GAMES TO WATCH  No. 5 Louisville at Houston (Thursday, 8 p.m., ESPN): Cardinals QB Lamar Jackson had one of his shakier outings of the year last week against Wake Forest ... and still rushed for 153 yards. He'll get a prime-time showcase for his Heisman candidacy against Tom Herman's Cougars. No. 23 Florida at No. 16 Louisiana State (Saturday, 1 p.m., SEC Network): Not even a hurricane or SEC in-fighting could prevent this game from being played. Granted, its postponement also entailed a change of venue, but the Gators will get an extra home game next year as a result of the unusual in-season schedule shift. No. 22 Washington State at No. 10 Colorado (Saturday, 3:30 p.m., Fox): Because everyone thought this was going to be one of the most important games in the Pac-12 this season. But the visiting Cougars have won eight in a row, and Mike MacIntyre's resurgent Buffaloes have lost only to Michigan and Southern California. Luke Falk and the Cougars' passing game against Colorado's secondary is perhaps the week's best matchup. Indiana at No. 3 Michigan (Saturday, 3:30 p.m., ESPN); No. 4 Clemson at Wake Forest (Saturday, 7 p.m., ESPN regional); Arizona State at No. 6 Washington (Saturday, 7:30 p.m., Fox): Three games, one story. How do Michigan, Clemson and Washington respond to their first losses of the season? Clemson should have the toughest time of the bunch, but this might turn out to be a series of blowouts. No. 9 Oklahoma at No. 14 West Virginia (Saturday, 8 p.m., ABC): The Sooners haven't lost since a prime-time humiliation against Ohio State in mid-September. And West Virginia? It's still plugging away at 8-1, and it can claim the Big 12 with three more victories. This one, though, figures to be the Mountaineers' toughest test to date. 
5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-opinions-are-local/wp/2016/11/10/virginia-for-the-win-breaking-the-blue-wall/	Virginia for the Win: Breaking the blue wall	   President-elect Donald Trump gestures as Vice President-elect Mike Pence applauds at their election night rally in New York (Mike Segar/Reuters)  Like so many others, I was wrong about the final outcome of the 2016 presidential race. And, yes, the premise this column was built upon -- that no Republican could win the White House without winning Virginia -- was handily disproved as well. Like many others, what I thought I knew about politics elsewhere in the country turned out to be wrong this time around. But not in Virginia. The election returns in the commonwealth confirmed a trend that should deeply concern Republicans looking to recapture the three statewide offices on next November's ballot. Clinton beat Trump by 4.7 percentage points, about eight-tenths of a point better than President Obama fared in 2012.  She did so by carrying Fairfax County by more than 197,000 votes -- greatly exceeding Obama's 108,000 vote margin in the county in 2012. That Fairfax County would put Clinton over the top was never in doubt. The county has become a bulwark for statewide Democratic candidates, who would lose most of the state's localities, often by wide margins, only to recoup those loss, and more, when the votes from the state's largest county by population rolled in. For Republicans looking to crack the Fairfax nut in 2017's statewide elections, the challenge seems impossible. It's not. Robert F. McDonnell won there in 2009 on his way to a landslide victory over Democrat Creigh Deeds for governor. Jim Gilmore did the same in 1997. George Allen did it in 1993. All of those were convincing Republican victories. And in the Age of Trump, their messaging looks almost quaint -- law and order, taxes, jobs. The crop of declared Republican gubernatorial candidates -- Ed Gillespie, Corey Stewart, Sen. Frank Wagner, and possibly Rep. Rob Wittman, too -- will all have various themes and issues to push during their fight for the nomination. Some of them might even be useful. But once the nominee is chosen, that person will have to face the same statewide map every Republican stares at in anger almost every four years. How to break through in Northern Virginia? How to turn back the rising Democratic tide in Chesterfield County, or return Henrico County, once a GOP bastion that gave rise to both Gilmore and former House majority leader Eric Cantor, to the GOP column? They could do much worse than take advice Gilmore gave to a meeting of conservatives a decade ago in Richmond. At that 2006 meeting, the former governor addressed the funk Virginia Republicans had fallen into after losing their second consecutive governor's race. Gilmore said Virginia Republicans had forgotten some very basic lessons about how to appeal to suburban voters. He said the party and its candidates should focus their attention on these folks, because it's the suburbs that decide Virginia's elections. Painting in broad strokes, Gilmore said these voters want a few basic things:  low taxes, safe communities and an effective, accountable, education system. And education, Gilmore said, trumped them all. The question for Republicans jockeying for position in 2017 isn't who can say the most outrageous things. It's who will embrace the basics Gilmore described and do so credibly. The temptation will be to run a campaign guided almost exclusively by national issues. That path leads to defeat. If Republicans don't want to reach back as far as Gilmore, or even George Allen, they could always lift a page from McDonnell's 2009 playbook, which would seem to have lost very little of its appeal. Talk about job creation and economic growth. Propose reforming the state's tax code, which is more attuned to Virginia' agrarian past than its technological future. Embrace expanded charter schools and school construction. Take the high road on law and order by becoming a strong advocate of asset-forfeiture reform and criminal-justice reform. Those issues aren't nearly as sexy, or fundraising friendly, as others. But versions of them have been essential to past Republican success statewide. They could work again - if the candidates want them to. Norman Leahy is a political reporter for the American Media Institute and producer of the Score radio show.

Both nations want to join the 28-nation European Union, although their applications are at different stages. Serbia has launched membership talks while Kosovo last year signed the Stabilization and Association Agreement, the first step toward membership.  ""Kosovo and Serbia share a vital interest in a normal relationship,"" Johnson said, speaking at the Kosovo parliament. As part of a Balkans tour, Johnson was in the Kosovo capital of Pristina on Thursday, meeting with top political leaders. He urged them to continue cooperating with the special court on war crime, created last year following pressure from Kosovo's Western backers.  ""All those guilty of war crimes, on all sides, should be locked up,"" Johnson said, adding he would say the same thing in Belgrade, his next visit. The pain and grievances of the past cannot be easily set aside, according to Johnson, but ""cooperating with the special court for war crimes is so important for Kosovo, however difficult this may be.""  ""It also requires a sincere attempt to resolve the wrongs of the past,"" he said. Kosovo broke away from Serbia and declared independence in 2008. Britain was among the first countries to recognize their independence. Now 112 countries do but not Serbia. Later Thursday, in Belgrade, Johnson praised Serbian government efforts to normalize ties with Kosovo and promised support for the country's bid to join the European Union despite Britain's decision to leave the bloc.  ""We will remain friends of Serbia,"" Johnson said after meeting Serbia's Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A dozen people were arrested. Crowds gathered Wednesday night, blocking streets near Virginia Commonwealth University. Online video showed marchers chanting, ""No Trump. No KKK. No fascist USA,"" and carrying banners reading, ""Not my president."" Troopers responded to Interstate 95 around 10 p.m. and guided a large group of protesters off the highway, state police said. More than an hour later, troopers were called to the Downtown Expressway, where protesters sat in lanes and many refused to leave. Around midnight, troopers arrested four men and six women between the ages of 20 and 26 and charged them with unlawful assembly and being pedestrians on an interstate, according to the statement. Richmond police arrested two more people on the opposite side of the road who will face the same charges, the department said. No arrests had been made in connection with the damage to statues along the city's Monument Avenue, which authorities believe were tagged during the protests. Graffiti on the side of a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis said, ""Your vote was a hate crime."" Also tagged were statues of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and naval officer and oceanographer Matthew Fontaine Maury. Cleanup of the Maury and Davis statues was underway Thursday, Richmond police spokesman James Mercante said. The graffiti on the Lee statue was also expected to be quickly removed, said Capt. Ray Goodloe, a spokesman for the Capitol Police, which are investigating that statue's damage. The headquarters of the Republican Party of Virginia was also vandalized during the protest, chairman John Whitbeck said in a statement. TV station WWBT reported the doorbell was broken and graffiti was painted on the building. A police spokeswoman said no one had filed a report about the vandalism. Police are looking into it but can't say whether the damage happened during the protests, spokeswoman Koury Wilson said. The protest in Richmond was one of several across the country against Trump's stunning victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"   (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg News)  As is often the case in presidential contests, the polls have tightened in recent days. How much and why are interesting questions that I'll get into in a moment, but my point today is: Why has the stock market reacted negatively to this tightening? What do markets fear about a Trump victory? The figure below, from an excellent Vox article on the internal mechanics of different polling methods, shows that the probability of a Trump victory, while well below 50 percent, is increasing in both the popular 538 model and the New York Times Upshot model, though a lot less so in the latter. That's because 538's methods give more weight to new, incoming information while other poll aggregators are less responsive to such information, implicitly waiting to see whether any new swings stick (""waiting to weight""). Both methods are completely legit, and we'll soon see who's made the more accurate prediction.    Source: Vox  But check out this next figure. It shows that about when the polls started tightening, equity values fell and volatility rose. According to Bloomberg News, the nine-day decline in the S&P index is the longest negative streak since 1980.    Sources: Standard and Poor and CBOE  Now, I assiduously avoid interpreting the wiggles and waggles in the stock market, but this is enough of a trend to warrant some speculation. So, here are some hypotheses as to what's behind the losses. Market Uncertainty: Markets don't like surprises. Forget about ideology, party, policy, scandals and the rest of the stuff the punditry gets wound up about. If something that looked like a pretty sure thing now looks to be more up for grabs, traders get nervous and start hedging, shorting, trading currencies and basically re-positioning themselves for what was an unexpected outcome. That's what the volatility index, which moves up as such trading accelerates, is telling us. Political Uncertainty: Though it's been hard to break through the dark drama of this benighted election cycle, a fair summary of the political expectations is that a Clinton presidency would not represent a strong break with the past eight years while a Trump presidency would signal exactly that, both in domestic and foreign policy. Moreover, as I've stressed in a number of places, Trump's extremely negative assessment of the economy belies the facts, particularly in the job market. As I've also stressed, that's a far cry from saying everyone's doing great or that a fair share of the economy's growth is consistently reaching the middle class. But from the market's perspective, Trump's inaccurate economic diagnosis signals a big, potential problem. Trade: While both candidates have been critical of the effects of trade and globalization, Clinton essentially stresses that globalization needs to be reshaped, not restrained. Trump's team, on the other hand, appears to want to significantly dampen trade flows through high tariffs and big fights with trading partners. Markets reasonably view that strategy as a negative for growth. The Federal Reserve: Trump's criticism of Janet Yellen and the Fed engender two aspects that spook markets. First, the idea of a president trying to muscle the Fed on interest rate decisions is scary, as the central bank's political independence is one of its most important attributes. If the Fed operated like the Congress, we'd be in real trouble. Second, while there are of course those on Wall Street who would like to see the Fed tighten, which is what Trump appears to be calling for, broadly speaking, the markets have reacted badly to signals of higher rates, and, in fact, market forecasters have priced in lower rates of both inflation and interest rates than those in the Fed's model. Immigration: Who knows if a President Trump could really deport millions of immigrants, but even the prospect of such an economically disruptive and damaging move has markets on edge. The Mexican peso has been particularly volatile in recent weeks, moving inversely to Trump's electoral fortunes (i.e., Trump up, peso down, and vice versa). Clinton's more welcoming stance on immigration is viewed as pro-growth by the markets. Taxes, budgets: Trump's fiscal plan has been scored to worsen our fiscal accounts much more so than Clinton's, which is mostly paid for (all of which suspends disbelief in terms of what either could get through the next Congress, so there's a bit of a Kabuki dance going on here). It's not clear that markets worry much about the budget deficit either way, but there's an argument that large, sustained deficits would eventually push up interest rates and slow growth, so perhaps that's in the mix here. Suffice it to say that most market participants, to their credit, don't buy the trickle-down nonsense about how phat tax cuts for the rich will pay for themselves through growth effects. TVF (Trump volatility factor): There's a narrative that suggests a thin-skinned president who overreacts to perceived (or actual) insults wouldn't be great for markets. Basically, a volatile president would create volatile markets, or, if you want the math: d(VIX)/d(TVF)>0 (the first derivative of the volatility index with respect to Trump's volatility is positive). Of course, it could well be the case that by the time you're reading this, the market has reversed course, which is why you normally don't want to read too much into near-term trends in the indexes. On the other hand, these times are anything but normal."

The arrest of Choi Soon-sil came as opposition lawmakers demanded that prosecutors also investigate Park. A recent opinion survey showed Park's approval rating plunging to about 9 percent. Her prime minister nominee said investigators could look into Park's dealings with Choi despite her presidential immunity. South Korean media speculate that Choi, whose late father was a cult leader and longtime mentor to Park, manipulated government affairs and pushed businesses to donate millions of dollars to two foundations that she controlled. Seoul Central District Court on Thursday issued a warrant to arrest Choi for alleged abuse of authority and fraud, court spokesman Shin Jae-hwan said. -- Associated Press ITALY Amnesty: Police are abusing migrants Tougher new European Union rules on processing asylum seekers have led Italian police to abuse some migrants, including beating them and giving them electric shocks, according to a report published Thursday by Amnesty International. The human rights watchdog cited 24 claims of abuse this year as police tried to force migrants to get fingerprinted in Italy. It also reported the deportations of some asylum seekers to war-torn countries like Sudan without proper checks on their safety. In response, Mario Morcone, head of immigration at Italy's Interior Ministry said, ""It is totally false that the police are violent with the migrants,"" according to news agency ANSA. The allegations come as Italian authorities try to implement new E.U. rules adopted last year on how to handle migrants and asylum seekers. This includes fingerprinting them in the first E.U. country they arrive in. -- Associated Press LEBANON Hariri asked to form a new government Lebanon's president asked Sunni Muslim leader Saad Hariri to form a new government on Thursday after he won the support of a majority of parliament and the endorsement of the parliament speaker. Hariri's nomination as prime minister was part of a political deal that resulted in the election of Christian leader Michel Aoun, a close ally of the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, as head of state on Monday, ending a 21/2-year presidential vacuum. The deal underscores Shiite Muslim Hezbollah's dominant position in Lebanon and the diminished role of Hariri's main regional backer, Saudi Arabia. The quick formation of a new administration with cross-party support will help revive government in a country where political conflict has paralyzed decision-making, economic development and basic services, and raised fears for its stability. -- Reuters  Last migrants leave ""Jungle"" camp in Calais: The final 291 residents of a sprawling migrant camp in Calais known as ""the Jungle"" were evacuated and transferred to family centers around France. The departure of the women and their children, who had been housed in a center at the edge of the camp, completed a mass, state-run relocation of nearly 7,000 people in 11 days and ended a drama that the English Channel city's mayor called ""hell on Earth.""  Spain names new cabinet: Conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy named Luis de Guindos as economy minister as he unveiled his 13-member cabinet. Alfonso Dastis was named foreign minister, while Soraya Saenz de Santamaria remains deputy premier. Rajoy won parliament's approval last week to begin a second term in office, this time with a minority government. The vote ended a 10-month political impasse after two inconclusive elections.  Palestinian attacker killed by troops, Israel says: The Israeli military said forces fatally shot a Palestinian who tried to stab a soldier near the West Bank Jewish settlement of Ofra. The military said the man had a knife and tried to stab the soldier as he was guarding a bus stop. No troops were injured.  Ex-Romanian leader becomes Moldovan citizen: The former president of Romania and his wife are now Moldovan citizens. Traian and Maria Basescu took a citizenship oath at the Moldovan Embassy in Bucharest. President from 2004 to 2014, Basescu urged closer ties with Moldova, which was part of Romania until 1940. He is running for Senate in Romania's Dec. 11 elections and said he may get politically involved in Moldova. -- From news services "
