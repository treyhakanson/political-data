Resources to process the immigrants, detain them and to try their immigration cases in court are extremely strained. Now, federal officials say they are releasing Haitian immigrants who have been entering the country in large numbers, backtracking on a pledge to jail them before they are deported. A U.S. government official told The Associated Press that the decision to free Haitians arriving in Arizona and California is in response to a lack of jail space. The official said releasing immigrants with orders to report later to immigration court is a tactic used when detention space is scarce, under certain humanitarian conditions or as part of efforts to keep families together. Before the Haitians are released, they are subjected to a criminal background and national security check. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on speaking on condition of anonymity. Federal immigration officials announced Thursday they are opening a large processing facility in west Texas next week in an effort to deal with the large number of families and young children coming through the border. The facility in Tornillo, outside of El Paso, can hold up to 500 people and will be up and running by next week, officials say. The influx of migrants and lack of jail space on the border will be one of the most immediate immigration challenges for Trump. Among the issues Trump will face is growing opposition to conditions at Border Patrol holding cells and ICE detention centers. For example, the Border Patrol in Arizona faces a lawsuit from immigrants who say its holding cells are overcrowded, dirty and extremely cold. A federal judge in Tucson on Tuesday said he was inclined to direct the Border Patrol to improve sleeping conditions, although he hasn't issued a directive yet. Immigrants who enter through Texas also report that Border Patrol holding facilities - known as ""hieleras"" - the Spanish word for ""freezers,"" are difficult to sleep in. CBP has said it is ""committed to the safety, security and welfare of those in our custody, especially those who are most vulnerable."" In California, thousands of Haitians have arrived at the U.S. border with Mexico in recent months, many after traveling 7,000 miles by foot, taxi and bus from Brazil through eight nations. They present themselves to U.S. border inspectors, often at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry, the nation's busiest crossing. About 5,000 Haitians had showed up at San Ysidro from October 2015 through late September, overwhelming border inspectors. Another 40,000 were on their way, officials have said. The Department of Homeland Security last week said there were about 41,000 people in immigration detention facilities, compared to a typical population of 31,000 to 34,000. It was unclear how many Haitians have been released since the change, although ICE says it has deported 203 Haitians to their home country and that about 4,400 remain detained. ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea said in a written statement it is removing Haitians in accordance with its enforcement priorities.  ""ICE prioritizes the removal of national security threats, convicted felons, individuals convicted of significant or multiple misdemeanors, and individuals apprehended at or between ports of entry while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States,"" she wrote. The decision to release Haitians will likely add to the growing backlog of more than half-a-million cases already pending in immigration court. That backlog has effectively meant that immigrants routinely wait years for a judge to decide if they should be kicked out of the country. At a bus station in Phoenix on Thursday, several Central American women said authorities released them on condition that they promise to appear in immigration court. Yarely Cobon of Guatemala was wearing an ankle monitor and was with her 4-year-old daughter. Cobon, 22, said she left Guatemala over three weeks ago and crossed the border in Texas. She turned herself in to the Border Patrol and was detained for about six days. Her family paid for a bus ticket to join them in Los Angeles, where she has a court hearing next week. Cobon said the Border Patrol holding cell where she was held with her daughter was packed with women in children.  ""I was just standing, sitting, desperate. There's children crying. It was dirty,"" Cobon said. Ana Lidia Dubon Martinez is nearly eight months pregnant with twins and left Honduras with her 11-year-old brother almost a month ago. The pair swam across the river in Matamoros, Mexico, and turned themselves in to border agents in the U.S. Dubon Martinez is headed to Los Angeles via bus. The U.S. policy shift announced in September lifted special protections that Haitians got after their country's 2010 earthquake and treats them like immigrants from other countries and regions, including Mexico and Central America. Central Americans, particularly adult men, are often detained until they can be flown home. Mexicans are typically turned around immediately, made possible by their country's shared border with the U.S. Women with children such as Cobon and Dubon Martinez are often released and given a court date similar to how the government is handling the Haitians. The new posture hit hurdles when a powerful hurricane struck Haiti, raising more questions about the ability of the Caribbean nation to accept large numbers of its people. The U.S. temporarily suspended deportation flights to Haiti on Oct. 4 but Johnson vowed that Haitians would continue to be detained. ___ Spagat reported from San Diego, Caldwell reported from Washington, Galvan reported from Phoenix Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

CNN spokeswoman Barbara Levin says the resignation Friday afternoon is effective immediately. Lewandowski's stay at CNN began days after he left the Trump campaign in June. It stirred debate over whether political insiders hired as network on-air contributors are more loyal to the politicians they once worked for than the network and its viewers. Lewandowski had stayed in close touch with Trump while at CNN, leading to speculation since Trump's victory this week that he might take a role in the new administration.

Hillary Clinton's running mate was clearly pleased to be among familiar faces after months of crisscrossing the country on the campaign trail. He and his wife, Anne Holton, walked two blocks from their home to the polling station at the Hermitage, where they have voted for the past 24 years. ""It's kind of like we've done all we can do, and now it's in the hands of voters,"" the Virginia senator said. ""But we feel really comfortable about it. And it's so nice to be back here in the neighborhood."" The couple were not first in line, despite arriving 10 minutes before polls opened. Ahead of them was 89-year-old Minerva Turpin, president of the residents' association at the Hermitage, a retirement community. She planted an ""I voted"" sticker on Kaine after he turned in his ballot, and he gave her a kiss.  [State officials prepare for an unusually chaotic Election Day]      Women voters in Northern Virginia explain why they are casting their votes for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Election Day. Arlington resident Kate Flaherty nearly cried as she explained what compelled her to choose Clinton. (Reuters)   It was still dark outside as Kaine left the building, but a long line of voters had formed. Some of them broke into applause for their neighbor, a popular former Virginia governor who began his political career as a Richmond City Council member more than two decades ago. Now he stands a chance of becoming vice president of a bitterly divided nation. Kaine told reporters that if he and Clinton ""are fortunate enough to win,"" they will work hard to address the grievances of voters who cast their ballots for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. ""In the tone of the things that we say, in the team that we put together, and the policies that we promote, we have to show that we want to govern for all, not just those who voted for us,"" he told reporters. ""That's something that Hillary and I have already talked about a good bit."" Kaine and Clinton have often criticized Trump for his statements about Muslims, immigrants and women. Asked what it means, then, that Trump will probably garner millions of votes Tuesday, Kaine said he believes that most Trump supporters are motivated by anxiety about the economy.  [Voters wait and wait in long lines at the polls]  ""There are an awful lot of people in the country who still don't see the path for themselves, and I think that is the principal concern that we have to speak to,"" Kaine said. ""Not just to win over people who might not be supporters, but we've got to speak to it to make sure this country continues to hold a promise that tomorrow's generation can have it better than their parents did."" As lines grew at polling stations around the state and the nation, Kaine said he hopes citizens turn out in great numbers Tuesday.

Why? Because Trump is running historically poorly among Hispanic voters, according to a new Washington Post-Univision national poll. Hillary Clinton is winning 67 percent of Hispanic voters, compared with just 19 percent for Trump If Trump continues to get somewhere in the neighborhood of one of every five Hispanic votes, it would mark a new low for Republicans in that critical voting bloc. George W. Bush got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 2004 reelection race. John McCain got 31 percent in 2008. Mitt Romney took 27 percent in 2012. That's, um, not a good trend.  Especially when every projection of where the country is headed shows the continuing decline of whites and the continued growth of the Hispanic population. According to projections by the Pew Research Center, whites will make up 46 percent of the U.S. population in 2065. Hispanics will be 24 percent at that time, while African Americans will make up 14 percent of the population. By comparison, 62 percent of the U.S. population in 2015 was white, while 18 percent was Hispanic and 12 percent was black. Need a more real-world example? In 1984, Ronald Reagan won the white vote by 20 points -- and the election with 525 electoral votes. In 2012, Romney matched Reagan's margin among white voters; he won just 206 electoral votes. In 1984, 86 percent of all votes were cast by whites; that number dipped to 72 percent in 2012 -- and is projected to drop to 70 percent (or maybe even lower) on Tuesday.     As the presidential race tightens, Democrats are going after voters in the Republican stronghold of Georgia. In Gwinnett County, a rising number of minorities could be changing the political landscape. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)   In the wake of that 2012 loss -- and the demographic problems it portended -- the Republican National Committee issued an autopsy report that had one central recommendation: Find a way to pass some sort of comprehensive immigration reform or else. It read (emphasis mine): ""We are not a policy committee, but among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only. We also believe that comprehensive immigration reform is consistent with Republican economic policies that promote job growth and opportunity for all."" ""Our party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only."" Remember those words. Instead of finding a way to get behind comprehensive reform, rank-and-file Republicans killed even the consideration of such a bill -- even after it had passed the Senate. And then the party chose Trump as its presidential nominee. That's the same Trump who rose to prominence within the Republican Party on a pledge to build a wall on our southern border and make Mexico pay for it. And the same candidate who has openly embraced the sort of grievance politics that led him to, among other things, question whether a judge of Mexican heritage was fit to oversee a case regarding Trump University and to propose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. In short: It's hard to conceive of a candidate who would run more contrary to the party's stated goal of expanding its coalition than Trump. Actually, it's not hard. It's impossible. What Republican strategists are desperately hoping is that Hispanics will view Trump as an outlier, an isolated case who does not represent the broader views of the GOP. Again, the Post-Univision poll suggests that may be a false hope.     The campaign of the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, is sparking a surge in the number of citizenship applications and voter registrations among Hispanics fearful of his immigration policies. Since January, California alone has seen a boost of 218 percent in Democratic registration and among Hispanics, registration is up 123 percent. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)   Seventy-six percent of likely Hispanic voters have an unfavorable view of Trump; 66 percent hold that same unfavorable view of the broader Republican Party. Those numbers compare horribly with the way Latino voters regard the Democratic Party: 71 percent have a favorable opinion, compared with 24 percent who have a negative one. Yes, Hispanics view Trump more unfavorably than they view the Republican Party as a whole. But two-thirds of Hispanic voters have an unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party, and that is still disastrously bad. Those numbers suggest that Trump is not being viewed as something separate from the GOP and that the negative way Hispanics view him is rubbing off on the party he represents. To go back to where I started: Yes, it is still possible that Trump could win the 270 electoral votes he needs to be president on Tuesday. (The white vote will still make up about 7 in 10 voters in this election.)  But, win or lose, Trump has set back his party among Hispanic voters in ways that may well be irreversible in the near to medium term. The current composition of the Republican Party's electorate is a winner for 1984. It's a near-certain loser for 2024 and beyond. "

Throughout the presidential campaign against Donald Trump, Clinton has made some very specific pledges about what she would and wouldn't do. Those could come back at Clinton if she's elected, because she could be governing in a politically polarized environment. Republicans and liberal Democrats would keep watch to see whether she keeps her word.  ""I think Republicans are going to be dogging her any time she flirts with something that sounds like a campaign pledge that's been broken,"" said Republican strategist Katie Packer, who isn't backing Trump. Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, said liberals would look at how Clinton tackles issues, saying ""the key is seeing if she actually fights, rather than insisting that she has to achieve that goal."" Complicating Clinton's path is the reality that the best-laid plans can change. President George H.W. Bush, for example, pledged ""no new taxes,"" but eventually agreed to a budget compromise with Democrats that did include some tax increases. He lost his re-election bid to Democrat Bill Clinton. A look at some pledges Hillary Clinton made in the final presidential debate and what they could mean for her as president: ___ TAXES  ""I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less. I also will not add a penny to the debt."" Clinton has focused her campaign on working- and middle-class families, and promised to tax the wealthy to pay for more social programs, but repeatedly said those making $250,000 or less will be exempt. That's the cutoff her campaign has identified to protect the middle class. Clinton says that by taxing the wealthy, she won't create any new debt, though she has not said she would cut the current debt. This tax pledge means any new fees or costs for lower-earning families will be scrutinized. When it comes to the national debt, Packer notes ""there's a lot of different ways you can do the math that make that a very hard promise to keep."" ___ TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP  ""I'm against it now. I'll be against it after the election. I'll be against it when I'm president."" This is a big one for Clinton. She came out against the trade deal last year amid mounting pressure from liberals. She previously praised the deal as secretary of State, calling it the ""gold standard"" of trade agreements. In the past, she has supported some trade deals and opposed others. So progressives will watch Clinton if she wins, not just after Jan. 20, but during the transition as well, to see if she mounts opposition to a vote in the lame-duck Congress.  ""It's going to be critically important that she steps up, she stand up and says it's not going to be passed in the lame duck,"" said Chamberlain, adding that if Clinton does not take such a stand ""in many people's eyes that would be breaking a promise."" ___ MILITARY  ""I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force."" Clinton has made it clear that she does not want more American soldiers to serve on the ground in the Middle East. There are several thousand U.S. troops in Iraq now serving as trainers and advisers to the Iraqi military. She has made similar statements about Syria, where dozens of U.S. special operators are helping. Still, Chamberlain said that on this pledge, liberals see ""a lot of wiggle room there. The progressive movement wants to see less military action period."" Republican strategist Rick Tyler, who advised Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential bid, said that this is the type of promise that could be hard, depending on world events. ""You could claim you were never going to drop a nuclear bomb. I hope not, but what is it there for,"" Tyler said. ___ COLLEGE COSTS  ""I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted."" Clinton enhanced her college affordability plan with the Vermont senator, her rival in the presidential primaries, in an effort to win over his supporters. Bringing down college costs was a rallying cry for his younger supporters. It's also an issue increasingly discussed on the left. Packer said this might be an area that both sides want to work on. ""That strikes me as a thing that transcends ideology."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Trump was speaking to supporters when chaos broke out in the crowd, and Secret Service agents hustled Trump off stage. No weapons were involved, although Trump's son Don Jr. labeled it an ""assassination attempt."" A man claiming to be the protester later told The Guardian and Reno Gazette-Journal that he was carrying a sign that read ""Republicans against Trump"" when he was attacked. The man told The Guardian he heard one person yell ""something about a gun."" Kellyanne Conway tells CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the protester was canvassing for Clinton and was put there by the Democratic campaign, but offered no details or proof. ___ 9:50 a.m. Democrat Tim Kaine says his running mate, Hillary Clinton, didn't notify ethics officials when the nation of Qatar donated $1 million to her family's foundation while she was secretary of state because her agreement with the U.S. government didn't require it. After Clinton became the nation's top diplomat, she agreed to notify the State Department if a foreign power increased its donations to the Clinton Foundation. The idea was to prevent any suggestion that foreign countries could sway Clinton's U.S. diplomatic work. Kaine tells CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that Qatar had already been a donor before she was secretary of state and that the $1 million donation ""wasn't a change in their position."" He said: ""There was a clear understanding that there was not additional notice required."" ___ 9:30 a.m. Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence isn't saying whether Chris Christie will continue to run Donald Trump's transition team if the Republicans win on Tuesday. But in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Pence says only that the campaign is not making any personnel changes ""in the waning days of the campaign."" Christie is the chairman of the team charged with putting together a new government. The New Jersey governor is under fresh scrutiny for his role in the Bridgegate controversy. Two Christie allies were convicted Friday in a plot to close the George Washington Bridge to punish a Democratic mayor for not backing Christie's re-election. ___ 9:25 a.m. Hillary Clinton's chief strategist says the campaign is focusing on Nevada and Michigan in the closing days of the presidential race. John Podesta tells NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that if she can hold onto those two states in particular, ""Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president of the United States."" Michigan, with 16 electoral votes, has voted for Democrats for president every election since it went for Clinton's husband in 1992. Recent polls have Clinton with a slim lead. Nevada, with six electoral votes, has swung between parties every two presidential elections beginning with Bill Clinton's election that same year. Recent polls show a nearly tied contest. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. ___ 9:20 a.m. Hillary Clinton's chief adviser says Donald Trump is ""essentially adopting Russian foreign policy and rejecting bipartisan U.S. foreign policy."" John Podesta tells NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday that a ""foreign power"" hacked his emails and is working with Wikileaks to ""dribble"" those exchanges to the public with a clear agenda to hurt Clinton and help Trump before the presidential election Tuesday. He suggested that Trump isn't just neutral on Russian foreign policy, but an advocate of it. Trump has raised eyebrows for repeatedly praising Putin's leadership and advocating a closer working relationship with Russia despite its record of human rights abuses and recent military incursions in Ukraine and Syria.  ""At least he's a leader,"" Trump told MSNBC of Putin last December, ""unlike what we have in this country."" ___ 8:55 a.m. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is making her support for Hillary Clinton clear for all to see. The popular leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party says in a Sunday Mail column that she ""fervently hopes"" Clinton will defeat Republican rival Donald Trump in Tuesday's U.S. presidential vote. It's unusual for political leaders to express their opinion on other country's elections while the campaign is underway. Neutrality is usually observed. Sturgeon says Clinton would be ""a great president"" and that her election would ""also mark the shattering of the glass ceiling in terms of equality for women."" ___ 6:00 a.m. Israel's prime minister says he expects the next American administration to back Israel's approach to peacemaking -- regardless of who's elected president. Benjamin Netanyahu tells his Cabinet he expects the United States to stay loyal to its long support for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict being resolved through direct negotiations without conditions -- and not through pressure by the United Nations and other international groups. Previous rounds of negotiations over the establishment of a Palestinian state have broken down and left outbursts of violence in their wake.

Seven pages. A welcome to newcomers. A Mass schedule. But there, between the prayers of healing for the ill and the deployed and a reminder about a parent-child chastity luncheon for ages 11 and up, was an extra flier. On it was printed a memo, written in Spanish and English, and titled, in part, ""How to vote like a Catholic."" ""It is a mortal sin to vote Democrat . . . immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell,"" the flier said, as reported by the San Diego Union-Tribune. The flier listed five political topics that will guarantee damnation for anyone who endorses them, the newspaper reported. What are those mortal issues? Abortion, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, human cloning and embryonic stem-cell research. Warnings from the church, which is in Old Town, the city's historic district, escalated Oct. 30. The message that day specifically mentioned Hillary Clinton, linking her to the famed late community organizer Saul David Alinsky, whom it described as a tool of ""Satan"" and ""the devil."" The Alinsky-Hillary Clinton-Satan connection (as a student at Wellesley, she wrote a thesis on Alinsky, who had a following of young activists in the 1960s and '70s) is an old conservative rap on Clinton, most recently resurrected by Ben Carson at the Republican National Convention.      Former presidential hopeful Ben Carson criticized Hillary Clinton's admiration of writer Saul Alinsky and warned against the progression of a secular agenda during a speech at the Republican National Convention July 19. (The Washington Post)   That Sunday's bulletin, which was printed on page 3 and not inserted as a flier, listed 10 key issues through which elected officials ""impose sin upon us."" On that expanded list: accepting immigrants whose ""religious values are to eradicate every belief except those of their own prophet and god,"" supporting immigrants monetarily while the national debt grows, ""playing policeman for the world"" and supporting gun control. A spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego told the Union-Tribune that the pastor didn't approve the initial flier. ""For all I know someone thought that they were doing a service"" by inserting the message into the bulletin, diocese spokesman Kevin Eckery said. ""The pastor said it was not something he had reviewed or approved."" Eckery said the messages in the flier and bulletin were wrong. ""It's not a mortal sin to vote for Democrats, number one. And number two, the church doesn't take positions on this, and we're not going to.""      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump addressed Catholic voters in an interview with EWTN airing on Oct. 27. ""If any Catholic votes for Hillary Clinton, I would say if I were a Catholic, I wouldn't be talking to them anymore,"" he said. (EWTN)   In a statement published by NBC San Diego, Bishop Robert McElroy said the church needs to stay out of partisan politics: Let me stress again that while we have a moral role to play in explaining how Catholic teaching relates to certain public policy issues, we must not and will not endorse specific candidates, use parish media or bulletins to favor candidates or parties through veiled language about selectively chosen issues, or engage in partisan political activity of any kind. As a condition of their tax-exempt status, churches are forbidden from participating in partisan politics. Thursday the story was picked up by the Associated Press and other outlets. Reaction on social media was swift and fierce. ""Start paying taxes for all the money you grub...then maybe your political opinion will matter,"" a woman wrote on the church's Facebook page. ""How DARE you prey on the fears of your congregation! 'Religious people' like you are the reason I and many others no longer attend your false house of worship."" ""Uh-oh! Someone was caught making political statements when they are not suppose too! Maybe you should pay taxes in order to have your say! Keep your book of fairy tales out of Government!!!"" wrote another. ""White clergy telling their non white parishioners they will go to hell if they don't vote for the white raging racist? How nice. Disgusting,"" wrote someone with the username Lu Vil. Dennis M. Clausen of Escondido, Calif., wrote to the Union-Tribune with this thought: ""Hell is starting to look a lot better if heaven is populated by people like the one who wrote this church bulletin.""
