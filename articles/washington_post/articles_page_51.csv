"   President-elect Donald Trump in Washington on Nov. 10. (Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump promised to quickly get rid of the top level of senior military officers serving in uniform. But if Trump actually follows through on his plan to purge President Obama's generals as his first order of business, he could provoke a crisis in civil-military relations at the very beginning of his presidency. Last year, Trump claimed to more know than the generals on the ground about how to fight the Islamic State. In September, during a Commander in Chief Forum, he said the generals during the Obama administration had been ""reduced to rubble"" and that if he were elected, he would convene his top generals within 30 days of taking office to provide him with a new plan, but ""they'll probably be different generals."" Traditionally, presidents have felt free to appoint three- and four-star generals they are comfortable with, but they wait until those officers' terms in their posts expire. Also, presidents don't typically interfere in the selection of generals at the lower, one- and two-star levels. What Trump is proposing, an immediate and thorough housecleaning, could provoke pushback from the military and accusations of political interference from the public. ""It would cost a lot to get rid of them. Is this a fight that they really want?"" said Tom Donnelly, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ""What would be the reward? Who do they think they would put in? The story will be that he wants to politicize the officer corps."" Those advising Trump on military matters contend that the current crop of uniformed military leaders need to go because they have refused to push back against an Obama White House that has pursued a military strategy against the Islamic State that is too slow, too restrictive and too focused on what Trump allies see as political considerations, such as the rights of detainees and the drive to minimize civilian casualties. Trump has said he would bring back harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, kill the families of terrorists as a deterrent and ""bomb the hell out of"" areas where terrorists are located, regardless of the collateral damage. As president, Trump may want generals who agree with all of those things in advance. ""We need to find the loyalties of the generals who are willing to do what is unpopular for their career,"" said Carl Higbie, spokesman for a major pro-Trump super PAC who has advised Trump directly on the issue. ""I couldn't comment on the scope of a purge, but from an ideological standpoint you have to find who are the people who are actually there to win the war and who are the people who are just trying to maintain their careers."" To some defense experts and former officials, a purge of generals based on their willingness to support a president's policies would be a dangerous endeavor that flew in the face of military culture and tradition. It might also cause a crisis in civil-military relations. ""This view that there's a need to ideologically purge the military of those who are out to protect their careers is completely antithetical to the professionalism of the all-volunteer force,"" said Loren DeJonge Schulman, who served in the Pentagon and the White House during the Obama administration. The entire point of having a professional core of career military officers is so that any president can get factual, objective information and analysis from military leaders who don't have to think about whether or not they are agreeing with their civilian bosses, she said. ""That will have incredible consequences for civil-military relations if Trump does this in the way he suggested he would during the campaign,"" Schulman said.      According to an advisor working closely with President-elect Donald Trump on his transition process, Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn the influential position of national security adviser. (Video: Reuters / Photo: AP)   Fueling concerns are reports that former Defense Intelligence Agency director Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn is Trump's leading candidate for national security adviser. Flynn was purged himself in 2014 by his superiors in the military intelligence community. He clashed with two Obama appointees, Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, over whether the war against Islamic extremism was going as well as the Obama White House claimed. Just before he stepped down, he said publicly that the U.S. was not safer from terrorism than before 9/11 and that al-Qaeda was ""not on the run,"" directly contradicting Obama. Clapper announced his resignation Thursday, meaning he is not willing to serve under Trump and perhaps Flynn. Another Trump transition leader who has sharp criticisms of current military and intelligence leaders regarding the war on terrorism is House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). He has been a driving force in investigating whether intelligence analysts at U.S. Central Command were pressured by their superiors to present overly optimistic reports on the war against the Islamic State. Nunes is now one of the three Trump transition officials in charge of national security appointments, along with former congressman Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) and Reagan-era official Frank Gaffney, following the Trump team's decision to dismiss former congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.). If Trump does decide to dismiss generals in an unprecedented way, there's not much that could be done to stop him. Disrupting the complicated military promotion system is messy but within the president's prerogative. Congress could provide a check by refusing to confirm new flag officers, but the Republican leaders of the relevant committees rarely use that option. The real question now is whether or not Trump was just blustering during the campaign about purging the generals who are serving now, and if not, does he want independent military advice or just a rubber stamp for his own ideas on fighting terrorism."

" Stephen K. Bannon helped build Breitbart News Network into the clarion of Donald Trump's anti-establishment political movement with a pugnacious approach that critics have called racist, misogynistic and xenophobic. And then Bannon really went to work for Trump, steering the campaign that made Trump the 45th president.  Now, as Trump ascends to the White House, the question is: Where does Breitbart end and Bannon and the new administration they helped midwife begin?  [Trump draws sharp rebuke, concerns over newly appointed chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon]  Trump on Sunday named Bannon his chief White House strategist and senior counselor, a powerful position that acknowledges Bannon's role as the ""Trump whisperer,"" the man with the president-elect's ear. Bannon, a former investment banker, joined Trump's campaign in August and helped guide it to its stunning upset over Democrat Hillary Clinton last week. Since then, neither Bannon nor staff members at Breitbart have spelled out what their relationship will be after candidate Trump becomes President Trump. But even if Bannon and the website sever all ties, they will face an unusual, and awkward, situation: Bannon would be the former executive of a media organization that openly supported his political patron who will serve the president in a senior capacity while his media organization continues to cover him and his new boss. ""Breitbart will now go from being the propaganda arm of the Trump campaign to effectively becoming a state-run medium,"" said Kurt Bardella, Breitbart's former spokesman. ""They will exist to tell the narrative of the Trump presidency to their audience to ensure their alternate reality they successfully ran on stays intact regardless of the situational reality and condition of this country. There is no separation between Breitbart and the Trump White House.""  Bannon remains on Breitbart's masthead as its executive chairman, although his day-to-day involvement as its chief editorial strategist (and host of its daily satellite radio program) were mothballed when he officially joined Trump's team over the summer.  He also remains chairman of the Government Accountability Institute, a think tank that supported the research behind ""Clinton Cash,"" by GCI president Peter Schweizer. The book detailed Bill and Hillary Clinton's business and philanthropic interests, including the role of foreign governments in supporting the charitable Clinton Foundation.  Beyond that, much is unclear. Breitbart News, like Trump, has never made its financial records public, so it's not known whether Bannon owns stock in the organization and whether he would sell it to avoid any appearance of a conflict while serving in the White House.  Breitbart News Network LLC -- which is based in Los Angeles but operates a newsroom out of a Capitol Hill townhouse that also serves as Bannon's pied-a-terre in Washington -- is closely held among a few people, including co-founder Larry Solov and the family of the late Andrew Breitbart, its other founder.  One of Breitbart's primary financial backers is billionaire hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, whose daughter, Rebekah, is part of Trump's presidential transition team. The Mercers were reportedly influential in persuading Trump to add Bannon and pollster Kellyanne Conway to his campaign team.  Alexander Marlow, Breitbart's editor in chief, declined to clarify the site's relationship with Bannon in an exchange of emails Sunday. Breitbart's spokeswoman, Alexandra Preate, also would not offer a response. Bannon did not reply to a request for comment. The most obvious change is definitional. Trump's election has transformed Breitbart from a scrappy, even scabrous outsider -- the scourge of what Bannon and Marlow contemptuously refer to as ""the establishment"" -- into the ultimate insider and defender of the status quo. The ""outsider"" role was enormously rewarding for Breitbart, which started in 2008 as an aggregator of wire-service articles selected by Andrew Breitbart and Marlow, then a student at the University of California at Berkeley (Breitbart died of a heart attack at age 43 in 2012; Bannon, then a board member, stepped in weeks later as executive chairman). Since then, and particularly this year, it has grown into the home of the rising Trump movement and its shadowy underbelly, the alt-right that is often synonymous with racism and white nationalism. Last month, it reported that it had reached a new high-water mark for online traffic with 37 million unique visitors, a count that rivals such mainstream news sites as ABCNews.com and CBSNews.com and exceeds LATimes.com. It has also announced plans to expand to sites in Germany and France, adding to its existing international operations in Great Britain and Israel.  On Monday, the site continued to stump for Trump with headlines that attacked his now-defeated, and largely powerless, opponents.  ""Clinton Top Aide Huma Abedin Seen Openly Weeping on Streets of New York,"" read one. Another: ""Giuliani: 'Professional Protesters,' Not Hillary Supporters, Marching Across the Nation."" And another: ""Meltdown Continues: Wave of Fake 'Hate Crimes' Sweeps Social Media."" It also kept up its relentless attacks on immigration and ""multiculturalism"" that not only echo Trump's views but also those of Europe's far-right political parties, such as Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party in Britain and Marine Le Pen's National Front. A typical headline on the site Monday: ""Feds Pull Agents Off Open Border to 'Process' Alien Surge."" Bannon was little known outside political circles until he was appointed to Trump's campaign in mid-August. The spotlight was not flattering; reporters unearthed a police report from 1996 in which one of Bannon's ex-wives, Mary Louise Piccard, accused him of misdemeanor domestic violence, battery and dissuading a witness (Bannon pleaded not guilty and the charges were dropped). Piccard later said in divorce proceedings that Bannon didn't want their daughters to attend an exclusive school in Los Angeles because many Jewish students attended the school and ""he didn't want the girls going to school with Jews.""  Another media report disclosed that Bannon and another ex-wife were registered to vote in two places, including at a vacant house in Florida that was scheduled to be demolished -- a potential violation of election law. The report was particularly ironic, given Trump's claims of rampant voter fraud.  All of which may help explain negative reactions to Trump's appointment of Bannon to a senior role in his administration. On Sunday, Republican strategist and CNN and ABC News commentator Ana Navarro tweeted about Bannon: ""A white supremacist Neanderthal in WH w/President's ear is DISGUSTING & TERRIFYING."" Breitbart's biggest star is British blogger and provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, who helped lead the attacks on female video-game programmers in an online troll war that became known as Gamergate. Twitter permanently banned Yiannopoulos in July after he led a wave of racist abuse of ""Ghostbusters"" star Leslie Jones. ""They were the house organ for Trump and will obviously remain so,"" said Ben Shapiro, a former columnist and editor at large at Breitbart. Bardella and Shapiro ended their association with Breitbart in March after the site publicly doubted and later rebuked one of its own reporters, Michelle Fields, after an incident at a Trump news conference in Florida. Fields said Trump's then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, had grabbed her arm and yanked her away from Trump as she sought to interview him at the event. Trump and Lewandowski denied Fields's assertions and, like Breitbart News, disparaged her. But a closed-circuit recording of the event showed that Lewandowski had done exactly what Fields described. Media figures such as Bannon sometimes take an informal advisory role in presidential administrations, but only a few have leveraged their influence over a news organization to gain office or become senior advisers, said W. Joseph Campbell, a media historian at American University in Washington. Among others, Campbell said, were newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst, who served two terms in Congress, but he failed in his bids to win the presidency or governorship of New York; President Warren G. Harding, who had been a newspaper publisher in Ohio; and President Lyndon Johnson, who owned radio and TV stations in his native Texas.  "

"   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, together with his family, from left, Eric Trump, Trump, Melania Trump, Tiffany Trump and Ivanka Trump, speaks in the hotel lobby during the grand opening of Trump International Hotel in Washington on Oct. 26. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press)  The Post reports, ""It's not just corporate lobbyists who are playing early, visible roles in the new power structure. Some of Trump's biggest political donors are shaping the incoming administration, including Rebekah Mercer, a daughter of billionaire Robert Mercer, who is figuring prominently in behind-the-scenes discussions, according to people familiar with the transition."" Worse than that: ""On Friday, the Trump Organization said it was focused on identifying how to 'immediately transfer' management to his three oldest children -- an arrangement government ethics experts said was fraught with conflicts, particularly since his children are also helping oversee the transition."" Rudy Giuliani complained on Sunday that it would be unfair -- to Trump's children -- to separate them from Trump's businesses. He proclaimed that the conflict-of-interest laws don't apply to the president. This attitude doesn't sound like Trump wants to ""drain the swamp."" It sounds like he will be flooding it. ""His kids cannot, by definition, administer a blind trust,"" former ambassador to the Czech Republic Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institution tells me. ""A true blind trust is supposed to be run by an independent trustee with no familial relationship. In a real blind trust, Trump would sell his assets and the proceeds would be converted into stocks, bonds or other holdings that he does not know the identity of."" Eisen, who in 1991 co-founded Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), adds, ""The problem is exacerbated by the kids having a role in a transition -- it's not consistent with the arm's length nature of what a blind trust is supposed to be."" (When the shoe was on the other foot, Republicans scoffed at the notion that Chelsea Clinton could have been left to run her parents' foundation if her mother became president.)      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 argued in a written statement that Trump's arrangement is the worst of all worlds: ""The arrangement will not only fail to protect against conflicts of interest, it will facilitate conflicts. The trust will shield all information from the American people, while the Trump family will control what is taking place and have full knowledge of the transactions."" He added, ""To the extent the Trump trust is doing business with foreign interests, the Trump family, not the American people, will know about those transactions and every one of them will involve a potential conflict of interest for President Trump. And under the proposed arrangement, there will no way to know if such conflicts of interest are occurring since the assets will be in a Trump-controlled blind trust."" Trump's conflicts are compounded by three extraordinary circumstances. First, media have focused almost exclusively on management of the Trump businesses, but the financial conflict comes from Trump's ownership, which he is not about to give up. Central to that is the role lenders play in the Trump empire. To the extent the Trump administration pushes banks to make available more credit, the lifeblood of the real estate business, there will be questions as to whether the Trump administration is acting in his own interests. Richard Painter, President George W. Bush's ethics counsel and now an expert on government ethics at University of Minnesota Law School, tells me that if Trump business people suggest in any way that favors or leniency can be obtained for lenders and other business partners, they would put themselves at peril for prosecution under bribery statutes. Government appointees in the Trump administration meanwhile will be accused of ""dereliction"" if they fail to enforce laws and regulations from every imaginable executive branch agency against Trump facilities. What about those IRS audits and investigations into labor-law violations? Second, Trump has never revealed his income, his specific investments, his liabilities (Does he owe money to foreign banks?) or the sources of his income. We do not know for certain what litigation he is involved in and what settlement agreements he is party to that might include ongoing financial obligations. Without that, the public will have no idea what Trump's ""interests"" are, let alone whether his administration is acting in ways that put Trump's financial interests above the country's. Painter thinks it would be unconstitutional for Congress (even if it had the political gumption) to require Trump to divest himself of holdings but it could beef up the disclosure forms Trump must file so that we would see specifically what he owns and to whom he owes money. That's critical since the Constitution bars presidents from accepting titles, gifts and other things of value from foreign governments under the so-called ""emoluments"" clause (Article I, Section 9). That, Painter says, would affect Trump's business dealings with foreign-owned banks (e.g. Bank of China). ""The emoluments clause has been interpreted by the Justice Department to include any payment from a foreign government, except with the consent of Congress,"" Painter recently wrote. ""Every time there was a financial transaction between a foreign government -- or a company controlled by a foreign government -- and any Trump entity, there would be a potential for favorable treatment that could violate this limitation, as well as the anti-bribery laws. That, too, gives us pause."" Third, even if his kids were not running his businesses, they cannot be blind. He owns and derives income from ongoing, public operations. ""It's somewhat hard to believe that he would be completely blind to his businesses when there's a giant one with his name on it five blocks from the White House,"" Jordan Libowitz of CREW explains. ""Even if he doesn't talk to his children about the businesses, he'd still know what properties they're overseeing, what would be good for them and what tax changes would benefit them."" Common Cause  president Karen Hobert Flynn agrees. ""Mr. Trump needs to come up with a serious plan to address the myriad conflicts inherent in his holdings. His current proposal does not even begin to address the very serious conflicts of interest he would face in office."" Ironically, the candidate who made hay out of the Clinton Foundation is poised to embark on something far worse than Bill and Hillary ever tried. ""It is a lot worse than the situation involving the Clinton Foundation because there were a set  of conflict of interest and other rules that applied there (including voluntary restrictions agreed to by the Clintons),"" Eisen likewise argues. ""None of that applies here, and moreover, here (unlike with the Clinton Foundation) we are also talking about a huge financial enterprise, one run for profit and in which the elected official has a giant personal economic stake."" Many Americans may be wondering: Isn't there a law or something that says he cannot do this? Not really. ""There is a long-standing tradition of presidents either putting their fortunes into blind trusts or similarly managed funds so that there is no conflict of interest between how they manage their money and how they manage the country,"" says Libowitz. However, there is no specific statute compelling the president to do so, although there may be nasty consequences if he insists on operating this way. ""While there is no law requiring Trump to set up a true blind trust, people are going to try to use the connection to his businesses, and his kids, to influence him, so that implicates laws that do apply such as bribery,"" Eisen says. He argues that ""Congress could and should pass legislation applying conflict of interest rules to the president, and if there is a big Trump conflicts scandal, which is a major risk given this state of affairs, they will."" Trump's conflicts minefield can best be defused through political pressure. The press can ask about his financial conflicts at every press conference and interview; his children can be peppered with questions whenever they appear. Reporters can track the effect of new legislation (e.g. tax and regulatory reforms) on Trump properties and inundate the administration with Freedom of Information requests to determine if anyone in federal departments, agencies and bureaus is considering offering preferential treatment to Trump businesses, conversing with the Trump kids or evaluating the potential effect of statutory and regulatory changes on his holdings. If Democrats stick together and can peel off some conscientious Republicans such as Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Mike Lee (R-Utah) or others, they can hold up confirmations, delay legislation and conduct oversight unless and until Trump really does separate himself and his family from his businesses.  Democrats should certainly try to test whether Republicans are intent on ""draining the swap"" -- or at least preventing it from overflowing. Democrats can make this a serious issue in the 2018 midterm elections. At the very least, the hypocrisy of the talk-show crowd and the other professional Hillary Clinton haters who deplored her corruption should be revealed. (In the worst-case scenario if Trump does violate the emoluments clause, we could head for a standoff with Congress. The only remedy if it gets that far would be impeachment.) Trump voters demanded he ""lock up Hillary."" They were scandalized that ""Crooked Hillary"" evaded rules on handling of classified material and had meetings with foundation donors. Shouldn't they be incensed if their chosen ""outsider"" becomes an even worse ethics offender? Their reaction will tell us much whether their concern about ""change"" was sincere or whether they simply wanted their own ""crooked"" president."

(Reuters)   Like the country as a whole, Washington today is characterized by radically different emotions as it contemplates the upcoming Trump presidency. Republicans are gleeful about all they'll be able to do to roll back the progress of the past eight years, liberating the country from the cruel oppression of things such as expanded health insurance, regulations on Wall Street and reproductive rights. Liberals are horrified at the same prospect. And members of the media are looking desperately for signs that Donald Trump is not actually the person we all watched for the past year and a half. ""I saw quite a change,"" said CBS's Lesley Stahl after interviewing him for ""60 Minutes."" ""He was much more subdued, much more serious."" It's as though we're talking about a child who managed to get through recess at the day care without punching any of the other children. Except this child is about to become the most powerful human being on Earth. And as it begins to take shape, Trump's administration is looking like some kind of mash-up of ""Being There"" and ""American History X,"" with just the combination of cluelessness and malice that you would have expected. Let's start with  the latter: President-elect Donald Trump's decision to appoint Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist in the White House has drawn a sharp rebuke from political strategists who see in Bannon a controversial figure too closely associated with the ""alt-right"" movement, which white nationalists have embraced. Bannon, who was the executive chairman of Breitbart News before joining the Trump campaign in August, will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor for Trump; that will give Bannon authority over the strategic direction of the White House. Bannon will assume a similar role to that of Karl Rove during George W. Bush's administration and recently by longtime strategist John Podesta under President Obama. He and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who will become White House chief of staff, will be among Trump's top advisers. The announcement has produced intense hand-wringing in Washington and sharp denunciations from political observers and strategists critical of Breitbart News's close association with the alt-right, a fringe conservative movement saturated with racially insensitive rhetoric and elements of outright white nationalism. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate-watch group, has accused Breitbart of explicitly embracing ethno-nationalism. After Bannon's elevation was announced, the law center tweeted several controversial stories written by Breitbart under Bannon's control, including a piece published two weeks after a mass killing at a black church in Charleston, S.C., last year: ""Hoist it high and proud: the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage.""   [Why millions fear the looming Trump presidency]   There has been way too much euphemizing about Bannon, so let's talk plainly. He's not just a ""controversial"" figure who ran a ""provocative"" web site. He is one of the foremost drivers of the spread of white nationalism in the United States today, and Breitbart is a firehose of thinly veiled racism and anti-Semitism, spewing its endless supply of poison into our politics. ""We're the platform for the alt-right,"" Bannon told journalist Sarah Posner this year. In the  words of Ben Shapiro, a former editor for Breitbart, the alt-right is ""a movement shot through with racism and anti-Semitism."" Bannon disagrees -- sort of. ""Are there anti-Semitic people involved in the alt-right? Absolutely. Are there racist people involved in the alt-right? Absolutely,"" he told Posner. ""But I don't believe that the movement overall is anti-Semitic."" Now let's not forget that Trump was retweeting white supremacist memes and attacking a variety of minority groups long before Bannon joined his campaign as chief executive. Bannon didn't make ""Trump for President"" into a white nationalist campaign, because it already was. So whatever Bannon suggests is going to find a ready audience in his boss. And now to the cluelessness: During their private White House meeting on Thursday, [President] Obama walked his successor through the duties of running the country, and Mr. Trump seemed surprised by the scope, said people familiar with the meeting. Trump aides were described by those people as unaware that the entire presidential staff working in the West Wing had to be replaced at the end of Mr. Obama's term.   [Against Trumpian triumphalism]   The man ran for president for a year and a half, and is surprised that the presidency is such a big job. Meanwhile, his aides were under the impression that the Obama staffers would stick around and be working for them now. This is appalling, but it shouldn't be surprising. Those of us who actually contemplated a Trump presidency during the campaign were particularly disturbed not just by Trump's ignorance, but also by the fact that it was accompanied by a certainty that he knew everything he needed to know, despite the fact that he knew virtually nothing. He would regularly claim that he was smarter and more knowledgeable than everyone who actually had experience in government and policy, despite never having served a day in government or spent a moment thinking about policy. Asked whom he consulted on foreign affairs, he said, ""I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things."" On fighting terrorism, he said, ""I know more about ISIS [the Islamic State] than the generals do, believe me."" I suppose that any day now he's going to unveil that secret plan to defeat the Islamic State, which he said was ""a foolproof way of winning,"" but he couldn't tell us what it was because then the Islamic State would know and it would be ruined. Even Republicans knew that he was just lying.      Reince Priebus will be the next chief of staff of the White House. Here's what you need to know about the man with the top job in Trump's administration. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   Nevertheless, the fact that Trump chose Priebus to be his chief of staff -- in a role that is reportedly going to be co-equal with Bannon's -- is being greeted with a collective sigh of relief. What a wise, statesmanlike move, to make the person who runs the White House a rational human being with some experience in politics (though no experience in the federal government) and not, say, actors Gary Busey or Scott Baio. Impressive! Meanwhile, the president-elect is tweeting out insults at news organizations whose coverage of him is insufficiently adulatory. If you thought that having won the election despite losing the popular vote Trump might display an iota of class, you were mistaken.

On a call Saturday with top campaign donors, Clinton said her campaign was winning until FBI director James Comey sent a letter to Congress on Oct. 28 announcing that the FBI had uncovered emails possibly related to its earlier probe into her use of a private server as secretary of state. The new examination was sparked by an unrelated investigation into former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of one of her top aides. The surprise announcement by the FBI came after three debates in which Republican Donald Trump was widely panned for his performance. Clinton told the donors that her campaign was leading by large margins in nearly every battleground state and was tied in Arizona, a traditionally Republican stronghold, until Comey released his letter. Trump's campaign and Republican supporters seized on the news, even though it was unclear whether Clinton's correspondence was tied up in the probe. Comey told lawmakers the Sunday before the election that the bureau had found no evidence to warrant criminal charges. His ""all clear"" message only served to further motivate Trump supporters, Clinton told donors on the call. In the nine days between Comey's initial statement and his ""all clear"" announcement, nearly 24 million people cast early ballots. That was roughly 18 percent of the expected total votes for president. While Clinton accepted some blame of her loss, said donors who listened to her call, she made little mention of the other factors driving Trump's victory: A desire for change by voters, possible sexism, the difficulty of a political party winning a third White House term, her campaign's all-but-dismissal of white working class voters and flaws within her own message. Donors on the call were not authorized to discuss her comments by name and requested anonymity to describe them to The Associated Press. Democrats have spent much of this week reeling for their loss, with many in the party beginning a process of soul-searching designed to sort out what exactly went wrong. Liberals like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren say Democrats must embrace a more aggressive economic message -- one Clinton largely shied away from during her campaign.

From beneath a black baseball cap embroidered with a large white X, Kaepernick explained that he was protesting the seemingly epidemic extrajudicial killings of unarmed black men that so rarely resulted even in indictments.  His black cap paid homage to Malcolm X, the iconic black civil rights agitant who was assassinated just over half a century ago. It was an appropriate appropriation by Kaepernick, who many of us celebrated for being a multimillionaire athlete not fearful of making a political statement -- and in a manner -- with which his employer, its sponsors and fans would find discomfort.  [Abdul-Jabbar: Insulting Kaepernick says more about our patriotism than his]  But Kaepernick appeared this past week to see Malcolm X only as a prop rather than understand Malcolm X's life as practicum.  When asked early Tuesday afternoon by San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Eric Branch if he voted in our presidential election, Kaepernick answered, ""No."" When Branch asked Kaepernick if he planned to cast his ballot later, Kaepernick responded, again, ""No."" Malcolm X would be disappointed.  After all, in what many historians considered not only Malcolm X's greatest speech, but one of the most notable political speeches of the last century, Malcolm X broke with the dictum of the black American Muslim movement in the middle 1960s and argued why black Americans should participate in electoral politics. He did so after witnessing what voting blocs of newly independent African nations had done for their consideration on the world stage. ""The black man in the black community has to be re-educated into the science of politics so he will know what politics is supposed to bring him in return,"" Malcolm X told an audience on April 3, 1964, at Cory Methodist Church in Cleveland in a speech titled 'The Ballot or the Bullet.' ""Don't be throwing out any ballots. A ballot is like a bullet."" Kaepernick treated his responsibility like a piece of junk mail. Sadly, he wasn't alone.  Of the estimated 231 million people eligible to vote in the United States, only 131 million voted for Hillary Clinton or the President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday. The United States continues to have the lowest voter participation rate in the industrialized world.  And a smaller share of eligible voters cast ballots in 2016 than in the 2012 presidential election, including black Americans, for whom Kaepernick overnight became a hero in protesting for Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Laquan McDonald, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Sandra Bland, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and other black citizens killed by police or from encounters with them.   Colin Kaepernick did not exercise his right to vote in Tuesday's election. (Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP)   [Jenkins: Kaepernick reminds us that dissent is a form of patriotism too]  What Kaepernick has done in drawing attention to the inordinate number of black victims of police deadly force -- kneeling during the Star-Spangled Banner -- is to create a flash mob of sorts of protest. NFL players on other teams have dropped to one knee. Athletes in other sports have followed his lead, as have high school players and kids on peewee teams. But what he didn't do Tuesday undermined his noble histrionics. His example of voting could have been an even more consequential act for those who look up, or over, to him as an example simply because he's an athlete. As Malcolm X -- who tutored Muhammad Ali in part because of his visibility as an athletic star -- came to express, there are often immediate and tangible consequences to voting that impact real people. The election we just experienced most likely will remind us of that for generations to come. It was an election that could least afford apathy, much like the 1964 presidential campaign between Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater that Malcolm X referenced and wound up shaping the contours of the partisan politics we have today with Democrats as a racial and ethnic coalition of liberals and the GOP as conservative whites. To be sure, the very issue that drove Kaepernick to silently protest the national anthem was likely affected, and drastically, by Tuesday's result. Black boys and men should expect to be at greater peril under the administration of Trump, who long has been dismissive of police brutality claims and ran on a law-and-order platform aligned with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Both are advocates of stop-and-frisk policing ,which studies showed didn't impact crime and, more disturbingly, targeted black males. The later finding landed New York City in court, where the policy was found to be discriminatory and unconstitutional. Kaepernick suggested that he didn't vote because he didn't see any election result dismantling systemic racism in this country. That may be true. But being dismissive of the process for such a reason ran counter to the reason to protest. It signaled defeat. It conceded victory. It recognized as supreme the very paradigm he sought to shift.   [Kaepernick refuses to stand for anthem to protest police shootings]  It also disrespected the names on the circular granite table across the street from the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., just around the corner from Dexter Avenue Baptist Church where Martin Luther King Jr. pastored during the Montgomery Bus Boycott in the middle '50s. The inscribed names include Rev. George W. Lee, who was murdered in Belzoni, Miss., in 1955 after he refused white officials' demand that he end his effort to register black people to vote. And Jimmie Lee Jackson, who died in Marion, Ala., from a beating and shooting by state troopers as he tried to protect his grandfather and mother during an attack on civil rights marchers.  The extrajudicial killing of Lee led to the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march in 1965 that ended at the Alabama Capitol stairs, just around the corner from this Civil Rights Memorial to the movement's martyrs. It took his death, and that of dozens of others, to get the Voting Rights Act passed. It all reminds that social justice, for which Kaepernick's actions have been lauded, is not achieved simply by a sole act, repeating a slogan or re-tweeting a hashtag. It is gained by a multi-skewered attack of which participation in the electoral process is among the prongs that anyone interested in change, including our new generation of protesters from the sports arena, should embrace.   Kevin B. Blackistone, ESPN panelist and visiting professor at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, writes sports commentary for The Post. "

Chris Christie convicted in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing case filed for a new trial Friday, a week after a federal jury found them guilty on all counts in a scheme to use gridlock to punish a political opponent. Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, a top appointee to the authority that operates the bridge, were each convicted on seven counts of wire fraud, conspiracy and misusing the bridge for improper purposes. Prosecutors said they engineered traffic jams in the town adjacent to the bridge to retaliate against its Democratic mayor who didn't endorse Christie in 2013. Christie, a member of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, wasn't charged, but testimony during the trial contradicted what he's said he knew about it. He continued this week to deny any prior knowledge. Vice President-elect Mike Pence was selected Friday to lead Trump's transition team, replacing Christie. Christie will now serve as vice chairman. Meanwhile, a New Jersey lawmaker who co-chaired a legislative committee that probed the lane closings in 2014 called this week for impeachment hearings and for the release of notes on Christie's interviews with federal investigators. On Thursday, Christie's office called state Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg's calls for hearings ""ridiculous."" David Wildstein, a former political blogger who attended high school with Christie in the 1970s and was Baroni's right-hand man at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, pleaded guilty in 2015 and testified for the government at the trial. Attorneys for Baroni and Kelly argued in court that jurors should have been instructed to return not-guilty verdicts if they believed the government didn't prove the two had conspired with Wildstein for the purpose of punishing Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. Wildstein testified he concocted the scheme. U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton disagreed, ruling the government didn't have to prove the motive behind the conspiracy, only that Baroni and Kelly conspired to break the law -- in this case, to misapply Port Authority property, i.e., the bridge. Defense attorneys filed a motion for a mistrial during jury deliberations last week that was denied by Wigenton. The motion was redacted, and neither attorney has revealed what it contained.

Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was counting on it. But the ""rising American electorate,"" as it's called, failed to carry Clinton across the finish line. It didn't even come close. According to national exit polls, among Latino voters she fell six points from President Obama's numbers in 2012; she dropped five points each among 18-to-29-year-olds, unmarried women and African Americans. Together, these groups made up the same percentage of the electorate in 2016 as they had in 2012. Some of the battleground-state figures are even more striking. In Ohio, Clinton was 13 points behind Obama among 18-to-29-year-olds. In New Mexico, she fell 11 points among Latinos. Why did the Democrats' strategy fail so miserably? Ultimately, because they overestimated the strength of a coalition based on identity politics. This strategy goes back, unfortunately, to ""The Emerging Democratic Majority,"" a book Ruy Teixeira and I wrote in 2002. We argued that by the end of the first decade of the century, a progressive-centrist coalition based on professionals, women, minorities and ""close to an even split"" of the white working class would create majorities for Democrats. That's what happened in 2006 and 2008. But in the wake of the Great Recession, Republicans were able to convince many white working-class voters that Obama administration policies had bypassed them, leading to a Republican wave in 2010. Liberal Democrats consoled themselves with a modification of our theory. They argued that demographics were trending in their favor, with a growing portion of the electorate represented by unmarried women, millennials and ""people of color"" (a highly misleading grab-bag term). In their view, Democrats didn't need to worry so much about the shrinking white working class. Proponents of the ""rising American electorate"" theory included pollsters Stanley Greenberg and Celinda Lake; Page Gardner, the president of the Voter Participation Center; and senior analysts from the Center for American Progress. Last year Gardner promised that ""the Rising American Electorate will be game changers in the upcoming elections."" Clinton's campaign put a version of the theory -- with the addition of a few other groups, such as people with disabilities -- into practice. It ran ads targeted at these voters, including more than 2,500 Spanish-language ads from January through September. Clinton anointed singer Katy Perry and television star Lena Dunham as surrogates to court the millennial vote and called on LeBron James , Beyonce and Jay Z to help get out the black vote. And the campaign hoped that her historic candidacy would appeal to the key group of unmarried women. At the Democratic convention, Clinton first appeared in a video showing her breaking a glass ceiling. She sought to unite her coalition with a vision of inclusivity and a promise to advance the fortunes of each group (Latinos, for instance, got immigration reform, and millennials got relief from student debt), along with a warning that Donald Trump -- who conveniently managed to insult each of Clinton's target groups at one point or another -- meant them harm. But Democrats can't win elections simply by appealing to the identity groups of the rising American electorate. These groups don't add up to a sure majority unless one assumes the Democrat wins near-unanimity among them and the Republican only bare majorities or less among Republican-trending groups. Besides such traditional GOP constituencies as farmers, small-business people and managers, three groups of voters have become increasingly Republican: the white working class, defined as whites without a four-year college degree; whites with a four-year college degree but not an advanced degree; and seniors. While the proportional numbers of the white working class have been shrinking over the past few decades, they remain formidable, particularly in battleground states, and the numbers of four-year-degree whites and seniors have not been declining.  Here's a back-of-the-envelope calculation: If you leave out white voters with advanced degrees -- who by a small majority have backed Democrats -- then whites without college degrees and with four-year degrees made up about 60 percent of the electorate, and much higher shares in states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Iowa, on which the election turned. In Ohio and Wisconsin, for instance, these groups composed somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of the electorate. The Republicans got about 60 percent of their vote, which was enough to win these states regardless of the Democrats' large margins among nonwhites or Clinton's success among single women and millennials. What about the future? Won't America's turn toward a majority-minority nation -- which the census forecasts for 2044 -- create an automatic Democratic majority? Much of that reasoning rests on the rising population of Hispanics and on an assumption, implicit in a term like ""people of color,"" that as Latinos age, settle, and move up the income and education ladder, as other minorities have done, they will remain loyal Democrats. But there are signs that Hispanics are following a trajectory more similar to that of the Irish than African Americans. In the American National Election Study  of the 2012 vote, Hispanic support for Obama was 70 percent among those with only a high school diploma but 55 percent among those with some college. (There is no similar data available yet for 2016.) There is also a political divide between first-generation immigrants and American-born Hispanics. According to a Gallup poll in August, Clinton enjoyed a far greater edge over Trump among foreign-born Hispanics than among those born in the United States. According to a Pew poll, bilingual Hispanics were far more supportive of Clinton than those who speak only English.  And there is a further complication. As sociologist Richard Alba has contended, when Hispanics intermarry with whites, they often identify their children as white. These, of course, are elusive socio-political categories masquerading as racial or national designations, but the liberals who argue that a majority-minority nation will favor Democrats are basing their claim on how voters identify themselves. It is equally difficult to make a case that younger voters will inevitably tilt Democratic. In Iowa this year, Trump and Clinton split the 18-to-29-year-old vote that Obama had won easily. In Missouri, where younger votes backed Obama by 58 to 39 percent in 2012, they supported Trump this time by 51 to 40 percent. And in national and several key state surveys, there is some evidence that Democrats are losing their sure grip on 30-something millennials.   None of this suggests the converse: that the Republicans, with their current majorities of the white working class, four-year college graduates and older voters, have a lock on the presidency or Congress. What it suggests is that politics matters. In the United States, our party coalitions are heterogeneous. The New Deal Democrats grouped together Northern big-city ethnics with Southern whites and union leaders with Texas oilmen. The Reagan coalition brought together Walmart and country-club Republicans. Obama's coalition included Wall Street and Silicon Valley high rollers along with the inner-city poor. But the key to winning elections has been to define a majority that can include your coalition as well as a significant slice of your rival's. Politicians and parties have traditionally done this by purporting to champion the people (defined variously as the middle class, the forgotten Americans, the common man) against an elite of some kind that is blocking the achievement of a goal that the people hold dear. The existence of a common adversary is essential to holding together what might otherwise be feuding groups. Ronald Reagan's coalition was united by a common opposition to ""big government"" liberals who were soft on communism. This year, Trump championed the ""silent majority"" (a Richard Nixon term) and Franklin Roosevelt's ""forgotten America"" against an establishment that was standing in the way of ""making America great again.""  Politics, of course, is vastly more complicated than this, and so is actual governing. But our successful politicians have adhered to this simple formula and have subsumed their platforms and programs on trade, taxes, immigration and foreign policy under it. For Clinton, the adversary was Trump, but it was also, as the campaign developed, the ""basket of deplorables"" who backed him. While Clinton claimed she meant only a subset of Trump's white working-class supporters, her charge was taken -- with some justice -- as applying to the group in its entirety. So instead of creating a majority that included her base plus a significant slice of potential Republican voters, Clinton defined her coalition against them. (Many liberal pundits reinforced this perception by repeatedly characterizing Trump's voters as poorly informed and racist, even though in 2008 and 2012 many of these voters backed Obama.) Infused with the promise of a rising American electorate, Clinton wrote off the significant slice of voters Democrats need -- in states like Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin -- to win majorities. But she also failed, except among single and college-educated women, to sufficiently rouse her target groups. Millennials, it turns out, care about more than the relief of their student debts. Hispanics don't necessarily rate immigration reform first among their concerns, and many of them are as leery of illegal immigration as one of Trump's so-called deplorables. They want a larger vision of the future. In this year's election, Clinton didn't give it to them, and for that reason her vote fell short even among the groups she relied on.

Winning this swing state with 52 percent of the vote was one of the keys to Trump's victory Tuesday. During a contentious campaign, the billionaire promised to build a wall on the Mexican border to help stem illegal immigration. Even before Trump's triumph, a raucous, pro-American crowd was expected in Columbus, where the U.S. has beaten El Tri 2-0 in four consecutive home qualifiers.  ""I certainly think there's an added layer to this game, given everything that's gone on the last few months,"" U.S. captain Michael Bradley said. ""We have total respect for everybody and a real appreciation not just for the Mexican-Americans but for the people from around the world who come and make a new life for themselves in our country."" Players said Thursday they don't think the political climate will affect the usually dialed-up intensity between the two sides. There is already so much at stake at the beginning of the final round of qualifying, known as the hexagonal.  ""I would hope not, you know?"" midfielder Alejandro Bedoya said. ""I know there are people out there who would like to politicize this game, but I don't see the need for it. It's a rivalry -- U.S. vs. Mexico. It's nothing more than that. We're going to try to kick each other's butt on the field."" Bedoya said he hopes the fans respect the Mexican team, as well.  ""I'm not really that concerned,"" midfielder Sacha Kljestan said. ""I think the message is that we be positive with each other and really come together, like we always do. I'm not worried."" Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio, a native of Colombia, sidestepped questions about the political overtones. Mexico didn't make its players available to comment Thursday.  ""I was first an exchange student, then I was an immigrant in the United States trying to get a great opportunity and work, and work as hard as any American. So I can sympathize with how the Mexicans feel about the whole situation,"" Osorio said. ""Nevertheless my efforts are all directed toward winning the game and nothing else. I'm really not here to discuss any political issues."" The match is the opener of the 10-game final round of qualifying in the North and Central American and Caribbean region. The top three nations qualify for the 2018 World Cup, and the No. 4 team advances to a playoff against the fifth-place Asian team for another berth. The U.S. plays Costa Rica on Tuesday. Defender Geoff Cameron, midfielder Kyle Beckerman and forward Chris Wondolowski will miss the match because of injuries. Tim Howard is expected to be back in goal for the U.S., and he comes to Columbus on a high note. He saved two penalty kicks during the Colorado Rapids' shootout victory against the L.A. Galaxy on Sunday, sending the club to its first Western Conference Final since 2010. Mexico has gone 12-1-2 since Osorio, a former Chicago Fire and New York Red Bulls coach, took over in October 2015 -- the loss was 7-0 to Chile in the Copa America quarterfinals in June.  ""We have big respect for them,"" Bradley said. ""And we've always prided ourselves on the fact that playing against them has always brought out the best in us. And we have guys who live to play in these types of games. History shows that the team that wins is the team that has more guys who are able to embrace the magnitude of the game and make big plays when it counts."" ___ Follow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy ___ This story has been corrected to show Mexico's coach is from Colombia, not Argentina.

Bush says name isnâ€™t liability after Trumpâ€™s win	" AUSTIN, Texas -- The only member of the Bush family currently holding elected office isn't worried about his political future being threatened by a rejection of dynasty politics that may have helped doom Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush campaigned for Donald Trump as chairman of his state Republican Party's victory committee, despite his family's well-publicized shunning of the billionaire businessman. Bush says Trump's success repudiating politics-as-usual won't make it harder for a member of one of America's best-known political families to succeed in upcoming elections.  ""I think, through my activities serving as victory chair and further positions that I took, it further shows that I'm my own man,"" Bush said in a phone interview Thursday. ""My family understands that more than anybody."" Some voters saw Clinton as too politically entrenched as a former secretary of state, senator and first lady. Bush agreed that Trump ""has disrupted American politics"" but said people ""vote based on the individual."" Bush plans to seek re-election in 2018 as land commissioner, which manages Texas' 13 million acres of public lands and mineral rights for oil and natural gas exploration. Bush's father, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was among the crowded Republican presidential primary field crushed by Trump. George P. Bush initially hesitated to embrace Trump, but eventually traveled Texas praising him while helping raise $1.5 million for the state Republican Party. His family never came around, though. Bush's uncle, former President George W. Bush, didn't cast a presidential vote. His grandfather, George H.W. Bush, won't discuss his vote. But on Wednesday, both former presidents congratulated Trump by phone and Jeb Bush did via Twitter. A fluent Spanish speaker whose mother is from Mexico, George P. Bush said Trump's non-politically correct rhetoric won't make Republican values a tougher sell for Hispanics. He noted that Eva Guzman, a Hispanic Republican justice on Texas' Supreme Court, got more votes in the state Tuesday than any candidate including Trump. Trump beat Clinton by 9 percentage points in Texas, the first time a Republican hasn't coasted to double-digit victory statewide since 2000. But Bush noted that Trump received 4.6 million-plus votes statewide, more than any Republican presidential nominee since at least 1992. Texas had a record 15.1 million people registered and a record 8.8 million cast ballots, but that's still only about 43 percent of all eligible voters statewide. Bush said he hadn't spoken with any relatives since Election Day but would likely see them during the holidays.  ""I respect their decision,"" he said. ""They've earned the right to have their opinion, and I have mine."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
