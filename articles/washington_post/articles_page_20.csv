The Supreme Court has too often granted rights to people that are not found in the Constitution, Thomas said, citing the decision in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal across the country. Both Scalia and Thomas dissented from that decision.  ""With such unchecked judicial power, we leave it for the least accountable branch to decide what newly discovered rights should be appended to our Constitution,"" Thomas told 1,700 people at a Thursday night dinner to honor Scalia, who died in February. He paraphrased Lincoln's Gettysburg address to exhort the audience to ""be dedicated to the unfinished business for which Justice Scalia gave his last full measure of devotion."" Thomas said he and his longtime friend and colleague formed an ""odd couple"" of a white New Yorker and a black man from Georgia. ""But together, we soon became our own band of brothers,"" Thomas said. Thomas' talk to the Federalist Society, along with one earlier Thursday by Justice Samuel Alito, came at an unexpectedly upbeat moment for the conservative legal organization. Many among its 40,000 members had resigned themselves to having Scalia's seat filled by someone more liberal, expecting that Hillary Clinton would become president. President Barack Obama had nominated Judge Merrick Garland for the seat.  ""Then, on Nov. 8, Hurricane Trump hit. The future can be difficult to predict,"" Federalist Society President Eugene Meyer said, referring to Donald Trump's surprising victory. Now Thomas is more likely to acquire a new conservative ally. Indeed, nine state and federal judges on Trump's list of possible Supreme Court nominees are taking part in the group's conference, which runs through Saturday. Thomas regaled the crowd with portions of Scalia's opinions over the years. He urged ""that these words spoken and written by Justice Scalia not be the final word written in support of originalism and constitutionalism. Rather, they ought to be a prologue."" Originalism refers to their shared belief that the words of the Constitution should be given the meaning they had when it was written. Alito issued his own rallying cry to conservatives earlier Thursday, describing religious freedom and gun rights as among ""constitutional fault lines,"" important issues at stake in the federal courts.

In excursions a year ago and then last April, scientists examined the normally stunning coral reefs around the island of Kiritimati and pronounced it mostly a boneyard of dead coral. About 85 percent of the coral was dead, 10 percent was sick and bleached but still technically alive, and only 5 percent was doing OK. The same scientists returned this month and found that 6 to 7 percent of the coral is alive and not bleached, said University of Victoria coral reef scientist Julia Baum, speaking by Skype from the island.  ""We left with a sense of dread and came back with a renewed purpose because there are some corals that literally came back from the brink,"" said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb, who returned from the expedition earlier. ""It's the best we could have hoped for."" Many of the fish that rely on the reef and had been absent seem to be back, Cobb said. Hot water -- mostly from El Nino, the natural occasional warming of the Pacific that changes weather worldwide, and man-made global warming -- had made the area one of the worst hit coral spots in the world. Later, nearby Jarvis Island was even more damaged. And the death of 85 percent of the coral of the better known and much larger Great Barrier Reef has been reported, said C. Mark Eakin, coral reef watch coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  ""But despite this mass mortality, there are a few small signs of hope,"" Baum said. ""It's clear that coral reefs have great resilience and the coral here is trying to recover."" Not only has some of the bleached coral recovered, she said, but ""there are coral babies that have settled on the reef sometime in the last year to year and half and these are the reef's best hope for recovery."" A study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology goes back more than a million years and finds that even during mass die-offs, coral species are able to rebound. Eakin points to Scott reef off western Australia where 12 years after the damaging 1998 El Nino coral die-off, nearly half the original reef revived. But it was damaged again by the recent El Nino. Even after the recovery seen at Kiritimati, Baum is wary: ""It's like having a patient who is very sick and instead of letting them recover we keep infecting them with more and more illnesses. There's only so much that any person -- or any natural system -- can take."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

""I know over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves whether America is the country we thought it was,"" Clinton said at an event hosted by the Children's Defense Fund. ""The divisions laid bare by this election run deep, but please listen to me when I say this: America is worth it, our children are worth it. Believe in our country, fight for our values, and never, ever give up."" The Democratic nominee made no direct mention of Republican President-elect Donald Trump during her remarks, which were part of a program that honored children who had overcome poverty and other odds to find success in their lives. An aide said Clinton had agreed to appear at the event prior to Election Day and wanted to honor her commitment regardless. It was in many ways a poignant setting. Clinton went to work for the Children's Defense Fund after graduating from law school and later served on its board. She has long considered Marian Wright Edelman, the organization's founder, to be a mentor. And as Clinton noted Wednesday night, the first stop Bill Clinton made after winning the presidency in 1992 was the same awards program. ""I will admit, coming here tonight wasn't the easiest thing for me,"" Hillary Clinton told the crowd gathered in an auditorium at the Newseum, just a few blocks from the Capitol, where, in January, Trump will be sworn in. ""There have been a few times this past week when all I wanted to do is just to curl up with a good book or our dogs and never leave the house again."" She was greeted with thunderous applause and chants of ""Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!"" as she strode onto stage in a blue pantsuit and offered a broad wave. Edelman, who introduced her, recounted Clinton's achievements as first lady, a senator from New York and secretary of state. And Edelman noted two distinctions Clinton holds as a woman: the first to be the nominee of a major political party in the United States and the first to win the popular vote in a U.S. presidential election -- even if Trump prevailed in the electoral college. ""We're going to say she is the people's president,"" Edelman said to great applause. Clinton also noted in her remarks that some innovative work on children's issues is taking place in Republican-led states and reminded her audience that passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program while she was first lady would not have been possible without the help of some Republican lawmakers. ""Even if it may not seem like it right now, there is common ground to build upon,"" Clinton said. While Wednesday marked her first formal appearance since the election, Clinton has reached out to supporters on conference calls in recent days, including one Monday with Democratic lawmakers. ""No one is sorrier than me,"" Clinton said on that call, according to a Democrat who participated. ""Heartbreaks don't heal overnight, and this one won't.""  Clinton started working for the Children's Defense Fund in 1973, after she graduated from Yale Law School. Her early work included going door-to-door in poverty-stricken parts of Bedford, Mass., to collect data. During her campaign, Clinton frequently brought up that service, citing Edelman as a mentor who taught her that standing up against injustice was her ""North Star."" The relationship between the two women has endured some rough patches, most notably in 1996 when President Bill Clinton signed a welfare reform bill, legislation Edelman saw as punitive toward children. Edelman's husband, Peter Edelman, quit his Clinton administration job in protest over the bill, and the tensions lingered for years. During Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, Edelman told an interviewer that the Clintons were ""not friends in politics."" None of that past tension was evident Wednesday night. After Clinton waved goodbye as she walked off stage, Edelman paid her a final tribute. ""I just thank Hillary for just who she is and what she's done and she's going to continue to do,"" she said. ""And so thank you. We love you. We love you."" "

So when he showed up to a news conference after a victory at Carolina last Sunday, and there was a tiny silver safety pin on his shirt, a subtle act intended to promote tolerance stood out.  ""It's funny,"" Smith said Wednesday, ""I didn't even think it got noticed at the time."" Wearing safety pins has become commonplace following the presidential election as people in all walks of life, many of whom are concerned about Donald Trump's proposed policies, have made public their desire for a more inclusive and diverse society.  ""I'll tell you what it wasn't: It wasn't anything political. Nothing to do with the presidential election. For me, just everything to do with tolerance, understanding,"" Smith explained before heading out to practice.  ""Something I found out about at my kids' school where they were teaching about diversity and tolerance, and I don't know why. Just felt like it was pertinent at the time."" Some athletes have expressed their dissatisfaction with Trump's election, including Tampa Bay wide receiver Mike Evans, who sat during the national anthem before last week's game against Chicago. The Chiefs play the Buccaneers this Sunday. That wasn't Smith's intent, though. The safety pin was meant to draw attention to the divisiveness in the country. The election may have been part of it, but so has racial discrimination that led to the Black Lives Matter movement, and perceived attacks on sexual orientation and gender equality that have been linked to North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2.  ""There's a lot going on right now. Things are crazy. I think there's a lack of understanding across the spectrum between people of different beliefs,"" Smith said. ""It had nothing to do with the presidential election or the outcome and everything to do with tolerance and diversity."" The Chiefs have supported their players' freedom to speak on social issues. In the season opener, cornerback Marcus Peters raised a gloved fist during the national anthem in a ""black power salute"" that was reminiscent of Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. Peters said the act was meant to increase awareness of racial inequality, and that he stood in solidarity with 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has been kneeling for the anthem this season.  ""That's what is so great about America, right?"" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. ""The NFL does a great job of letting people express themselves not only on the field as players, but also as people.  ""We're just a microcosm of what this country is,"" Reid added. ""It's all healthy. That's what makes this country the greatest place in the world to live."" Smith said he didn't mean to draw attention away from the win over the Panthers, nor did he want to create a stir in the locker room. But he did say the locker room can be representative of the kind of tolerance people should embrace, pointing out that the 53 guys on the Chiefs roster come from different states with different social and economic backgrounds and varying religious beliefs.  ""Growing up, playing team sports, there's guys in this locker room that think a vast variety of ways,"" Smith said. ""That comes back to respect and understanding, and there's a lot of respect and understanding in this locker room."" Smith didn't say whether he would continue to wear a pin this season, but he did underscore that he didn't want the small act intended to promote unity to become disruptive.  ""Like I said, it's about understanding of all humans. I don't care what you believe, where you stand -- Muslim, Jewish, Christian, you name it,"" Smith said.  ""I do know it's been tied here or there, but that's certainly not why I wore it. It originated from my kids' school and they're trying to teach about diversity. I wasn't trying to be a distraction."" ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The seven men and one woman are accused of forming in 2015 the ""Freital Group,"" named after a suburb of the eastern city of Dresden that has seen a string of anti-refugee protests and other incidents amid a surge in far-right attacks following a huge influx of refugees and other migrants.  ""The goal of this group was to carry out bombing attacks on asylum-seeker facilities as well as homes, offices and vehicles of those with different political thinking,"" prosecutors said. ""Through that, the suspects wanted to create a climate of fear and repression."" Using banned powerful firecrackers from the Czech Republic, prosecutors say they made pipe bombs and other improvised explosive devices. They're accused of several attacks, including blowing up the car of a Left party politician and a Left party office in Freital, as well as two bombings of refugee homes in which windows were blown out and one asylum-seeker suffered facial cuts. All eight have been in custody since April. They were identified as Timo S., 27; Patrick F., 25; Philipp W., 29; Justin S., 19; Maria K., 28; Mike S., 38; Sebastian W., 26; and Rico K., 38. Their last names were withheld in line with German privacy laws. Timo S. and Patrick F. are accused of having a ""central leadership role"" in the organization, responsible for the planning and organization of the attacks. In addition to terrorism charges, seven of the suspects are charged with attempted murder, while Mike S. is charged with accessory to attempted murder. They also face various explosives related charges. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

"   Donald Trump at a February a campaign rally in North Charleston, S.C. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)  Yes, I got this presidential election very wrong. I was certain that Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, would win the White House. Why, after more than three decades of quite successful handicapping, did I misread the signs? Were the signs even there? As always, I relied on survey data and more than a handful of rules of thumb about campaigns and elections developed over the years to evaluate the electability of candidates. This year, the indicators I trusted led me down the wrong path. Here is an autopsy of my misjudgment. First, I assumed, as in other years, that the traditional measures of candidate quality mattered, and I relied on a handful of poll questions to show me not only what voters were thinking but also how they would behave. Over and over again, post-convention polls found Trump with higher ""unfavorable"" ratings than Hillary Clinton. Both candidates were upside down (having higher negatives than positives), but Clinton's numbers on that key question were normally a few points better. In addition, when pollsters asked whether Clinton and Trump were qualified to be president and had the right temperament for the job, the differences were stunning -- Clinton had huge advantages on both qualities. Just as important, on Clinton's most glaring political liability, her trustworthiness and honesty, polls repeatedly showed voters saw little difference between the two candidates. Indeed, in exit polling, 36 percent of respondents said that Clinton was honest and trustworthy, compared with only 33 percent who said the same about Trump. Together, these facts convinced me that Trump's ceiling of support was considerably lower than Clinton's. After all, if only 38 percent thought Trump was qualified to be president, how could he win when the eventual winner would probably need at least 45 percent of the vote? I mistakenly concluded that voters could not and would not vote for a candidate they deemed ""unqualified"" for the presidency. I also read too much into the various ballot tests in the weeks and months before the election. I've been relying on public opinion surveys for decades, comparing public polls -- such as those conducted by The Washington Post-ABC News and NBC News-Wall Street Journal -- with poll numbers gathered, but not released to the public, by Republican and Democratic pollsters I hold in high regard. I did that again this year. What I found was that both the public and private polls showed Clinton had a clear advantage in the presidential contest. In the final week, the consistency of those surveys was remarkable. While those polls ultimately called the winner of the popular vote correctly (Clinton), they never conveyed the sense that the race would be a squeaker. Yes, each ballot test was within the margin of error of the final outcome, but the fact that they all missed in a single direction -- toward Clinton -- gave me greater confidence in the eventual margin than I should have had. The outcome never appeared so close that one candidate could win the popular vote while the other candidate would win a majority of the electoral vote. Yet, that is exactly what happened. In most elections, the responses to survey questions about candidate qualities and vote preference predict the outcome. But this year was different. What I didn't understand, of course, was that enough voters in just the right combination of states were so frustrated and angry with the status quo that they simply were ready to burn down the building rather than try to rehabilitate it. Voting for Trump, the candidate mocked by the media and disdained by the establishment, was the way to do that. Even if he was unqualified. Even if he had the wrong temperament. Even if he wasn't more honest and trustworthy. Even if -- maybe because -- he was a vulgar, intemperate bully. Second, I was completely wrong in my assessment that there weren't enough white voters to elect Trump. While I was right that whites as a percentage of the electorate would drop to 70 percent, the lowest number in history, that fact turned out to be irrelevant, not predictive. Those whites who turned out gave Trump a larger margin than ever before. That was surprising, since most surveys during the fall showed Trump winning whites by 12 or 15 points, far less than Romney's margin in 2012. I had no reason to expect Clinton would underperform compared with President Obama's 2012 showing among Latinos and Asian Americans -- or that Trump would slightly outperform Romney among those two minority groups. All the national data indicated Trump might draw 1 in 5 Latinos, certainly nothing near 29 percent, as the exit polling found. In a fundamental error, I also could not imagine there would be many Obama-Trump voters. But as a recent Washington Post piece showed, there were some of those voters in key states that decided the election. Finally, you might ask, why didn't I know that voters were so angry that they might upset the apple cart on Election Day? In fact, I wrote repeatedly about the public's dissatisfaction, anger and desire for change (citing the ""right direction/wrong track"" question). I knew there was anger, especially on the political right. The outcome of the GOP nomination fight made that quite clear. But I also saw a Republican Party that nominated Romney, an establishment candidate, just four years ago, and I saw few signs of political revolution during the 2016 House and Senate primaries. And even with the public's anger, I thought Trump was a deeply flawed -- and ultimately unacceptable -- messenger. Having watched elections for decades and learned a few lessons about the American people, I didn't think that the country would elect a nominee who said that he knew more than the generals about defeating the Islamic State, was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan, would not release his taxes, belittled and bullied political adversaries, journalists and other public figures, and was churlish, undignified and narcissistic. My view of the basic nature of the American electorate, which had been confirmed by decades of past election results and seemed to be confirmed by the polling data, proved to be incorrect this time. The question is whether the indicators I used in the past are outdated and now lack any predictive value or whether the 2016 election was an aberration -- a rare temper tantrum by part of the electorate -- after which our politics returns to normal. In my mind, that is now an open question."

"   A voter casts his ballot in San Francisco on Nov. 8. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)  Last week, I wrote about the origins of the electoral college. I said I would ""hold off on the debate"" over the electoral college's merits ""until Wednesday, anyway!"" Well, that debate has indeed been rekindled. As of Nov. 13, Hillary Clinton is almost certain to win the national popular vote; according to CNN, the current gap is more than 631,000 votes. But Donald Trump was on track to win more than 300 votes in the electoral college, comfortably more than the 270 required to be elected president.   [Wait, why do we even have an electoral college?]   Over time, more than 700 constitutional amendments to change the electoral college system have been proposed. But perhaps because the electoral college normally does track the popular vote, its would-be reformers have rarely gained much traction. Even the 2000 election, which, after all, carried the asterisk of Florida's chad-borne chaos and court-denied recounts, did not generate sustained public debate about the electoral college.   [Hillary Clinton will keep gaining votes after election night. Here's why.]   The argument for repealing the electoral college is straightforward The main repeal argument is simple: that the electoral college is not directly democratic and thus violates the principle of ""one person, one vote."" Some states' residents are more equal than others'. In 2012, for example, nearly 37 million people lived in California; about 13 million of them voted for president, determining the fate of 55 electoral votes. Wyoming had fewer than 570,000 residents and 249,000 voters, who allocated three electoral votes. The former voters had far more absolute power as a collective, of course -- no political consultant would advise a candidate to try to win Wyoming and not California. Still, each Wyoming voter in 2012 was worth 2.87 California voters in terms of her individual share of her respective state's electoral votes.    Example of a state's certified electoral college votes from the 2008 presidential election. (Source: National Archives)  George Edwards III concludes that ""the electoral college poses a ... fundamental threat to American democracy. ... It is difficult to find a contemporary theorist who argues that some people's votes should count for more than other people's votes."" There are other objections, too. For instance, electors can vote for whomever they want. The framers of the Constitution hoped that the electors would be independent, well-informed about national policy and potential leaders. But these days electors are often chosen by party slate and not even identified to voters as individuals; independent judgment is actually disqualifying. The idea of using party loyalists as electors is to make sure the state's electoral votes follow its popular vote. But even so, ""faithless electors"" are a theoretical possibility and an occasional reality. Electors are often bound by state law to support the popular vote winner in their state, but while such laws are constitutional, it is far from clear that those laws could be enforced. So why not change it? Those who oppose repeal stress that the United States was designed not as a popular democracy but as a republic -- a representative democracy. As detailed in my last post, the electoral college was a compromise, not a masterpiece of applied political theory. But it was not a random compromise. It fit the selection of the presidency into a federal system of separated and checked powers.   [Hate Trump if you want. But democracy requires respecting the winner's legitimacy.]   Consistent with this, the electoral college watered down the ability of a geographically concentrated majority to impose its choice of chief executive on the rest of the country. The Constitution assumes majorities can tyrannize, that majorities can be factions that place their own interests above the nation's. (Indeed, that is James Madison's focus in his famous Federalist 10.) Regional interests do vary in a nation the size of the United States. The electoral college's inducement to build cross-community coalitions in numerous states should press candidates to think about programs with broader appeal. Further, while we talk about a national popular vote reflecting an electoral majority, it runs the risk of splintering the vote instead. Judith Best argues that the ""magnifier"" effect of the electoral college usefully converts popular pluralities -- like that of Bill Clinton, twice -- to authority-enhancing majorities, and forestalls the possibility that the House will wind up choosing the president. A national plebiscite could readily attract many candidates. Would a four- or five-way race in which the winner got 30 percent or less be better? Darin DeWitt and Thomas Schwartz argue in the current issue of the political science journal PS that a plurality winner could readily be someone detested by the majority. Solving that problem raises additional structural questions. Would a minimum percentage be required to win? If so, what percentage? Would there be a runoff election? Some sort of ranked-choice voting?   [Everyone is sure their side is going to win -- even when it's about to lose big. Here's how we know.]   As this suggests, the electoral college narrows voters' choices. Both proponents and opponents of the electoral college point out that its ""winner-take-all"" nature reinforces a two-party system. Opponents argue that this prevents alternate views from being aired; those who support third-party candidacies are urged not to ""waste"" their votes. Proponents say it leads to a more stable system and, again, clear winners. The process of amending the Constitution is notoriously hard. As Julia Azari points out: ""If the candidate and party in question had had enough energy and organization behind them to change the Constitution, they probably would have won the election in the first place."" So some reformers have chosen midway points -- for instance, the idea of allocating of electoral votes by congressional district, as in Nebraska or Maine. But with congressional districts drawn to benefit one party, such a strategy actually makes voters even less equal -- because it distinguishes between voters within a state as well as across states. Limiting campaigning to intentionally homogenized districts will simply replicate the House -- which in at least one recent presidential election has produced a solid House majority for a party receiving, yes, less than a plurality of the national vote.   [How rural resentment helps explain Donald Trump's surprising victory]   The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative is more ambitious, taking advantage of states' free rein in choosing the way they assign their electors. NPV is an interstate compact that would require states to have their electors vote for the winner of the national popular vote, no matter who wins their own state. (For much more detail on the NPV, see the exchange between John Koza and DeWitt and Schwartz in the issue of PS mentioned above.) The NPV is likely constitutional. But it too raises questions. What if states decide to leave the compact? The possibility of a candidate selected by a tiny plurality remains. And what if a spree of faithless electors results? In short, as with any serious institutional reform, replacing the electoral college brings both rewards and risks Some believe the rewards obviously win the day. If one thinks that plurality rule is the only legitimate form of democratic choice, then the electoral college cannot be legitimate. Edwards argues that although the framers' choices violated political equality in various places, ""it does not follow that these compromises are inviolate,"" and that Americans have rightly democratized other aspects of the Constitution over time. Others note that this year's situation occurs rarely, and that cross-state coalition-building benefits governance. DeWitt and Schwartz warn, too, against unintended consequences, writing, ""the greatest merit of the electoral college system as it has come to be implemented is the cost of replacing it."" That cost could decrease if the divergence between electoral college result and popular vote becomes more frequent. Alternately, the political parties might broaden their reach to a wider range of voters, realigning the two modes of choice. Either way, in the shorter term, voters upset by the outcome of a given national election can turn to activism at other levels of government. As President Obama told graduating students this spring, ""That's how we change our politics -- by electing people at every level who are representative of and accountable to us."" A federal republic, after all, provides freedoms as well as frustrations."

Critics say so.	" President-elect Donald Trump's new chief strategist and senior counselor, Stephen K. Bannon, has been called a racist, an anti-Semite and a white nationalist. And that's just since Sunday, when Trump announced that he would be giving Bannon, the former head of the far-right website Breitbart News, a central White House role. It's true that Bannon has attracted legions of followers who describe themselves as white supremacists. It's less clear whether Bannon's own actions and words prove that he is one, too.  Bannon describes himself as a leader of the alt-right, a loose term describing a far-right ideology that includes opposition to immigration and ""globalism."" Bannon declined to comment on the record, but there is little evidence that the nationalism question -- occasionally litigated in the campaign -- slowed his path to a job that requires no Senate confirmation.  Shortly after joining Trump's campaign in August, Bannon said in a revealing interview with Mother Jones that, possibly, there were ""some people that are white nationalists that are attracted to some of the philosophies of the alt-right."" That, he said, could no more define ""alt-right"" than the presence of extremists on the left could identify their movement.     The Post's Robert Costa and Paul Farhi discuss the appointments by President-elect Donald Trump of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor and Reince Priebus as chief of staff. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   But by and large, the alt-right is not racist, he said. ""If you look at the identity movements over there in Europe, I think a lot of [them] are really 'Polish identity' or 'German identity,' not racial identity,"" said Bannon. ""It's more identity toward a nation-state or their people as a nation."" Under the site's founder, the late Andrew Breitbart, accusations of racism were dismissed as ""cultural Marxism."" Yet some of the highest praise for Bannon's appointment came from white nationalists and white supremacists. According to SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors far-right and far-left activity on the Internet, a trove of comments celebrating the news have posted on Stormfront, a website for the ""White Nationalist Community,"" including this one from a reader called ""Pheonix1993:"" ""Stephen Bannon: racist, anti-homo, anti-immigrant, anti-jewish, anti-establishment.

Additionally, the white nationalist writer Richard Spencer posted this late Sunday on Twitter: ""Bannon will answer directly to Trump and focus on the big picture, and not get lost in the weeds.

Caption   Vigils and protests flare up from opponents of the president-elect.  Nov. 16, 2016  People march in Los Angeles to protest the appointment of former Breitbart News head Steve Bannon as White House chief strategist. David Mcnew/AFP/Getty Images  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        Under Bannon's leadership, Breitbart became an anti-""globalist"" news site clearly aligned with the European far right. It attracts self-described white supremacists with such headlines as ""Bill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew."" It offers a steady stream of opinion essays, such as one by Milo Yiannopoulos in March describing anti-Semitic caricatures as the ""long hair and rock 'n' roll"" of 2016. Direct evidence of racist or anti-Semitic statements by Bannon is harder to find. According to a 2007 court statement, Bannon's ex-wife accused him of not wanting their twin daughters attending a California private school because its student body included too many Jews. The scrutiny will only intensify. Bannon left Breitbart in August to become chief executive of Trump's presidential campaign. Until then, he had never been part of any political campaign. Little of what he did made sense to political reporters looking for the normal tokens of a winning effort -- not the Mississippi rally with Brexit leader Nigel Farage, not the surprise news conference with Bill Clinton's accusers. ""Trump has gone from 2012 GOP style loss to a 2008 GOP style loss,"" wrote Republican pollster Matthew Dowd on Oct. 10. ""The rhetoric that Bannon is feeding Trump makes it increasingly likely that Trump will lose in a landslide,"" wrote the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza on Oct. 16. A few weeks, an FBI letter and tens of thousands of WikiLeaked emails later, Bannon is poised to be Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor. Democrats have laced into him, but Republicans, taking the lead of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, have not mentioned Bannon at all, not even to point out that many Breitbart staffers are Jewish. And there is talk of more Breitbart reporters joining Bannon at the White House, in roles that do not require Senate confirmation. Since 2012, when Bannon became Breitbart's chief executive, the site has defied doubts about what it could be without its charismatic founder and survived several tumultuous scraps with former staffers. The latest, just nine months ago, was telling of how Breitbart and Bannon viewed the media. After a Trump victory speech, Michelle Fields, then a reporter for Breitbart, was shoved out of the way by Trump's then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Within a week, she was gone; within a few months, Breitbart was running pieces about her being unable to defend her story. From the outside, the moves looked chaotic. But chat logs published by BuzzFeed found Breitbart staffers agreeing that the scuffle looked bad but that going to ""war"" over it would reflect poorly on a greater cause. That cause was the Trump campaign. Bannon had joked a year before he was hired that he was effectively Trump's campaign manager because the Republican front-runner was a ""nationalist."" He identified Breitbart as a home for the alt-right for the same reason. In Europe, the far right has dealt with the same sort of media coverage as Bannon. Accusations of racism were constant; internal power struggles were seen as proof of the whole project falling apart. But Breitbart, which launched a London branch in early 2014, had seen this before. The site's editor, Raheem Kassam, became chief of staff to Brexit leader Farage as his United Kingdom Independence Party surged.  [Trump's win may be just the beginning of a global populist wave]  The Brexit vote this summer was seen, at Breitbart, as nationalism's great validation. In an analysis by Allum Bokhari and Yiannopoulos, two of the site's U.K. writers, the failure of the ""Remain"" campaign in Britain -- one that united most of both of the country's major parties and most of its experts -- proved that the masses wanted a revolt against ""globalism."" Warnings about what the wrong vote would do to markets, or that it would make people think of voters as racists, meant less than nothing to the anti-globalism working class. ""They think about political sovereignty, independence and national pride,"" Bokhari and Yiannopoulos wrote. ""Elites sneer at these concerns as the foolish, provincial preoccupations of 'low-information voters,' yet they are deeply embedded in human nature, particularly in the search for belonging."" In America, too, Breitbart was the place for news on the revolt against the ""globalists."" European far-right politicians like Geert Wilders and the Le Pens earned regular write-ups. A typical headline: ""Marion Marechal-Le Pen: Either We Kill Islamism or It Kills Us."" Their politics were seen as necessary because of the litany of migrant crimes screaming across Breitbart, such as this headline: ""Previously-Deported Illegal Alien Caught on Camera Destroying Trump Signs While 'at Work.' "" Coverage like that turned Breitbart into a powerhouse; according to the New York Times, it earned more Facebook impressions on election night than Fox News or CNN. More importantly, Bannon helped shape a Trump message that won the condemnation of the Anti-Defamation League -- and helped him in swing states. Trump's closing ad, a two-minute edit of a speech he had given attacking the ""global financial powers,"" struck the ADL as hitting ""anti-Semitic themes."" In the wider media, it was seen as stirring and populist. ""I played the clip for like five different people and I said, 'Is that anti-Semitic?'"" said MSNBC's Joe Scarborough last week. ""No. There are dog whistles, but . . . play that ad to 100 Americans in middle America, 99 of them will go, 'That's cool.' "" Further on the political fringe, Bannon and Breitbart were credited with honing Trump's message against globalism, and unleashing his say-anything approach to talking about terrorism and immigrant crime. Alex Jones, a Texas-based online host who has attacked ""globalists"" and called the 9/11 attacks an inside job, told viewers this week that Trump had thanked him for his coverage. On Jones's online show, after the election, sometime-Trump adviser Roger Stone suggested that Bannon become Trump's chief of staff to keep the momentum of the campaign going. ""I think he has the big picture viewpoint that Trump needs,"" Stone said. ""He knows exactly who the bad guys are. He knows exactly who those who won this victory are.""                "

Passionate fandoms, like the one for Harry Potter, are probably not the reason Donald Trump was elected. Just saying. (Warner Bros. Pictures via Associated Press)  Last week, one of my colleagues asked me to reflect  on the proposition that ""the young, liberal, blue state retreat into fantasy and pop culture as a form of politics is a big reason Trump is president."" As usual, this is the sort of conclusion that is easy to offer but difficult to back up with data. If someone produces convincing evidence that the potential decline in millennial voter turnout from 2012 to 2016 is because those who weren't going to the polls were, say, arguing over the depiction of a young, black female successor to Iron Man, I'll break my staff and drown my book and insist that the only thing worth reading ever again is ""Rules for Radicals."" But until that day arrives, I think a more nuanced analysis of the relationship between culture and political advocacy is the wiser course. It's important to remember that there is a difference between using allusions to the grand narratives of culture to express one's feelings about politics and believing that the consumption of culture is a political act that substitutes for voting, organizing, protesting or other forms of civic engagement. While I certainly believe that voting with your dollars is a valuable way to put weight behind your expressed preferences, I'm also sharply aware that major corporations have a vested interest in convincing consumers that membership in a fandom is a form of citizenship. I have no patience with anyone who believes that cultural expenditures and politics are interchangeable. But at the same time, I've seen people use the language of culture to mobilize in the real world. Andrew Slack and the members of the Harry Potter Alliance fought for four years to get Warner Bros. to commit to new standards of cocoa production for the products sold under the brand of one of the world's largest franchises. The Foundation to Decrease World Suck, a project of the artists and brothers John and Hank Green, disburses hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, raised from fans who identify themselves as Nerdfighters. Just because some people use different language or labels to describe the stakes of a fight or to identify their affiliations doesn't make them unserious or incapable of mobilization. It's also worth noting that the arts and entertainment industries employ millions of Americans, and American cultural exports are both hugely valuable and hugely influential. There's nothing foolish or insubstantial about fighting for equity of opportunity and opposing systemic discrimination in a major industry, or thinking critically and seriously about what we say to the world about what's desirable. But this election is a valuable moment for reflection about the intersection of culture and politics. While discussions about specific casting or directing decisions, for example, drive enormous volumes of traffic to culture sites, fighting battles on that level guarantees that the war will be perpetual: The victory lasts only as long as the movie is in theaters, the show is on the air or the comic book is on the shelf, and there are always new projects coming to fruition. Structural changes in the entertainment industry will require more sustained shifts in large companies and organizations such as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which, to Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs's credit, she has worked hard to bring about. It would be exciting to see the powerful entertainment business unions reach out to fans on issues such as equity and inclusion in hiring and to mobilize audience support for campaigns within the industry. Not merely would such efforts give fans concrete ways to make change in Hollywood, they might give Americans who are either too young to vote, or more invested in culture than politics, some experience in organizing and agitation. Additionally, the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election would be an excellent moment to think about how celebrities can be most useful to the movements to which they feel drawn, beyond their role as a draw at fundraisers. As New York Times television critic James Poniewozik wrote on Twitter, ""The opposition of 99% of showbiz could not stop a reality-TV host's election. Pop culture is the least and most powerful force in America."" If an element of Trump's appeal was that he was a television star who shucked off the liberal conventions of the industry that made him a national figure, then it may be difficult for Democrats to recalibrate the party's relationship with celebrities. And for stars who hope to turn their fans into constituencies, whether for a particular candidate or for issues such as climate change and immigration reform, my hope is that this moment will spur introspection on what's most effective and ideas for new tactics. I think there is little question that cultural backlash was a powerful element of the 2016 election for president, whether in the form of young men radicalized by GamerGate who embraced Donald Trump, or the more nebulous nostalgia for a time when social hierarchies were different, as expressed in the call to ""Make America Great Again."" But until serious evidence emerges that cultural engagement is a culprit in Hillary Clinton's defeat, we should make the same demands of culture, its fans and the industry that produces it that we always have: that culture find a way to speak truths that politics can't and to reach people politicians can't. As with everything else, the work continues."

Ebrahim Sharif of the Waad party had told the AP on Friday he feared the Prince of Wales' visit to the tiny kingdom could ""whitewash"" an ongoing crackdown on dissent there. He also suggested the island's ruling family should enter into a power-sharing agreement with political parties as the kingdom faces growing financial pressure from low oil prices. On Sunday, Bahrain's public prosecution said it questioned an unnamed man over comments made to the foreign press.  ""The public prosecution ordered his release after charging him with openly inciting hatred of the political system in Bahrain and with contempt,"" a statement by prosecutors said. Sharif could not be reached for comment. However, his political party and Sayed Alwadaei of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy identified the man charged as Sharif.  ""Prince Charles was criticized for participating in a blatant PR exercise for the Bahraini regime,"" Alwadaei said in a statement. ""Now in connection to his visit, Bahrain is prosecuting Ebrahim Sharif."" It's not clear what penalties Sharif, who has been imprisoned before in Bahrain, could face if he is convicted. Similar convictions have involved both prison time and fines. Bahrain's government did not respond to a request for comment Sunday. However, it told the AP just days earlier that ""no individual in Bahrain will, or can be, prosecuted for his or her political views due to the freedom of expression protections explicitly stated in the constitution."" Bahrain put down its Arab Spring protests with the help of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The protests were backed by the Shiite majority and others, and were aimed at demanding more political freedoms from the ruling Al Khalifa family. While low-level unrest persisted for years, things remained largely peaceful until April, when Bahrain's military announced it was ""ready to deal firmly and with determination with these sedition groups and their heads"" after a gasoline bomb killed a police officer. Since then, authorities suspended the country's largest Shiite opposition group, Al-Wefaq, and doubled a prison sentence for its secretary-general, Sheikh Ali Salman. Famed activist Nabeel Rajab was imprisoned and now awaits sentencing on a charge of spreading ""false news."" Zainab al-Khawaja, the daughter of well-known activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who himself is serving a life sentence over his role in the 2011 protests, was forced into exile. Meanwhile, the country's security forces have besieged a small town home to a Shiite cleric who had his citizenship stripped by the government earlier this year. ___ Associated Press writer Adam Schreck in Irbil, Iraq, contributed to this report.  ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .
