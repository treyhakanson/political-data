JOHNSBURY, Vt. -- At Dog Mountain, canines and their human owners can take walks on a 150-acre Vermont hillside, enjoy several ponds, attend dog parties and even visit a chapel and an art gallery. Now, a group is hoping to preserve the doggie haven and the vision of Stephen Huneck, the late artist and children's book author who founded it. The Friends of Dog Mountain recently received a $75,000 federal grant that will used to transfer the property to nonprofit ownership and for fundraising and development efforts.  ""The mission is to preserve, steward and protect both Dog Mountain as a public access and asset for future generations to enjoy with their dogs,"" said Scott Buckingham, acting director of the nonprofit Friends of Dog Mountain. Huneck and his wife, Gwen, purchased the property in 1995, transforming the barn into an art studio, and later opening the dog chapel, which welcomes ""all creeds, all breeds, no dogmas allowed."" Huneck, whose whimsical dog-centric prints, sculptures and furniture showed his love of the animals, envisioned the chapel as a ritual space to help people achieve closure after their dogs die. And based on the vast amount of loving notes on the chapel walls from pet owners to lost pets, it has achieved his vision. Dog Mountain, where dogs can go leash-free, remains popular with animal lovers. A USA Today reader contest recently picked the destination as the #1 dog friendly tour or activity. The Friends of Dog Mountain hopes the property can continue to flourish and become an ""economic and cultural asset"" to the St. Johnsbury, Vermont area. Ideas include redoing the barn and holding programs for artists in residence, offering children's art and therapy dog training, said Buckingham. A local arts organization wants to hold a concert series at Dog Mountain -- dogs welcome of course. Dog Mountain has had its financial struggles and its recent history is a tragic one. Huneck, after a battle with depression, killed himself in 2010. Gwen kept Dog Mountain going but after three years, she took her own life. The gallery's creative director said she finds joy in the fact that the destination keeps operating in their honor.  ""It's such a joyous place. It's too bad there's that little bit of a shadow of sadness,"" said Amanda McDermott. But McDermott is hoping the Friends of Dog Mountain effort will help to alleviate some of that. Catrina Nuite, of Brattleboro, was visiting her son when she stopped by with her dog and her son's dog. She said she visits from time and time and likes ""the people, the dogs and the land."" Carolsue Cummings, of Surf City, New Jersey, placed a note in the chapel this week after losing her 16-year-dog. She and her husband and her daughter and son-in-law who live in Vermont also visited the gallery.  ""This is just so nice and so interesting,"" she said. Roaming around the gallery is Sally, a black lab that belonged to Gwen Huneck. She's been adopted by McDermott, who says the comfort people receive by touching and loving a dog is great. Sally provides that comfort to visitors.  ""It's a prescription that I think everybody needs in this type of world,"" McDermott said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Over several years, the U.S. government and other law enforcement agencies paid about $1 million to Jose Santos-Pena, 55, and hundreds of thousands of dollars more to his son, Jose Santos-Hernandez, 34, for information about drug dealers. The pair traveled to multiple countries, including some where Drug Enforcement Administration agents aren't welcome, to make secret recordings of people believed to be involved in drug trafficking. That included Venezuela, where Santos-Pena recorded two nephews of Cilia Flores, the wife of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, handling a block of cocaine. Then, in April, prosecutors learned that while working for the DEA, Santos-Pena and Santos-Hernandez were also hard at work smuggling drugs themselves. In late summer, just as the case against Flores' nephews was getting ready to go to trial in New York, Santos-Pena and Santos-Hernandez pleaded guilty to trafficking charges, admitting dealing drugs for at least four years, including while they were building the Venezuelan case last fall under the direction of the DEA. Prosecutors went ahead anyway with their case against Venezuelans Francisco Flores, 31, and his cousin, Efrain Campo, 30, who were accused of conspiring to ship over 1,700 pounds of cocaine into the U.S. They were arrested in Haiti last year and flown to the U.S. for trial. The government, though, did not know that more surprises lay ahead for its star witness, Santos-Pena. His son did not testify at the trial. At a court hearing in September, Santos-Pena confessed to prosecutors during a lunch break that he had used a prostitute twice during a trip in Caracas, Venezuela, last year. He had also allowed his son's friend to sit in on some of the DEA-orchestrated meetings with their Venezuelan targets. And he admitted that he'd been using cocaine regularly while working for the DEA. And as the trial against Campo and Flores neared its conclusion this month, defense attorney Randall Jackson revealed that he had jailhouse tapes that proved Santos-Pena continued to communicate about drug deals in recent weeks. After the tapes were played for jurors, a prosecutor notified Santos-Pena that his continued lies, including that he had not communicated with his son while in prison, meant the government was ripping up a cooperation agreement that he was counting on to win leniency. Without it, he faces a minimum of 10 years in prison and a maximum of life. Santos-Pena seemed surprised. Prosecutors overcame the humiliation of their star witness when the jury returned a guilty verdict Friday against the nephews.  ""He was slime,"" juror Robert Lewis, a 69-year-old architect, said of Santos-Pena. He said other evidence, including transcripts of conversations involving the nephews and text messages, were enough to prove guilt.  ""We had to rely on those things,"" Lewis said.  ""It's the nature of the business to have cooperators with really unseemly pasts,"" said Daniel C. Richman, a law professor at Columbia Law School. ""Making deals with bad guys are par for the course in a whole range of cases. I don't think it's the nature of the business to have the cooperators breaking the law while purporting to have agreements with the government."" Prosecutors knew going in that Santos-Pena had a shady past. Before he began cooperating with U.S. authorities in 2007, he testified that he had been a member of the Mexico-based Sinaloa drug trafficking cartel for a decade. He moved to the U.S. in 2003. He said he was involved in deals this year in Los Angeles and Pomona, California, involving about 7 kilograms of cocaine. In court papers praising the two informants earlier this year, federal prosecutors wrote that Santos-Pena and Santos-Hernandez had ""participated in multiple significant international drug trafficking investigations, including cases focusing on some of the most violent places in the world targeting extremely violent criminals."" Lawyers for Campo and Flores said in their closing statements to jurors Thursday that the informants are simply liars who shouldn't be believed.  ""You saw a rare thing, a government cooperator get ripped up in court,"" attorney David Rody said. For all the dirt revealed about the informants in the Venezuelan case, they will never rival the notorious history of Salvatore ""Sammy the Bull"" Gravano, who admitted his role in 19 murders in a sweetheart deal that resulted in a five-year prison sentence in exchange for his testimony against the late Gambino boss John Gotti. Still, Richman noted, the issue for jurors is the credibility of the witness. As for Gravano, Richman said: ""He was just a murderer, not a liar."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Can they now get along?	"   Surrounded by retired U.S. military officers, veterans and Medal of Honor recipients, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump delivers remarks during a campaign event at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. (Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto Agency)  During the campaign, Donald Trump and Sen. John McCain sparred with each other, trading bruising jabs that at times made it seem as if they were running against each other for office. Trump insulted McCain's war record. McCain criticized Trump's lewd comments about women on a leaked video. And after Trump won the presidential election, McCain (R-Ariz.) offered a terse, two-sentence statement of congratulations. But now the two may find that they have some key goals in common that could forge the kind of unlikely marriage that only exists in Washington, where political expediency can turn enemies into allies almost overnight. Trump, of course, is now president-elect. McCain, himself a former Republican presidential nominee, chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. While they are far apart on issues such as torture and Russia, they share common ground over how the Pentagon does business. Both want to grow the military. Both want to shake up the Pentagon bureaucracy. And both have taken aim at major programs that have gone wildly over budget and years behind schedule. How they get along -- or don't -- could have significant impacts for national security, the defense industry and the Washington region, where many of the largest firms are located. After months of acrimony, it may take time for the pair to come to anything resembling reconciliation. Trump insulted McCain's military record, saying he was no war hero for being captured during the Vietnam War. McCain lashed back after the infamous video capturing Trump making lewd comments about women, and rescinded his endorsement of the GOP nominee, saying it was ""impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy. But now they need each other to accomplish their goals, analysts said. ""They have every incentive to work together,"" said Andrew Hunter, a defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The question is can they?"" Neither Trump nor McCain's teams responded to requests for comment. Both have tempers and outsized personalities that can be driven by emotion. And after a vitriolic campaign it's not clear ""if they will mend the personal distance between them. There were some very rough things said,"" said Daniel Goure, a national security analyst at the Lexington Institute. ""But they've got real interest in working together. McCain really wants to see major change and major accomplishment and make his mark on defense and national security policy. He has as much interest as the president elect would in working together."" While little about his policies are known, Trump has spoken in general terms of wanting to bolster the military and cut red tape at the Pentagon. To do that, his proposals would have go to through the committee McCain chairs with gusto. The former Naval officer is known for using his perch to excoriate generals, contractors, administration officials, turning his high dudgeon into some of Capitol Hill's best theater. He's taken particular aim at major weapons programs -- such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter -- that have gone over budget. And for the past few years, he's been involved in a massive effort to reform the way the Pentagon buys everything from weapons to services. He's also proposed breaking up the Pentagon department in charge of buying major weapons programs to streamline it. And he's proposed reducing the number of generals that he says makes the military top heavy. Those are the kind of bold, disruptive plans that might appeal to Trump, analysts said. Trump has said he wants to increase the size of the Army and the Marine Corps, build new ships for the Navy and add jets to the Air Force's arsenal and modernize the nuclear arsenal. Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, has calculated that the campaign promises could add up to an additional $55 billion in defense spending -- at least. Trump would need McCain, then, to help push through the programs and overcome the objections of conservatives who want to trim spending. They are, however, far apart on other matters, such as foreign policy, that could strain the relationship. McCain is a harsh critic of Russia and its president Vladimir Putin, whom Trump has praised. On torture, Trump has said he would use water boarding and ""much worse"" on terrorists. ""Senator McCain has been a staunch opponent of torture and challenged the Bush Administration repeatedly and decisively on this issue,"" Hunter said. ""This issue has the potential to be defining in their relationship."" Still, there is enough common ground to forge a consensus, said Richard Fontaine, the president of the Center for New American Security, who previously served as a foreign policy adviser to McCain. ""I think they can overcome those differences,"" he said. ""The whole point of 2017 is going to be overcoming personal and political differences so we can get something done.""

Van Hollen spoke Wednesday with Maryland Sens. Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin in Baltimore. Van Hollen won the seat that is opening with Mikulski's retirement after 30 years in the office. Van Hollen says he doesn't know much about Trump's agenda, except that he wants to build a wall on the Mexican border and deport people who are in the country illegally. He says he's willing to work constructively, but after the billionaire's divisive campaign Trump will need to make a major step toward cooperation. ___ 11 a.m. Gov. Larry Hogan is congratulating President-elect Donald Trump on his victory and saying he'll work with the new administration on behalf of all Marylanders. The Republican governor of Maryland said in a statement Wednesday that it's time to ""to come together to find real solutions to the problems we face as a country."" He is encouraging both parties to ""leave behind the divisive politics that have marred this election season"" and ""focus on doing what is best for America."" Hogan said for months that he was disappointed in the candidates for both major parties and wouldn't support Trump. On Tuesday, Hogan's spokesman Doug Mayer announced that the governor wrote in the name of his father, former Rep. Lawrence Hogan, the person who taught him what it meant to hold public office with integrity. ___ 2 a.m. For the first time in decades, Maryland will be without a woman in the state's congressional delegation. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, won the seat that will be open when Sen. Barbara Mikulski retires next year after 30 years in office. In April's Democratic primary, Van Hollen defeated Rep. Donna Edwards, who was the only female to hold one of the state's eight U.S. House seats. Maryland has had at least one woman in the state's congressional delegation since 1971. Although Hillary Clinton won Maryland's 10 electoral votes, voters Tuesday said gender was not a top concern. Van Hollen defeated Del. Kathy Szeliga for Mikulski's seat. Szeliga is the minority whip in the Maryland House of Delegates. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Celebrations, it seemed, were in order.  ""Historic day,"" his boss wrote back. ""There's still some good in America,"" McDonald responded. Just before midnight, he said he could barely believe it.  ""The people have spoken,"" he cheered. ""The people said, 'Enough is enough.'"" In a presidential contest that bitterly divided the nation, the election of Donald Trump to the White House left America's voters just as polarized. For those watching as the results came in, there was exuberance, despair -- and surprise on both sides of the political aisle. McDonald was overjoyed. He's vice president of collections at a bank in Tazewell, Virginia, where he spends his days working with neighbors who are losing cars, homes and businesses amid a collapsing coal economy. Trump is viewed a savior there, the man McDonald believes will deliver new prosperity to working class communities.  ""He's going to bring back jobs. He's going to bring back faith in America,"" he said. On the other side of the nation, Democrat Terry Zee Lee felt something far different.  ""I fear for our country,"" said the 68-year-old Lee, who earlier Tuesday had no doubt in her mind that Hillary Clinton would be elected president. ""I cannot imagine that as well as our country is doing right now, with all the improvements and all the gains we've had for equal opportunity and social justice -- it just makes me sick to my stomach that my fellow Americans have that much hate and misogyny."" Election night turned into a nail-biter for millions of Americans as the nation waited for the final tally of votes from a small number of states, mostly in the upper Midwest. But Trump victories in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, along with traditional Republican strongholds, gave the real estate mogul the path he needed to win. The final determination of who would become the nation's 45th president extended an already long, acrimonious race. In Hagerstown, Maryland, Sebiila Odin, an African-American who supported Clinton, wondered about the prospects of the nation coming back together after such a rancorous campaign. She joked that her son asked her, ""'You want to go to Canada for four years?'"" But Odin said that on Wednesday, ""I'm going to get up and go to work. And I'm just going to be like, he's in the White House. And hopefully, four years from now, we'll win it back. "" Even as Democrats sought to make sense of the outcome, Republicans pointed to Trump's outsider status as part of his unorthodox appeal. Josetta Smith, a 38-year-old Tazewell, Virginia, resident who'd never even registered to vote before this year, was so wowed by Trump that when she renewed her license plate, she got a personalized tag -- ""GO-TRMP"" -- as a show of support.  ""He's not a politician. But that's awesome because he always speaks whatever he thinks,"" said Smith, who's unemployed. ""He's completely determined to have his way, which is good and bad. Whatever he says he wants to make happen, he's going to make happen."" John Fusaro, a 50-year-old Dallas resident who works for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, believes Trump's success reflects the public's deep frustration with the so-called ""establishment.""  ""I think people are just tired of these people in Washington thinking we work for them, when they work for us,"" he said. Fusaro stayed up late watching the results come in -- feeling, like much of America, stunned.  ""When this first started, I didn't think Trump would get this far, and I'm kind of a little bit in shock. But I'm very relieved. He's had no support from the Republican establishment, or very little support. He had a lot of negative media. And despite all that, he's done very well. That's just a testament to the man's will and ability."" Fusaro had no illusions, however, about what it might take to begin healing the fractured electorate. Trump, he said, must appeal for unity.  ""I think he just needs to get out there and let them know that he's not the monster that he's been made out to be, and he will work for every American,"" Fusaro said. ""And hopefully they'll begin to trust him once he gets in office. That's what I'm hoping for anyway."" ___ Claire Galofaro in Tazewell, Virginia, Matt Sedensky in Atlanta, Peter Banda in Denver and Pauline Arrillaga in Phoenix contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to change Odin's first name to Sebiila, not Sebiina.

5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/09/republicans-won-big-now-they-have-big-questions-to-answer/	The next big political fight could be between Trump and Republicans	      At a news conference on Nov. 9, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Donald Trump's presidential win reflected that most Americans don't like the direction the country is going in. (Reuters)   Donald Trump and the Republican Party trounced Democrats in Tuesday's election, seizing the presidency and maintaining control of both houses of Congress. The returns give Trump and GOP leaders a historic opportunity to implement an ambitious conservative agenda. First, though, there is a great deal of work to be done. Bills will have to be written and passed. Lawmakers will have to come up with the money to put Republicans' often costly plans into practice. Democrats in the Senate could have an opportunity to filibuster some pieces of legislation. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan will have to unite the notoriously fractious GOP caucus. On at least two crucial issues, trade and the environment, Trump will be able to achieve many of his goals through his executive authority as president. On other issues, Trump will require Congress's cooperation. The obstacles might not be insurmountable, but they are substantial. Let's take a quick look at the to-do list for Republicans: Infrastructure was the first item Trump mentioned in his victory speech last night. Ryan has said infrastructure is no longer a priority. For Ryan's part, addressing fiscal imbalances in the long term through reforming entitlements is a major priority. Yet Trump has said he intends to preserve Social Security and Medicare as they exist.   [Drug companies just scored a big election victory]   Trump has promised repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's health reform, and Ryan agrees with this goal. Yet winning the election has not liberated Republicans from the difficulties of making health-care policy. Conservative Republicans might object to the health-care plan Ryan and his colleagues put forward earlier this year on the grounds that it is both costly and preserves some essential features of the current law, commonly known as Obamacare. The GOP lawmakers' proposal would eliminate the Affordable Care Act's requirement that all individual Americans have health insurance, and it would repeal the taxes levied under the reform. However, subscribers would continue to receive generous subsidies to help pay for insurance, though the proposal did not specify how large these subsidies would be or their total cost to the federal government. For his part, Trump has not advanced a detailed plan of his own. From there, the issues only get trickier.   [Donald Trump will now have the power to swiftly fulfill one of his big promises]   Consider immigration, which Trump used to define his candidacy. The New York businessman has called for requiring businesses around the country to electronically verify that their employees can work legally in the United States. An estimated 8 million workers are undocumented immigrants, and this kind of policy could force many of them to leave the country. Trump, however, could confront opposition from moderate Republican lawmakers such as Ryan -- who supports granting legal status to undocumented immigrants -- and from the business lobby. Even those firms that do not rely on illegal labor would likely resent the additional paperwork. Moreover, if Trump picks a fight on punitive immigration policy, he might have to do it without the public on his side. In a poll conducted in September by The Washington Post and ABC News, 79 percent of all those surveyed favored eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants -- including 60 percent of Trump's own supporters, a substantial majority. Just as the issue of immigration has defined Trump's political identity, poverty has defined Ryan's. The pair do not have any obvious disagreements when it comes to poverty, primarily because Trump has said little it. If Ryan wants to put a bill on Trump's desk in the Oval Office, however, he would have to get it through Congress first.   [Paul Ryan tried and failed to get Republicans to agree on helping the poor]   The plan he and his Republican colleagues put forward earlier this year suggested there are real disagreements among conservative lawmakers about how to address the problem. That document did not take clear positions on crucial questions, such as how involved the state should be in the managing the lives of the poor. Another issue Republicans would have to resolve is whether to focus public help on the very poor to save money, a tack that could arguably discourage work by revoking benefits for people who have somewhat more earnings. An alternative approach is to create broader and costlier programs that support more people regardless of income and that allow them to enjoy greater material rewards from their paychecks.

The government did not link the exercises to Donald Trump's U.S. presidential victory but the announcement of maneuvers and tactical exercises across the country came nearly simultaneously with Trump's surprise win. It is the seventh time Cuba has held what it calls the Bastion Strategic Exercise, often in response to points of high tension with the United States. The first exercise was launched in 1980 after the election of Ronald Reagan as U.S. president, according to an official history. Trump has promised to reverse President Barack Obama's reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba and the ongoing normalization of the relationship between the two countries.     Around the globe, right-wing leaders reacted to the victory of Republican President-elect Donald Trump with joy, while some expats and politicians expressed dismay and anxiety for international relations. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)    [World gasps in collective disbelief following Trump's election]  An announcement by Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces in red ink across the top of the front page of the country's main newspaper said the army, Interior Ministry and other forces would be conducting maneuvers and different types of tactical exercises from the 16th to the 20th of November. It warned citizens that the exercises would include ""movements of troops and war materiel, overflights and explosions in the cases where they're required."" News of Trump's victory hit hard among ordinary people and experts in U.S. relations with Cuba, which has spent the last two years negotiating normalization after more than 50 years of Cold War hostility. Normalization has set off a tourism boom and visits by hundreds of executives from the U.S. and dozens of other nations newly interested in doing business on the island. Trump has promised to reverse Obama's opening unless President Raul Castro agrees to more political freedom on the island, a concession considered a virtual impossibility.  [27 years after the Berlin Wall fell, Europe wakes up to a U.S. president-elect promising one of his own]  Speaking of Cuba's leaders, Communist Party member and noted economist and political scientist Esteban Morales told the Telesur network: ""They must be worried because I think this represents a new chapter."" Carlos Alzugaray, a political scientist and retired Cuban diplomat, said a Trump victory could please some hard-liners in the Cuban leadership who worried that Cuba was moving too close to the United States too quickly.  ""There's been a lot of rejection of what's been done with Obama,"" Alzugaray said. ""Many Cubans think that a situation of confrontation is better for the revolution."" Many Cubans said they feared that a Trump victory would mean losing the few improvements they had seen in their lives thanks to the post-detente tourism boom.  ""The little we've advanced, if he reverses it, it hurts us,"" taxi driver Oriel Iglesias Garcia said. ""You know tourism will go down. If Donald Trump wins and turns everything back it's really bad for us."" "
7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/09/democrats-are-now-a-party-without-leader-or-direction/	Democrats are now a party without leader or direction	"   Hillary Clinton meets Ohio voters, accompanied by Rep. Marsha Fudge (D-Ohio), at Angie's Soul Cafe in Cleveland on Oct. 31. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  Hillary Clinton's stunning loss in the presidential race Tuesday night doesn't just leave Democrats without a president in January; it leaves them without an obvious party leader or path forward as a party. Now the party begins the difficult task of trying to pick up the pieces and figure out exactly who it is and what it wants to be over the next two or four years. Below, we look three key hurdles for the party on the leadership front. 1. The party has no obvious leader, and its congressional leaders don't fit the bill When she launched her 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton avoided anybody who was considered a top-tier challenger for the presidency. This was partially because she was Clinton, but also because the Democratic bench wasn't that deep. There just weren't many Democrats ready to take that big a step, because the party's bench in Congress and even at the governor level had been decimated by the 2010 and 2014 elections. Now, with Clinton no longer in line to be president for the next four years, it leaves the party without an obvious national leader. They don't even have a House speaker or Senate majority leader to assume the role. Instead, they have 76-year-old House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and 65-year-old incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.). Those are the highest-ranking Democrats in American government in January.      Anti-Trump protests took place near some college campuses on election night. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   Both, of course, have shown they are savvy political operators, but neither is the face of a party -- especially from an opposition standpoint. Republicans in recent years have at least had House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) and then House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) leading a chamber, forcing votes and negotiating with President Obama when it was called for. President Donald Trump won't have to spend much time holding summits with Pelosi and Schumer, and they won't be able to stand in his way nearly as much. As for alternatives, President Obama could certainly stay involved in politics after his tenure ends, but a former president usually doesn't meddle in the affairs of his successor. First lady Michelle Obama could, too, but she doesn't seem to have the appetite for all politics all the time. Vice President Biden, 73, also appears done with politics. It could be time for someone like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to take a leadership role. But both are uneasy fits for a job that tends to demand pragmatism over idealism. 2. The party now must deal with an emboldened Sanders/Warren contingent Speaking of Sanders, the results of Tuesday's election can only fire up his supporters, who were somewhat reluctant to embrace Clinton in the first place and will certainly push for a real conversation about whether the party should pursue a different, more-Bernie direction. Some groups are already calling for a thorough self-examination. That leaves Democrats in a situation pretty familiar to Republicans -- choosing between the standard path of an establishment-friendly platform with a potentially more ideological brand of populism. The GOP's famous-infamous 2012 autopsy did not really change much, but it did reflect a party torn between its base, which wanted no moderation on things like immigration reform, and its leaders, who worried about losing Latino voters for decades to come. Republicans at least got something of a resolution to their identity crisis in this election, given Trump's victory. Democrats have no such clarity, and there's now a leadership vacuum in which ambitious pols can really try to push the party in a new direction. That's an opportunity, sure, but it's also likely to be a completely uncertain time. 3. The party is still an old party in Congress The results Tuesday were not all doom and gloom for the Democratic bench. The party installed two possible future leaders in safe Democratic Senate seats -- state Attorney General Kamala Harris, 52, in California and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, 57, who is a former member of House leadership, in Maryland. They also elected Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a 48-year-old Iraq veteran, in Illinois, and 52-year-old former state attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada. Cortez Masto, Duckworth and Harris are all diverse, youngish female voices for the party who could carve big profiles. But the overall picture for Democrats is decidedly not young and full of rising stars. As things stand, just 11 of the 30 youngest senators in the next Congress will be Democrats, and they'll have just 4 of the 13 senators under 50 years old, including Duckworth. The currently less-hierarchical GOP has done a good job of winning key races with younger candidates in recent years, and that filters up to the national and presidential level eventually. Point No. 3 is more of a long-term issue for Democrats than an immediate concern, but it speaks to the same problem. And yes, it's easy to oversell the tough spot Democrats find themselves in after a tough loss -- ""Dems In Disarray!"" and all that -- but they have a bunch of very real questions to answer about who leads the party going forward."

(Associated Press)  In the run-up to the American election, there's been a lot said about the dangers of demagoguery and nativist politics. Analysts and historians have trotted out various parallels, likening the campaign's most surprising -- and, to some, alarming -- candidate, Republican nominee Donald Trump, to myriad would-be strongmen and actual dictators, including Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. These comparative gestures, particularly to Hitler, serve to obscure more than they reveal. But they go to show the depth of concern about Trump's candidacy and rhetoric, which taps into a larger far-right, populist turn that also seems to be taking place across the pond. On Monday, a letter posted by a German working in the United States that urged Americans to vote against Trump went viral. ""Go ahead, vote for the guy with the loud voice who hates minorities, threatens to imprison his opponents, doesn't give a f--- about democracy, and claims he alone can fix everything. What could possibly go wrong? Good luck,"" read the letter, with the hashtag #BeenThereDoneThat. As WorldViews noted, the impulse to invoke Hitler in a modern-day analogy is less common among Germans than elsewhere. ""Hitler comparisons are far less frequent in German public life than they are elsewhere in Europe, the U.S., or Israel,"" German historian Thomas Weber explained to my colleague Rick Noack. But he went on: ""The near consensus [in Germany] indeed is that Trump is a minority-hating lout, who threatens to imprison his opponents, has disdain for democracy, and claims that he alone can fix everything."" Georg Diez, a columnist for the German newsweekly Der Spiegel, wrote a similarly stinging critique of Trump on Monday. ""It is disastrous that a racist with fascist tendencies has come so close to taking over power in this country, a man who appeals to hate, greed and the basest of instincts, an agitator who plays people off against each other, who abhors losers and who adheres to the credo: might makes right,"" he wrote. Nevertheless, here's the point that many Trump critics seem to be making: Forget the Hitler metaphor and think about the larger context. Trump isn't Hitler and his opponents aren't the enemies Hitler and other 1930s fascists sought to crush. Consider, instead, the underlying conditions that allowed for Hitler's rise. That's what Mark Mazower, an acclaimed scholar of 20th-century Europe and a professor of history at Columbia University, illustrated in a lucid essay on the nature of fascism published over the weekend in the Financial Times. Mazower begins with an obvious caveat about our present moment: ""No one is calling for a single party state. There are no serried ranks of black- or brownshirts marching through the streets. There are no royalists who will embrace anyone rather than fall into the abyss of Bolshevism."" But, he observes, ""the racism and anti-immigrant feeling at [fascism's] heart never went away."" This has been amplified at a period of profound political and perhaps even cultural crisis in the West, with populist movements rejecting the claims of a supposed ""globalist"" elite, balking at immigration and championing the defense of sovereignty and national borders. This backlash has had a range of effects: It has led to a segment of the American voting public developing a marked hostility to the perceived ""establishment,"" the media and even the democratic process. It has called into question the independence of the judiciary and federal law enforcement agencies. And it has accentuated the sense of an insurmountable divide within American society. ""Underpinning the rise of fascism was a profound crisis of liberal democracy,"" explains Mazower when discussing the collapse of Weimar Germany. ""The real lesson waiting to be learned is from this interwar crisis of democratic institutions."" He lays out the mood at the time: Across Europe, many blamed the power of the legislature for society's woes and wanted to see more power in the hands of a single leader. Parliaments were written off as facades that rubber-stamped what unaccountable lobbies and elites demanded. The most striking parallel of all: political parties moved to the extremes and spoke about one another as if they were fundamentally illegitimate. Judiciary and police became politicized. It is this crisis of institutions that provides the most striking parallel between Weimar and the US today. This toxic reality of parties that view the other as ""fundamentally illegitimate"" cripples more fragile democracies in other parts of the world; it can prompt coups, the jailing of the opposition, and pave the way for authoritarian rule. That sense of a zero-sum game -- epitomized by Trump's apparent refusal ahead of Nov. 8 to accept defeat if it seems he has lost -- is the atmosphere choking the air on Election Day in the United States. And it can't be dispelled by one day at the ballot box, as Mazower concludes: But fascism was always about more than the dictators. Indeed, as the conservative political thinker Michael Oakeshott wrote decades ago, it is a kind of liberal illusion to focus on the figure of the dictator, as though one person was the only problem. The real problems lie in the dictator's shadow, in the conditions that enable the leader's rise. The hollowing out of those basic institutions without which no modern state or society can govern itself, the extremism of political discourse -- these things are already with us.

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP)  On Monday, fans, followers and foes of Glenn Beck alike were probably left lifting the lower halves of their jaws from the floor when they read the New Yorker's profile of the conservative media figure. As it turns out, he might actually not despise President Obama. In fact, it almost seems as if Beck respects him. The piece, appropriately titled ""Glenn Beck Tries Out Decency,"" was short but shocking, in view of Beck's previous stance on the Obamas: ""Obama made me a better man,"" he said. Beck, it's important to note, is the same man who once said Obama has a ""deep-seated hatred for white people.""    Beck is the same man who, in July, published a piece on his website titled ""What Was the Worst Thing Obama Said at the Police Memorial?"" and stated that at the Dallas police memorial, Obama ""once again used the stage to push his political agenda."" The same man who once called some of Obama's policies, ""September 11th all over again except we didn't have the collapsing building."" (Speaking of 9/11, he's the same man who once said, ""It took me about a year to start hating the 9/11's victims' families . . . When I see a 9/11 victim's family, you know, on television or whatever, I'm just like,'Shut up.' I'm so sick of them, because they're always complaining "" He hedged this comment by saying he's only discussing about 10 victims. In the same segment, he said of Hurricane Katrina victims, ""I didn't think I could hate victims faster than the 9/11 victims."" ) Beck told the New Yorker he doesn't speak like that any longer, that he's become a different man. In particular, he said he regrets calling the president a racist. ""I did a lot of freaking out about Barack Obama,"" he told the magazine. Added Beck, ""So much of what I used to believe was either always a sham or has been made into a sham. There's nothing deep."" Beck went on, in the interview, to state that he now supports the Black Lives Matter movement. (Which shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, because as The Washington Post noted, he has been urging conservatives to understand the movement. In September, he even penned an op-ed for the New York Times titled ""Empathy for Black Lives Matter."")   [Glenn Beck urges conservatives to understand 'Black Lives Matter']   ""There are things unique to the African American experience that I cannot relate to,"" he told the New Yorker. ""I had to listen to them."" It should be noted that via Twitter, Nick Baumann, enterprise editor for the Huffington Post, claimed to have reached out to Beck's PR team after the interview, only to receive a very different response.   A member of Glenn Beck's PR team reached out to me to say Beck doesn't support #blacklivesmatter + they've asked @NewYorker to correct. -- Nick Baumann (@NickBaumann) November 7, 2016   Beck's primary inspiration for these changes in viewpoint, as the brief profile suggested, was first lady Michelle Obama. This is particularly shocking, considering that he once said of her, ""So this woman's a monster. She is Lady Macbeth. She is a frightening woman,"" as the Huffington Post noted. Days after The Post published a video in which Donald Trump spoke openly about sexually assaulting women, including his now-infamous phrase, ""grab them by the p--y,"" the first lady gave an impassioned speech while campaigning for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire. The Post's On Leadership blog opined that it was a ""master class in speaking from the gut"" and called it ""required viewing for every leader."" In a similar vein, The Fix called the speech ""one of the most important of this political cycle.""   [Two speeches in two hours crystallize the state of Campaign 2016]   In the speech, the first lady said the language Trump used ""has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted."" Later that same day, on his radio program, Beck showed some sign of his coming change, calling the speech ""the most effective political speech I have heard since Ronald Reagan."" One reason Beck so admired the speech was that it transcended party lines, which, he said, is what Reagan did so well. ""Reagan didn't believe in the government,"" Beck said. ""He didn't believe in the party. He believed in the people."" The first lady, he said, did the same. ""She didn't say, 'The government should do X, Y, or Z.' She said, 'We,' 'Us' -- without a political party. 'We are better.' 'We need to stop this.' It had to do with 'Who are you as a human being?' 'How do you view women?' Brilliant speech,"" he said. ""That was a moment that transcended all political thought."" Added Beck, ""Those words hit me where I live. If you're a decent human being, those words were dead on."" And that, a decent human being, as the magazine suggested with its headline, seems to be what Beck aspires to these days. As is to be expected, many members of the alt-right have taken to social media to blast Beck for walking back his previous statements. Most of the tweets call Beck the alt-right's favorite insult: ""cuck,"" which is short for ""cuckservative"" and is used to denote a Republican who is allowing his party to be overtaken by the left (think: RINO, or Republican In Name Only).   [What's the alt-right? A primer]   ""Can we start a gofundme to send this cuck to an island with only running water and food?"" tweeted one user. ""Obama did not make you a better 'man'. He made you a better cuck,"" tweeted another. ""I was never with 'Glenn Beck'. Behold a cuck becoming a cuck before your very eyes. The establishment plants fake opposition like Beck,"" tweeted a third. ""We're reaching levels of cuck I didn't think were possible,"" tweeted yet another. In the profile, Beck addressed the alt-right, telling the magazine that ""these people scare the hell out of me."" Their candidate of choice -- Donald Trump -- also frightens him. ""This guy is dangerously unhinged,"" he said. ""And, for all the things people have said about me over the years, I should be able to spot Dangerously Unhinged."" Added Beck, ""What's most tragic about this is us. We have, as a culture, embraced the bad guys. I love Tony Soprano. But, when a Tony Soprano shows up in your life, you don't love him so much.""
