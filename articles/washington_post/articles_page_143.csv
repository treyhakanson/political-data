""The past 12 months might be remembered as the year of Donald Trump . . . and the year of the Alt Right,"" according to the website for the National Policy Institute, which is hosting the event. ""It was a time when more people joined our movement then [sic] ever before and when our ideas began invading the mainstream."" The conference is expected to draw dozens if not hundreds of protesters, who have launched a Facebook page asking that people join them ""to defeat this hate."" The institute's president, Richard Spencer, who coined the term ""alt-right,"" is a leading promoter of white identity. He and his followers oppose immigration and multiculturalism. Friday night as prospective attendees of the Saturday conference gathered at a restaurant for a private dinner, protesters rushed up a flight of stairs toward them. They were prevented from reaching them, however, and went back outside to continue protesting.      About 200 people protested a gathering of white nationalists sponsored by the National Policy Institute at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center on Nov. 19 in downtown Washington. (Facebook/Tauhid Chappell)   The Southern Poverty Law Center describes the National Policy Institute as an extreme right-wing group whose core belief ""is that 'white identity' is under attack by multicultural forces using 'political correctness' and 'social justice' to undermine white people and 'their' civilization.""  [What's the alt-right? A primer]   The movement gained national prominence during the 2016 presidential campaign as supporters crusaded on Twitter and Facebook for Trump, whose blunt talk and immigrant bashing resonated with them. When the president-elect named as chief White House strategist the former Breitbart News chief Stephen K. Bannon -- who is closely associated with the movement -- the alt-right's leadership touted the appointment as another enormous victory for their cause. "" 'Strategist' is the best possible position for Steve Bannon in the Trump White House,"" Spencer wrote on Twitter, just days before the social media platform, without explanation, suspended him and a number of like-minded users. Saturday's speaker lineup features a number of prominent, and controversial, white nationalists, including Kevin MacDonald, a retired professor of psychology at the California State University at Long Beach, who is considered deeply anti-Semitic by Jewish groups. He is, the SPLC says, ""the neo-Nazi movement's favorite academic."" Peter Brimelow, an author and anti-immigration activist who leads the VDare Foundation, will also address the gathering. Spencer, a 38-year-old with degrees from the universities of Virginia and Chicago, has worked for months to inject the movement's ideology into the mainstream, offering interviews to dozens of major media publications.  Although people have fiercely objected to the Reagan building hosting Saturday's conference, the management has said it can't discriminate because the building is federal. On its Facebook page, the anti-fascist group ""Smash Racism DC"" celebrated that the Hamilton had canceled a Friday-night dinner the institute intended to host at the restaurant. ""We didn't really know the nature of the event,"" said Hamilton spokeswoman Molly Quigley. ""Once there was a threat of protest and disruption, we canceled it for the safety of our guests and employees and our business."" The restaurant, she said, had been inundated with calls from activists. However, a group of prospective conference attendees gathered for dinner at another restaurant, Maggiano's in the Friendship Heights area, and protesters tried to confront them inside.  Midway through the private dinner, more than 30 demonstrators swarmed into the restaurant and tried to reach the second floor area where the dinner was going on.  Restaurant personnel blocked the protesters from reaching the diners,and police later forced them outside. A protest continued on the Wisconsin Avenue sidewalk for about an hour and a half, with posters and chants. At one point during the turbulence inside the restaurant, a foul-smelling liquid was sprayed on Spencer.  ""They're total scum"" he told a reporter later. ""They attacked me, they attacked the employees of this restaurant.""  Among protesters' chants was ""No Nazis, No KKK, No Fascist USA.""

(Courtesy of Christie's International Real Estate)   Winston Churchill's former home in London No. 28 Hyde Park Gate, Kensington  Winston Churchill, who was prime minister of Britain from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955, bought No. 28 during World War II and No. 27 after the war. He combined the duplex into one unit with offices for his secretaries. Over the years, the home sprouted a dormered third floor and a variety of additions, including a walled entrance porch. According to a 1965 Chicago Tribune article, Churchill's favorite room in the home was the dining room. He lowered its floor so that it was even with the garden. Two bay windows made it the brightest room in the house. When Churchill became prime minister again in 1951, he lived at 10 Downing Street, but he later returned to No. 28 Hyde Park Gate. He died there in 1965. Churchill met many world leaders in his home, including George Marshall, then the U.S. secretary of state, in 1947. A 1965 New York Times story noted that the No. 28 address ""became over the postwar years almost as well-known as 10 Downing Street."" After his death, Churchill's widow auctioned off the property. Samuel Leonard Simpson, chairman of Simpson's department store in Piccadilly, bought the home for $287,000 in October 1965. The 5,763-square-foot house has seven bedrooms, a wine cellar, a plant room and a 55-foot-long, west-facing garden. It is listed at $27,724,400.

Former French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy's childhood home Castagneto Po, Turin, Italy  Atop a private peninsula that juts into the Mediterranean Sea is the castle where Carla Bruni-Sarkozy grew up. Bruni-Sarkozy is the wife of Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president who is trying to reclaim the office he held from 2007 to 2012. The castle reportedly dates back to 1019. It was destroyed in 1705 and rebuilt based on the drawings of architect Nicolis de Robilant. Ernesto Melano, architect to the King of Italy, completed the renovation in 1835. By the end of 1800, the castle passed to the counts of Ceriana. Billionaire industrialist Alberto Bruni-Tedeschi acquired the 21,000-square-foot castle in 1952. The family vacated the property in the early 1970s, fearing reprisals by Marxist guerrilla groups. They held onto the property until Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bought it in 2009 for $25 million. The 40-room castle is surrounded by an English-style garden and an ancient forest on 173 acres. Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, Carla's sister, directed and stared in a movie ""Un Chateau en Italie"" (""A Castle in Italy""), much of which was shot in the family home. The International Herald Tribune called the movie ""a Chekhovian comedy with dark autobiographical moments."" The Guardian panned it, calling the movie ""tiresome and insufferably self-regarding, all too obviously a twee personal 'project.' "" The price for Castagneto Po was not made available.

His father Jesse, also an inventor, named his son Carbon after one of the elemental constituents of oil. Carbon Dubbs added a middle initial ""P"" later in life because he liked the way it sounded. Because of his work, people eventually started calling him Carbon Petroleum, and the name stuck. Carbon Petroleum Dubbs was as quirky as his name. He reportedly wore roller skates to go from room to room because the house was so large. After he died in 1962, his heirs gave the private beachfront compound to the U.S. government.

(The Washington Post)   On Saturday afternoon, the scruffy liberal activist and documentary filmmaker Michael Moore arrived at the base of Trump Tower in Manhattan, hoping to deliver a message to the president-elect. Wearing a dark sweater and a San Francisco 49ers hat, he rode the escalators through the gold-and-marble interior, looking for the elevators to take him to the business mogul's offices. Camera crews followed close behind, as did a crowd of onlookers, their smartphones out. Moore streamed the entire affair on Facebook Live. ""We'll see if they let me talk to him,"" he said into the camera at one point. Someone asked how far he planned to go. ""I don't know,"" Moore replied, telling followers he was surprised that police had let him into the building in the first place. Secret Service agents stopped him at the security desk. After trying unsuccessfully to negotiate his way to the high floors, Moore scribbled a note on a folded piece of paper. ""Mr. Trump. I'm here,"" it read. ""I want to talk to you."" In a tweet later in the day, he said:   I was able to get into Trump Tower & deliver him a message: ""You lost. Step aside."" SS took the note I wrote up & went 2 give it to him. -- Michael Moore (@MMFlint) November 12, 2016   It was a classic Michael Moore moment. For decades now, Moore has reveled in his role as a gadfly of the left, and cornering powerful figures -- often in awkward or unannounced appearances at their homes and offices -- has been a key part of his M.O. But it was the type of stunt that hasn't made headlines for the 62-year-old filmmaker in recent years. Indeed, it was fitting that it took the ascendance of one consummate showman, Trump, to bring out another, Michael Moore. Both have been called demagogues. After rising to hero status among liberals during the administration of President George W. Bush, Moore seemed to fade from public view when President Obama entered the White House. He continued to champion liberal causes, but some of his targets became more provincial. In the meantime, personal problems cropped up. In 2011, he fought a year-long legal battle against his financial backers over profits from his blockbuster documentary ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" In 2014, his two-decade marriage ended in a messy divorce. He went six years without putting out a film. But the 2016 presidential election has brought Moore back into the spotlight, or more accurately, he has thrust himself back into the spotlight, and Saturday's visit to Trump Tower was the latest reminder of his skills as a propagandist and his capacity to grab attention. Moore, who prides himself on his understanding of working class Americans, was one of few to predict Trump would win the nomination, telling Business Insider in December that Trump would ""absolutely"" be the Republican candidate. In July, he was one of even fewer people who saw the writing on the wall for Hillary Clinton, saying in a post on his website that Trump would be elected president, despite poll after poll indicating otherwise. ""This wretched, ignorant, dangerous part-time clown and full time sociopath is going to be our next president,"" Moore said. ""President Trump. Go ahead and say the words, 'cause you'll be saying them for the next four years."" ""Never in my life have I wanted to be proven wrong more than I do right now,"" he added. As Election Day approached, Moore fought for the Democratic nominee, releasing ""Michael Moore In TrumpLand,"" a slapdash pro-Clinton film seeking to win over skeptical voters. In a four-minute recording made during a promotional event for the film and posted to YouTube, Moore said Trump's forthcoming win would be ""the biggest 'f-- you' ever recorded in human history."" It drew a response from Trump himself:   I agree, @MMFlint- To all Americans, I see you & I hear you. I am your voice. Vote to #DrainTheSwamp w/ me on 11/8. https://t.co/D7nBwkogBb -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016   Moore seized the moment again last week after Clinton's stunning loss in the Electoral College. On Nov. 9, he published a five-point ""Morning After To-Do List,"" calling on Trump opponents to take over the Democratic Party, fire political pundits and pollsters and take other steps to mobilize against the new Republican-led administration and Congress. Meanwhile, he has made the rounds on cable news, most recently CNN's ""State of the Union,"" where he told Jake Tapper that Democrats would have been better off running Oprah Winfrey or Tom Hanks instead of Clinton. It's a version of the Michael Moore persona that was more visible during the Bush years than the Obama years. Moore developed a following in the late 1980s with his documentary debut, ""Roger and Me,"" a critique of General Motors CEO Roger Smith's decision to close auto plants in Moore's hometown of Flint, Mich., and the impact it had on workers. But it wasn't until the early 2000s that Moore became a household name -- not to mention, a nemesis of the political right -- with a pair of enormously successful films. In 2002, he released ""Bowling for Columbine,"" a probe of gun violence in the United States told in the wake of the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado. The film won the Academy Award for best documentary the following year. In 2004, Moore put out ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" a conspiratorial attack on the Bush administration and the rationale for war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Bringing in more than $222 million at the box office, it still ranks as the highest-grossing documentary of all time, according to Box Office Mojo. The films propelled Moore into celebrity status, and in 2005 he was named one of Time's 100 most influential people. Actor Sean Penn wrote up the segment on Moore: ""Through endless appearances on talk shows and cable news networks, Moore never backed down from his impossible level of righteousness, even when Katie Couric referred to him as a jerk,"" Penn wrote. ""By doing so, Moore, the Bobby Knight of the left, inspired his fellow Democrats with a workingman's toughness they have lacked for some time."" But ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" had its harsh critics, most notably, the late Christopher Hitchens. He called the film ""a sinister exercise in moral frivolity"" and Moore a ""silly and shady man."" ""To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability,"" Hitchens wrote. ""To describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental."" Confrontation has always been one of Moore's specialties. In ""Roger and Me,"" he repeatedly needled General Motors staffers and others in hopes of getting an interview with Smith, eventually infiltrating a shareholder meeting to fire off his questions. In ""Bowling for Columbine,"" he presented the former National Rifle Association president with a picture of a gun violence victim, ending what was already a painfully awkward interview. And in ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" he read the entire text of the Patriot Act to Congress through a loudspeaker on an ice cream truck. The trip to Trump Tower on Saturday had all the same hallmarks. ""It went well,"" Moore said of the visit. ""They didn't kick me out."" More from Morning Mix The post-election hate spike: How long will it last?

The investigatory chamber of FIFA's ethics committee says the ban is requested in a final report to ethics judges. A verdict is expected within weeks. Hawit pleaded guilty in Brooklyn federal court in April to charges of racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and conspiracy to obstruct justice. The 65-year-old Honduran official agreed to forfeit $950,000 upon sentencing. Hawit was acting president for CONCACAF when he was arrested at a Zurich hotel last December. A U.S. Justice Department indictment said Hawit took $250,000 in 2011 to steer CONCACAF commercial rights toward an Argentina-based agency.

Literally.	"   (AFP photo/Saul Loeb)  THE MORNING PLUM: There is a great deal to fear about Donald Trump's presidency, but perhaps highest on the list of all is his vow to pull the United States out of the global climate accord and to scrap President Obama's efforts to limit carbon emissions here through executive action. As David Roberts explains, the election of Trump signals that the U.S. will not play a leadership role in global efforts to continue reducing carbon emissions towards a long-term goal that might plausibly avert widespread human suffering and dislocation, making such a fate more likely. That's the big picture. But the short-term granular picture is important, too. How much can Trump really do right away to realize his pledges to scrap our participation in the Paris accord and to scuttle Obama's Clean Power Plan, which is designed to reduce our own carbon emissions? A lot, unfortunately. Coral Davenport of the New York Times has a good piece explaining the nuts and bolts on both fronts. Her conclusion, delivered with deft understatement, is this: ""Pessimism appears to be warranted."" Indeed it does:  Mr. Trump cannot legally block other countries from fulfilling their Paris agreement commitments, nor can he quickly or unilaterally erase Mr. Obama's climate rules. But he can, as president, choose not to carry out the Paris plan in the United States. And he could so substantially slow or weaken the enforcement of Mr. Obama's rules that they would have little impact on reducing emissions in the United States, at least during Mr. Trump's term. That could doom the Paris agreement's goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions enough to stave off an atmospheric warming of at least 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the point at which, many scientists say, the planet will be locked into an irreversible future of extreme and dangerous warming. Without the full participation of the United States, the world's second-largest greenhouse gas polluter, after China, that goal is probably unattainable, even if every other country follows through on its pledges.  Key to our abilities to meet our Paris commitments is the Clean Power Plan, which is one of the most important and consequential aspects of Obama's legacy. It employs Environmental Protection Agency rules under the Clean Air Act to direct the states to hit targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plans, with the goal of reducing our overall emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels by the year 2030.      Donald Trump will enter the White House with an environmental policy agenda opposed to that of the Obama administration and many other nations that have pledged support to the Paris climate agreement. The Washington Post's Chris Mooney breaks down what a Donald Trump presidency will mean when it comes to climate change. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)   Even if Trump were not able to scuttle implementation of the Clean Power Plan, it is being challenged in court by two dozen states and industry groups, and it is likely to go to the Supreme Court soon. Once Republicans confirm a fifth conservative justice to the Court -- Trump will pick one that Republicans and conservatives want, bank on it -- that will likely make the plan's legal survival less likely. Which underscores yet another way in which the consequences of Senate Republicans' refusal to act on Obama's replacement for Antonin Scalia could be dire indeed. Meanwhile, whatever happens before the court, Trump can use executive means to slow implementation of the E.P.A. rule in various ways. Now, it is possible that Trump will surprise us and ultimately decide against pulling us out of the Paris accord. As Bloomberg reports, some world leaders believe that there's still a chance he will not go through with it, because it could create massive international diplomatic complications and render the United States an outlier amid the global trend towards acceptance of a need to tackle global warming. As the world's second largest greenhouse gas emitter, that would make us a rather gigantic outlier. Regardless, representatives from many nations are currently gathered in Morocco for a conference, where they are trying to figure out how to lock in commitments to the accord. The potentially disastrous implications of Trump's victory for the deal is a big topic of discussion there. In a sense, then, from their perspective, world leaders are literally scrambling to save the planet from Donald Trump, before it is too late. It is often objected that the Paris accord is unlikely to be sufficient to the long term global warming challenge in any case. That is a legitimate worry. But the whole idea behind it is to set in motion a cycle in which countries -- prompted by each other's actions -- continue to build on their own progress in a kind of mutually reinforcing cycle. What's more, if we press ahead now, it holds out at least the chance of putting us on a path to much more renewal energy use and more private sector innovation that could make a real difference over the long term. True, we don't know for certain if the Paris accord will be sufficient if we do remain a part of it. But if the U.S. were to stay committed to it, at least we'd be able to find out if it will be. Now we likely will not do that -- and may even end up being an active force in preventing it from succeeding. If there is one place where we should hope to be pleasantly surprised by Trump, it's here. *********************************************************** * TRUMP'S TEAM ALREADY STOCKED WITH D.C. INSIDERS: ""Outsider"" candidate Trump promised to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington. But CNN's Tal Kopan reports:  Trump's transition team is staffed with long-time Washington experts and lobbyists from K Street, think tanks and political offices...he has so far fully embraced lobbyists within his transition, and all signs point to a heavy influence from longtime Washington Republican circles on his transition. And with Trump mostly skipping detailed policy proposals during his campaign, they can have a powerful impact on his agenda. Shocking, isn't it? This is yet another sign that Trump very well govern much as a conventional Republican president would -- tax cuts, deregulation -- and not as a scourge of the elites. * DEMS BLAST CLINTON'S FAILURE WITH BLUE COLLAR WHITES: The recriminations are underway, and Politico reports that some Democrats believe Clinton lost because of her ""limited outreach"" to working class whites, something Bill Clinton pushed harder for: In general, Bill Clinton's viewpoint of fighting for the working class white voters was often dismissed with a hand wave by senior members of the team as a personal vendetta to win back the voters who elected him, from a talented but aging politician who simply refused to accept the new Democratic map. At a meeting ahead of the convention...senior strategist Joel Benenson told the former president bluntly that the voters from West Virginia were never coming back to his party. This portends a bruising argument among Democrats over how to get these voters back -- with more economic populism, or by sanding down the party's cultural appeals to the new Democratic coalition. * SENATOR MERKLEY ALLEGES 'STOLEN' COURT SEAT: On MSNBC's Chris Hayes show last night, Senator Jeff Merkley made the provocative charge that Republicans had ""stolen"" the current court vacancy by refusing to act on it for much of this year. He said: ""The seat that is sitting empty is being stolen...there's no legitimacy to a Supreme Court justice in a seat that's been stolen from one administration and handed to another...this is going to corrupt our political system in a way never envisioned or intended by our Constitution for a generation to come.  And so, we need to be talking about it."" Once the post-election niceties are over, we may be entering into a kind of Total War period. * McCONNELL MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SCRAP FILIBUSTER: The New York Times reports that Mitch McConnell won't say whether he'll end the filibuster for legislation or Supreme Court nominees. And:  It is not clear that Mr. McConnell, even if he wanted to, could round up enough votes from his own party to curtail the Senate filibuster, since some veteran Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine would probably be opposed. However, if Senate Democrats were able to frustrate the unified Republican government through the filibuster, the forces behind Mr. Trump's election and agenda...would be likely to push Mr. McConnell and his colleagues to get rid of it.  If Democrats exercise even a fraction of the obstruction that Republicans did during the Obama years, the roar from the right to kill it will be deafening. * TRUMP IS LIKELY TO REVOKE PROTECTIONS FOR DREAMers: This is a good catch by Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur:  The immigration section of Trump's presidential transition website reaffirms his plans to ""cancel unconstitutional executive orders"" -- which his advisers have said includes President Barack Obama's 2012 program that has protected from deportation 750,000 young people brought to the U.S. illegally.  As I noted yesterday, revoking protections and work permits from DREAMers is going to be a very big story, and very revealing of the true nature of the coming Trump presidency. * TRUMP WIN COULD USHER IN MORE VOTER SUPPRESSION: A disconcerting point from Paul Krugman about the long-term damage Trump's victory might bring:  The political damage will extend far into the future, too. The odds are that some terrible people will become Supreme Court justices. States will feel empowered to engage in even more voter suppression than they did this year. At worst, we could see a slightly covert form of Jim Crow become the norm all across America.  Needless to say, there won't be any Congressional effort to fix the gutted Voting Rights Act. Ironically, Trump's victory may mean our elections will grow more ""rigged,"" not less. "

Schafer told reporters in Berlin on Friday that the exact agenda is still being determined, ""but you can assume he'll be carrying the topic of the incarcerated HDP deputies in his briefcase."" Several lawmakers from Turkey's Peoples' Democratic Party, known as HDP, were arrested on terrorism-related charges last week. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Tuesday's election results shocked the political professionals, the country, and the world. As its true implications become clear, many people who thought they would be doing one thing for the next four years are now confronted with a stark and different future. These kind of cognitive adjustments are difficult for even the most levelheaded of individuals. Readers should offer up a moment of empathy for those who will have to process this news the quickest. I am referring, of course, to Donald Trump and his transition team. While many commentators are lambasting the Clinton campaign for not reading the political moment better, the postmortems show that Trump's team was only marginally less surprised by the outcome. Bloomberg's Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg report that, ""Even on the eve of the election Trump's models predicted only a 30 percent likelihood of victory."" Politico's Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia note a similar mind-set: Many members of the 100-plus Trump transition team were surprised by the election results. Many privately expected the Republican to get lambasted at the polls. ""There was definitely some shock,"" one team member told POLITICO, adding, ""Let's just put it this way, I owe a lot of people around here lunches and beers."" And the Daily Beast's Kimberly Dozier and Shane Harris offer up this nugget: Team Trump didn't expect to win until the campaign's internal polling a month before the election signaled a possible victory. That's when senior Trump officials went into overdrive, trying to build a bench of experienced national security candidates with top secret clearances willing to work for a Trump presidency -- and they met resistance across the landscape of experienced GOP national security professionals. Trump's team did not expect to win. A collection of outsiders largely inexperienced about government must now prepare to take over one of the world's largest bureaucracies. Oh, and they're doing it shorthanded. Trump's campaign policy shop died a slow death back in August. His transition team was understaffed. None of this changes the fact that on Jan. 20, Trump will be sworn in as president.   [Trump's huge transition will start with his tight inner circle]   This isn't just a problem with hiring people to run the government. It is also a problem with Trump's own mind-set. On Thursday, he came to Washington to meet with President Obama and the GOP leadership in Congress.

Drezner (@dandrezner) November 10, 2016   CNN's description of this meeting suggests that it's beginning to dawn on Trump that he's actually going to be the commander in chief: The meeting, and Trump's stern demeanor, also underscored how the heavy burden of the presidency begins to settle on the shoulders of a President-elect. In Trump's case, that process will be especially challenging giving that he will be the first president elected with not political, diplomatic or military executive experience. And here Trump and soon-to-be first lady Melania Trump look super-thrilled to chat with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.

But the reportage also makes it clear that Trump and his coterie have not quite processed what is happening. Which means there are going to be a lot more bumps in the road for the next three months. Indeed, the Associated Press reports that Trump's transition team already contravened standard operating procedures for a president-elect: Donald Trump is keeping Americans in the dark about his earliest conversations and decisions as president-elect, bucking a long-standing practice intended to ensure the public has a watchful eye on its new leader. Trump on Thursday refused to allow journalists to travel with him to Washington for his historic first meetings with President Barack Obama and congressional leaders. The Republican's top advisers rebuffed news organizations' requests for a small ""pool"" of journalists to trail him as he attended the meetings. The decision was part of an opaque pattern in Trump's moves since his victory Tuesday. He was entirely out of sight on Wednesday. His aides said he was huddled with advisers at his offices in New York. His team has not put out a daily schedule, or offered any detailed updates on how he has spent his time. They have not acknowledged phone calls or other contact with world leaders. And then there's Trump's Twitter feed:   Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016   When a man who was elected president with the second-largest number of votes complains that protests are somehow ""unfair,"" it suggests that maybe he's not thinking about how to be the president of all Americans. By definition, transition means change. Trump and his staff will likely move down the learning curve. To Trump or his staff's credit, his follow-up tweet this morning about the protests was more conciliatory. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks put out a statement promising a traditional press pool ""in the near future,"" which hopefully means before Jan. 20. A Trump administration will eventually staff up, even in foreign policy. But let's be blunt: Trump's quixotic management style was always going to clash with the rigors of the White House. The fact that he's already scrambling means this transition is going to be the opposite of orderly. The Americans who voted for Donald Trump wanted to see a disruption of the status quo in Washington. We are all about to get a firsthand look at what that actually means."

By comparison, Clinton got more than 260,000 votes. Trump will have the prickly task of running the country from the very place that wanted him there the least. ""He doesn't even care. It's going to be bad, period,"" said Kim Jones, a 44-year-old cook at D.C. Public Schools, adding that she expects Trump to be no better for the District than he will be for the rest of the country. The city's political establishment has made its animus toward Trump clear. When he formally celebrated the opening last month of his $212 million luxury hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, local leaders -- including Mayor Muriel E, Bowser (D) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) were nowhere in sight. Those who came, such as Latino union workers, were there to stage a protest.  [Two weeks out, Trump takes commercial break from campaign to again tout D.C. hotel]  In 2015, Bowser called Trump's more incendiary remarks ""idiotic"" but said that she still wanted his hotel in the city and the tax revenue it would bring. But Bowser turned on him in October after Trump incorrectly stated in a presidential debate that ""killings have risen by 50 percent"" in the nation's capital. Shaking my head at Donald Trump, ""who comes to DC for profit on the 1 hand, badmouths it on the other,"" Bowser tweeted in response.     Protesters demonstrated at the White House and in front of Trump International Hotel on Nov. 9 as they tried to come to grips with the election of President-elect Donald Trump. (WUSA 9)   Norton said that the hotel opening was essentially just a political event, and it would have been inappropriate for her to attend.      At a news conference on Nov. 9, Democratic D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said that some relationships need to be repaired in order for President-elect Donald Trump to win the support of D.C. residents. About 93 percent of D.C. voters chose another candidate over Trump. (YouTube/D.C. Government)   But she said Wednesday morning that she has had successful relationships with Republican presidents in the past, and D.C. residents should view his presidency with an open mind -- even if they have felt insulted by his past comments about women, Muslims, Latinos and African Americans. ""This is old hat for me,"" she said. ""I've always had to separate the Republican president's ideological views with his obligation to help the people of the District of Columbia. I have no reason he will be hostile to the District."" The president and the people who live near him share a unique relationship. The president and Congress hold considerable clout over how the mayor and D.C. Council spend tax dollars and use the powers granted to them by Congress under home rule. Bowser vowed to try to work with Trump, during an interview on WAMU-FM on Wednesday morning. ""Our job here is to run our city, and we are running our city in a very effective way,"" Bowser said. ""We are attracting residents and businesses, and we expect from a President Trump what we would have quite frankly from a President Clinton -- to support the things that are important to D.C. residents."" A change in administrations always means change in the local population, as people move in and out of the city. But the transition from the Obama presidency to Trump's could be more stark than usual. observers say. Obama brought a youthful energy to the city, attracting young and diverse staffers. Obama's presidency also overlapped with the massive D.C. population boom and, subsequently, with the explosion of the city's restaurant, entertainment and luxury-condo scene. Over the past eight years, Washington seems to have shaken off its reputation as a staid, suited-up town and transformed into something of a hip city.  [Obama made D.C. look cool. Will Clinton or Trump make it boring again?]  The result of Tuesday's election was especially disappointing for the city's political leaders because Clinton had made it clear during her campaign that she would back statehood for the District, while Trump said, ""I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C.,"" and, ""I don't see statehood for D.C."" ""There had been great hope that the new President and the new Congress would be the friendliest to the District that we've seen in decades,"" D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) wrote in an email. ""The challenge is on us to work with the next administration to ensure that Congress recognizes the importance of Home Rule and finds ways to be supportive, not oppositional, of our local Government.""

8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/11/07/will-there-be-any-profiles-in-courage/	Will there be any profiles in courage?	"Our long national nightmare has ... just begun. No matter who wins tomorrow, we are in for a continuation of dark days for our democracy. As Newt Gingrich said to Chuck Todd yesterday: ""I think tragically, we have drifted into an environment where if Hillary [Clinton] is elected, the criminal investigations will be endless, and if [Donald] Trump is elected, it will just be like Madison, Wisconsin, with Scott Walker."" He's probably right. It is painful to contemplate. Ever since I cast my first vote for president, there has always been some sense that in the election's aftermath -- no matter how bitter or who won -- the country could renew itself. But this election has sapped that hope. Instead of the belief that somehow things will come together, there is the numb feeling that the fight is just getting started. To put it bluntly, no one is going to kiss and make up after this election. Unless, of course, something shifts. Perhaps a group of our nation's leaders could rediscover courage. Not all of them; just a few. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) could start a powerful movement. Their alliance of courage could start with a negative proposition: The course we are on politically in our country is not sustainable. Full stop. If we don't find some common ground politically and don't begin to restore confidence in our democratic institutions, our country will continue its slide domestically and internationally. When John F. Kennedy despaired of the nation's ability to rise to the threat of communism, he looked to history for examples of political courage and wrote a book about them. Today, our leaders might want to follow his example for inspiration. They could start by reading excerpts from the first chapter of ""Profiles in Courage"": ""Today the challenge of political courage looms larger than ever before. For our everyday life is becoming so saturated with the tremendous power of mass communications that any unpopular or unorthodox course arouses a storm of protests . . . Of course, it would be much easier if we could all continue to think in traditional political patterns -- of liberalism and conservatism, as Republicans and Democrats, from the viewpoint of North and South, management and labor, business and consumer or some equally narrow framework. It would be more comfortable to continue to move and vote in platoons, joining whomever of our colleagues are equally enslaved by some current fashion, raging prejudice or popular movement. But today this nation cannot tolerate the luxury of such lazy political habits."" Is there anybody ready to meet the challenge?  We will soon find out."

But they’ve been on a hot streak anyway.	" You can tell Election Day is near because leaves are down and gun sales are up. ""It's been steady all year. It's just in the past couple of weeks we've really started to see large spikes,"" said Will Doss, retail manager of Town Gun Shop in Richmond. ""We're up double-digits."" Nationwide, gun sales jumped 17 percent from September to October, and last month's sales were 18 percent higher than the same time last year, according to recent FBI background check data.  Retailers have reported surging gun sales every four years at election time, as uncertainty about the future and concern about changes to gun laws make people want to stock up, just in case. This year that spike is coming during a campaign season that has seen especially heated rhetoric about guns. As Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has called for tighter background checks and restrictions on military-style weapons, some supporters of Republican Donald Trump have made a point of wearing firearms at public events and even suggested taking them to polling places.  [Guns at polling places worry Virginia election officials]  But guns have been hot for some time now. Beginning in 2003, gun sales have gone up for 13 straight years, although the numbers rise and fall from month to month, according to the FBI data. Last year's total of more than 23 million FBI firearms background checks was roughly double the number for 2007, and this year is on pace to blow that away. Those stats don't translate directly to sales figures -- each incident may not lead to a sale, or it may lead to a single sale of multiple weapons. But it's seen as a reliable gauge for the industry. Last week, for example, the manufacturer Sturm, Ruger reported that its sales for the quarter that ended in October were up by a third, compared with the same period in 2015.  A Virginia State Police database of firearm records checks also shows that each month of this year has seen more apparent sales than the same month the year before, with particular spikes in July -- during the nominating conventions -- and October. ""Just guessing, I'd say we're up 20 percent"" this month, said Grace Moates, owner of Bob Moates Sport Shop in Midlothian, Va. ""It's because a majority of people are afraid that if Hillary wins . . . she would limit their rights to keep and bear arms."" Moates's shop is geared toward hunting and fishing, but she said she has seen a sharp increase in women looking to buy guns for protection. Just the other day, she said, an elderly woman signed up for a concealed-weapons class and bought a handbag designed to hold a gun.  ""They're tired of going anywhere and feeling vulnerable,"" said Moates, whose husband started the shop in 1960 but died in 2009. She has a Trump/Pence sign outside and figures that almost all of her customers share her political views. Last week, the Brady Campaign, a gun control group, warned that increasing gun sales are linked to threats of election-related violence. But Moates said the gun owners she knows intend no such thing. ""That's fabricated,"" agreed customer Jeff Daulton, 53, who works in road construction. In his experience, it's liberals who get more emotional about issues such as guns and politics. ""We can't agree to have a conversation if you won't even listen to what we say,"" he said. At Town Gun, which caters more to a law enforcement and self-protection clientele, the fastest growing market is for concealed carry, Doss said. And women are a major driver of that business. ""Just seeing what's going on in the world, people realize they need to defend themselves and their families,"" he said. But political issues will be addressed through voting, he added, not threats or intimidation at the polls. ""Law-abiding gun owners are very polite,"" Doss said. ""An armed society is a polite society."" While Trump was not his first choice for president, Doss said he will vote for him because ""I am voting for the Second Amendment."" The spike in gun sales is driven by fear that Clinton will use an executive order to tighten gun laws, he said, and many gun owners worry that she will revive efforts by Bill Clinton during his administration to ban assault weapons or put a cap on high-capacity ammunition magazines.  [Here's how gun-control advocates are hoping to finally win on Tuesday]  Similar fears pushed gun sales to record levels when President Obama was elected in 2008 and 2012. So far this year, sales are even higher -- though the biggest spikes always come after the ballots are counted in November and December. Gun shop owners dislike the cyclical nature of the business. ""You want to see slow, steady growth,"" Doss said, noting that some small sellers have actually struggled to stay in business as demand rises and falls. That's certainly a concern for Nick Fornarotto, 72, whose Buck & Doe Gun Shop in rural Buckingham County, west of Richmond, relies on repair work and on word-of-mouth among area hunters.  His business has fallen dramatically -- ""down maybe 75 percent,"" said Fornarotto, whose shop is behind his house near the railroad town of Dillwyn. ""Normally this time of year I'm so busy I don't even have time to go inside to take a break. Now -- nothing."" Few people are coming in for repairs, and the occasional sales customer is looking for the cheapest possible guns. ""They don't have money to buy a gun right now because the economy is so bad,"" Fornarotto said. There are fewer jobs in his part of the state, he said, and those that are available don't pay well. Try to take time off for hunting season -- which used to be common -- and you'll find yourself out of work, Fornarotto said. ""The economy is poor, it's really poor,"" he said.  As in so many other sectors of the modern economy, he sees a disparity between bigger gun shops in wealthy areas and little guys like him. ""The everyday blue-collar worker who actually makes this country move is down -- way down,"" he said. He blames President Obama, and he blames the Clintons. Add in fears about weakening gun rights, and there's not much doubt how Fornarotto will vote.  "
