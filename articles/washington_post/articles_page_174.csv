Suddenly faced with the possibility that the U.S. could withdraw from the emissions pact adopted in Paris last year, countries rallied in support of the deal and said they would forge ahead no matter what. Moroccan Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar, the host of the two-week talks in Marrakech, said the conference's ""message to the new American president is simply to say, 'We count on your pragmatism and your spirit of commitment.'"" Trump said during his campaign that he would ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement and withdraw American tax dollars from U.N. global warming programs. More than 190 countries, including the United States, pledged in the deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for rising temperatures and sea levels, worsening droughts and heat waves. In Marrakech, delegates from China to Brazil expressed hope that Trump didn't mean what he said during his campaign. Some appealed to him directly to change his mind about the issue.  ""I renew my offer to President-elect Trump to come to Fiji and see the effects of climate change,"" said the island nation's prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, drawing applause from the conference. Small island nations are among the strongest advocates for sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions because they fear their survival depends on it. Many are already experiencing the effects of climate change, with rising seas eroding their coastlines and intruding into their freshwater supply. As the conference drew to a close, German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said it ""has demonstrated that the spirit of Paris is alive and stronger than ever."" With mostly procedural issues under negotiation, countries announced various partnerships and initiatives to show their commitment to a clean-energy transition. In a symbolic move, more than 40 vulnerable countries including small island nations and drought-hit African countries, declared they would pursue 100 percent renewable energy ""as rapidly as possible."" Many of them would require support from richer countries to switch to renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Some, including the Philippines and Bangladesh, plan to expand coal power, a key source of global warming emissions, to meet their growing energy needs. Still, the declaration signaled support from even poor countries that previously had said it was up to the West, which historically has polluted the most, to reduce emissions.  ""This is a group of countries that are the most vulnerable to climate change, but they are not sitting back and complaining about being vulnerable,"" Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace said. ""They are acting and they are setting the pace for the type of change that we need to see in our world."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Pete Ricketts said Wednesday he plans to renew his focus on resuming executions despite numerous hurdles that have kept the state from doing so since 1997. Ricketts offered few specifics during a post-election phone conference with reporters, but said he planned to meet with Attorney General Doug Peterson, a fellow death penalty supporter, to discuss how to move forward. Voters reinstated the death penalty in Tuesday's election, more than a year after lawmakers abolished the punishment over Ricketts' veto. Death penalty supporters responded with a statewide ballot campaign partially funded by Ricketts that prevented the law from going into effect until voters decided whether to overturn the Legislature's decision.  ""The people of Nebraska have spoken,"" Ricketts said in the call from China, where he was leading an international trade mission. Ricketts declined to say exactly how the state will acquire the lethal injection drugs it currently lacks or whether Nebraska will change its protocol. He said he would discuss those issues with Peterson when they meet. Peterson said his office is looking at changes to the state's three-drug protocol, using drugs that are easier to obtain and likely to survive a court challenge. He said he couldn't offer a timeline for when the state might move forward with executions ""because there might be different variables that affect that timeline."" Nebraska has struggled to obtain all of the necessary drugs, and Ricketts previously said his administration would halt its efforts until after Tuesday's statewide vote. Ricketts said the vote demonstrates clear public support for capital punishment in Nebraska despite the Legislature's vote.  ""It's an important tool to protect our law enforcement officers,"" Ricketts said. ""Obviously, that's a different view than what the Legislature took."" Meanwhile, death penalty opponents said they would continue fighting the punishment and working to prevent the state from executing any of the 10 men currently on death row. Sen. Ernie Chambers of Omaha, who sponsored the historic 2015 repeal law after decades of failed attempts, said he plans to reintroduce a bill to abolish the punishment when lawmakers convene in January. Because of term limits and incumbents who were defeated, however, it's not clear whether senators would pass such a measure again next year. Chambers, who is black and known as a firebrand, said he believes some white voters wanted to reinstate it because they associated his name with the repeal.  ""There definitely was a racial aspect to it,"" Chambers said. He added that he's not surprised by the outcome in what he called a ""hick-ified, backward state."" Chambers said the issue probably wouldn't have made it to the ballot and passed without support from Ricketts, who donated $300,000 of his own money to the Nebraskans for the Death Penalty campaign. Nebraskans for the Death Penalty raised $1.3 million for its effort but was outspent by a death penalty opposition group, which received nearly $2.7 million. Both sides blanketed the state with television, radio and social media ads and mailings to voters. Nebraska's last execution was 1997, using the electric chair, and the state has never executed an inmate using its current three-drug lethal injection protocol. Ricketts announced last year that the state had spent $54,400 to buy two of the required drugs, but the state never received them because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said they couldn't legally be imported. Dan Parsons, a spokesman for the death penalty opposition group Retain a Just Nebraska, said it's unlikely the state will carry out an execution anytime soon. Bob Evnen, a Lincoln attorney who campaigned for the death penalty, said policymakers should read the vote as a signal that they need to push harder to resume executions. In a series of interviews Tuesday, voters who supported the death penalty said they view it as an appropriate punishment for what prosecutors deem the most heinous crimes.  ""If there's any doubt at all whether the individual in question is guilty, then no, we shouldn't (execute that person),"" said James Stewart, 55, of Lincoln. ""But if we're 100 percent sure, it should be a done deal. I don't want to feed them breakfast, lunch and supper every day. It's costing us a ton of money."" Some supporters of the death penalty at an Omaha polling place cited the 2013 slaying a woman by Nikko Jenkins, who had only weeks earlier been released from prison, where he had spent most of his adult life. Jenkins has since pleaded no contest and been convicted of killing Juan Uribe-Pena, Jorge Cajiga-Ruiz, Curtis Bradford and Andrea Kruger in the summer of 2013. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against him.  ""That happened just a couple of blocks from here,"" said Jordon Scott, 39, of Omaha, referring to Kruger's shooting death. ""Without the death penalty, he'll be hanging out on my dime for the rest of his life."" __ Associated Press writer Margery A. Beck contributed from Omaha. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Instead, Hillary Clinton looked out to a group of grief-stricken aides and tearful supporters, as she acknowledged her stunning loss of the presidency to Donald Trump.  ""This is painful,"" Clinton said, her voice crackling with emotion, ""and it will be for a long time."" But she told her faithful to accept Trump and the election results, urging them to give him ""an open mind and a chance to lead."" Before Clinton took the stage at a New York City hotel, top aides filed in, eyes red and shoulders slumped, as they tried to process the celebrity businessman's shocking win after a campaign that appeared poised until Election Day to make Clinton the first woman elected U.S. president. Clinton, who twice sought the presidency, told women: ""I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling. But someday, someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now."" Her remarks brought to mind her 2008 concession speech after the Democratic primaries in which she spoke of putting ""18 million cracks"" in the glass ceiling.  ""To all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams,"" she said as her husband, former President Bill Clinton, stood wistfully by her side. In perhaps a subtle nod to bridging the red state and blue state divide, Clinton wore a purple blouse and a dark blazer with a purple lapel while her husband wore a purple tie. It may have been the final public act for the enduring political partnership of the Clintons, who appeared on the verge of returning to power after 16 years. If Clinton had won, it would have marked the first time a former first lady was elected U.S. president. Clinton's campaign was trying to make sense of a dramatic election night in which Trump captured battleground states like Florida, North Carolina and Ohio and demolished a longstanding ""blue wall"" of states in the Upper Midwest that had backed every Democratic presidential candidate since her husband won the presidency in 1992. As Democrats were left wondering how they had misread their country, mournful Clinton backers gathered outside the hotel Wednesday.  ""I was devastated. Shocked. Still am,"" said Shirley Ritenour, 64, a musician from Brooklyn, New York. ""When I came in on the subway this morning there were a lot of people crying."" Flanked by her husband, daughter Chelsea Clinton and running mate Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Clinton said she had offered to work with Trump on behalf of a country that she acknowledged was ""more deeply divided than we thought."" The results were startling to Clinton and her aides, who had ended their campaign with a whirlwind tour of battleground states and had projected optimism that she would maintain the diverse coalition assembled by President Barack Obama in the past two elections. On the final day of the campaign, Clinton literally followed Obama to stand behind a podium with a presidential seal at a massive rally outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia. As she walked up to the lectern, the president bent down to pull out a small stool for Clinton. Before leaving the stage, Obama leaned over to whisper in Clinton's ear, ""We'll have to make this permanent."" The devastating loss for the party, which will no longer hold the White House and will continue to be in the minority of both chambers of Congress, was certain to open painful soul-searching among Democrats, who had endured a lengthy primary between Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The so-called democratic socialist drew strong support among liberals amid an electorate calling for change but then backed Clinton's general election bid. Yet her team spent the bulk of their time focused on attacking Trump, while failing to adequately address Clinton's deep liabilities -- or the wave of frustration roiling the nation. Every time the race focused on Clinton, her numbers dropped, eventually making her one of the least-liked presidential nominees in history. And she offered an anxious electorate a message of breaking barriers and the strength of diversity -- hardly a rallying cry -- leaving her advisers debating the central point of her candidacy late into the primary race. ___ Thomas reported from Washington.

(Courtesy of an American University student)  A group of American University students burned U.S. flags on the D.C. campus Wednesday afternoon to protest Donald Trump's election as president, some shouting ""F-- white America!"" Several hundred students gathered in front of a campus center that holds the dining hall and classrooms, while protesters used matches and lighters to set several American flags ablaze. One student screamed: ""This is a representation of America! We are going down in flames!"" Some students challenged the protesters, telling them that their words and actions amounted to hate speech. One person tried to grab a burning flag to try to put out the flames, and people were shouting at one another. At one point, some students began chanting ""U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"" and protesters -- holding yellow signs that said, ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""Stand up to racism!"" and ""Stand against anti-Muslim bigotry"" -- responded with mocking profanity, according to a student watching the protest and counterprotest.      An anti-Trump protest on the campus of American University in Northwest Washington escalated into shouting matches when protesting students burned a small American flag. (The Washington Post)   It was one of many campus protests nationwide Wednesday as college students lashed out after Trump's victory was assured; students on campuses with predominantly liberal politics said they were shocked and saddened by results.   [Mobs of tearful, angry students protesting Trump victory swarm campuses]   Camille Lepre, a spokeswoman from American University, issued a written statement Wednesday evening: ""About 200 students convened this afternoon in a protest to express their reactions to the presidential election outcome. The university supported the free expression of views on all sides of the political spectrum. The expressions were at times heated, but peaceful and safe. The university does not condone the burning of the American flag, even though the act is protected speech."" In video filmed at the protest, some people can be heard shouting that they have a right to political expression. (And others can be heard shouting, ""Shut up!"") In a year when freedom of speech, race and a polarizing election have been hotly debated, the scene still upset many at American University and far beyond its campus.   ['Racism at AU is bananas': Hundreds protest incidents on American U. campus]   Lindsay Petelinkar, a sophomore from Pennsylvania, said she was ""extremely shocked"" by the scene. She supported Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton, as did most people she knows -- ""it's a liberal campus,"" she said -- but she couldn't believe people were burning the nation's symbols. ""I was definitely uncomfortable, just -- more in shock than anything, that a fellow student at my university would be willing to burn our nation's flags and be happy about it and say this is a revolution, this is going to change everything,"" she said. She left, worried about what might happen next, and not wanting to be a part of it, even as an onlooker. It was the first large gathering since the election, she said. In the early-morning hours Wednesday, people were sitting on the grass on campus in small groups or alone, talking on phones, crying, with their families. ""It felt like America died,"" she said. ""As if we were in mourning."" Students' photos and videos of the protest spread quickly, generating intense reactions on social media.   Flag burning at American University.

"     A man reacts as he watches voting results at an election-night event for Hillary Clinton. (Aaron P. Bernstein)  So this is America, after all. It's not the one many of us hoped we lived in right now, but it's the one verified by the electoral map, and it's the one that others of us have feared we lived in for a very long time. All through the election, Hillary Clinton's surrogates tried to repudiate the possibility of a Donald Trump presidency and all of its strident, fear-laden rhetoric. America is better than that, they said. Those values aren't American; those values don't represent us.  All through Tuesday night, Wolf Blitzer and John King bickered in front of their CNN Magic Wall about the ""surprise"" and ""upset"" of Trump's victory. No one saw it coming, they said. Nobody could explain it. It wasn't until the wee, exhausted hours of Wednesday morning that Van Jones, an African American political commenter, broke in with a shaking, emotional voice and offered his explanation: ""This was a white-lash,"" he said. ""This was a white-lash against a changing country. It was a white-lash against a black president, in part. And that's the part where the pain comes."" What if America isn't better than that? What if this was America all along? Not the America that welcomed immigrant ""huddled masses,"" but the America that kidnapped African slaves and made them build a country, brick by brick and cotton field by cotton field. Not the America that lets women work and dress and worship as they please, but the America in which a man who sexually assaults one of them can be imprisoned for only three months. Not the America pulled along by hope but the America pushed along by aggression. The people who were truly shocked by the outcome are those who have never experienced certain behaviors of the citizenry. Good men don't realize that when women are walking alone, every single block can feel like a gantlet of harassment. It's no wonder they don't realize this -- bad men make sure to treat women politely when women are accompanied by male friends. Good white people don't fully understand why people of color fear encounters with the police, because the police have been mostly kind to them.       Anti-Trump protests took place near some college campuses on election night. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   ""I'm seeing so many posts, from mostly white friends, saying, 'America, I don't even know you,' "" says Wendy Tien, a Milwaukee attorney and second-generation Taiwanese American. ""And I'm thinking, 'Where have you been? What do you mean you don't know this America? Why haven't you seen it?' I've seen it. I see it all the time."" On Twitter, after news organizations predicted the Republican candidate's win, a woman wrote, ""America: We knew this was in us. We usually like to pretend it's a mistake or something we can ignore or mock. We can't do that anymore."" Analysts have been poring over the numbers, announcing that this was not really an election about race, but about class. There were, after all, counties that voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and this year voted for Donald Trump. This was not really an election about gender, but about one particular woman that many people, including in her own party, hated. This was not really an election about xenophobia, they said, but an election about free-trade agreements and jobs.    Cheers for Donald Trump inside an election-night event in New York City. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  This might all be true. Nobody can look inside the hearts of voters and determine with certainty what makes one candidate viscerally more appealing than another. Could this election, for some voters, have been a culmination of many factors? Economics, race, geography and gender? America's history has never been a simple narrative. ""On Election Day, my white friends were posting pictures of Susan B. Anthony and talking about how great it was to honor her,"" says Joylyn Hopkins, a consultant in the District, who is black. ""And my black friends were commenting -- yes, Susan B. Anthony did those things, but she was also extremely racist. We need to stop this thinking, where people are all good or all bad."" This is America, the America that we built, the America that we all live in. But if this election taught us anything, it's that we haven't all been living in it in the same way. ""Now do you believe us?"" tweeted Xeni Jardin, an editor in California, early Wednesday morning. ""Us girls and women? Now do you believe Americans who are not white when they say white supremacy prevails?""  Jardin, who is white, grew up in a Southern city across from a prison, where she remembers that mostly white spectators would gather with coolers to celebrate the executions of mostly black inmates. But, she says, polite people didn't discuss such things, just like they didn't discuss sexual violence or other mistreatment of women. It just existed, quietly, part of the rotten underbelly of that America.  Now it exists, loudly, part of the blaring horn of this one.  "

""Who won?"" 8-year-old Bilal asked as he pulled out of his Marvel superhero sheets. Sadi, 34, could hardly say the words. ""Donald Trump won,"" he said. Bilal's jaw dropped, and his dad tried to remain calm as he walked downstairs to prepare breakfast. About an hour away, in the small, heavily working-class town of Dunn, truck driver Gary Godwin strode into Sherry's Bakery with a smile on his face. It is a simple restaurant, with doughnuts and cupcakes, where women in hairnets man skillets and greet customers by name.

Their eyes were fixed on a television as a broadcaster recapped Trump's victory. ""That's my man!"" Godwin said. ""Trump is a businessman. He'll get people to stop sitting on their porch and not working. No one knows how to do anything."" ""And you have all these people coming from across the border to take their jobs,"" added Stan Carroll, 70.      View Graphic    Two swing states show why Clinton lost  It was morning in Trump's America, hours after the Republican's improbable victory. The election had been grueling, and the polarization it brought to the country did not die at the ballot box. The diverging views in two North Carolina communities -- so close geographically, and yet so far apart culturally -- showed how the divisions exposed during the campaign will be difficult, if not impossible, to heal. In Raleigh, Sadi and his wife, Amani Asad, felt confused and queasy. They were proud to practice their Muslim faith and to be Americans. Yet they wondered what their place was in a country that supported the ascent of a man who proposed a ban on Muslims entering the country and attacked the parents of a slain Muslim American soldier.  In Dunn, Godwin and his friends felt optimistic and redeemed. For the first time in years, several there said, they couldn't be accused of being on the wrong side of history -- nor did they feel boxed out of the country's future. Customers wondered whether Trump would reopen some of the military bases. A man wearing a pest control uniform declared that ""Trump will lower my taxes from 35 to 15 percent, and I'll be one happy SOB."" Then he and Godwin high-fived. ""It's about damn time the country opened their eyes,"" Godwin said.    Cameron Williams, who bakes doughnuts at Sherry's Bakery, gets his first glimpse of the news that Donald Trump won the presidential election. Williams said he voted for Hillary Clinton.

The way the old-timers tell it, times in Dunn hadn't changed much. But it seemed as if they were constantly at odds with another type of America, where people seemed to have a different set of values. Carroll said he didn't know whether Trump could fix the country's problems, but at least he had newer ideas than the political establishment. ""The Democrats used to be the party of the working man,"" Carroll said. ""Now, all they want to talk about is gays and transgenders. What about jobs?"" He took a breath.

""It looks like everything's going our way."" This was the mystery of America, said Bobby Tyndall, 71, as he ate his bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. ""You can't take nothing for granted,"" Tyndall said. ""And Trump worked for it. I think he'll work to end the racial strife and stop the killings. Great day to be an American."" Back in Raleigh, the day didn't feel so great for Sadi and his family  A bit of their country felt as if it was slipping away as they watched the election returns Tuesday night. Election night started out well when they walked into a house turned community center called the Light House.  Asad had draped an American flag scarf over her hijab with patriotic defiance. Asad said that growing up in Raleigh she never thought twice about covering her hair as a sign of faith. Lately, though, she said, other drivers were cutting her off and people were staring at her in restaurants.  ""Over the past two years, things have changed,"" Asad said. ""What is so scary is you don't know who hates you."" Those fears started before Trump's candidacy. In February 2015, her friend Deah Shaddy Barakat, a dental student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was shot and killed, allegedly by a neighbor. He is accused of fatally shooting Barakat's wife and sister as well. The crime rocked the local Muslim American community. The accused gunman is awaiting trial. Initially, Sadi and Asad felt empowered by the community response. The dental school, for example, holds a day of service each year to honor the victims. The family of Deah Barakat then renovated a house in a predominantly black neighborhood, creating the Light House community center, where they gathered to watch the election results.  They aren't Hillary Clinton fans but felt the election could be consequential to repudiate the heightened Islamophobia they had been seeing.     Shadi Sadi holds his 5-year-old daughter, Saja Sadi, while watching the news Wednesday morning. (Ted Richardson/For The Washington Post)  ""I feel the goodness of America will win out,"" Sadi said at the start of the evening. ""I feel that, in my stomach, people won't vote for him because they value us as Americans."" Early in the night, the group took a break from CNN to watch a trailer for a documentary about the life of Barakat and his family. The movie details how police suggested that the slayings were a result of a parking dispute gone awry, rather than an act of religious hatred. The trailer shows Barakat playing basketball and starting a program to give toothbrushes to the homeless. It also included Trump saying in an interview that ""Islam hates us."" By the time the trailer ended, Asad was drying her tears with her American flag scarf. The group sat in silence. Minutes passed. Someone wondered how a voter could like Trump without being anti-Islam. A high school student said that Trump won his class's mock election 60 percent to 40 percent. It unnerved him so much that he didn't tell his parents. Then, as they watched election returns, more states were called for Trump. After Ohio went into the Republican column, Asad got a text message from a friend who reported that someone was following her at a grocery store and had shouted, ""Go, Trump!""  North Carolina was called for Trump, and Asad noticed a friend's post on Facebook saying that she was afraid to leave her house. Sadi and Asad left before the final results. They felt sick. ""Why would you want to screw your own country like this?"" Asad said. The next morning, Sadi was still in disbelief. Around his suburban subdivision, everyone seemed so calm and dismissed Trump as a ""crazy guy."" ""I'm, like, legit scared of my neighbors,"" Sadi said. ""There weren't any signs here, but the question is who was with him? Because I know they weren't with her. That's the biggest thing."" The parents tried to appear calm while Bilal ate a bowl of Golden Grahams. Sadi reminded himself that this was a country of laws and that, more often than not, justice wins. He tried to remind himself that he was in a country that ensured freedom of religion, and that is something that will not change. Privately, he feared that his children will live ""in a sucky time"" to grow up. Bilal grabbed his backpack. Asad took up the car keys to drive him to school. Sadi wrapped his son in his arms and kissed his forehead. He smiled to him and said, ""Have a beautiful day."" "

After a race that shattered norms of civility and restraint, Trump's ascendency to the White House on the power of overwhelming white support left some with the sinking feeling that they now live in a country where they simply don't matter. Some said they even worry that they are potentially in danger because of the color of their skin, the God they worship or the language they speak.  ""I'm like literally an enemy of the state now,"" said Black Lives Matter activist Mercutio Southall, 32, who was roughed-up by Trump supporters a year ago after disrupting one of the candidate's rallies in Birmingham. Trump received minority votes in his stunning win over Democrat Hillary Clinton, and he made conciliatory comments about unity in his victory speech. But some minority citizens who didn't support the Republican nominee said they fear what the next four years might bring.  ""It looks like we are going back to the back of the bus,"" said NAACP member George Rudolph, 65, a black Vietnam veteran whose wife Sarah was seriously injured in the Ku Klux Klan church bombing that killed four black girls in Birmingham in 1963. Rudolph said Trump's election evokes a time decades ago when segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace stoked crowds with similar rhetoric. In Los Angeles, just hours after Trump was projected as the next president, Martha Arevalo of the Central American Resource Center said her office already was fielding calls from immigrants who fear they will be targeted for deportation under a Trump presidency.  ""This is very, very scary for our families, and they are afraid,"" said Arevalo, the center's executive director. ""What we are telling them is we will continue to fight and we will continue to try to protect them as much as possible."" The nature of the divided vote is behind some of the concern. After promising to ""make America great again"" -- which some heard as a call to return the nation to a time when white men ran almost everything -- Trump won the presidency with staggering support from white men. Exit polls and unofficial returns reflected that his backers were older, more male and overwhelmingly white compared to Clinton supporters. Clinton drew support from a diverse coalition resembling the one that twice elected Barack Obama as president. She carried women, young voters and nonwhites with margins that could leave her actually winning the national popular vote while losing the electoral tally. At North Carolina Central University in Durham, sophomore Jamon Carlton said he still hadn't figured out how Trump had won in a country that seemed to embrace hope and the inclusion of everyone eight years ago. He worried Trump's victory might embolden closet bigots and lead to more dangerous displays of anger.  ""It could become confrontational. Man, I hope it doesn't come to that,"" said Carlton, who voted for Clinton. Bennett McAuley and Derrick Swick, a gay-transgender couple in Durham, said they feel especially vulnerable just weeks away from a Trump presidency. ""Hell, I'm a white man and this is a really uncomfortable morning,"" Swick said. Just hours after Trump' election, the head of Alabama's largest Islamic congregation said he awakened to messages from female Muslims worried about whether it was safe to wear their religious coverings in public.  ""People on social media and otherwise are very concerned about all the talk about banning Muslims and having Muslims to register, so there is a lot of concern,"" said Ashfaq Taufique, president of the Birmingham Islamic Society. Trump has tried to walk back some of his harshest campaign comments, such as calling Mexican immigrants ""rapists;"" proposing a ban on Muslims entering the United States, and advocating mass deportations. His victory speech struck a gentler tone that some found encouraging, and Clinton noted that Trump had won the right to govern.  ""We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead,"" she said in her concession speech. Imelda Salazar, an immigrant rights organizer in Chicago, isn't there yet. She broke down into tears while discussing Trump's win.  ""I haven't slept. I'm sad. I'm angry and all that,"" she said. ""But one thing that stands out the most is I'm not alone."" Javier Benavidez, executive director of the Southwest Organizing Project in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said activists there likely would hold peaceful demonstrations each time Trump visits the state as president. For now, they plan a Native American healing ceremony in reaction to his election.  ""Confronting this new terrain is frightening,"" Benavidez said. ___ Associated Press writers Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California; Russell Contreras in Las Vegas; Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco; and Jeffrey S.

Andy Harris, Maryland's lone Republican member of Congress, will monitor election results with the GOP faithful on Tuesday night in a hotel ballroom near Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport. Gov. Larry Hogan, the Republicans' de facto state leader and perhaps Maryland's most popular politician, is not expected to be part of the crowd. Hogan, who disavowed GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump months ago, has also been keeping his distance from the state party, opting out of big fundraisers, endorsing only a few candidates and taking a hands-off approach in the selection of party leaders.  [Larry Hogan's approval soars, buoyed by his disavowal of Donald Trump]  His approach is stirring resentment in some state GOP circles, including from Del. Patrick L. McDonough (R-Baltimore County), who is waging a long-shot bid to oust veteran Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (D) and said the governor ""should call it the Larry Hogan Party if he doesn't want to be a Republican.""   Hogan endorses state House Minority Whip Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County) for the U.S. Senate on July 19 in Annapolis. (Ovetta Wiggins/The Washington Post)  Analysts say Hogan's strategy is smart in deep-blue Maryland, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1, Hogan has deep support across party lines and rank-and-file members of Hogan's own party are unlikely to abandon him for any reason. ""He is very aware that this is a state where the Republican Party is a distinct minority,"" said Russell J. Schriefer, a Republican political strategist who has close ties to the governor. Matthew Crenson, a political-science professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins University, said that ""by distancing himself from the Republican Party, [Hogan] stays acceptable to the Democrats in the state."" Hogan, whose approval rating topped 70 percent in a recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, said he does not think that his role as the top elected Republican official means deep involvement with the state party. This past summer he skipped the party's major fundraising dinner, an event that featured Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker -- a politician despised by Democrats. He has rarely attended fundraisers for Republican state lawmakers and only sparingly hosted fundraisers for candidates. ""The party has their own things to do, and I've got a state to run,"" Hogan said. ""The governor represents all of the people, regardless of party.""  [Md. Democrats clash over how to attack Hogan]      Republican Maryland governor Larry Hogan has publicly admitted he isn't voting for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Here are the many times Logan has said he won't back Trump's run for the White House. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)   Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, another widely popular Republican in a Democratic state, is not heavily involved with his state party, either. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) -- a former presidential candidate and Hogan ally who embraced Trump while Hogan did the opposite -- has taken a more active party role. In Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a close friend and staunch supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, is a frequent party cheerleader. He has tapped his vast connections from years as a Clinton fundraiser to bring in donations for his own PAC as well as for the state party. Joe Cluster, executive director of the Maryland GOP, said there is ""no problem"" between Hogan and the party -- and much excitement about the fact that Hogan seems well-positioned to win a second term in 2018 and play a role in setting boundaries for legislative and congressional districts after the 2020 Census. ""He's an active Republican,"" Cluster said. ""I don't think he's screaming it from the mountaintops, but he's supportive of our party."" McDonough, who hosts a talk radio show, said he pushed for Hogan on the program during the 2014 Republican primary and the general election. In contrast, he said, the governor ""hasn't lifted a finger"" to help McDonough or many other Republicans this election cycle. ""I understand it's a strong blue state,"" McDonough said, ""but you should not go to an extreme position that you ignore your party.""  [When a sitting Republican governor says he won't vote for Trump]  Hogan has not endorsed McDonough or Harris, who is overwhelmingly favored to win reelection in Maryland's 1st Congressional District. But he gave his backing to state House Minority Whip Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), who is running nearly 30 points behind Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D) in the contest to succeed retiring Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D), and to newcomers Amie Hoeber and Mark Plaster, who are challenging Reps. John Delaney (D) and John P. Sarbanes (D), respectively, in congressional races. The governor is also supporting Matt McDaniel, a Republican who is vying for a seat on the Baltimore City Council. ""I've endorsed the people who asked me that I thought were really good, who I thought had a chance to win, had a good campaign and I wanted to support,"" Hogan said. Hoeber campaign manager Paul Ellington said that Hogan's endorsement was a ""shot in the arm,"" legitimizing Hoeber ""as a credible, top-tier candidate."" The Hoeber and Szeliga fundraisers that the governor attended were among the campaigns' biggest hauls, officials with their campaigns said. One top Maryland Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive party issues, said ""everyone is happy with the job"" Hogan is doing as governor, ""but folks are looking to translate that into gains for the party as well."" Among the key questions, this Republican said, is how hard Hogan will work to help the party gain additional seats in vulnerable state legislative districts in 2018. For now, many Republicans say they feel Hogan has ""no relationship"" with the state party, this individual said. Hogan, 60, has been immersed in GOP politics for much of his life. He worked for his father, Lawrence Hogan Sr., who was a Republican member of Congress from 1969 to 1975 and Prince George's county executive from 1978 to 1982; was head of Maryland's Youth for Reagan; and served as appointments secretary for Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. from 2003 to 2007. Ehrlich, the only other Republican governor in Maryland in the past half-century, played a visible role in the state party, headlining fundraisers and attending major functions. Some say Hogan's strained relationship with the state GOP dates to the start of his gubernatorial tenure, when he had to nominate a replacement for then-state Sen. Joseph Getty (R-Carroll), whom Hogan had tapped as his senior legislative aide. The Carroll County Republican Central Committee wanted Robin Bartlett Frazier, who was supported by tea party activists, to fill Getty's seat. Hogan balked, telling the committee to recommend three names, not one, and ultimately choosing then-Del. Justin Ready (R-Carroll), who had helped with Hogan's campaign. Another Republican insider, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intraparty tensions, said ""it's been like a family feud"" between Hogan and the most conservative wing of the party ever since. ""No one has wanted to mend fences,"" including Hogan, the insider said. Hogan also has generally steered clear of conservative social issues since taking office, declining to weigh in on expanding gun ownership or other hot-button topics that could endear him to his party's right flank. But Crenson, the Johns Hopkins professor, said GOP hard-liners are extremely unlikely to turn against the governor. ""They don't want to kill the golden goose,"" Crenson said. ""If they went after him, they would have a lot to lose."" "

Nancy Pelosi hands a gavel to incoming Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in October, 2015. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)  +How can the next president improve the uncooperative atmosphere in Washington?  So far, the ""The Missing Debate"" has covered a wide range of policy imperatives, from the future of the Federal Reserve to housing policy to K-12 education. While we've discussed a wide range of potential solutions, we're under no illusion that they are likely to make headway in Washington's current political climate. When this vicious electoral season comes to a close, we're likely to be left with a further divided government and an increasingly polarized electorate. Perhaps the biggest question regarding any policy agenda is whether there is any hope for lawmakers to break through the dysfunction that has paralyzed Congress over the past few years. For that reason, the final question of the series focuses on reforms that could improve relations between the two parties and make lawmakers more willing to cooperate and pass needed legislation. What is the one most important reform the next administration and Congress should champion to improve the political atmosphere in Washington?    Jason Grumet is the founder and president of the Bipartisan Policy Center. This campaign has laid bare discord that defines our current politics, but a divided country is not an excuse for government dysfunction. The story of our nation is not 240 years of placid cohesion. Rather than pining for gentler times, we must work to strengthen the structures that have long enabled Congress to be both partisan and productive. It was not long ago that Congress had the capacity to metabolize political conflict. Within weeks of being impeached in 1998, President Bill Clinton was signing legislation that had been developed and considered alongside his trial. Why was that possible then, but so unlikely today? Because in the past, members of Congress knew one another and Congress had more tools to build consensus on hard issues.   [How to fix Congress? Make representatives accountable to voters.]   A series of reforms designed to make government work better have had the opposite effect. C-SPAN and newer digital technologies have revealed much about our policymaking process while reducing the space for honest interaction and negotiation. And the elimination of earmarks has sanitized the legislative process to a virtual standstill.  We sometimes forget that resolving policy conflicts is not that different from challenges we all face when trying to come to agreement. Imagine discussing with your spouse whose in-laws to visit over the holidays. Now imagine that same discussion with your in-laws watching you on a live broadcast. There are moments in life and legislating where the imperative for deliberation trumps the imperative for transparency, and Congress should occasionally turn the cameras off. The incentive to perform for the TV audience is most unfortunate in congressional committees where canned questions and grandstanding have replaced learning and discussion. Congress dealt itself a vicious blow in 2011 by eliminating earmarks, the ability to direct funds to a specific project -- usually in the member's district. For some, the goal was eliminating ""pork."" Others argued against trading votes and transactional politics. But contrary to common assumption, earmarks don't increase spending. In fact, they reclaim control of some discretionary spending (about 1 percent) from the executive branch. In the preceding years the practice had been improved by requiring all projects to be posted on a public website with a written justification. But eliminating earmarks altogether has diminished Congress' ability to solve hard problems. The give and take that is often necessary to overcome entrenched differences is impossible if there is nothing to give or take. The derision of earmarks is also at odds with a fundamental aspect of our constitutional design. Our representatives must simultaneously govern in the national interest while appealing to local constituents. Having eliminated the opportunities to build goodwill by doing something popular back home, we should not be surprised by a diminished willingness to take tough votes and expend political capital for the good of the nation. Restoring any of these ""transactional"" or ""relationship-building"" measures would be unpopular. While lamenting gridlock, most would rather punish scoundrels than empower legislators. But there is one reason to believe that Congress will start to move in this direction: Desperation. While there are many reasons for voter anger, Washington's inability to do almost anything is high on the list. The majority of our elected leaders want and need accomplishments. The best hope for those who want to govern is to stand up for our democracy, stop denigrating the institution that they fought dearly to join and demand the tools they need to solve problems.
