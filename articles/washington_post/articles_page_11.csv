(Dmitry Astakov/Ria Novosti/Kremlin Pool)  MOSCOW -- It's not Lynchburg Lemonade, it's ""Saratov Limonad."" You want a Jack Daniels? Order a ""Zhora Denisov."" And the cocktail that previously shared the name of the B-52 bomber? It's a SU-34 strike fighter jet now, bub. These are the drolly patriotic extremes to which one Siberian bar has gone in reaction to Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's semi-serious suggestion that ordering an ""Americano"" -- the way Russians refer to American coffee -- is politically incorrect in these dire times for U.S.-Russian relations. Across Russia, purveyors of coffee have taken the hint. Menus across the nation are switching to the name ""Russiano,"" Igor Bukharov, head of the Russian restaurateurs and hoteliers federation, told the TASS news agency on Friday. But Bar-Restaurant Ogonyok in Yekaterinburg, Russia, has taken the patriotic name craze to a new level. On its new ""Premier"" menu -- the name is an acerbic doff of the cap to Medvedev -- American Honey whiskey is now ""Sweet Russia,"" a Jack and Coke is now a Zhora and Kvass, and other famous cocktails with American place names like Bronx and Manhattan have been relocated to Biryulyovo and Maryina Roscha. ""We have changed all the politically incorrect names on our menu to our Russian, patriotic ones,"" the venue announced on its Facebook page. Anti-Americanism has been steadily growing in Russia for years, especially after the Obama administration slapped Russia with sanctions over Moscow's annexation of Crimea.   [Russia's anti-American fever goes beyond the Soviet era's]   But the latest spurt of liquid jingoism is more of a humorous reaction. It started when Medvedev, attending an intergovernmental conference of Eurasian leaders Wednesday, rebuked a participant who asked for an ""Americano."" ""Actually, this is not politically correct at all. Let's rename it,"" Medvedev said; a member of the Armenian delegation yelled out ""Russiano,"" and a trend was born. The Russian branch of the American chain Burger King quickly came out with a Russiano to replace its Americano: ""Burger King has heeded the advice of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and renamed its regular coffee at some of its stores 'Russiano,'"" the RIA Novosti news agency quoted the chain as saying. The appropriately nationalistic beverage would sell for 49 rubles, or about 75 cents, cheap enough to be a ""democratic price,"" RIA Novosti quoted the fast-food chain as saying. Instagram took note:      [?][?] #russiano A photo posted by Krasnodar // Vladimir Matveev (@matvveevv) on Nov 19, 2016 at 1:20am PST    And Russianos started popping up all over the country. This sign says ""It's even tastier because its ours.""      #Prem'erministr #Rossii poshutil, predlozhiv pereimenovat' #kofe #amerikano v #russiano, i vot tebe #nashkoferussiano #errorape A photo posted by serega makarov (@makarovserg17) on Nov 19, 2016 at 1:36am PST    This movement should not be unfamiliar to Americans who remember that in protest of France's opposition to the Bush administration's plan to invade Iraq, the U.S. House of Representatives renamed french fries and French toast in the chamber's cafeteria as ""Freedom fries"" and ""Freedom toast.""   [Nevermind those freedom fries. The French are Europe's new war hawks.]   Then again, these trends are made to be broken. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president has Russians claiming victory, and Kremlin officials hoping for better relations soon. It better be real soon. Burger King plans to stop selling Russiano-named coffee in two weeks. Read more:  Obama warns against a 'crude sort of nationalism' taking root in the U.S. Are the Russians really preparing for war?

Judge Sharon Ovington's Thursday order says she cut short a scheduled, one-year probation for Thomas DiMassimo based on his probation officer's recommendation and without objection from the U.S. attorney's office. She fined him $250 in July and ordered him to stay away from ""any Republican presidential event,"" after earlier warning him against going to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. DiMassimo pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of illegally entering a restricted area. The then-Wright State University student was arrested March 12 at the future President-elect's Dayton-area airport hangar rally. He said he hoped to grab the microphone to show people they could stand up to Trump. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The resolution entitled ""Combating glorification of Nazism, Neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fueling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,"" was approved by the U.N.'s human rights committee on Friday with 131 in favor, 3 against with 48 abstentions.

""We condemn without reservation all forms of religious and ethnic intolerance or hatred at home and around the world,"" said Deputy U.S. Representative to the Economic and Social Council Stefanie Amadeo, explaining the U.S. vote.  ""However, due to this resolution's overly narrow scope and politicized nature, and because it calls for unacceptable limits on the fundamental freedom of expression, the United States cannot support it,"" Amadeo said. She said the U.S. also disagrees with the resolution's willing to curb freedom of expression even while sharing its concerns about the rise of hate speech around the world.  ""This resolution's recommendations to limit freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to peaceful assembly contravene the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and must be opposed,"" Amadeo said.

At the same time, Trump is soliciting the help of Mitt Romney, a mainstream consensus figure who had been the face of the Republican resistance to Trump's candidacy, in assembling his government. Trump sought a meeting with Romney, scheduled for this weekend, to broker peace -- and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a vice chairman of Trump's transition, told reporters that Trump could consider the 2012 GOP presidential nominee for an administration position, perhaps secretary of state. The presence of Flynn and Romney in Trump's orbit sends mixed signals to already jittery leaders around the globe, as well as officials in Washington's foreign policy community, about the tone and substance of the Trump administration's posture to the world. Flynn, who would hold the most powerful national security position, is a retired three-star general and decorated intelligence officer who established a close relationship with Trump while campaigning at his side this year. His behavior and a string of controversial and dark statements about Islam, among other topics, have alarmed many of his former colleagues.   Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a vice chairman of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, and Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, speak to reporters at Trump Tower on Thursday. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)  Trump's selection of Flynn, which was first reported by the Associated Press, comes after the president-elect enraged Democrats and civil rights groups by appointing Stephen K. Bannon, former chairman of Breitbart News, an alt-right news site that has become a forum for the white nationalist movement, as his chief strategist and senior counselor in the White House. Flynn was widely expected to be tapped as national security adviser. A vice chairman of the transition team, Flynn has been a frequent presence at Trump Tower since the election. But the role of Romney was a surprising development, coming as Trump is expanding his outreach to foreign leaders.  [Trump's pick for national security adviser brings experience and controversy]  On Thursday, he met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has been concerned by Trump's negative campaign statements about Japan and his position against free trade. In a 90-minute meeting in Trump's New York apartment -- attended by Flynn, Trump's oldest daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner -- Abe sought assurances from the incoming U.S. president that he would maintain the long-standing alliance between the two nations. The Trump-Romney relationship has been marked by acrimony: Trump has said Romney ""walks like a penguin"" and ""choked like a dog,"" while Romney labeled Trump ""a phony, a fraud"" who threatens national security. But Romney is said to feel compelled by patriotic duty to answer Trump's call for counsel, and he has long been animated by global affairs and enticed by a return to government service -- even if he stops short of acquiescing and agreeing to join the Cabinet should Trump extend an offer. ""I think it's good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Mr. Romney,"" Sessions said. ""He's meeting with a lot of talented people that he needs good relationships with. I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things, but he'll be one of those I'm sure that's reviewed, and Mr. Trump will make that decision.""     Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) told reporters that the transition for President-elect Donald Trump was ""working well together"" and praised his decision to meet with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. He also said he would be ""honored"" to be considered for an appointment in Trump's new administration. (Video: Reuters / Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   Others close to the transition, however, said they doubted Romney ultimately would be in the mix for a Cabinet post.  [Japan's prime minister hopes to build a 'trusting relationship' with Trump]  Romney would be a more conventional choice than two others who are considered to be leading contenders to helm the State Department: former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and former ambassador to the United Nations John R. Bolton. A fourth prospect, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, was thrust into the mix for secretary of state after she met Thursday with the president-elect in his Trump Tower office. Haley, who is close with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, criticized Trump during the primaries but has since said she is encouraged by the promise of his presidency. Calling Haley ""unbelievably talented,"" Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer said on CNN: ""Donald Trump right now isn't looking to figure out who supported him and who didn't . . . As long as they are committed to bringing change to Washington and making this country better, then they can be part of this team."" Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who had been considered a potential pick as secretary of state or another Cabinet position, announced Thursday that he had decided to serve Trump only as an outside adviser. ""I want to be free to network across the whole system and look at what we have to do to succeed,"" Gingrich said Thursday when briefly reached by phone. Holding a Cabinet post, he said, would have been ""not physically doable."" The developments came on the same day that President Obama stood in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to reassure Western allies about the United States' commitment to NATO and other transatlantic partnerships. Obama sounded notes of confidence that Trump recognizes the seriousness of the job before him, but he also challenged his successor to aggressively confront Russia. During the campaign, Trump spoke admiringly of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the two men spoke by phone on Monday. Obama -- whose administration has accused Moscow of meddling in the U.S. elections by hacking the email of the Democratic National Committee -- called on Trump to be ""willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms."" The U.S. posture with Russia is not only an area of disagreement between the 44th and 45th presidents, but also between Trump and Romney. Trump has praised Putin as a stronger leader than Obama and vowed to work with Putin to fight Islamic State terrorists in Syria and elsewhere. Romney, meanwhile, has sharply condemned Putin, as have most Republican leaders. In other respects, however, Romney would be a natural choice to lead Trump's State Department. He has been an unrelenting critic of Obama's foreign policy and of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. At a June 2015 summit he organized of business and political leaders in Park City, Utah, Romney presented a PowerPoint slide show assessing global hotspots that was titled: ""The Most Consequential Obama Foreign Policy Mistakes.""  [Mitt Romney gives a brutal Power Point critique of Obama's foreign policy]  Romney's meeting with Trump was an outgrowth of a phone call the two men had last Wednesday, the day after the election. Trump later tweeted, ""Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!"" Similarly, Abe's meeting with Trump came after the Japanese leader placed a congratulatory phone call to him. Abe, who was scheduled to travel through New York on his way to a regional economic summit in Peru, offered to meet with Trump, who quickly agreed. Trump's session with Abe raised questions among some in Washington's foreign policy community because Trump apparently was not briefed by the State Department in advance. A former State Department official said such meetings normally would be preceded by numerous briefings for Trump from key diplomats -- which is considered especially important here because the Japanese are concerned about comments Trump made on the campaign trail. Tokyo fretted over Trump's vow to kill the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord that includes the United States and Japan, as well as his suggestions that the U.S. military basing agreements in Japan and South Korea are too costly to maintain. ""Trump said various things during his campaign, but I will not presuppose what he will do as president,"" Tomomi Inada, Japan's defense minister, said late last week. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, explained that the Trump-Abe meeting was designed to be informal because Trump has yet to assume office. ""We are very sensitive to the fact that President Obama is still in office for the next two months,'' Conway said. Abe entered the meeting intent on emphasizing their common ground, including more robust U.S. defense spending and Japan's role as the United States' strongest ally in Asia. ""He's going to work on chemistry and rapport and planting the idea that in the chaotic world that Trump is going to discover, Japan will be one of his best friends,"" said Mike Green, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served as senior Asia director in the George W. Bush administration. ""A lot of Asia, and I suspect the Europeans, too, are looking to Abe"" for signals of how Trump intends to engage the world. Trump has spoken with or met with several dozen foreign leaders and officials. Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, appeared at Trump Tower on Thursday afternoon, but neither transition officials nor Israeli Embassy officials responded to questions about whether he met with Trump, someone else, or was just visiting. With Conway by his side, Dermer told reporters that Israel had no doubt that Trump is ""a true friend of Israel."" Pence, he said, ""was one of Israel's greatest friends in the Congress"" and ""we look forward to working . . . with all the members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, and making the U.S.-Israel alliance stronger than ever."" Asked why he had specifically mentioned Bannon, whose Breitbart News site has been decried as anti-Semitic by the Anti-Defamation League, Dermer did not respond. Meanwhile, another ambassador in Washington, the United Arab Emirates' Yousef al-Otaiba, noted in a CNN op-ed that Thursday was the United Nations-designated ""International Day for Tolerance"" and said that ""divisiveness and polarization are on the rise across the world and -- if left unchecked -- this trend will undermine global stability and peace."" Around the world, there is considerable anxiety about Trump's presidency, and concerned and curious foreign leaders have rushed to establish contact with Trump and Pence. Unless Trump schedules something earlier, his first international appearance will be at Group of 20 and NATO summits, both scheduled to be held next summer. But many world leaders are pushing for an earlier, up-close and personal sign that the new president wants to be a presence on the global stage. Clinton had indicated that, if elected president, she would quickly convene NATO leaders for an informal gathering; the two most recent former alliance heads this week called on Trump to do the same. Anders Fogh Rasmussen and his predecessor, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, also warned the president-elect against undermining U.S.-European policy on Ukraine by making an early deal with Putin. Having expected, like most U.S. pollsters, a Clinton victory, U.S. allies are shifting gears to ready for what one senior European diplomat called ""an earthquake, politically speaking, for the transatlantic alliance.""

The Democrats' shellacking in the election -- below-expectations gains in the House plus the White House loss and minimal wins in the Senate -- produced party grumbling that the 76-year-old California liberal may not be the best messenger to lead those once-core Democratic voters back into the fold.  ""Who is the leader that can go into those Southern states and Midwestern states and begin to pull those voters back into our corner?"" asked Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who is mulling a challenge to Pelosi. If Democrats ""don't get working people back to work, we are never gonna get the majority back,"" Ryan added. In the words of Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass.: ""The American people sent us a message loud and clear. We need to listen to that message and we need to respond."" Despite the discontent, Pelosi is a survivor who enjoys enormous respect and goodwill among most Democrats, even as many of her closest allies have left Congress. She has managed to maintain unity within the diverse flock of House Democrats and is an unparalleled fundraiser for them, collecting more than $100 million in the past cycle alone. She was crucial in ensuring President Barack Obama's health care overhaul became law in 2010. Even in the minority under Obama, Pelosi has been a savvy negotiator with GOP leaders when Democratic votes were needed to advance legislation. In a letter Wednesday announcing her candidacy for leader, Pelosi acknowledged the party's challenge.  ""To be a strong voice for hard-working families and to uphold the values we cherish as Americans, House Democrats must be unified, strategic and unwavering,"" she wrote. ""These qualities took us to victory in 2006 and I believe they will do so again. We must start now!"" The Democrat, who is known for her vote-counting skills, also declared that she has the votes with the backing of two-thirds of her caucus. Pelosi became the top House Democrat in 2002 and rode the unpopular war in Iraq and President George W. Bush's slipping approval to a House majority in 2006. With Obama in the White House, she ruled with an iron hand over the House to deliver for him. The 2010 midterm Republican landslide was a disaster for House Democrats and sent them into the minority. So were the 2014 elections, and last week Democrats picked up only a half-dozen seats, far less than they'd hoped. Democrats had been slated to re-elect Pelosi on Thursday. But dissatisfaction and a desire to further chew over the party's problems prompted a delay until Nov. 30. While the election of Donald Trump was traumatic for Democrats, Pelosi's allies say she's not to blame -- and that her strength will be needed to help the party maneuver through troubled times.  ""We have to focus on the immediate, and that is that come January we're going to have a Republican president and a Republican Congress. And so what are we going to do about it?"" asked Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. ""And I think that's where our focus needs to be. People can vent ... but at the end of the day we need to develop a strategy for right now."" What is more, the departure of top lieutenants like Reps. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Steve Israel, D-N.Y., has considerably thinned the bench of potential successors to Pelosi. Van Hollen in particular had been groomed to succeed Pelosi, but he will be sworn in as Maryland's new senator on Jan. 3. Israel is retiring at the end of the year. Pelosi has a historic rivalry with Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat who at 77 is not a viable long-term replacement anyway.  ""We need to give our younger members and our newer members opportunities to have some exposure because the face of our party right now is pretty old and it's pretty long term,"" said Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky. A successful re-election as Democratic leader on Nov. 30 would cement Pelosi as the symbol of the party going forward. But the campaign in 2018 is going to be about Trump and Republicans controlling Congress.  ""We must proceed with a clear vision, firm values and innovative strategy,"" Pelosi said in the letter. Republicans made Pelosi a target in winning back the House and she remains a sign of the party's leftward leanings, including her failed effort in 2009 to combat global warming and her support for abortion rights and same-sex marriage.  ""I truly believe as long as she's leader we keep the majority,"" the No. 2 House Republican, Kevin McCarthy of California, said on Monday. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Mary Schwalm/Associated Press)    Following Donald Trump's surprise -- even to his campaign! -- victory in the 2016 presidential election last week, I got a lot of email about a recent column on the decline and fall of Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. In the piece, I wrote that, barring a huge upset by Trump, Christie's political career was over -- derailed by the convictions of two of his former top gubernatorial aides in relation to the Bridgegate scandal. Then, Trump won. And Christie, who had been running Trump's transition organization, was suddenly reborn.   [Chris Christie's career takes another hit with 'Bridgegate' convictions]   Most of the emails I got regarding Christie and Trump can't be printed on a family blog, but they all went something like this: ""You said Christie's career was over! Now look at him! Man, are you the worst!"" And, despite all of the curse words directed at me, the emailers had a point. Christie's career would be dead -- d-e-a-d -- if Trump had lost. The New Jersey governor had alienated many of his longtime allies when he endorsed Trump in February, following the end of his own presidential bid. And his relentless defense of Trump -- often in indefensible situations -- for the next eight-plus months further devalued his political stock in the eyes of Republican establishment types who were expected to seize back control of the party after Trump's loss. But, Trump's victory turned out not to be such a good thing for Christie, either. Within 72 hours of Trump winning, Christie was out as head of the transition -- replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. As The Washington Post wrote of the shake-up: The changes within the transition effort will substantially dilute the influence of Christie and his closest aides, add a conservative edge to the upper level of Trump's team and formally empower Trump's family in decisions about his administration. . . . . . . The move comes after two former aides to Christie, whose administration in New Jersey has been hobbled by scandal, were convicted for their roles in politically motivated lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. Not good. But, it would get worse. Over the past few days, anyone with ties to Christie has been purged from the transition team -- starting with former congressman Mike Rogers (Mich.), who had been running transition efforts in the national security area. Richard H. Bagger, a former Christie chief of staff who had been executive director of the transition, and William J. Palatucci, a New Jersey Republican who served as the transition team's general counsel, have also been removed in recent days.   [Pence replaces Christie as leader of Trump transition effort]   The ""why"" is hard to figure out. Many media reports on the Christie purge suggest that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, was unhappy with Christie's handling of the organization. Christie and Kushner have history: As U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Christie prosecuted Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, on charges of illegal campaign contributions among other things in 2005. Reporting around Trump's vice presidential choice suggested that Jared Kushner personally shut down the possibility of Christie as Trump's pick for second-in-command. There's also some chatter, according to The Washington Post report, that Christie was deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump by some within the president-elect's inner circle. Regardless, Christie is on the outs -- big time. He's nowhere near the attorney general job -- Ted Cruz is now mentioned for that one! -- which is the Cabinet post he quite clearly covets. And, at the moment, it's sort of hard to imagine Christie getting any sort of role in a Trump Cabinet. If Christie is left out of the Cabinet, it will mark the latest dip in a political career that has seen more ups and downs than almost any other politician over the past four years.      Two former allies of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni, say they will appeal their conviction for their roles in the ""Bridgegate"" lane closure scandal. (Reuters)   Christie was the hottest commodity in Republican politics in the spring of 2012 as lots and lots of major donors, unhappy with Mitt Romney, tried to recruit him into the presidential race. Christie chose not to run, a decision that, with the benefit of hindsight, was a major mistake. Then came Bridgegate, the lane-closure-as-political-revenge scandal that badly damaged Christie's momentum following his 2013 reelection in the Garden State. Christie never really recovered from Bridgegate in the 2016 race, putting all of his chips into New Hampshire but finishing sixth. Then came his Trump endorsement, which seemed to confirm that Christie's trend line was downward. Trump's win triggered a brief rise in Christie's stock. But, today, you can buy it for a penny. Again. The story of Christie has all the elements of great drama -- rises and falls, unpredictability and, at its heart, a tragic figure. Christie's only hope now is that the winds (or whims) of Trumpworld shift and he somehow finds himself in favor again. I'd say it's impossible, but looking at the journey the New Jersey governor has been on over the past four years, anything is possible.          1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Legislators shouted to be heard and argued over points of procedure. They were fired up and in no mood to stop.   By the end of four days, they had impeached seven cabinet ministers. The foreign minister was gone, and the finance minister had barely survived a vote of confidence. Technically, the process was about under-spent budgets, but ethnic politics and opportunism were at its core. Once again, political melodrama has taken over the national conversation. The spectacle of renewed discord -- in a government that underwent a wave of defections last spring -- is dominating the news and shifting focus from pressing issues that include a spate of attacks by Taliban insurgents, record-high unemployment and a mass influx of returning refugees.  The revolt in the parliament is only one symptom of the disarray. In recent weeks, several aides to President Ashraf Ghani have publicly criticized his administration, while opposition leaders are plotting to divide it from the outside. Long-promised elections are still far off, and public confidence is weakening.  [Four Americans die in suicide blast at U.S. base in Afghanistan; 17 others wounded]    Afghan President Ashraf Ghani speaks during a news conference in Kabul in July. (Omar Sobhani /Reuters)  The tensions have resurfaced just as the United States, a mainstay of Afghan defense and economic aid for years, has elected a new president with different priorities and no investment in Afghanistan's success. Many Afghans fear President-elect Donald Trump may withdraw the 10,000 U.S. troops that President Obama kept here to help Afghan security forces take over the anti-insurgent fight. ""Everyone in Afghanistan is worried about what Trump will do. We are so dependent on American aid, and the government needs to be sending a positive message to Washington. Instead, it is sending a message of political dysfunction,"" said Haroun Mir, an analyst in Kabul. Just six weeks ago, Ghani and his governing partner, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, managed to present a united front and an ambitious agenda at a crucial donors' conference in Europe, even though the two men were on frosty personal terms and the legitimacy of their two-year-old arrangement was being widely questioned. Since then Ghani and Abdullah have had numerous meetings, and aides say they now have a good working relationship. But defections by ethnic opposition leaders who once backed Abdullah have left his future in doubt, while others who joined Ghani's team have publicly criticized him as autocratic. First Vice President Abdurrashid Dostum, a former ethnic Uzbek warlord, accused the president of controlling too much power, then threatened to lead an uprising and accused members of Ghani's National Security Council of plotting to kill him. The rift was mended through negotiations, but the northern strongman remains a political wild card.  [Latest Afghan attack raises perplexing questions on security]  The other powerful figure who could make or break the national unity government is Atta Mohammad Noor, an ethnic Tajik and wealthy northern governor from Abdullah's Jamiat-i-Islami party. Noor bankrolled Abdullah's run for president, but he recently has been negotiating with Ghani on his own, seeking a larger share of power for Jamiat. ""Governor Noor doesn't want a job for himself. He wants the full implementation of the national unity agreement and our rights in it, which Dr. Abdullah has not been able to get,"" said an adviser to Noor. ""That means 50 percent of power, a bigger role in policy and appointments."" While such maneuvering goes on behind closed doors, another ethnic power play was televised live all week in Parliament. The first group of three ministers scheduled to appear included two Tajiks, but after opposition legislators cried foul, the lineup was switched to one Pashtun, one Hazara and one Tajik. It was Ghani, a reformist technocrat and ethnic Pashtun, who unwittingly triggered the melodrama when he warned that he might dismiss any minister who failed to spend 65 percent of the budget. But legislators, seizing what analysts called an opportunity for influence and profit, turned his cleanup effort into something else.  ""This is muscle flexing by politicians who see their fortunes dwindling under Ghani and are trying to squeeze as much patronage from the situation as they can,"" said a Western expert in Kabul, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Noting that ministers regularly pay bribes to win or keep their jobs, he called the impeachment process a ""gold mine."" Aides to several impeached ministers said the hearings were biased, with few questions asked before votes were taken. Mujib Mehrdad, an aide to the dismissed education minister, said that his boss tried to explain his under-spending but that the legislators ""didn't listen. That means they had another agenda. It's not fair.""  [Afghanistan has many problems. Its president may be one of them.]  Ghani's response has been an awkward mix of conciliation and confrontation. He refused to let several ministers appear before parliament, then called a group of lawmakers to his palace late one night and asked them to delay the process. Finally, he referred the issue to the Supreme Court.  ""We were not trying to start a fire in the jungle. Our main purpose was to benefit the country,"" said Fawzia Koofi, a Tajik legislator. ""But Ghani reacted very strongly. When we went to meet him, he left without saying goodbye. He takes everything too personally. He needs to have broad, welcoming shoulders, like a traditional leader."" Aides to the president acknowledged he had been taken aback by the impeachment fever, but they said that the internal conflicts with Abdullah, Dostum and others had been resolved, and that Ghani has been reaching out to all political groups for support.  ""Our democracy is in the process of maturing. This is a power struggle between branches of government, driven by political and financial interests, but it will not affect long-term issues,"" said Nader Nadery, a senior adviser to Ghani. ""This is not a major setback. It is a temporary distraction."" Still, international observers said the growing political uncertainty, including a potentially nasty fight over refilling the cabinet and the shifting loyalties among powerful ethnic figures such as Dostum and Noor, could be a bigger worry. ""Things are changing every day. No one knows who is in or out, friend or enemy,"" said the Western expert, who is not authorized to speak publicly. ""That makes it more likely that Ghani will survive, but it could functionally bring the government to a standstill.""

She's keenly aware of the stakes. Mounib, a 56-year-old endocrinology professor, is Morocco's most high-profile female politician. After two weeks of campaigning across the country in a cramped mini-bus, she will find out the next day if she has succeeded in getting the party she leads into parliament and winning a seat herself. It's a moment she's worked for all her adult life, while raising three children. Even now, in the anxiety-tinged bustle, she's caught in the push-pull of a working mother. She excuses herself to rush home and help her son with his science homework. ______ EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of a series of profiles of Arab women fighting for change in different countries and areas of life. ______ Mounib is still a rarity in the Arab world -- a female politician in a leadership position. Morocco ranks 97th out of 145 countries on the gender gap in politics, according to the World Economic Forum. Many Arab countries score even lower. Mounib says she learned early on that women have to outperform men to prove their worth.  ""Women have to struggle extra hard in every aspect of what they do,"" she says. ""The main reason I decided to pursue politics was to reach these heights, to reach these ceilings, and to shatter them for other women...I want to create an example, a historic example, a successful example."" Despite the hopes raised by the Arab Spring five years ago, women in the region still hold only 17.6 percent of seats in parliament, the second lowest score in the world. In Morocco, it's 20.5 percent, mainly because of a women's quota. In this election, Mounib's Unified Socialist Party is allied with two others to form the Federation of the Democratic Left. She is accompanied on the white campaign bus by four young volunteers, including her 25-year-old daughter Dounia. The mood is casual. Mounib insists that the driver eat with the team. He is almost instantly transformed from a random stranger into a supporter, sitting in the front row when she delivers her daily stump speech. Her calm only rarely gives way to irritation, mostly over planning mishaps. ""Honestly, I do feel this pressure,"" she later says about leading a national campaign. Her audiences -- mostly men -- listen without heckling or interruptions, a display of politeness fairly typical at such rallies in Morocco. The husky-voiced Mounib is lively and confident. She took up karate when she was younger -- a sport she says helped with concentration and public speaking.  ""Our society teaches us to be shy and keep to ourselves,"" she says of women in Morocco. ""I've always been outspoken."" Mounib grew up in Casablanca as the seventh of nine children. Her father, a diplomat, encouraged her interest in politics, answering questions and giving her books. He also invited her to his office, where he received dignitaries. In a patriarchy, a supportive father is the key to a girl's confidence, she says. She earned her doctorate at Montpellier University in France. After her return to Casablanca in the 1980s, she became a university lecturer, eventually rising to the leadership of the professors' union, and got involved in politics. Daughter Dounia says her father, who works in insurance, often fixed meals as her mother dashed off to meetings. Some of her girlfriends, even in their upscale Anfa district, would often be asked to serve their brothers, she says. Her mother is a role model, even if there's some friction. At one point on the trail, Mounib snaps at Dounia when she criticizes a decision on a social media post. The tension quickly dissipates.  ""Just the fact that you see this woman being in charge of something this big makes you believe in anything,"" Dounia says. ""You see yourself in her."" The Federation has struggled to extend its appeal beyond urban, educated Moroccans. Mounib tries to reach rural audiences with demands for social justice -- narrow the wealth gap, fight nepotism, improve education. Morocco does not allow polling during campaigns, so Mounib has no idea how she is doing. But in some rural communities where men control the public space, her presence gives a jolt of hope to women. Mounib ""gives strength to women because she is capable and equal to a man,"" says Chenna Hadhoum, a 38-year-old municipal clerk, at one stop. After the rally, Hadhoum wrestles with her shyness, and then walks up to Mounib and asks for a photo. She says it's been a day she will remember for a long time. Mounib says she has encountered sexism even in a progressive movement like her own. In her first year as party leader, she faced repeated challenges, mostly from male colleagues, and at times considered resigning. The possibility of failure is clearly on her mind. She resolves not to seek re-election as party leader if the Federation does poorly.  ""If we fail, I'm going to go back and put on my sneakers, and get back to the grassroots,"" she says. However, Emna Ma Al Ainaine, an Islamist candidate, dismisses the Federation as marginal and claims Mounib comes off as elitist.  ""We had debates,"" she says. ""Me, I am open, I am ready to listen to everyone .... But with Nabila, she believes she has the truth, just her, in Morocco."" Dounia says her mother has been skewered on Facebook for owning a pair of expensive sunglasses -- which she takes off when talking in poorer communities. And a French publication noted in a profile that Mounib drove to the interview in a Volvo. Early on Oct. 8th, the election results start to come in. Euphoria erupts at campaign headquarters, because the federation has secured two of 305 seats in district races. But the two seats fall far short of the 10 to 12 Mounib had hoped for. And a few hours later, she hears on television that the federation did not cross the 3 percent threshold for the national vote, which determines 90 additional seats reserved for women and younger candidates. This means she won't get into parliament. Mounib takes a few days to deal with the disappointment. A week later, she's back at party headquarters. She won't seek re-election as party leader, as promised, but she won't resign from the party either.  ""I want a Morocco where equality between a man and a woman means that a woman can walk outside in a hijab or in shorts,"" she says, ""and be happy about being a woman.""

9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/14/even-in-defeat-clintons-campaign-could-still-inspire-young-women/	Even in defeat, Clinton’s campaign could still inspire young women	"   Hillary Clinton gives her concession speech at the New Yorker Hotel in New York on Nov. 9. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  Hillary Clinton's bid to become the first female president ended Tuesday night. But even in defeat, she sought in her concession speech Wednesday to inspire and encourage young women who had invested hope in her campaign: And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams. Clinton's loss is no doubt a setback for the efforts to shatter the ""highest and hardest glass ceiling"" in American politics, but our research suggests that her campaign may still increase young women's political engagement. What Clinton's candidacy ultimately means for women's underrepresentation in office, however, is less clear. One reason Clinton's campaign may spur female political engagement is that Clinton herself sought to cultivate an image as a role model. When Clinton secured the Democratic nomination in July, she tweeted a picture of herself dancing with a young girl. ""To every little girl who dreams big: Yes, you can be anything you want -- even president,"" she wrote. ""This night is for you."" We find that adolescent girls become more likely to say they plan to be active in politics as adults when the number of women running competitive campaigns for office -- not just winning -- increases. Given that Clinton has likely won the popular vote and lost the electoral college by a relatively small margin, we can surely describe her candidacy as competitive. But such effects are not automatic. There are at least two factors that affect whether female candidates end up serving as political role models for young women: how women in politics are described by the media, and whether politics are discussed over the dinner table as a result. First, adolescent girls are more likely to become interested in political activism when the media characterizes female politicians as unusual, pathbreaking or remarkable. It seems a pretty safe bet that Clinton's campaign has been viewed as pathbreaking by most Americans. Headlines from the Democratic National Convention typically noted that she was the first woman at the top of a major-party ticket. In her acceptance speech, Clinton called her nomination a ""milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union."" Moreover, Donald Trump ensured that gender remained front and center during the campaign. By claiming that Clinton's appeal was based on her playing the ""woman card"" and calling her a ""nasty woman"" during the final debate, Trump helped remind Americans that she was attempting to make history. Second, we find that it's not just what girls see or read that matters. It may also depend on whether the Clinton campaign spurred conversations about politics between parents and daughters at home. When the presence of female politicians leads parents and children to talk politics, girls become more interested in political participation. Thus, parents play an important role in ensuring that youth make the connection between the political world and their own lives. Ironically, this means that even the disparaging rhetoric about Clinton that arose from Trump rallies and some of his supporters may help to engage young girls. If the unprecedented nature of Clinton's candidacy-- highlighted by the candidate herself, her opponent and the media -- means politics became a topic of conversation within America's homes, adolescent girls may become more engaged in politics as a result. Over the long run, the reverberations could be significant. If the political engagement of young women increases, that may help undermine one of the key reasons for women's underrepresentation: women are far less likely to run for office than men. Seeing a female candidate run for president may lead more girls and women to envision themselves as candidates as well. Of course, there are reasons to doubt that Clinton's unsuccessful bid will lead more women to politics. Concerns about discrimination help explain the reluctance of qualified women to seek elective office. And although gender bias -- by the media and voters -- is far less prevalent in politics than it used to be, it is clear that a woman running for office exposes herself to considerable scrutiny and criticism. To the extent that becomes the focus of postelection analyses, it may serve to discourage more women from running. But ultimately, whether a ""Hillary generation"" of politically engaged young women emerges to pick up the pieces will certainly shape the course of women's representation in the United States for years to come.
