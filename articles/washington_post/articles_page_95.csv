Members of the Alexandria and Falls Church city councils and Arlington County Board officials met jointly to discuss how to collaborate on transit and land use, an enhanced 911 system and regulations governing short-term rentals such as Airbnb and to consider whether working together can save taxpayers money. No major agreements emerged from the 21/2 -hour session at Alexandria's Durant Recreation Center. But the officials encouraged their city and county employees to keep sharing information and coordinating plans, which they were quick to point out has been happening informally for years.   [Metroway, region's first bus rapid transit, to debut in Northern Virginia]  ""With all the negativity going on at the national level, it's good to see these three groups can come together,"" said Alexandria council member Willie Bailey (D).  ""I hope this is not a one-off,"" said Falls Church council member David Snyder (R). ""We need to tighten our relationship and exchange information and see where it takes us in the future."" Other officials, who noted that those present had not all met before Tuesday, suggested working together on legislative requests to the General Assembly, focusing on housing affordability and joining to address airport noise.  The three relatively small jurisdictions have a lot in common, said Arlington County Board Chair Libby Garvey (D), who added that the discussion was ""better than I expected."" Alexandria Mayor Allison Silberberg (D) urged colleagues to ""borrow each other's ideas and share what works.""  The populations of the communities -- Arlington has 225,000 residents, Alexandria has 149,000 and Falls Church has 13,500 -- are dwarfed by those of their neighbors, starting with Fairfax County, with 1.1 million residents. Across the Potomac River, Prince George's County in Maryland has 890,000 residents, and the District has about 659,000. The smaller and the larger jurisdictions participate in the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board. But the officials from the three smaller, inside-the-Beltway Virginia communities said they shared enough similarities to make their own annual meeting worthwhile. The session began with Alexandria's official town crier, Ben Fiore-Walker, in his Colonial uniform, reading an original poem welcoming the officials. Falls Church Mayor P. David Tarter offered to host the next meeting, but he had a request. ""I want a town crier,"" he said. "

Denver, which ordered about 150 homeless people living on sidewalks to clear out their belongings Tuesday, was among four cities criticized for policies criminalizing homelessness in a report by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, an advocacy group aiming to prevent people from losing their homes. The other cities listed in its ""hall of shame"" are in Hawaii, Texas and Washington state. People in Denver chanted, ""No handcuffs. Give us homes,"" as they packed up their belongings when police arrived. As they piled shopping carts high, a jumble of items cluttered the area: a banana, a paperback copy of Shakespeare and a pair of construction boots. Many cities with increasing home prices have been struggling with homelessness, including Denver and Honolulu, which were reprimanded for an anti-camping law and ban on sitting or lying on sidewalks, respectfully.  ""These laws are unconstitutional and bad public policy,"" Maria Foscarinis, the center's executive director, said in a phone call with reporters. ""Homelessness remains a national crisis across the country. It's fueled by the growing lack of affordable housing and the shrinking safety net."" The report, which was based on a review of policies enacted by 187 cities over a decade, said bans on living in vehicles increased by 143 percent. Those laws can be particularly devastating because they often lead to vehicle impoundment, and people can lose all of their belongings, disrupting their ability to work or attend school, Foscarinis said. In Denver, authorities had given notice that homeless people had to move their things. While some packed up and left, others resisted, so the city gave them more time, said Julie Smith, a spokeswoman for the human services department. She said the city wants to help them go to shelters and get other services. Bennie Henley, an Army veteran who moved to Denver two weeks ago from Kansas to get treatment at the Veterans Administration hospital, said he prefers sleeping on an advertising banner rolled out on the sidewalk rather than in a shelter. He showed a rash on his arm that he thinks came from bedbugs in a shelter.  ""I don't like being crowded up like that,"" said Henley, sitting on a swivel office chair on the sidewalk and leaning on a cane. The report said Denver forces thousands of people to dismantle camps despite a waiting list for subsidized housing. City spokeswoman Amber Miller called the report's findings inaccurate, saying the center relied on local advocacy groups with incorrect information. She said Denver's priority is helping people find assistance.  ""We have increased outreach workers and paired them with police patrols, expanded day and night shelter, created 250 units of permanent supportive housing and launched a day work program,"" Miller said in a statement. Honolulu was criticized for what the report called aggressive enforcement of its sit-lie ban. The group said the city has issued more than 16,000 warnings to people violating the ban since it was enacted in Waikiki in 2014. But Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell's spokesman Jesse Broder Van Dyke said the report fails to mention that since the sit-lie law took effect in September of 2014, officers have issued 21,630 warnings and made only 27 arrests after a public education and warning period. He also said over the last two years Honolulu has helped house more than 1,000 people who were experiencing homelessness, including over 860 veterans. The report also targeted Dallas and Puyallup, Washington. Dallas was criticized for issuing thousands of citations for sleeping in public, and Puyallup, for making it illegal to camp, panhandle or sit and lie down in parts of the city, despite lacking adequate space in an emergency shelter. Officials from those two cities didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The report called several such policies unconstitutional. The group said panhandling is protected by free-speech rights and preventing sleeping in public could be considered cruel and unusual punishment. ___ Slevin reported from Denver. ___ Follow Cathy Bussewitz on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cbussewitz .

(Robyn Beck/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  What will President-elect Donald Trump's foreign policy look like? During the campaign, he made numerous statements about immigration, terrorism and trade, but no one knows whether Trump's more extreme pronouncements reflect his convictions. There's no previous voting record or policies to give a hint -- and there are few clues about the president-elect's foreign policy advisers. And, as many foreign policy experts who previously served in Republican administrations took the extraordinary step of denouncing his candidacy during the campaign, there are few obvious choices to lead this new foreign policy team -- and give a suggestion of what foreign policy doctrines we can expect.   [What a President Trump means for foreign policy]   Yet when placed against the backdrop of decades of American foreign policy, two striking perspectives emerge -- one familiar and the other unprecedented. The familiar -- American decline Trump's promise to ""make America great again"" presumes that it once was but no longer is, tapping into the long-standing concern with American decline. Ronald Reagan made this fear a central part of his foreign policy plank. He campaigned to restore America's place in the world by ending the Vietnam syndrome, fixing an economy mired in stagflation and getting tough with the Soviet Union after the ""capitulation"" of detente. For his 1984 reelection bid, Reagan campaigned on the slogan that ""it's morning in America again."" Like Trump, Reagan argued that America's decline was self-inflicted. Yes, the Soviets had hoodwinked the naive Americans. And, yes, our trade partners and strategic allies had taken advantage of an overly generous and gullible United States. But Reagan blamed Washington for this sad state of affairs -- our leaders acted as if America was in decline and made defeatism a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you believe it is true and act as though it is true, then it will become true. Fortunately, according to Samuel Huntington, Reagan had the good sense to believe in the promise of American renewal and, subsequently, made it happen.   [When the White House changes hands, it's a dangerous time in foreign policy]   Although without Reagan's charm or twinkle, Trump has also blamed American decline on Washington, accusing U.S. leaders of being weak, stupid, corrupt and ready to make awful deals for no apparent reason. Trump also faults a liberal international order, which the United States helped build, for benefiting others at the direct expense of U.S. citizens. But the unfamiliar is unnerving Trump's vision of America in the world is all power and no purpose, distinguishing him from all recent American presidents. Reagan promised to not only end America's decline but also to restore America's greatness, defined by its ideals and readiness to defend and spread freedom. It would become, once again, a ""shining city on the hill."" There is no Trump corollary to Reagan's ""shining city on the hill,"" and its absence is significant. All U.S. presidents since World War II have proclaimed that American ideals, and not just military and economic might, are what make America great. America's greatness owes to its democracy, the rule of law, human rights, liberties and the presence of a civic culture that gives everyone an equal chance and judges people on the basis of their accomplishments and not on their race, gender, religion or national origins. And by tying America's global standing to its ideal, one president after another has insisted that U.S. foreign policy is more than crass self-interest, oil, money or global supremacy. It also is about the goodness of the American people and the stature of the U.S. experiment. Successful presidents, including Reagan, communicated this spirit to the American people. In one of his most memorable speeches, his 1989 farewell address, Reagan said: ""I've spoken of the shining city all my political life. ... After 200 years, two centuries, she still stands strong and true to the granite ridge, and her glow has held no matter what storm. And she's still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home."" Every president since Reagan, from George H.W. Bush to Barack Obama, has expressed similar sentiments. The combination of power and purpose accounts for the U.S.'s ""soft power"" -- the ability to persuade others to support U.S. interests because they believe that doing so is good for them and the right thing to do. America's global leadership has lasted as long as it has not just because of power but also because the United States has a record, however mixed, of trying to bring peace, prosperity and freedom to the rest of the world. The United States, as its leaders like to say, is both the exceptional and the indispensable nation. For realists, who see international relations as a power play, there is no surprise that a country would interpret its strength as providential. Those at the top almost always credit their good fortune to their goodness. But realism also warns that foreign policies that emphasize power without purpose also quickly lose their legitimacy and popularity. Foreign policies and international orders without a modicum sense of legitimacy soon crumble and can be sustained only by force. My research shows that stable and enduring international orders require some degree of acceptance, an acceptance based not only on short-term gains but also on agreed-upon norms, ideals and vision of a better world. What is Trump's vision, anyway? Trump, so far, seems to have broken with this deep-seated belief that U.S. foreign policy should be inspired by American values and ideals. Trump has said little about American values or how they should inform the country's place in the world. Indeed, he often suggests that these ideals are a burden and inconvenience, preventing him from exercising power as he wants. Trump has often openly mocked the international norms and law, declaring that he would ignore them. To combat our foreign enemies such as the Islamic State, he recommends that we freely use torture and kill the families of suspected terrorists -- even though doing so would put the United States on the wrong side of the civilized world and the law, branding the country as a war criminal. Whereas previous presidents have pledged not to use nuclear weapons, Trump has said just the opposite.   [Here's how Trump's election will affect U.S.-Russian relations]   There is no statement of support for human rights or freedom around the world -- or those leaders who support democracy. Instead, Trump has exclaimed a fondness for some of the world's most reviled authoritarian leaders. And in contrast to Reagan's generous spirit concerning refugees and wanting America to be a beacon for those lost in the wilderness, Trump worries that shining such a light will only encourage the wrong people to crawl onto American shores. This is shaping up to be a foreign policy that is all id and no superego, precisely the kind of leader that the great realist thinker Hans Morgenthau believed would lead to an aggressive nationalism and be a danger to world peace. Unlike all previous presidents, who firmly believed that the strength and influence of the United States came from its power and its principles, Trump's vision is power without principles. What does this mean? It represents an unprecedented break with a traditional tenet of U.S. foreign policy. It means that the United States will lean more heavily on brute power to influence friends and rivals alike. The United States should drive a harder bargain on economic agreements. There are good reasons to want better trade deals, but Trump's definition of a successful transaction is only the deal that leaves the nation in an advantaged position. There are good reasons to want our allies to contribute more to the security bill, but he suggests that the United States treat its commitments as matters of convenience, and threatens to withdraw from strategic alliances that do not provide immediate gratification. International orders based on naked self-interest, threats, force and expediency are not long for this world, potentially taking everyone down with them. The absence of any mention of U.S. ideals creates a vision of a U.S. foreign policy that resembles a predatory business -- and without any pretense of corporate social responsibility. What is American foreign policy without American ideals? If Trump's campaign rhetoric carries over to his presidency, we are about to find out. Michael Barnett is a professor of international affairs and political science at George Washington University. His most recent book is ""The Star and the Stripes: A History of the Foreign Policies of American Jews"" (Princeton University Press, 2016)."

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/11/10/eight-steps-to-surviving-the-next-four-years/	Eight steps to surviving the next four years	"      Speaking from the Oval Office, Nov. 10, President Obama said he was ""very encouraged"" following a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. Trump said the meeting lasted longer than expected and easily could have gone longer. (The Washington Post)   We -- Republicans and Democrats, pro- and anti-Trump -- are all adapting to a political thunder strike we never thought would come to pass, the election of Donald Trump as our 45th president. Yesterday, we spoke to Democrats who are understandably fearful and just plain lost. (If any Republican doubts the other side's devotion to country, look at how worried they are not about themselves, but about America.) The shock is nearly as great on the anti-Trump Republican side of the ledger. What can they do? How can they cope? 1. Accept that the worst may not come, but prepare if it does. Maybe President-elect Donald Trump will be so impressed and maybe overwhelmed with the responsibilities of the office that he will defer frequently to congressional leaders, learn about policy, refrain from disparaging opponents and embrace our democratic norms. When asked to step up -- meet with the Mexican president or deliver an acceptance speech -- he seemed, frankly, contrite and a little out of his depth. That's better than unremitting arrogance. So, don't panic. Keep your head about you. 2. Don't apologize for being on the ""losing"" side. Politics and public policy aren't about winning and losing, not really. They are about making things better or letting them get worse. Chicago Cubs fans can relate -- if winning is the only concern, find another activity. 3. When Trump is right, say so. When he behaves with restraint, praise him. To an uncommon degree, he is exceptionally concerned with what others think of him. That gives all of us something to work with, a way to influence the White House. It would be far worse if Trump didn't care so much about being loved, successful and admired. Failure frightens him and can therefore motivate him. 4. Do not be a hypocrite. Simply because your side is in power, do not advocate that Republicans should dispense with the filibuster, forget about federalism, become fiscally reckless or accede to executive overreach. We now must assess Trump by the same standards that have been applied to President Obama. Does he respect the rule of law, understand the limits of federal power and the downside of excessive centralization, view the world as it is and not as he wants it to be, and promote opportunity for all? (In case liberals appalled by Trump are interested, all of these things will be of aid in curtailing his excesses; feel free to borrow from the center-right playbook.) 5. Build bridges. Hillary Clinton got it: We have to be more empathetic and attuned to shared national concerns. At every level -- in legislative chambers, think tanks, hallway and email conversations, community activities, daily reading and news consumption -- find those people and ideas that may not have a ""conservative"" or ""Republican"" label affixed but nevertheless deepen your understanding and advance worthwhile policy goals. We've had the rewarding experience in this election season to converse and collaborate with many on the center-left with near-identical concerns about Trump. Knee-jerk objection to anyone with a ""D"" after his or her name is no way to go through life or advance your goals. 6. Make distinctions. Not all Trump voters are members of the alt-right. Many voted for Trump, betting that his language was an act and his actual views were not crazy. They might have been hoodwinked, but if Trump goes off the rails, they will stand by our side to oppose him. Recognize that buyer's remorse, like imitation, is the sincerest form of flattery. 7. Time and priorities can be used to advantage. Presidents soon find out that their to-do list doesn't match up with the legislative calendar or account for  unplanned events (e.g. natural disasters, scandals). It takes a long time to get through a single initiative; by the time you've completed three or four, it is time for another election. What gets done up front matters most; what gets pushed to the rear might never get done. 8. Don't think that politics is all there is to America. C'mon, conservatives, you're the ones who counsel that civic, mediating institutions matter more than the federal government. The private sector is remarkably resilient and can endure political blips. Rededicate yourself to schools, charitable work, churches and synagogues, advocacy groups and non-political causes. It's there that you may find the other half of America and there that your empathy, kindness, tolerance and love of country can make a difference."
5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/11/10/the-problem-with-our-government-is-democracy/	The problem with our government is democracy	"   Residents of Prince George's County cast their votes at Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)  Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we're talking about voter rationality. Need a primer? Catch up here. Jason Brennan is Flanagan family chair of economics, ethics and public policy at Georgetown University. His most recent book is ""Against Democracy."" Many are scratching their heads: How can someone like Donald Trump win the presidency? To win elections, politicians must push policies that appeal to voters. But most voters are systematically misinformed about the basic facts relevant to elections, and many advocate policies they would reject if they were better informed. We get low-quality government because voters have little idea what they're doing. Worst of all? There's little we can do about it. The problem is built into the democratic system. More education won't help. Voters are more educated now than in the past, but they are as ignorant now as they were 65 years ago. We could require voters to take an exam to earn the right to vote, but that would be unconstitutional, and few people support such an undemocratic policy. Perhaps, at best, we could change the culture surrounding voting. We could push the idea that citizens should not just vote, but also be informed voters.   [Should we really trust voters?]   Sixty-five years ago, researchers began studying what voters know and how they think. The results are depressing. The median voter knows who the president is, but not much else. Voters don't know which party controls Congress, who their representatives are, what new laws were passed, what the unemployment rate is or what's happening to the economy. In the 2000 U.S. presidential election, while slightly more than half of voters knew that Al Gore was more liberal than George W. Bush, they did not seem to know what the word ""liberal"" means. Significantly less than half knew that Gore was more supportive of abortion rights, was more supportive of welfare-state programs, favored a higher degree of aid to blacks or was more supportive of environmental regulation. High-information voters have systematically different policy preferences from low-information voters, even controlling for whatever impacts our demographic differences have on our ideologies. For instance, as political scientist Martin Gilens found in one study, high-information Democrats are more in favor of free trade, abortion rights, civil liberties, gay rights and less hawkish foreign policy than low-information voters. Political scientist Scott Althaus and economist Bryan Caplan get the same results using different sets of data. But the American voting public as a whole shares the preferences of low-information voters, simply because there are far more of them. When these voters do bother to seek out information, they turn to news sources and experts who share their bias. They almost never talk to the other side, whom they regard as stupid and evil. When they read material that suggests they're mistaken, they dig in their heels and conclude they're still right. It's no mystery why most voters are like this. Imagine you are in a thousand-person college class. The professor tells the class on the first day that she plans to average all the grades together and that every student will receive the same grade. Most students would not bother to study, and the average final grade would likely be an F.   [No, Trump voters were not irrational]   So it goes with voting. How the entire electorate votes does matter, but how individual voters votes does not. As a result, for most individual voters, the costs of acquiring political information exceed the expected benefits. It's not that voters are stupid individually; it's that they just don't care. They respond rationally to the bad incentives democracy creates. This mirrors the problem of air pollution. As an individual, each of us can pollute to our heart's content. Buying a Prius won't save the world and driving a gas guzzler won't end it. But if we all act without regard to the consequences, we get dangerous climate change. As with air pollution, voting pollution is a collective action problem. Some theorists say voters can use information shortcuts to make voting easier. They're partly right. Sure, the two-party system makes the choice easier, because voters have to choose between only two platforms. Still, most voters don't know much about what the two parties will do or have done -- and many parties push the policies they do only because they're trying to appeal to low-information voters. Similarly, voters can turn to information leaders and experts for advice on how to vote, but most voters just seek out ""experts"" who agree with them. Voters are badly informed because they have no incentive to be informed. Perhaps governments could do something to change that. Suppose that two weeks before the election, the government administered some sort of ""basic political knowledge test"" and gave anyone who passed a $500 tax credit. This would incentivize voters to learn the basic facts, though perhaps the marginal benefit would not be worth the expense. In a country made up entirely of high-information voters, Trump would have never stood a chance, and the Democrats would have probably fielded someone far better than Hillary Clinton. But voters are more like sports fans waving towels than they are like dispassionate social scientists. We can't fix the problem. It's built into democracy.

The Southeast is enduring a damaging drought. (Brynn Anderson/AP)  Drought is currently plaguing the Southeast. I smelled smoke from wildfires all day Wednesday in North Georgia. My mind wandered to the weather patterns, climate-drought connections and the health-aviation hazards that were at play. It reaffirmed for me that our nation's weather-climate physical and intellectual infrastructure must remain strong and be taken to new heights. The transition of governing power is always an exciting and nerve-racking time. The newly elected administration, led by President-elect Donald Trump, is working to understand the processes of the government and how to implement its DNA on the process. In a white paper to the next administration, Antonio Busalacchi, president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, wrote: ""A focused investment of federal resources in the atmospheric, earth and related sciences will make significant contributions toward meeting important societal concerns including: protection of American lives and property; expansion of new economic opportunities; enhancement of national security; and strengthening the U.S. leadership in research and development."" (Busalacchi joins me Sunday at noon on the Weather Channel's Weather Geeks program to discuss these issues in more depth.) One-third of the United States gross domestic product is affected by weather. It is revealing to review various ways that the U.S. depends on weather and climate information:  Agricultural productivity U.S. commercial and military aviation activities Short and long-term planning for national security operations Design and engineering of national infrastructure such as buildings, bridges and roads Tracking disease outbreaks Business decisions related to consumer products ranging from clothing to cereal  The United States has a well-respected weather and climate enterprise. During my term as president of the American Meteorological Society, I saw the strong roles that public-private-academic partnership plays in delivery of weather and climate information. The federal ""leg of the stool"" is vital. The National Academies, a nonpartisan science advisory body, found that weather forecasts alone have an annualized value of $31.5 billion compared to a $5 billion price tag to generate the information. Though I wasn't a business major I clearly recognize that sixfold returns on investments are good for the American people's livelihood, safety and productivity. As I write this, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is poised to launch America's game-changing GOES-R weather satellite. This satellite will provide unprecedented capacity for observing weather systems and improving forecasts.   [This new weather satellite is a game changer -- if it can survive the journey to launch]   NASA has also been a key player in the development of this satellite. I worked for 12 years as a NASA scientist developing advanced satellite missions and research that will move the nation's operational mission forward. NASA uses the vantage point of space to assess and learn about our Earth. Much of what we know about El Nino, global rainfall patterns, drought, ice sheets, ocean process and so forth come from NASA's Earth Science mission. For example, the ozone hole and its threat to humanity was only fully appreciated once we saw it from the perspective of space. Such scientific knowledge produced global action to reduce the harmful chemical products that were destroying the ozone layer and threatening humanity. Hopefully there are lessons in this as we face other pressing weather, climate and environmental challenges. Many of us within the weather community are adamant that the United States should have the best weather model capabilities in the world. This requires advanced computing, new modeling techniques and ways to translate that information clearly to the consuming public. NOAA's National Weather Service has started down the right pathway, but we can't get there without vigorous and sustained support. The tendency has been to ""throw money"" at the problem after a disaster like Hurricane Sandy, the South Carolina floods or the recent Louisiana floods. We need a more proactive business model to ensure that we can maintain (and extend) that sixfold return that I discussed earlier. (By the way, satellite data inputs are a key reason the European weather model is so good. Some of the most critical of that data comes from NASA and NOAA missions.) Basic research provided by the National Science Foundation is also important for the weather-climate enterprise. Their contribution is more difficult to convey but basic research leads to the advances we enjoy now, such as GPS, smartphones and advanced medical procedures. They don't just ""poof"" and come out of thin air. National Science Foundation research is critical for developing new knowledge on physical processes, observing technologies, social sciences and meteorological processes. These things do not get headlines but the next generation weather models and observations build upon these basic foundations. There are important weather and climate components within the U.S. Forest Service, Defense Department, Energy Department, Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies that have specific applications. I have always observed bipartisan partnerships on this issue of investments in weather research and infrastructure. The Lucas-Bridenstine Weather Forecasting Bill demonstrated the understanding that weather affects people no matter how they vote. Such bipartisanship will be needed if we are going to make our models the best in the world, maintain a vibrant observing system, advance two-week to one-year drought forecasts, stimulate new air quality predictive capability and foster public partnerships with the emerging private sector adding value to weather data. We will have to find a way to address the climate challenges as they are clearly related to our weather. I know it is difficult to discuss from a political lens because of the myth of partisanship, but it can be done. We proved it with the ozone hole. Our community stands ready to work with President-elect Donald Trump to move the country forward on the weather front.

Bowser conceded Wednesday that the referendum she pushed to make the nation's capital the 51st state would probably go nowhere soon in the wake of Donald Trump's election as president.  The mayor's acknowledgment -- before District officials had even finished counting ballots -- laid bare the stark political consequences for the nation's capital stemming from the Republican's upset win.

Bowser, in fact, said she was bound by the outcome of the referendum to still petition the next Congress in January. The mayor said officials need to study whether it could afford a public relations campaign. ""It is clear that we need to spend a lot more time educating other states and we need to figure out what we're willing to pay to do that,"" she said. Under the referendum, the District would split into a new state for its residential areas and a smaller, federal district containing government buildings and monuments. Bowser and statehood advocates crafted the referendum in hopes of emulating the way residents in Tennessee petitioned Congress to join the Union in 1796. Congress said it would grant statehood to Tennessee, a federal territory at the time, if residents there approved a constitution and committed to a republican form of government. But partisan politics have long made D.C. statehood a nonstarter with Republicans in Congress. The city has a population of more than 672,000, and its residents pay more in federal taxes than those of 22 states. But Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city by a ratio of more than 2 to 1.  That means if allowed to become a state, the District would likely elect two Democratic senators and a Democratic member of the House, a prospect that disturbs most Republicans in Congress.  Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the powerful House Oversight Committee, said in an interview this year that D.C. statehood would ""never happen"" on his watch. He and other Republicans also say they believe that statehood violates the Constitution, which they argue gives Congress supreme authority over what happens in the capital city. Council member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) said District leaders need to focus on protecting progressive policies in the era of Trump. ""Statehood is off the table.

Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   Donald J. Trump will be the 45th president of the United States. Let that sink in for a minute. Donald Trump, a man who has never run for any elected office before. Donald Trump, who made his name nationally as a flamboyant billionaire turned reality TV star. Donald Trump, who built a primary campaign on a pledge to build a wall along our southern border and make Mexico pay for it. Donald Trump, who, in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino in late 2015, proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Donald Trump, who faced allegations of sexual assault from a dozen different women in the closing weeks of this campaign. Donald Trump, who said and did 1,000 things in this campaign that would have lost any other candidate the race. Yes, that Donald Trump is going to be the most powerful person in the United States -- and maybe the world -- for the next four years. What Donald Trump has done is nothing short of cataclysmic. He has fundamentally reshaped the political map. He has broken the Republican Party into pieces -- and its shards still remain scattered everywhere. He has proven that the political polling and punditry industries need a deep re-examination. But, even more than all that, Trump's victory reveals that many of the assumptions that people have long made about who we are as a country and what we want out of our politicians, our political system and each other are, frankly, wrong. Trump's candidacy was premised on the idea that everyone -- politicians, reporters, corporations -- is lying to you, and lying to you to to feather their own nests. It was a Holden Caulfield campaign: Everyone, except Trump and his supporters, were phonies. In short: Trump played on the deep alienation and anxiety coursing through the country. Globalism, immigration, a growing chasm between the haves and the have nots, a rejection of political correctness in all its forms. A prevailing sense that things were so screwed up that radical change -- and make no mistake that is what Trump cast himself as in this contest -- was the only option left. Consider this: Just 38 percent of voters in the national exit poll said that Trump was qualified to be president. (52 percent said the same of Clinton.) And yet, he won the White House on Tuesday night. That disconnect can only be explained by a desire to blow up the whole system. And I don't just mean the political system. I mean every elite and establishment institution that's ever assumed they know best -- the media very much included. Trump is the collective middle finger from all the people who think the elites have laughed them off and dismissed them for too long. It is the average man's revenge -- made all the more remarkable by the fact that the vessel of this rage against elites and the establishment is a billionaire who tells anyone who asks how smart and rich he is. How Trump happened then, while remarkable, can be understood and analyzed. What Trump will do as president is a far more difficult question to answer.    Donald Trump (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)  Trump's policy positions were loosely defined, at best. His lone consistent position throughout his life is on trade, where he has long favored a more protectionist view, suspicious of broad trade deals like NAFTA or the Trans-Pacific Partnership. His immigration stance -- build a wall and make Mexico pay for it -- seems far-fetched. His plans on taxes, on education, on energy are all sketches of ideas as opposed to specific policy proposals. How does Trump relate to the GOP congressional majorities he is going to enjoy? He ran against the Republican establishment -- in the primary and general election campaigns. He vilified them as tone-deaf to the changes happening not only within their party but also in the country. What now? Trump sits in the catbird's seat. Republican leaders need to come to him -- but is he willing to accept them into the new Republican Party he has forged? And what of the Democratic Party? Hillary Clinton began the 2016 campaign as the strongest non-incumbent front-runner in the history of modern politics. Her presumed strength glossed over the fact that a) a significant amount of liberal unrest -- represented in the primary by Bernie Sanders -- remained toward her and b) the Democratic bench is remarkably thin. What does it mean for world markets, that plunged as the likelihood of a Trump victory shaped up? Or the U.S. relationship with foreign countries? Or our involvement in foreign conflicts? There are many questions that Trump's victory creates. And more I can't even think of. Here's what I do know: Trump's victory is the single most stunning political development I have ever witnessed. And it's not close. This is the equivalent of dropping a refrigerator -- or maybe 10 refrigerators -- into a smallish pond. There are obvious, giant waves. But there are 1,000 other ripples that we might not even see today -- or might not even exist today. Cataclysm. Plain and simple.
