Karega issued a statement on Wednesday, saying that she would fight the dismissal and accusing Oberlin College of campaigning ""to implicate"" her ""professional fitness using arbitrary, inequitable, and discriminatory practices."" Karega, an assistant professor of rhetoric and composition, was criticized early this year for sharing Facebook postings that, among other things, claimed that ""Israeli and Zionist Jews"" were responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, and for the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in 2015.   [Does academic freedom protect professors who promote outrageous falsehoods?]   Karega, whose academic interests include black political and protest literacies as well as social justice writing, also wrote that the Islamic State is not ""a jihadist, Islamic terrorist organization"" but rather ""an operation"" of the CIA and Israel's intelligence agency, the Mossad. And she said Israel had brought down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 widely believed to have been shot down by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. After the controversy erupted, Oberlin President Marvin Krislov issued a statement saying that while he is a Jew who had family murdered in the Holocaust, academic freedom was fundamental to higher education. The Board of Directors of the liberal arts college in Oberlin, Ohio, however, was not satisfied with allowing Karega's statements to fall under the protection of academic freedom and in a statement said it had ordered the administration to ""challenge the assertion that there is any justification for these repugnant postings."" In August, amid some concerns that the investigation was taking too long, she was placed on leave, and at that time, her lawyer, Chui Karega, said in an email to Inside Higher Education that Oberlin's administration was ""pandering to the dictates of a handful of vocal and wealthy religious zealots."" In September, Krislov announced that he was stepping down after 10 years as Oberlin president at the end of the 2016-17 school year. And on Tuesday, the board released this statement saying that Karega -- who never apologized for her posts -- was being dismissed: The Oberlin College Board of Trustees, after extensive consideration and a comprehensive review of recommendations from multiple faculty committees and Oberlin President Marvin Krislov, has voted to dismiss Assistant Professor of Rhetoric and Composition Joy D. Karega for failing to meet the academic standards that Oberlin requires of its faculty and failing to demonstrate intellectual honesty. The dismissal is effective Tuesday, November 15, 2016. As a Board, we agree with President Krislov and every faculty committee reviewing this matter that the central issues are Dr. Karega's professional integrity and fitness.  We affirm Oberlin's historic and ongoing commitment to academic freedom. During this process, which began with Dr. Karega's posting of anti-Semitic writings on social media, Dr. Karega received numerous procedural protections: she was represented by counsel; she presented witness testimony, documents, and statements to support her position; and she had the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses testifying against her. The faculty review process examined whether Dr. Karega had violated the fundamental responsibilities of Oberlin faculty members -- namely, adherence to the ""Statement of Professional Ethics"" of the American Association of University Professors, which requires faculty members to ""accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending and transmitting knowledge"" and to ""practice intellectual honesty."" Contrary to this obligation, Dr. Karega attacked her colleagues when they challenged inconsistencies in her description of the connection between her postings and her scholarship. She disclaimed all responsibility for her misconduct. And she continues to blame Oberlin and its faculty committees for undertaking a shared governance review process. For these reasons, the faculty review committees and President Krislov agreed on the seriousness of Dr. Karega's misconduct. Indeed, the majority of the General Faculty Council, the executive body of Oberlin's faculty, concluded that Dr. Karega's postings could not be justified as part of her scholarship and had ""irreparably impaired [her] ability to perform her duties as a scholar, a teacher, and a member of the community."" In the face of Dr. Karega's repeated refusal to acknowledge and remedy her misconduct, her continued presence undermines the mission and values of Oberlin's academic community. Thus, any sanction short of dismissal is insufficient and the Board of Trustees is compelled to take this most serious action.   [Does academic freedom protect professors who promote outrageous falsehoods?]   Karega's statement said in part: On February 25, 2016, several of my Facebook posts were taken out of their original context and grossly misrepresented by a magazine with a political agenda. Since the publication of the posts, I have been inundated with HUNDREDS of hatemail filled with slurs (racial, misogynist, classist), harassment, and threats. To add insult to injury, for the last eight months, Oberlin College has campaigned to implicate my professional fitness using arbitrary, inequitable, and discriminatory practices. Indeed, the College launched an assault on my substantive rights... I will challenge the College's decision and assault on my substantive rights through ALL the avenues I have available to me. "

Patrick J. Toomey (R). Had she won the tight race, she would have taken Pennsylvania off the list of 21 states that have never elected a female senator. (Mel Evans/AP)  Hillary Clinton did not shatter that ""highest and hardest glass ceiling,"" as she said again Wednesday during her concession speech. But in the wake of this week's election, it's worth remembering the other high-ranking government jobs that women haven't attained: several Cabinet positions, and the senator or governor positions in more than 20 states. Besides the vice presidency -- which has had two major-party female candidates -- there are four Cabinet or designated Cabinet-level positions that have yet to be occupied by a woman. They are defense secretary, treasury secretary, secretary of veterans affairs and White House chief of staff. (There are other top government positions, such as FBI Director, director of the National Security Agency and other top intelligence jobs that have always been male. The chief justice of the United States has never been a woman.)   [Republican women who opposed Trump quietly plan a comeback]   Until Trump's stunning win this week, it appeared that some of that track record in the Cabinet might change. There was wide speculation that Michele Flournoy, who took herself out of the running in 2014 to replace Chuck Hagel, was considered a likely candidate for secretary of defense in a Clinton administration. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard was seen as a front-runner at the Treasury Department. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg also received some speculation for the job. Clinton had talked about naming a Cabinet that ""looks like America, and 50 percent of America is women,"" all but promising to nominate a gender-balanced Cabinet. We don't know yet what Trump's Cabinet will look like, but reports about his shortlist show an overwhelmingly male selection of contenders, and no women for those above four Cabinet jobs. Reports from Politico and BuzzFeed News show women being considered for attorney general, labor secretary and the Environmental Protection Agency. Four are reportedly under consideration for interior secretary. But their numbers are dwarfed in the reports by contenders who are male -- and mostly white. Naming a Cabinet with diversity, said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, ""is an opportunity for [Trump] to show that he's willing to go outside of those same white men that he has been surrounding himself with."" She notes that's particularly important because ""these are the first decisions we will get to see him make about how he is going to shape his administration."" Meanwhile, 21 states have never sent a woman to the U.S. Senate. Female candidates in three of those states -- Arizona, Utah and Pennsylvania -- lost this year, and only one loss, of Democrat Katie McGinty's to Republican Patrick J. Toomey in Pennsylvania, was close. Three new women will join the Senate in 2017, and notably, one is biracial, one is Thailand-born, and one is Latina: Kamala Harris, Tammy Duckworth and Catherine Cortez Masto, respectively. Yet with two female senators retiring, the total comes to 21, just one more than currently serves. Walsh said progress is slow. ""Part of the challenge is the pace of change is reflected in the pace of change in the number of women running. We aren't seeing big breakthroughs"" in how many women run.   [Janet Reno, former US attorney general, dies at age 78]   Women fare slightly better in the House of Representatives. Only two states -- Vermont and Mississippi -- have never sent a woman there; Delaware will drop off that list with its election of Lisa Blunt Rochester, its first female and African American representative, this week. Meanwhile, 23 states have not yet elected a woman to be governor, and those numbers did not change this year. Walsh says the same gender stereotypes that women face about leadership in top roles such as chief executive -- or the presidency -- have held back the number of women in state chief executive jobs, too. Still, she thinks those sentiments could be changing. Since the 1930s, Gallup has asked people whether they would vote for a woman for president, a percentage that has gone from just 33 percent in 1937 to 92 percent last year. ""One of the things that gives me hope out of this election, and I think this is meaningful . . . is that for the first time Americans had a real opportunity to vote on that issue. While [Clinton] did not win the electoral votes to win the presidency, she did win the popular vote,"" Walsh said. ""A majority of women did pull the lever for a woman to be the chief executive of the country. For me that is a breakthrough, and hopefully it will also be meaningful for women chief executives in the states, too.""

But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   The greatest trick Donald Trump pulled was convincing voters he'd be ""anti-establishment."" Well, maybe not the greatest trick. But in a campaign full of cons, it has to rank close to the top. This was near the heart of Trump's appeal to the disaffected and disempowered: Send me to Washington, and that ""establishment"" you've been hearing so much about? We'll blow it up, send it packing, punch it right in the face, and when it's over the government will finally be working for you again. And the people who voted for Trump bought it. After all, he's no politician, right? He's an outsider, a glass-breaker, a guy who can cut out the bull and get things done. Right? But the idea that he would do this was based on a profound misunderstanding of what the establishment actually is, and who Donald Trump is. Here's a report on Trump's transition from Eric Lipton of the New York Times: President-elect Donald J. Trump, who campaigned against the corrupt power of special interests, is filling his transition team with some of the very sort of people who he has complained have too much clout in Washington: corporate consultants and lobbyists... Mr. Trump was swept to power in large part by white working-class voters who responded to his vow to restore the voices of forgotten people, ones drowned out by big business and Wall Street. But in his transition to power, some of the most prominent voices will be those of advisers who come from the same industries for which they are being asked to help set the regulatory groundwork.      President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 10 pledged to accomplish ""spectacular things for the American people"" as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) sat by his side. (Reuters)   An organizational chart of Trump's transition team shows it to be crawling with corporate lobbyists, representing such clients as Altria, Visa, Coca-Cola, General Electric, Verizon, HSBC, Pfizer, Dow Chemical, and Duke Energy. And K Street is positively salivating over all the new opportunities they'll have to deliver goodies to their clients in the Trump era. Who could possibly have predicted such a thing? The answer is, anyone who was paying attention. Look at the people Trump is considering for his Cabinet, and you won't find any outside-the-box thinkers burning to work for the little guy. It's a collection of Republican politicians and corporate plutocrats -- not much different from who you'd find in any Republican administration.   [What derigging the system looks like so far]   And it isn't just personnel. What are the priorities Trump and the Republican Congress will be pursuing right out of the gate? There's the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, of course. ""Take that, establishment!"", 20 million people can say when they lose their health coverage. Next on the list is that eternal Republican priority, cutting taxes. If you're waiting for your fat rebate from the government once the establishment has been sent packing, you're in for a shock. It won't actually be Trump's plan precisely that will pass Congress and he'll sign, it will be some combination of what he wanted and what congressional Republicans want. But the two share a driving principle in common, and you may want to sit down while I tell you that helping regular folks is most definitely not it.          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.    Caption   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.  Nov. 10, 2016  President Obama talks with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        No, their commitment is to be of service to that most oppressed and forgotten group of Americans, the wealthy. Trump's tax plan would give 47 percent of its benefits to the richest one percent of taxpayers. Paul Ryan's tax plan is even purer -- it gives 76 percent of its cuts to the richest one percent in its first year, and by 2025 would feed 99.6 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent. Once that's accomplished, Trump and the Republicans plan to either gut or completely repeal the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, the greatest wish of Wall Street bankers. Can you feel the anti-establishment wind blowing? So what's going on here? Most plainly, the voters thinking that Trump would vanquish the establishment were just marks for a con, like those who lost their life savings at Trump University. But it was made possible by the vagueness of the idea of the ""establishment"" -- and some related ideas -- and the way people could pour all their dissatisfaction into it and elect they guy promising to destroy it when he had no intention of doing anything of the sort. You see, in Washington we think of the establishment as something specific to this city: the people who hold certain kinds of institutional positions and certain kinds of ideas about what should be done. We tend to think that, say, internal arguments between factions of the Republican Party represent a genuine threat to the establishment. But for most voters it's much bigger than that, and this is what Donald Trump recognized. By now we should understand that while Trump is an ignorant buffoon in some ways and an outright moron in others, he's also a savant of hatred and resentment. He not only identifies the ugliest feelings that portions of the electorate have -- that's the easy part, and all of his primary opponents knew equally well what those feelings were -- he finds just the right way to reach in and goose them. And he grasped that people were ready to sign on with an attack on all sectors of established power, in Washington or anywhere else. That attack was politically potent because to those who heard it, it was about much more than politics. They didn't really care whether the House Majority Whip is one guy or a different guy. What Trump tapped into was their sense of powerlessness, that unseen forces are pulling the strings and manipulating ""the system"" for their own benefit. That ""system"" encompasses everything from politics to the economy to their local schools to culture. The system made that factory leave town. The system lets immigrants come in and speak a language other than English. Everywhere you look you're being held down by the system.   [The problem with our government is democracy]   So when Trump complained that anything that didn't go his way meant the system was ""rigged"" against him, they nodded in agreement and said, ""Yep, it's rigged against me, too."" And of course, the horror of the establishment (both Democratic and Republican) at Trump only reinforced the belief that once he was elected he'd change everything. Now to be clear, the fact that in some ways -- hiring lobbyists, cutting taxes for the wealthy, gutting regulations -- Trump is going to be little different from any other Republican president doesn't mean that he isn't uniquely dangerous. He's reckless, impulsive, vindictive, hateful, and authoritarian, and his presidency is going to be somewhere between disastrous and cataclysmic, likely in ways we can't even imagine yet. But one thing it will not be is a threat to the establishment, or the system, or whatever you want to call it. The wealthy and powerful will have more wealth and power when he's done, not less. There's a lot that Trump will upend, but if you're a little guy who thinks Trump was going to upend things on your behalf or in order to serve your interests, guess what: you got suckered."

Opposition lawmakers, who are against the deal, have disrupted parliamentary work by using tear gas canisters, blowing whistles and throwing water bottles. Street rallies by opposition supporters routinely turn into violent clashes with police. EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn visited Kosovo on Friday, saying that its political polarization is negatively affecting its integration path into the 28-nation bloc.  ""I urge all the players to understand that the political debate should be held at the parliament, naturally without tear gas or other such tools, but with competition for the best argument,"" Hahn told a news conference. In May, the European Commission recommended a visa-free regime for Kosovo, but first Pristina has to ratify the border agreement with Montenegro.  ""We should be clear that is a condition without flexibility,"" Hahn said. ""We are at the last kilometer, which is a very long kilometer, crawling like a snake."" Last year, Kosovo signed a stabilization and association agreement with the EU, the first step toward membership. Hahn said that Brussels would continuously assist Kosovo in its reforms.  ""The implementation of the European agenda asks for much work ... and for political will to carry out tough reforms,"" he said. Prime Minister Isa Mustafa said that strengthening the rule of law, competition and improving education and employment were the main priorities for the next 18 months. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia. That is recognized by 112 countries, but not by Belgrade. Five EU members that don't recognize Kosovo haven't blocked its integration steps.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)  President Obama laid a wreath in Arlington National Cemetery on Friday and used his final Veterans Day speech to deliver a plea for unity and to urge Americans to set aside political grievances and follow the example of those who fight the country's wars. ""We can practice kindness, we can pay it forward, we can volunteer, and we can serve,"" Obama said on a blustery and bright day. ""We can respect one another. We can always get each other's backs. That is what Veterans Day asks all of us to think about."" The president is a former smoker and during moments of stress he has admitted to chewing Nicorette gum. Before he stood to speak, Obama appeared to spit a wad of the gum into a paper napkin, which he slipped into his suit pocket. As he stepped to the presidential lectern, he was welcomed with an unusually long ovation. The president, normally a polished and confident speaker, seemed to stumble over his words at the beginning of his address. He praised veterans for their quiet and selfless service, but the focus of his remarks was on the need for the country to recover from a bruising election campaign, a theme that is likely to dominate his remaining days in office. He praised the U.S. military as ""the single most diverse institution in our country,"" representing ""every shade of humanity ... all forged into common service."" The president referred in the most general way to the bitter election campaign to replace him, which was marred by widespread accusations of racism, sexism and anti-immigrant sentiment. ""Veterans Day often follows a hard-fought political campaign,"" he said. But the president did not revisit the slights of the campaign trail, focusing instead on the  ""the American instinct ... to find strength in our common creed, to forge unity from our great diversity."" ""We can show how much we love our country by loving our neighbors as ourselves,"" Obama said. The president defended his administration's record on veterans' issues, noting that he had increased funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs by 85 percent over the course of his two terms in office, improved access to mental health services and cut veteran homelessness in half. He urged his successor to continue work on the tragedy of veteran suicides, which claim 20 lives a day, and to resist calls to outsource and privatize the VA. Obama focused his remarks on an increasingly disaffected and angry electorate. ""Whenever the world makes you cynical, whenever you seek true humility and selflessness, look to a veteran,"" the president said."

""I note with bitterness, I who am a friend of Turkey, that Turkey is distancing itself from Europe every day,"" the president of the EU's executive Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said. Juncker's comments follow a week that saw 10 lawmakers from Turkey's pro-Kurdish party and nine senior staff members of the opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper arrested on alleged links to terror groups. Access to social media websites and applications also were restricted, a move seen as a bid by the government to prevent protests from being organized. Juncker called on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to immediately say ""whether Turkey really wants to be -- yes or no -- a member of the European Union."" He also said Erdogan would only have himself to blame if the EU does not grant visa-free travel in Europe to Turkish citizens soon. The visa waiver is part of a package of incentives, including fast-tracked membership talks and billions of euros for Syrian refugees in Turkey, promised to Ankara if it helps prevent mass migration to the continent.  ""Mr. Erdogan will have to explain to the Turkish people why they will not be able to freely travel like all other Europeans throughout Europe, because it will be he who has not fulfilled the conditions agreed in advance,"" Juncker said. His criticism comes just as the EU is set to release its latest progress report on Turkey's membership negotiations, on Wednesday. Turkey's Foreign Ministry branded the EU criticism as ""unacceptable."" In a statement, the ministry accused European nations of ""insistently refusing to understand Turkey's sensitivities concerning terrorism."" One of the conditions for the waiving of visas is that Turkey must change its definition of ""terrorism"" to prevent the arrests of journalists and political opponents. The ministry also faulted the EU for failing to press the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, to lay down its arms. Both Turkey and the EU consider the PKK a terror organization, yet alleged PKK militants were allowed to roam freely in EU countries and to engage in anti-Turkish propaganda inside the European Parliament building, according to the statement.  ""The EU has lost its plausibility and credibility with the Turkish people on the issue of the struggle against terrorism,"" the statement said. Turkey has been in talks to join the European Union since October 2005, but progress has been held up, often by political opposition and particularly due to resistance from Cyprus. The Mediterranean island has been divided in two since 1974, when Turkish troops occupied its northern third. But other EU countries also are opposed to the large, relatively poor and mainly Muslim country joining. Germany, notably, would prefer an alternate kind of ""privileged partnership"" for Turkey. The tenuous state of Turkey's future in the EU was reflected Tuesday in the remarks of a senior German official who pointed Turks who feel politically persecuted to the possibility of seeking asylum in Germany. Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Roth expressed the government's solidarity with ""all critical spirits in Turkey"" in Tuesday's edition of daily newspaper Die Welt. He added that Germany ""is in principle open to all politically persecuted people. They can apply for asylum in Germany."" However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the priority is ensuring that no one needs to do so. Merkel also stressed that asylum applications are considered by independent institutions, not her government.  ""We are working politically for a situation in Turkey that doesn't make it necessary for people to seek asylum,"" she said. Merkel added that ""we have received alarming signals in recent days"" and Germany would continue pushing for Turkey to respect fundamental freedoms. Speaking in the European Parliament in Brussels Tuesday, Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) parliamentarian Ertugrul Kurkcu called for action, not just words of condemnation.  ""We are at a critical moment,"" he warned, adding that ""a very dark atmosphere of oppression"" reigns over Turkey. ___ Fraser reported from Ankara. Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed.

Chris Christie maintained in an interview aired Monday that he has no recollection of any of his aides telling him about lane closures on the George Washington Bridge that were ultimately found to be a political retaliation plot. Two of Christie's former aides were convicted Friday of causing epic traffic traffic jams near the nation's busiest bridge, a plot that Christie called ""one of the most abjectly stupid things I've ever seen."" Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, an executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were convicted of scheming with former Christie ally David Wildstein to punish a Democratic mayor for not endorsing Republican Christie when he ran for re-election in 2013. Wildstein pleaded guilty. Here are some of the highlights of Christie's first comments since the verdict. ____ DID CHRISTIE KNOW MORE THAN HE'S SAID? Testimony contradicted Christie's statements about when he knew about the four days of gridlock at the base of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee in September 2013. Wildstein testified that Baroni told Christie d about the traffic jam at a Sept. 11 memorial event in New York while the gridlock was in progress. He said Christie laughed and made a sarcastic joke when he learned of Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich's distress over not getting his calls returned. It was unclear from Wildstein's testimony whether Christie knew then that the mess was manufactured for political reasons. However, Kelly testified she told Christie about Sokolich's concerns about political retaliation during the week of the traffic jams at the bridge, which connects New York and Fort Lee. Christie said Monday that no one testified they told him it was an act of political retribution.  ""If they would have told me that they were creating traffic at the George Washington Bridge in order to punish the mayor for not endorsing you, I would have remembered that. And they never said that,"" Christie said. Other testimony described some of Christie's top advisers and confidants knowing about the plan ahead of time or soon afterward and being aware of the political motivation well before Christie told reporters in December 2013 that none of his staff was involved. ___ ON THE 'ABSOLUTELY STUPID' PLOT Christie said that he could never figure out why aides would have retaliated against the mayor considering Christie had a large lead.  ""I'm pretty good at this political game, I'm up by 25 points in a re-election in a blue state and they decide they're going to create a traffic jam in a town that's a Democrat town that I wound up winning two months later in the election?"" Christie said. ""Absolutely stupid."" Christie's big edge in the polls notwithstanding, the Office of Inter-Governmental Affairs, headed by Kelly, had spent more than two years before the bridge scandal courting Democratic mayors, even keeping a spreadsheet ranking them on their likelihood to endorse Christie and listing what favors they had received, according to testimony. Several weeks before the lane closures, Christie's office apparently felt betrayed by Democratic Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, who they viewed as a potential endorser. According to Kelly's testimony, the order came from Christie to cancel scheduled meetings with Fulop. ___ ON WHAT THE VERDICT SAYS ABOUT HIS MANAGEMENT Christie said Kelly was ""one out of 25"" people to serve on his senior staff who ""didn't get it.""  ""So I don't think it says anything about me,"" he said. ""I think it says everything about that person."" One of Christie's closest political allies, David Samson, pleaded guilty this year to using his position as chairman of the Port Authority to get an airline to start a flight so he could have an easier trip to his vacation home. Also, Christie cut ties with his former campaign manager because of his alleged role in the bridge plot. Bill Stepien is now involved in Donald Trump's presidential campaign. So is Christie. ___ ON WHETHER BRIDGEGATE COST HIM POLITICALLY At the time the scandal unfolded, Christie was considered a top presidential contender. Christie ultimately dropped out of the presidential race after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary and said recently the scandal probably influenced Trump's decision not to pick him as a running mate. Christie is chairman of Trump's transition team, in charge of hiring thousands of employees if he wins the presidency. Christie said in the interview that he was runner-up to Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to be Trump's running mate, but that you'd have to ask Trump what role Bridgegate played in him not getting the nod. Christie's scheduled campaign stops for Trump on Saturday were canceled on Friday after the verdict and he wasn't scheduled to campaign with him ahead of Election Day. ____ Associated Press Writer David Porter, in Newark, contributed to this report.

That's according to recently released data from the Pew Research Center, which has been tracking the role of social media throughout this divisive election cycle. More people than ever are turning to Facebook, Twitter and the like for news and commentary, then sharing their views with followers who range from old high school friends to that aunt you only care to see at Thanksgiving. Pew found that 20 percent of survey respondents say social media has altered their position on a political issue and 17 percent say it has changed their view of a specific candidate. Democrats were more likely to report social media changed their views than Republicans. A similar Pew survey conducted in 2012 found that 16 percent of respondents had their views of a political issue changed as a result of their activity on social networks. When asked which candidate or issue they reconsidered because of interactions on social media, the top responses were Hillary Clinton (21 percent), Donald Trump (18 percent), racial issues/Black Lives Matter/police brutality (13 percent), Bernie Sanders (8 percent) and gun control/gun rights (6 percent), according to Pew. That's not necessarily good news for Clinton or Trump. More respondents said social media posts made their impressions of the candidates more negative rather than more positive. Social media, especially Facebook, has been criticized for creating something of a political echo chamber, where people tend to find information and engage with those who reinforce their views rather than challenge them. Facebook released its own study last year that showed its users have five friends with political views similar to their own for every one friend with opposing views. The Pew survey found that people were exposed to a diversity of viewpoints but may not have tolerance for all of them. Although 40 percent of respondents say they have blocked or unfriended someone for political reasons, many also report that a ""mix of beliefs"" is reflected in their Facebook (53 percent) and Twitter (39 percent) newsfeeds. People have ""been thrown into this environment with this big stew of people who in many cases they may not want to hear their political viewpoints and here they are popping up in their feeds,"" said Aaron Smith, Pew's associate director of research. ""I don't know if we can make a universal statement about whether this is good or bad,"" he added. Read more from The Washington Post's Innovations section."
