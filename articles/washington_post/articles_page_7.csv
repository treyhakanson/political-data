Several months ago, administration officials envisioned the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting as a possible capstone to years of painstaking efforts to deepen trade, defense and diplomatic ties between the United States and East and Southeast Asia, the world's most populous and fastest-growing region. But Trump's sharp criticism of trade deals such as the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which still lacks congressional ratification, and his suggestion that long-standing U.S. military base agreements in Japan and South Korea might be too expensive to maintain, threatens to reverse the Obama administration's agenda and upend decades of American leadership in the region. ""The governments in Asia are all very anxious,"" said Michael Green, senior vice president for Asia at the Center for International and Strategic Studies and former senior Asia director at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. In a bilateral meeting with Obama on Saturday evening, Chinese President Xi Jinping voiced that anxiety as he sat across from the president at a long table, with both men flanked by several aides. ""We meet at a hinge moment in the China-U.S. relationship,"" Xi said, through an interpreter, after Obama had thanked him for China's cooperation on issues as divergent as climate change and nuclear nonproliferation. ""I hope the two sides will work together to focus on cooperation, manage our differences, and make sure there is a smooth transition in the relationship, and that it will continue to grow."" Although most of the president's diplomacy here took place behind closed doors, he tackled those concerns directly Saturday as he spoke to an audience of 1,000 young people who had gathered in Peru to celebrate the administration's new Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative. After a young woman asked whether concerns about Trump's presidency were ""for real,"" Obama said he had the same message for her that he had been delivering to world leaders in Greece, Germany and Peru during his last foreign trip as president. ""My main message to you, though, is: Don't just assume the worst,"" he said, standing in shirt sleeves on a wide stage erected at the center of the Pontifical Catholic University's gym. ""Wait until the administration's in place, it's actually putting its policies together, and then you can make your judgments."" But the president acknowledged that while the next administration may maintain several of his policies regarding Latin America, for example, ""There are going to be tensions, most likely around trade more than anything else."" The uncertainty and anxiety over Trump's administration in Tokyo, Seoul and beyond come at a time of rising challenges and complexities. China has accelerated its expansionist aims with maritime claims throughout the South China Sea, angering its neighbors, and has touted its own multilateral trade deal in Asia that does not include the United States. North Korea's belligerent leader Kim Jong Un has defied international rules and condemnation by exploding nuclear devices and conducting ballistic-missile tests. The presidency of South Korean President Park Geun-hye is threatened by a massive corruption scandal. And new Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's fiercely anti-U.S. rhetoric has alarmed Washington about whether the longtime U.S. ally could draw closer to Beijing.  [Overseas, Obama warns against a 'crude nationalism' taking root worldwide]  During the U.S. presidential campaign, the New York businessman said Japan and South Korea are not paying ""their fair share"" to support the U.S. troop presence there. And Trump repeatedly criticized China as a currency manipulator and powerful global operator that had taken advantage of the United States under Obama's tenure. He has threatened to slap high tariffs on imports from China and to withdraw the United States from a global climate agreement the Obama administration helped broker by courting cooperation with Chinese and Indian officials. Trump has already begun to reach out to Asian leaders since his election, meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in New York and talking by phone with the South Korean president. After meeting with Trump on Thursday, Abe said that the two had a ""very candid discussion"" and that he is ""convinced that Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have confidence."" Trump's team has taken a sharply critical view of the Obama administration's effort to ""rebalance"" or ""pivot"" U.S. foreign policy attention to Asia. In an article published Nov. 7 in Foreign Policy, two of Trump's policy advisers, Alexander Gray and Peter Navarro, criticized both Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton as failing to exercise enough military muscle in Asia. ""This pivot has also turned out to be an imprudent case of talking loudly but carrying a small stick, one that has led to more, not less, aggression and instability in the region,"" they wrote. ""American allies and partners in the region have been disheartened by a foreign policy that has veered from feckless to mendacious.""  [TPP is the first casualty of Trump's anti-trade campaign pledge]  Some Asia analysts suggest that while a vow to increase military spending in the region would be welcomed by leaders there, a de-emphasis on trade deals and a more realpolitik approach to diplomatic relations could prompt some Asia-Pacific nations to move closer toward China. In a memo for the Eurasia Group, a global risk assessment firm in New York, Obama's former senior Asia director, Evan Medeiros, predicted that ""US alliances will experience strain but will not break, while Asian leaders gradually hedge away from the US on both security and economic issues."" Some of the statements by Trump and his advisers, Medeiros wrote, ""raise fundamental questions about America's commitment to basic interests and policies that have guided U.S. engagement over the past 60 years."" The president and his aides, for their part, sought to emphasize that officials should not jump to conclusions about where American diplomacy is headed. One White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to talk about the president-elect, said that it was worth noting that Trump has not questioned the importance of the Asia-Pacific region even as he has suggested that he would pursue a different path. ""I haven't seen Trump walk that back,"" the official said. In a sign of how intent Obama remains on shoring up some of those relationships before leaving office, he will meet with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull here Sunday. Green said he advised some of the current NSC officials that Obama would be on solid ground telling other foreign leaders ""this was not an isolationist election,"" since independent polls show that Americans continue to back the regional trade deal as well as military support for key Asian allies.  But U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, who is attending the summit here, told reporters Friday that other nations' political and economic calculus may change if the next administration delays ratification of TPP and sends different diplomatic signals. China is continuing to push for a competing trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which involves the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and six other countries that have free trade agreements with that association. ""Inaction poses serious costs,"" Froman said, noting these other negotiators met a few weeks ago and have another round of talks scheduled next month. ""That is happening, as we say, in real time, where we see people around the table here right now talking about that if TPP doesn't move forward, then they're going to have to put their eggs in an RCEP basket.""

But this time, his record was bound for the city's public library. Officials in Tennessee's capital city have unearthed never-before-published photos and records documenting Lewis' arrests there decades ago, while he was leading an effort to desegregate the city's lunch counters. Nashville Mayor Megan Berry surprised Lewis with the records while he was on stage Saturday at the Martin Luther King Jr. Academic Magnet High School to receive a literary award for ""March,"" a three-part graphic novel about his life in the civil rights movement.  ""I was surprised, and I almost cried. I held back tears, because I was so young,"" Lewis, now 76 and long a U.S. congressman from Georgia, told reporters afterward. ""I would love to have copies of them and place them in my Washington office, so when young people, especially children, come by, and even some of my colleagues, they will see what happened and be inspired to do something."" As a child, Lewis was inspired by radio broadcasts of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. That eventually led him to co-found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and serve as its chairman. He was one of the organizers for the 1963 March on Washington. The photos depict a scowling Lewis in his early 20s, wearing a tie in one photo and a long overcoat in another. The arrest records show he was booked at least three times from 1961 to 1963 on charges including disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and breach of the peace. City officials plan to display copies of the records in the Civil Rights Room of the Nashville Public Library, where all police trainees are required to attend a class.  ""You got into some 'good trouble' in Nashville, and apparently 40-plus more times, and I hope these photos remind you of what you have done and the legacy you have left for us,"" Barry told Lewis while showing him the records Saturday. David Ewing, a local historian and lawyer, first requested the records years ago but was told they did not exist. But he kept asking, and his prodding eventually led officials to find them deep in the city's archives. Lewis said he has been arrested 45 times for his activism -- including five times since he was elected to Congress. But his first arrest came in Nashville.  ""I'm probably going to be arrested again,"" he said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Jeff Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, is likely to rehash racially charged allegations that derailed his efforts to become a federal judge and made him a symbol of black-voter intimidation under the Reagan administration. The expected focus on Sessions' record on race, policing and immigration comes as the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has surged in prominence under the Obama administration. If confirmed, Sessions would have broad latitude to define how federal prosecutors across the country wield their powers and make changes to the Justice Department's priorities. Lawmakers and advocates expressed concern Friday that Sessions could sideline or undo the Obama administration's civil rights efforts, which have included investigations of police departments for unconstitutional practices and lawsuits meant to protect the rights of transgender individuals and black voters.  ""Given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say,"" incoming Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said he strongly supported Sessions, who he said ""has worked tirelessly to safeguard the public and to improve the lives of Americans from all walks of life."" Sessions' peers on the Senate Judiciary Committee will almost certainly delve into the Alabama senator's past statements on race. The panel's top Democrat, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, hinted as much on Friday, saying the ""American people deserve to learn about Senator Sessions' record."" Leahy voted against Sessions for a district judgeship when he last came before the Judiciary Committee in 1986. During that hearing, Sessions was criticized for joking in the presence of a Civil Rights Division attorney that the Ku Klux Klan was ""OK"" until he learned they smoked marijuana. He was also said to have called a black assistant U.S. attorney ""boy"" and the NAACP ""un-American"" and ""communist-inspired."" Gerry Hebert, a former Justice Department lawyer who worked with Sessions in the early 1980s, said he remembered Sessions making racially offensive remarks.  ""I filed all these things away thinking, 'God, what a racist this guy is,'"" Hebert said. Sessions, a former prosecutor, has said the racially charged allegations against him have been painful to him and an unfair stain on his reputation. He called the matter ""heartbreaking"" in a 2009 CNN interview and described the allegations as ""false charges."" In defending his record, Sessions is likely to point to his vote to confirm Eric Holder as the country's first black attorney general and to his co-sponsorship of the Fair Sentencing Act, which sought to reduce racial disparities in how black and white drug offenders are treated. When he was U.S. attorney in Alabama, his office investigated the 1981 murder of Michael Donald, a black man who was kidnapped, beaten and killed by two Klansmen who hanged his body in a tree. The two men were later arrested and convicted.  ""He couldn't have been more supportive of making sure we got convicted the murderers of the last black man who was lynched by the Klan,"" said former Justice Department attorney Barry Kowalski, who worked with Sessions. But ""those incidents don't obliterate the well-established record of hostility to civil rights enforcement in other areas,"" said Wade Henderson, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Sessions' civil rights record matters because, if confirmed, he would have oversight of a division that Holder has described as the Justice Department's ""crown jewel."" Sessions himself has said a ""properly exercised"" Civil Rights Division ""provides tremendous benefit to American citizens"" but should not be used as ""a sword to assert inappropriate claims that have the effect of promoting political agendas."" As attorney general, he'd have the power to depart significantly from the priorities of his Democratic-nominated predecessors. The Obama administration Justice Department, for instance, has opened 23 investigations of law enforcement agencies, including police departments in Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri, for unconstitutional practices and has reached court-enforceable consent decrees with many of them. It sued North Carolina over a bathroom bill it said discriminated against transgender individuals, and has challenged state voting laws that it said disenfranchised minority voters. As a supporter of Trump, who campaigned on law and order, Sessions is likely to pursue fewer civil rights investigations of troubled police departments. He may also elevate voter fraud as a priority, something the current Justice Department leaders see as negligible. In the mid-1980s, Sessions was criticized over the prosecution of three civil rights activists on charges of vote tampering in Perry County, Alabama. The activists, who included Albert Turner, a former adviser to Martin Luther King Jr., were acquitted. During his confirmation hearing Sessions defended the case, citing evidence of absentee-ballot tampering. Democrats and civil rights groups called it an example of the Reagan administration intimidating black voters. As a senator, Sessions criticized the Justice Department in 2009 for dismissing three defendants from a voting rights lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party after allegations of voter intimidation outside a Philadelphia polling place. The department's Office of Professional Responsibility found no evidence politics played a role in that decision. He's also defended the lawfulness of state voter identification laws. Policy differences aside, the Civil Rights Division is expected to continue enforcing civil rights laws, such as prosecuting police officers for egregious acts of violence.  ""The challenge for an incoming administration is always to make those policy changes without making law enforcement look like a purely political undertaking,"" said William Yeomans, who worked in the division for more than two decades. Otherwise, ""it hurts the legitimacy of the institution."" ___ Associated Press writer Eileen Sullivan in Washington and Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama contributed to this report.

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says action on climate change has become ""unstoppable"" and predicts that President-elect Donald Trump will drop plans to quit the global climate change deal. (Reuters)   As the international meeting on climate change neared a close in Morocco on Thursday, parties endorsed a strong statement declaring that the ""momentum is irreversible"" when it comes to global action on climate change. In the wake of the Nov. 8 U.S. election, that statement may have been aimed at one specific climate-change doubter, President-elect Donald Trump. ""We call for the highest political commitment to combat climate change, as a matter of urgent priority,"" the statement, endorsed by heads of state, declared. The Marrakesh gathering is the first official meeting under the Paris climate agreement that was signed by 195 countries late last year and ratified by enough of them to bring it into force in less than a year. During the meeting, additional nations ratified the accord, including major emitters Australia, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom. The newly released document doesn't mention Trump, but it's hard not to read it in its current political context.   [China tells Trump climate change is not a Chinese hoax]   ""While this proclamation has long been planned, it's taken on far greater symbolic and political significance in the wake of Trump's threats to withdraw from the Paris Agreement,"" said former Clinton White House climate official Paul Bledsoe, who was attending the negotiations. ""It is a stiff upper lip reaction, really, and it's appropriate I think. You have to do this,"" said John Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, shortly after returning from Marrakesh. Schellnhuber said that in the first week of the meeting, many delegates were ""really panicking."" But the tone shifted to a more measured realism in the second week, he said, driven in large part by reassurances that China, the world's largest emitter, remains seriously committed to the accord. ""If China stays the course, I think we have a very good chance to overcome the Trump bump in the road,"" Schellnhuber said. He said he suspects there will be some minor damage to the climate from U.S. recalcitrance, but far more damage to the U.S. economy in the long term if it cedes leadership in the clean energy space to rivals such as China and Germany in favor of a backward-looking emphasis on fossil fuels.   [From France to Canada, countries are reeling from Trump's climate plans]   Perhaps the most important aspect of the Marrakesh statement was a call for ""urgently raising ambition and strengthening cooperation amongst ourselves to close the gap between current emissions trajectories and the pathway needed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement."" That will not happen at this meeting, but it is an acknowledgment that if countries don't move quickly on their emissions cuts, key climate goals will be lost. As the meeting neared a wrap-up Friday, there remained a few issues to be negotiated, but the main accomplishments included progress on laying out the rules for how parties must conform with the Paris agreement, explained Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. In two years, countries are expected to finalize rules for reporting their emissions, and how much they have reduced them, under the agreement. ""There's almost 120 different elements that have to be finalized and worked out to give full meaning to Paris and guidance to countries on how to revise and report on their nationally determined commitments,"" Meyer said.   [What it would really mean if Trump pulls the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement]   That's not the only thing looming in 2018 -- so is a meeting to ratchet up every country's commitment to cutting said emissions, which is sure to be difficult. By then the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to have completed a report studying what it would take for the world to limit the planet's warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels -- a hugely ambitious goal that may not be possible to achieve. ""We see that as the next big political moment in this process,"" Meyer said of 2018. ""It's when there will be a clear acknowledgement that we are not on track to meet the Paris temperature goals."" So, after reeling from Trump's election and its potential impact on global climate change, delegates have steeled themselves to push ahead -- with or without the United States. It all sets the stage for quite the international climate saga in the coming years.      The Paris Agreement is edging closer to coming into force as more and more countries sign and officially join the accord. Here's what you need to know. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)   "

Then Trump won, and he gave his sermon in tears.	"      Rabbi Daniel Zemel delivered an emotional sermon at Temple Micah in Northwest Washington on Nov.11 reflecting on the Election Day results and what Donald Trump's win means for American Jews and the country as a whole. (Courtesy: Rabbi Daniel Zemel)   He couldn't even get through his first sentence before the tears began. ""I woke up Wednesday morning thinking about the legendary sign,"" he started. He couldn't continue. The congregants packed into the unusually crowded sanctuary held their breaths for three long seconds. He inhaled. ""Above the synagogue of the Kotzker rebbe: Jews don't despair."" Rabbi Daniel Zemel knows there is a lot he could despair about. As Reform Jews, who voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, and as residents of the District, where more than 92 percent did so, Zemel's congregants at Temple Micah were almost uniformly dismayed by Donald Trump's election. As many grew shaken and scared in the days following the election, they flocked to Zemel's Friday-night Shabbat service for solace, strength or simply togetherness.   [Anti-Defamation League decries Stephen Bannon, while many other Jewish groups stay silent]   ""We have just lived through a bruising political season where the results feel to many of us like a repudiation of the values that we believe this country was founded on and embraced. ... Tolerance. An open mind. A spirit of generosity. A belief that we are all created in God's image,"" he said in his sermon. ""And for me, there's always been something so confluent about my American beliefs and my Jewish beliefs. They reinforce each other."" Addressing the election so openly was a rare choice for Zemel. During the High Holy Day season a little more than a month ago, when rabbis have their biggest audiences of the year, some rabbis used their pulpit to speak against Trump. But the majority decided not to talk about politics, and Zemel was strongly in that camp.   [On the High Holy Days, rabbis wrestle with whether to take on Donald Trump]   ""For me to tell people what their values are about the election, it would be so 'preaching to the choir' in the most unnecessary way,"" he said. He steered clear of current events altogether on Yom Kippur, giving a sermon about the Book of Job. Now, Zemel expects he'll be talking a lot about what's happening in America, for the foreseeable future. The emails have been pouring in from his bereft congregants: What can we do next? ""I want to learn about civil disobedience. I think we're at a point where we may have to,"" Zemel said. He's doing his reading -- Martin Luther King Jr.'s letter from the Birmingham jail, Henry David Thoreau's ""Civil Disobedience,"" the biblical story of the midwives who defied Pharaoh's order to kill the babies of Jewish slaves. ""If they're asking Muslims to register, of course we'll get every Jew in America to register,"" he said. ""If they're going to start deporting people, we'll make Temple Micah into a sanctuary.""   [One of Trump's top transition advisers says they're planning a registry for Muslims]   He also wants to further understanding between liberals and conservatives. He wants to convene very personal conversations --maybe one-on-one, maybe in small groups -- between members of Temple Micah and conservative counterparts, perhaps Trump voters, whom they wouldn't otherwise meet. He might ask speakers from diverse viewpoints to address the synagogue. But on the political front, he plans to lead his congregation in direct action against the Trump administration if Trump carries out some of his campaign proposals that the Micah community finds most abhorrent, like a registry of Muslims. ""We simply have to communicate whatever we can and take action, that this is not the American way,"" Zemel said. ""We all have to be ready to pounce on every action which is totally, totally, totally objectionable to us. We can't be seduced and think, 'Maybe we can let this one slide; this will be okay.' "" In his sermon, through his tears, Zemel tried to urge resilience. ""We will console one another, and then we will light a candle. That's what we do,"" he said. ""Jews mourn by lighting a candle. When our world is darkened, we light a candle. If our world became darker, we would light another candle. And then we would light another candle. And we would return to the street."" He asked the congregation to rise soon after, and together they sang ""America the Beautiful."" To watch the complete sermon, view Temple Micah's video. Want more stories about faith?

It worked.	"   Example of message designed to remind harassers of the humanity of their victims and to reconsider the norms of online behavior. (Screen shot from Twitter by Kevin Munger/TMC)  Despite rising concern among the public, social-media companies have had little success stemming the wave of online harassment. As part of research recently published in the journal Political Behavior, I conducted an experiment on Twitter to find out the best tactics people can use to discourage other users from using harassing language. I found that these sanctioning messages do have an effect, but not in all contexts. Twitter is certainly aware of this problem. As CEO Dick Costelo said in an internal memo in 2015, ""We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years."" They do suspend some of the more egregiously abusive accounts, and they have started implementing more sophisticated techniques like ""shadow banning."" However, there may be limits to the effectiveness of top-down efforts by companies that run social-media platforms. In the short run, heavy-handed sanctions like account bans can actually embolden users who are censored. There is excellent evidence that this happens in China when the regime employs censorship. A better option might be to empower users to improve their online communities through peer-to-peer sanctioning. To test this hypothesis, I used Twitter accounts I controlled (""bots,"" although they aren't acting autonomously) to send messages designed to remind harassers of the humanity of their victims and to reconsider the norms of online behavior. The use of an experiment allowed me to tightly control the context for sanctioning. I sent every harasser the same message: @[subject] Hey man, just remember that there are real people who are hurt when you harass them with that kind of language I used a racial slur as the search term because I thought of it as the strongest evidence that a tweet might contain racist harassment. I restricted the sample to users who had a history of using offensive language, and I only included subjects who appeared to be a white man or who were anonymous. It was essential to keep the race and gender of the subjects constant to test my central question: How would reactions to my sanctioning message change based on the race of the bot sending the message? To do so, I created two types of bots: white men and black men. To manipulate the race, I used the same cartoon avatar for the bots' profile picture and simply changed the skin color. Using a method that has been frequently employed to measure discrimination in hiring, I also gave the bots characteristically white or characteristically black first and last names. Here's an example of ""Greg,"" a white bot:    ""Greg"", the white bot used in the author's study. (Screen shot from Twitter by Kevin Munger/TMC)  The picture at the start of this post is a screenshot of ""Rasheed,"" a black bot, in action. To make the bots look more like real people, I followed some celebrities/news outlets and sent a number of harmless tweets (""Strawberry season is in full swing, and I'm loving it""). I also varied the number of followers the bots had, to test the theory that ""higher status"" people are more effective at changing others' behavior. To do this, I bought followers for half of the bots -- 500 followers, to be specific -- and gave the remaining bots only two followers each (see screenshot above). This represents a large status difference: a Twitter user with two followers is unlikely to be taken seriously, while 500 followers is a substantial number. Overall, I had four types of bots: High Follower/White; Low Follower/White; High Follower/Black; and Low Follower/Black. My prediction was that messages from the different types of bots would function differently. I thought High Follower/White bots would have the largest effect, while Low Follower/Black bots would have only a minimal effect. I expected the white bots to be more effective than the black bots because all of my subjects were themselves white, and there is evidence that messages about social norms from the ""in-group"" are more effective than messages from the ""out-group."" Race does not always define in-group/out-group status, but because these subjects were engaged in racist harassment, I thought that this was the most relevant group identity. The primary behavior I hoped to change with my intervention was the subjects' use of racist slurs. I tracked each subject's Twitter use for two months and calculated the change in the use of a particular racial slur. Only one of the four types of bots caused a significant reduction in the subjects' rate of tweeting slurs: the white bots with 500 followers. The graph below shows that this type of bot caused each subject to tweet the slur 0.3 fewer times per day in the week after being sanctioned.    Change in average daily slur use in the week following online sanctioning (Data and Figure: Kevin Munger)  Roughly 35 percent of subjects provided some personal information on their profile. The effects of my messages on this subset -- that is, non anonymous Twitter users -- were strikingly different. Tweets from white bots with 500 followers did not cause a significant change in these users' behavior, but tweets from black bots with few followers (the type of bots that I thought would have a minimal effect) actually caused an increase in the use of racist slurs. The messages were identical, but the results varied dramatically based on the racial identity and status of the bot and the degree of anonymity of the subject. Overall, I found that it is possible to cause people to use less harassing language. This change seems to be most likely when both individuals share a social identity. Unsurprisingly, high status people are also more likely to cause a change. Many people are already engaged in sanctioning bad behavior online, but they sometimes do so in a way that can backfire. If people call out bad behavior in a way that emphasizes the social distance between themselves and the person they're calling out, my research suggests that the sanctioning is less likely to be effective. Physical distance, anonymity and partisan bubbles online can lead to extremely nasty behavior, but if we remember that there's a real person behind every online encounter and emphasize what we have in common rather than what divides us, we might be able to make the Internet a better place.

Clary/Agence France-Press via Getty Images)  Donald Trump's largely unexpected path from a wealthy businessman on a reality television show to the president-elect of the United States has left many Americans scratching their heads. But is this without precedent? Looking to the global stage, one comparison seems apt: Trump is America's Silvio Berlusconi. Yes, that Berlusconi. The Italian business magnate who spearheaded a widely mocked but remarkably successful political movement, eventually serving as prime minister for nine years over four stints -- the longest of any postwar Italian leader -- before becoming embroiled in scandals involving corruption, women and, of course, ""bunga bunga."" Out of office since 2011 and still facing court cases, even Berlusconi thinks the Trump comparison is fitting, telling the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that the parallels are ""obvious."" In fact, the comparison didn't first appear in this election cycle. Paul Ginsborg, chair of contemporary European history at the University of Florence and an expert on Italy's Berlusconi era, had suggested more than 10 years ago that there was something Trump-ish about Berlusconi. Consider the following passage from his 2005 biography of the then-prime minister, ""Silvio Berlusconi: Television, Power and Patrimony."" ""Berlusconi is certainly a consummate salesman, and a very well-prepared one. But he is also, and probably above all, a buyer of commodities and services, of villas and footballers, of television channels and entertainers, of supermarkets and publishing houses, and much else besides. His is a patrimonial and acquisitive instinct, fired by the production and the use of wealth, as well as the need for his name and face to be omnipresent. In this respect, though not in others, he can be compared to a figure like Donald Trump, who used to boast that he had the largest living room in New York and the city's most spectacular view."" Speaking on the phone from his home in Italy this week, Ginsborg said that with the benefit of hindsight, he's now struck by how both men have used their patrimony to gain political power -- insisting that political power is a commodity to be bought or sold. ""Once having enriched themselves to a very considerable extent, they then wanted to use that patrimony, part of that wealth, to enter politics,"" Ginsborg said. An additional motivation for both, he suggested, was ""the need to defend themselves through changing the hands of power within democracy and making American democracy and Italian democracy autocratic."" But Ginsborg was also keen to stress the differences between the two. Berlusconi's rise was made possible by his ""extraordinary control over the media,"" he said -- a clear contrast to Trump's often adversarial role with the press. Particularly important was the fact that the Italian owned three commercial television channels (Rete 4, Italia Uno and Canale 5), which helped him with the ""constant conditioning"" of his core supporters: housewives older than 50 and small-business owners. Berlusconi was also helped by a complicated political situation in Italy during his rise, Ginsborg noted, and he had the support of organized criminal groups in the south that ""left their instructions as to how people should vote."" Perhaps even more important are the personal differences between Trump and Berlusconi, Ginsborg said. ""I think there's sort of a pall of theatricality that strikes one enormously,"" he said. ""Big-man Trump, you know. Very powerful, physical presence, sort of power play, in many ways. Berlusconi is a little man, and no real discourse of violence at all."" That physicality is hard to miss: Berlusconi is 5-foot-5, compared with Trump's claimed 6-foot-3. ""He's the little seducer who crooned his way on the cruise ships early in his career,"" Ginsborg said, referring to the young Berlusconi's time as a singer. And where Trump is best understood as a creature of the right and perhaps even the far right, Berlusconi was a neo-liberal who had a romantic conception of the power of the individual. ""He adored Mrs. Thatcher,"" Ginsborg said, referring to the late British leader. Ginsborg was a vocal critic of Berlusconi during his years in power, and he credits an ""unspoken coalition"" of civil society and veterans in Italy's institutions with thwarting Berlusconi's worst impulses, especially after his election in 2008, when he had a majority in both houses. Ginsborg says Italy's judges and magistrates, in particular, deserve praise for their role. But in large part, Berlusconi's fall from grace was enabled by something familiar: He simply couldn't deliver on his promises. ""His program was based upon the idea of economic resurgence,"" Ginsborg said. The Italian premier suggested that he could use his business acumen to bring Italy a million new jobs. ""By the end of it, he came nowhere near that number,"" Ginsborg said. Even a self-made billionaire couldn't overcome the economic stagnation that had gripped Italy for years. Ginsborg struggled to say anything positive about the Berlusconi years. ""It showed the weaknesses of the Italian democracy,"" he said. ""'It showed how easy it was in modern democracies for a man who had swiftly accumulated  a considerable patrimony  then to buy his way into political power."" Even so, in the grand scheme of things, Ginsborg suggested that Berlusconi won't be remembered much in Italy. ""It's surprising how quickly the memory of his years in power has faded,"" he said. While Berlusconi has lingering support (his party, Forza Italia, polls at about 14 percent), the discourse in Italy is now shaped more by new anti-immigrant forces such as the Northern League, echoing the rise of the U.K. Independence Party in Britain and the National Front in France. And Ginsborg shook off the suggestion from some online that Trump could be closer to a Benito Mussolini than a Berlusconi. ""That's really weird,"" he said, arguing that the fascist leader's state-first policies didn't fit with either Trump or Berlusconi. ""Mussolini feels a very long way away from those two,"" he said. Still, the similarities between Trump and Berlusconi worry Ginsborg. ""The difference in scale in the two cases amounts to a difference in quality,"" he said, noting that Berlusconi had no claim to be the leader of the free world -- or really anything other than Italy itself. ""So extraordinarily important is the victory of Trump on the world scale that, in comparison, Berlusconi seems to be a bit player.""

Here’s how Democrats can take back politics.	"           Since Donald Trump won the White House without winning the popular vote, cries have risen that the electoral college should be abolished. Millions have signed an online petition urging electors to choose Hillary Clinton despite their states' vote for Trump. This is a wrongheaded path for dissent. The electoral college shouldn't be abolished. It enshrines an important principle -- protection of the rights of a minority -- in our Constitution. A popular majority unhappy with the presidential results should make its weight felt not by taking to the streets but by taking back electoral politics -- relearning what it means to win elections for state legislatures, governorships and Congress. It's worth understanding the origins of the electoral college to see how it came to enshrine this principle in our political institutions. When delegates to the Constitutional Convention assembled in Philadelphia in 1787, they began with an elaborate debate on whether the government founded in 1776 had grounded its authority in the people as a whole or in the power of 13 independent state governments. The question was whether the new government had arisen to embrace a single national people or had been erected as merely a treaty among 13 nations, with distinguishable identities and cultures.     President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it's ""healthy"" for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. ""When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,"" Obama said. (The Washington Post)   The men who met and argued in Philadelphia were not able to resolve the question. They compromised. They determined that one chamber of Congress (the House of Representatives) would be grounded in the people as a whole, while the second (the Senate) would rest on the authority of the state governments. The House would consist of delegations from each state sized in proportion to the population. The Senate, in contrast, would provide equal representation to each state -- two delegates each, regardless of population. This design, which arose from the need to compromise, was also an expression of principle: the importance of protecting minority interests from being trampled by the majority. The electoral college reflects the same desire. It was organized to include as its number of electors the combination of the number of senators and members of the House. It, too, has the protection of a minority interest built into its structure. Originally, the electoral college protected the interests of the smaller Northeastern states: Now the protection of minority interest works in favor of the less populous states of the nation's midsection. For the first half of the 20th century, this interest worked in favor of the Southern states and served as a roadblock to civil rights protections for African Americans. But as with most of our political institutions, the fact that they have sometimes been used against the cause of justice does not mean that they might not at another moment be used for that cause. Democracies that aspire to embodying not only popular sovereignty but also justice must have structures for protecting minority interests. Anyone who cares to defend the interests of minorities should pause before calling for the abolition of the electoral college. But what about the notion, now spreading widely, that the electoral college was intended to dilute African American influence? This argument doesn't get the history right. Southern states demanded popular representation, and wanted to include enslaved people in the census count that would determine the size of their congressional delegation, in order to maximize their political power. That's what gave us the House (albeit with a decision to count each enslaved person as three-fifths of a person). This left the small Northern states feeling threatened, so they wanted equality among the states. That gave us the Senate. The Northern states were motivated by a desire to dilute Southern power, not to minimize African American influence, which in 1787 was nil. The irony is that the only reason California has as many electoral votes as it does now is because Southern states sought to gain political advantage from their population of enslaved people. While the electoral college is weighted to overemphasize the voice of less populous states, popular majorities have many other avenues for pursuing power -- a fact that Republicans have used to their advantage and that Democrats have too often ignored. Over the past 15 years, and the past eight especially, the Republican Party has obliterated the Democratic Party at the state level: in state legislatures, governorships and Congress. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Republicans will now hold 33 governorships, 31 secretaries of state, 69 of 99 legislative majorities and, of course, majorities in both houses of Congress.  This is not an accident. The Republican Party has been working hard and was buoyed by the tea party revolt, a revolution that took not to the streets but to electoral politics. Remember those crazy town halls about the health-care law in the summer of 2009? Tea partyers turned out in droves when members of Congress came home to see their constituents. Anyone who looked likely to be supporting the health-care legislation was treated to an especially unpleasant dose of constituent dissent. That was the beginning of the tea party drive to turn Democrats and moderate Republicans out of office and resulted in the evisceration of the Democrats' congressional majority in 2010. By contrast, since Occupy Wall Street in 2011, Democrats and the left have devoted the greater part of their political energies to street protests, petition drives and efforts to shame public officials into changing their stances on particular issues. Activists seem to have forgotten that real levers of power exist to be grasped in all the small elections that take place all over the country year after year. Democrats are already wringing their hands over the difficulty of making inroads in Congress in 2018, and it's true that they may not get where they want by then. But then again, when Barack Obama swept in a Democratic Congress in 2008, no one expected that all would be lost by 2010.  If Democrats want to see things move in a different direction, all they need is their own blue tea party movement. But this requires capturing the energy in the streets and redirecting it to the nuts-and-bolts work of winning elections at the state level. That will be the only effective basis for rebuilding power and momentum at the federal level as well. But it surely doesn't have to take a generation. That's what we've learned from the incredible distance we've traveled between 2008 and the present.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)   With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Barack Obama has deluded himself with the misguided hope that Donald Trump will not even try to follow through on many of his biggest campaign promises. He is consoling himself with the hope that, if he does, the new president will be measured, self-restrained and respectful of custom. That he will ""study ... deeply"" and ""look at the facts."" That logic and reason, not emotion or ideology, will drive him above all else. The lame-duck president has convinced himself that Republicans probably won't go through with repealing Obamacare when they realize just how hard it will be. Ditto with the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. ""Reality has a way of asserting itself,"" Obama reasoned. ""I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other presidents might be arriving with. I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately he's pragmatic in that way."" -- Is Obama really that naive? Probably not. He is just wallowing in a state of denial and has resorted to wishful thinking as a coping mechanism. It is a natural psychological condition that afflicts most human beings grieving a major loss, at least for a time. Presidents are not immune. For a little over an hour yesterday afternoon, Americans saw a 55-year-old who has not come to grips with just how big a blow Trump's victory is to his legacy and his party. He rationalized. He downplayed. He justified. He minimized. With all the trappings of the presidency still his, it hasn't fully sunk in yet. And it might not for 66 more days, when Trump gets sworn in on the West Front of the Capitol -- and Obama begins living as a civilian in Kalorama. -- Trying to project reassurance, circumspection and a sense of continuity, Obama came across at times as both nonchalant and almost ambivalent about the results. He expressed confidence in how hard it is to move the levers of power. ""The federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat. It's an ocean liner,"" he said. But with the stroke of a pen Trump could instantly undo much of what Obama has pushed with through executive action during the second term. And the new president will have Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. -- Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, in her 1969 book ""On Death and Dying,"" identified the five stages of grief as denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Obama is clearly still in stage one.     Obama waves as he leaves the White House, bound for Europe. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)   -- Other Democrats have already progressed further along in their recovery over the past seven days. The protesters chanting ""not my president"" in the streets every night are angry (stage two). The liberals who won't stop talking about how Hillary Clinton won the popular vote are in the bargaining phase (stage three). Many more went right into depression (stage four), almost to the point of being inconsolably paralyzed by it. A bunch of Democratic groups and lobbying firms scheduled parties around Washington this week, assuming folks would be in a mood to celebrate. But several events that took place last night were sparsely attended, since so many movers and shakers just want to sit in their basements and drink alone. Meanwhile, the intensifying debate over who should chair the Democratic National Committee has forced acceptance (stage five) in some quarters. -- The Republican establishment already had to work through this grieving process vis-a-vis Trump in the spring. Pretty much everyone in the GOP reached the acceptance phase by Election Day.    Obama speaks. (Andrew Harnik/AP)   -- Obama is a textbook case of denial right now. The president allowed himself to hear what he wanted to hear during his 90-minute sit-down with Trump last Thursday. His successor somehow managed to both reassure and flatter him. Perhaps Trump privately told him that he was not serious about many of his priorities and stressed that they are merely opening bids in a negotiation. It is also possible that the same confirmation bias that caused so many in the mainstream media to tune out all the signals that Trump was on the verge of pulling off the biggest political upset since at least ""Dewey defeats Truman"" has now apparently convinced Obama that his successor is not actually about to massively roll back many of his proudest achievements, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. (Trump may not be ideological, but his administration will be full of committed movement conservatives who are focused on systematically unwinding the regulatory state that Obama built up. And Trump's advisers are already sketching out plans to use the budget reconciliation process to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act.) Taking questions from reporters for the first time since the election, before boarding Air Force One for his flight to Athens, Greece, Obama declared that he will reassure U.S. allies that Trump never actually believed what he said about NATO. Never mind that, in the hours before he said this, the president-elect was on the telephone with Vladimir Putin -- the single biggest threat to the transatlantic alliance -- pledging to improve ""unsatisfactory"" relations and agreeing that their aides will set up a face-to-face meeting.    -- What a difference a few days makes. Last week, making his closing argument against Trump, Obama told audiences: ""Who you are [and] what you are does not change once you become president. It magnifies who you are. You have more power ... so folks will enable you to be more of who you are. It will shine a spotlight on who you are."" Yesterday, he took the opposite view: ""This office has a way of waking you up. My advice to the president-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that."" ""Of course I've got concerns,"" Obama allowed later, when another journalist asked basically the same question that had already been asked three times. ""There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them."" But he pointedly declined to say whether he still believes Trump is unqualified to be president. In fact, when pressed, Obama praised his ""gregarious"" successor whom -- behind the same podium in the same briefing room -- he once called ""a carnival barker.""    Trump checks out Paul Ryan's balcony at the Capitol last week. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty)   -- The outgoing president spoke as if a guy who channeled Jean-Batiste Colbert on the campaign trail will become an Adam Smith-like acolyte of open markets once he gets briefed on how ""a global supply chain"" actually works. ""When it comes to trade, I think when you're governing, it will become increasingly apparent that ... it's not as simple as it might have seemed,"" Obama said. On the Iran deal, he explained: ""My suspicion is, is that when the president-elect comes in, and he's consulting with his Republican colleagues on the Hill, that they will look at the facts.... When you're not responsible for it, I think you can call it a terrible deal. When you are responsible for the deal and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, you're more likely to look at the facts. That is going to be true in other circumstances. For example, the Paris agreement."" ""Do I think that the new administration will make some changes? Absolutely,"" he continued. ""But these international agreements, the tradition has been that you carry them forward across administrations, particularly if, once you actually examine them, it turns out that they're doing good for us and binding other countries into behavior that will help us."" As Politico's Edward-Isaac Dovere notes, ""This is precisely the kind of argument that Republicans in Congress have felt so patronized by over the last eight years, and one that is completely out of whack with the shake to the system delivered by Trump's campaign, which racked up few political debts to anyone as he claimed victory.""    President Obama boards Marine One on the South Lawn last night. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)   -- Many thought leaders on the left are upset about the president's demeanor, as well. In his column, Dana Milbank rips Obama for ""cool detachment"" and ""happy talk"": ""Why is this man smiling? ... Obama's post-election remarks seemed utterly at odds with the national mood. Half the country is exultant because Trump has promised to undo everything Obama has done over the past eight years. The other half of the country is alarmed that a new age of bigotry and inwardness has seized the country. ... This has been Obama's pattern. At times when passion is called for, he's cerebral and philosophical and taking the long view -- so long that it frustrates those living in the present."" -- Obama conveyed a similar message during two conference calls with supporters after the news conference. ""I've always said, progress doesn't follow a straight line. It zigs and zags, and sometimes it moves forward and sometimes it moves backwards or moves sideways,"" he said. ""So, as a consequence, I think it is fine for everybody to feel stressed, sad, discouraged for a while, but I'm giving you like a week and a half to get over it.... By next week and Thanksgiving ... you're going to have to be in a more positive place.... So don't mope.""     Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:    Rudy Giuliani speaks last night at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council in the Four Seasons in Washington. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)   -- Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani is the leading candidate for secretary of state, the Wall Street Journal says on A1. ""I will NOT be attorney general,"" Rudy said at an event last night. Trump aides have also considered former U.S. ambassador John Bolton as a contender, but the close relationship between Giuliani and Trump was a ""major consideration,"" per Damian Paletta. ""For Mr. Trump, it is a choice between a longtime friend and ally in New York, Mr. Giuliani, and a hawkish conservative diplomat, Mr. Bolton, who called last year for the U.S. to bomb Iran. A final decision could be several weeks away ... and other candidates could still emerge."" Personnel deliberations are likely to quicken today, when newly installed transition team chairman Mike Pence arrives in New York from Orlando, where he met last night with Republican governors.  The former New York mayor said last night that Trump will likely focus much of his early foreign policy strategy on destroying the Islamic State, setting aside more vexing problems in the Middle East and elsewhere to focus on the militant group. ""ISIS, short-term I believe, is the greatest danger and not because ISIS is in Iraq and in Syria, but because ISIS did something al-Qaeda never did -- ISIS was able to spread itself around the world,"" Giuliani said, speaking during a Monday evening appearance at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council gathering. He also signaled strong interest in potentially serving as Trump's secretary of state, going into ""great detail"" about how his foreign policy views overlap with those of the president-elect. (Paletta)    Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) talks with reporters as he arrives at Trump Tower yesterday. (Evan Vucci/AP)   -- Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is the leading choice to be defense secretary, Politico reports.

""The two men haven't seen eye to eye on everything: Sessions is a budget hawk who favors caps on defense spending, while Trump has called for an arms and troops buildup that could cost $55 billion or more per year."" ""Establishment Republican defense officials may still try to push back against a Sessions nomination as Pentagon chief,"" Politico adds. ""The main alternative is Stephen Hadley, one of George W. Bush's former national security advisers, who unlike many other Bush alums shrewdly refrained from criticizing Trump during the campaign. Other possibilities include Bill Clinton's hawkish CIA director, Jim Woolsey, who endorsed Trump in September, as well as former Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri and outgoing Sen.

""Of the group, Trump knows Bossie the best. But party insiders see Bossie setting his sights higher -- perhaps the role of White House political director, a behind-the-scenes post with a direct line to Trump, and a position where he could be delivering orders to the next RNC chair,"" Politico's Shane Goldmacher and Kyle Cheney report. ""A wild-card pick that members are discussing among themselves could be [Kellyanne] Conway -- a constant presence on television who Trump trusts fully and who could continue to operate her polling business while running the party, something she would have to give up if she joined the administration."" Other names being circulated include Pence adviser Nick Ayers, South Carolina GOP chairman Matt Moore, Virginia GOP chairman John Whitbeck and Mississippi GOP chairman Joe Nosef.  -- The 2018 campaign has begun: GOP Rep.

It doesn't mean everybody always did everything exactly the way it's supposed to -- because we got 2 million people working in the federal government ... and so we had to just try to institutionalize this as much as we could. And that takes a lot of work.""    SEC chair Mary Jo White testifies before the Senate Banking Committee. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)   TRUMP'S WASHINGTON: -- SEC Chairman Mary Jo White announced that she will step down in January, leaving two years before the end of her term and clearing the way for Trump to massively reshape the way Wall Street is regulated. From Renae Merle: ""White was widely expected to step down no matter who won the election to allow the next president to appoint their own chair. Trump has already indicated he would usher in a period of deregulation, including dismantling ... the Dodd-Frank Act. He appointed Paul Atkins, an industry veteran, who has called Dodd-Frank a 'calamity,' to lead the agency's transition. ... Atkins served as an SEC commissioner for six years during the President George W. Bush administration. ... In addition to replacing White, Trump will be able to fill two openings on the five-member commission. Trump could also choose to ignore the more than 20-year-old tradition of allowing the opposing political party to pick its own representative on the commission, one industry official said, further bolstering his influence over the agency. ... Also, Thomas Curry, the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, another important Wall Street regulator, has less than six months on his term."" -- Mike Pence is going to court to argue for email secrecy. The Indianapolis Star's Fatima Hussein reports on the irony: ""Now that the presidential campaign and most of the furor over Hillary Clinton's email scandal are behind us, the Pence administration is going to court to argue for its own brand of email secrecy. The administration is fighting to conceal the contents of an email sent to Gov. Mike Pence by a political ally. That email is being sought by a prominent Democratic labor lawyer who says he wants to expose waste in the Republican administration. But legal experts fear the stakes may be much higher than mere politics because the decision could remove a judicial branch check on executive power and limit a citizen's right to know what the government is doing and how it spends taxpayer dollars. 'It comes down to this -- the court is giving up its ability to check another branch of government, and that should worry people,' said Gerry Lanosga, an Indiana University media professor specializing in public records law."" -- When Trump first launched his presidential campaign in 2015, he told Chris Christie he ""didn't expect to make it past October"" - at which point he'd throw his support behind the New Jersey governor, CNN's Thomas Lake, Jodi Enda, and Susan Baer report in an excerpt from their forthcoming book, ""Unprecedented,"" which covers the 2016 race. ""I think they always had an understanding that the first one out would probably endorse the other,"" a Christie adviser said.

(David Mareuil/AFP/Getty Images)   THE WORLD REACTS TO TRUMP: -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is paying a visit to Trump in New York on Thursday, becoming one of the first world leaders to meet with the next president-elect. Abe said he will use the meeting to ""build a trusting relationship"" with Trump, and on that front, they reportedly have plenty in common. From Anna Fifield in Tokyo: ""For one, Trump sets a tone that Abe, a strong nationalist in his own right, will be comfortable with ... Trump promised to 'make America great again,' while Abe is set on turning Japan back into a 'beautiful country.' For another, they both have a bromance going on with Vladimir Putin, the unequivocally nationalist Russian leader whom Trump has praised and whom Abe will welcome to Japan next month."" ""The point of this meeting is to develop trust and chemistry on a personal level, to reassure people in both countries that everything is fine,"" said Michael Green, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has strong ties to Abe's team. -- Right-wing Israeli leaders are pushing assertive new legislation to legalize Jewish settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land, seizing on the timing of Trump's election to force passage of the controversial law. (William Booth and Ruth Eglash)    Steve Bannon exits an elevator in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty)   BANNON BLOWBACK: -- Where does Breitbart end and Bannon's role in the Trump White House begin? Neither camp has spelled out the details of their future relationship, Paul Farhi writes. ""But even if Bannon and the website sever all ties, they will face an unusual, and awkward, situation: Bannon would be the former executive of a media organization that openly supported his political patron who will serve the president in a senior capacity while his media organization continues to cover him and his new boss."" Adding yet another layer of entanglement: one of Breitbart's primary financial backers is billionaire hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, whose daughter, Rebekah, is part of Trump's presidential transition team. ""They were the house organ for Trump and will obviously remain so,"" said Ben Shapiro, former Breitbart editor at large.  Trump officials quickly pushed back on criticism, with spokesman Jason Miller saying Bannon has done a ""fantastic job"" since joining Trump's inner circle. ""If you've seen the president-elect since the election, he's taken a very measured tone,"" Miller said on CNN's ""New Day."" Former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised Bannon as a ""brilliant tactician"" and the ""general of this campaign"": Asked whether Bannon should explain his connections to the alt-right movement, Conway said: ""I'm personally offended that you think I would manage a campaign where that would be one of the going philosophies. It was not -- 56 million-plus Americans or so saw something else.""  -- Congressional Republicans scrambled to avoid criticizing Trump's future senior aide before the new administration begins. From Karoun Demirjian: ""The former head of Breitbart news, Bannon has published stories taking aim at Muslims, Jews, women and African Americans, as well as making his own allegedly anti-Semitic statements. But Republicans seem unwilling to judge Bannon on that track record -- or even accept that he bears responsibility for the more incendiary headlines ...""  ""Did he write it? Give me something that he wrote,"" said Rep. Dave Brat. ""I hear a lot of innuendo of this, but I haven't seen it."" House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy also suggested the reported information could be untrue: ""I've seen things said about me that I know are not true, but because they're on the Internet, 'they must be true,' "" McCarthy said.  Others said they didn't expect the racist and sexist headlines approved under Bannon to have any bearing on his future role as a White House adviser. ""Of course I'd have serious problems with anti-Semitic statements coming out of the White House, but I don't expect that,"" said Rep. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. Rather, he said Bannon's appointment ""symbolizes tremendous loyalty"" and that Trump understands a system of ""checks and balances is appropriate even within his own shop."" House Speaker Paul Ryan sought to assuage fears about Trump's election in a Wisconsin radio interview, saying ""there is a lot of hysteria and hyperbole."" ""I would tell people to just relax -- things are going to be fine,"" he said. (Viebeck, Markon, DeYoung) -- Many Republican lawmakers claimed they ""don't know"" Bannon, feigning ignorance. From Buzzfeed's Tarini Parti: Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz said he'll continue to be a ""champion for religious freedom,"" but he doesn't have ""the bandwidth"" to go through what every staffer he hires has said in the past. Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers praised Priebus' appointment as evidence Trump has ""done a good job of an inclusive pick so far.""  Pressed on Bannon, Stivers said: ""I don't know a lot about Steve Bannon, so I don't care to be an expert on him."" -- HOW WILL HE HELP SHAPE A TRUMP WHITE HOUSE? ""If Bannon's past is prologue, he will not care about criticism,"" Dave Weigel writes. ""Under his leadership, Breitbart became an anti-'globalist' news site clearly aligned with the European far right. Under the site's founder, the late Andrew Breitbart, accusations of 'racism' were dismissed as 'cultural Marxism.' The attacks lobbed at Bannon, one plumbing [a] 2007 divorce record for evidence of anti-Semitism, resemble the ones that failed to stop Trump's rise. There is even talk of more Breitbart reporters joining Bannon at the White House, in roles that do not require Senate confirmation."" ""Bannon will answer directly to Trump and focus on the big picture, and not get lost in the weeds,"" white nationalist thinker Richard Spencer wrote last night on Twitter. ""Bannon is not a 'chief of staff,' which requires a 'golden retriever' personality. He'll be freed up to chart Trump's macro trajectory."" -- In an interview with the New York Times, Bannon rejected what he called ""ethno-nationalist"" tendencies of some in the movement, saying he believes his enemies are misstating his views and the views of many Trump supporters: ""These people are patriots,"" he said. ""They love their country. They just want their country taken care of. ... It's not that some people on the margins, as in any movement, aren't bad guys -- racists, anti-Semites. But that's irrelevant.""  -- The over-the-top praise for Priebus is a sign of how far the media has lowered the bar for Trump, Vox's Matthew Yglesias argues. ""Trump's elevation to the presidency has people worried about everything from the collapse of America's democratic institutions to the spectacle of violence in the streets. But it's worth recalling that any presidency also features a range of more or less banal crises in which the fate of the nation and the world is nonetheless at stake. Can Trump really tear up the nuclear agreement with Iran without completely destablizing the Persian Gulf, for example? I'm not sure, I'm sure that Trump is not sure, and I'm frankly skeptical that Priebus is the right person to figure it out. It's great that Trump has decided to make the premier digital popularizer of white nationalism the second most important person in his White House rather than the first. But the presidency is still a really big job that Trump has no relevant experience for. More to the point, the country needs people who can help Trump actually run the government."" -- Analysis: Less than a week into Trump's transition, and The New Yorker's John Cassidy argues that he has already pulled a ""bait-and-switch"" from rhetoric espoused during his populist campaign: ""To sum up, this is the prospect we are facing. A populist but semi-engaged President who is less interested in governing than in soaking up adulation at big rallies. (He might hold more of them even though the campaign is over...). Meanwhile, his cronies and members of the permanent establishment make many of the actual decisions, which will largely benefit the already rich, including the ruling family. Debt mushrooms as El Presidente approves prestige construction projects but not the taxes needed to pay for them. And skilled propagandists, like Bannon, whip up nationalist fervor to keep the masses diverted from what is really going on. We've seen this movie before, many times. But not here in the United States.""    Trump protesters walk through downtown Santa Ana, Calif.

(LA Times) -- A social studies instructor who teaches at a school for recent immigrants shared some of the heartbreaking letters he received from students after Trump's victory in a Post op-ed. ""I'm worried that this country is not going to be any better than my country,"" said one female student from Afghanistan. ""Nobody listens to women in my country, and now the president will do the same here?"" Said another student from El Salvador: ""All my dreams can fall down because of a decision that people made last night. I don't understand how a person who says bad things, that hurt people, is the head of a country ... I have faced many troubles in order to come here. I don't know how but I have to continue."" -- Trump's proposed deportation plans could have potentially severe consequences for the U.S. economy, according to a newly-published National Bureau of Economic Research analysis, which offers the first detailed estimates of how a mass deportation policy would affect specific industries. From Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund: ""Unsurprisingly, the greatest number of undocumented workers -- 1.3 million -- were employed in leisure and hospitality, followed by the construction sector, which employed 1.1 million. These two sectors were followed by professional and business services, which ... included nearly 1 million undocumented workers. If all undocumented workers were immediately removed from the country, [researchers] forecast a decline of 9 percent in agricultural production and declines of 8 percent in construction and leisure and hospitality over the long term."" And relative to the overall economy, the effect would be a decline in manufacturing output of $74 billion over the long term.    Hundreds of Maryland high school students march down Georgia Avenue after leaving their schools in peaceful protest. (Toni L.

Both men have said in the past week that action to repeal the Affordable Care Act, secure the southern U.S. border and cut taxes are among their shared priorities.

The goal was to see firsthand the place that perhaps more than any other has climate scientists worried about melting ice and rising sea levels.
