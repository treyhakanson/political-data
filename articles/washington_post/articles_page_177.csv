" What is a Christian? Now, hold on. The question isn't some roundabout attempt to use an opinion piece to promote or knock a particular faith. Rather, it spotlights a search of another kind.  ""What is a Christian?"" grows out of an article this week by The Post's Julie Zauzmer, which described jubilation among some Christians over Donald Trump's victory -- a win supported by more than 80 percent of white evangelicals.  ""It really makes you feel great to be a Christian,"" one person told The Post. ""I think Christians took a big stand this time and said we're going to stand up for our faith,"" said a second. Referring to Trump, a third said, ""I feel like we actually have an advocate now in the White House."" Those attitudes are reflected in a Pew Research Center analysis of exit poll results, which show that high numbers of white, born-again evangelical Christians, as well as a majority of Catholics, went for Trump.  That notwithstanding, CNN exit polls also showed that 59 percent of nonwhite evangelical Protestants, 45 percent of Catholics and 71 percent of Jewish voters backed Hillary Clinton. Their embrace of Trump isn't, however, what prompts the ""What is a Christian?"" question.  It is raised because of ""A Declaration by American Evangelicals Concerning Donald Trump,"" a statement posted on change.org that has been signed by more than 22,000 evangelical leaders and their supporters.  These are a collection of Christians of African and European descent, Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans representing a wide range of denominations and churches -- and they hold a decidedly different view.   Trump, they declare, ""fueled white American nationalism with xenophobic appeals and religious intolerance at the expense of gospel values [and] democratic principles."" They charge him with mocking women and the sanctity of marriage vows, disregarding facts, worshiping ""wealth and shameful materialism,"" and taking an already-weakened ""culture of civility to nearly unprecedented"" depths with his vulgarity and ugly personal attacks. They describe Trump's campaign as the most ""extreme version of a history of racialized politics'' that has ever been pursued, also noting with disdain the silence of white evangelicals in the face of such behavior. Their silence throughout that history, those Christian leaders declared, ""set the environment for what we see now."" Hence the conundrum: A racially diverse community of evangelical Christian denominations and their supporters puts down Trump, beloved by a majority of white evangelical Christians, as ""morally unacceptable."" What is a Christian? What does it mean to be one? These are haunting questions when tied to race. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. grappled with it more than 50 years ago. King wrote in his famous 1963 ""Letter From Birmingham Jail"" that when he was ""catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, Ala.,"" he felt the white church would support him. Instead, he discovered some white ministers were outright opponents; others were ""more cautious than courageous and . . . [they] remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained glass windows.""  King expressed disappointment at seeing white church leaders, in the midst of blatant racial and economic injustices, ""stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities."" He spoke of traveling on ""sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings"" and looking ""at the South's beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward."" ""Over and over I have found myself asking: 'What kind of people worship here? Who is their God?' ""  ""Where were their voices,"" King asked, when the lips of their governors dripped with words of bigotry and hatred? ""Where were their voices of support?""  They were silent.  King, first and foremost a Christian minister and son of a pastor, saw segregation as morally wrong and sinful. Why didn't his white co-religionists in the South see segregation statutes the same way?  In truth, some of the white Christians who professed belief in the authority of the Scriptures and the ""good news"" of the gospel were the backbone of racial segregation. They elected and reelected to public office some of the country's most sexist, racist and religious bigots.  So it was then.  And now? Since beginning my faith journey at age 12 several decades ago, I have been stumbling, slipping and falling short of the glory of God. So who am I to judge?  Yet, looking back at the election night outcome, a different, haunting question recurs: What is a Christian?  Read more from Colbert King's archive.

The Manhattan federal court jury returned its verdict against Efrain Campo, 30, and his cousin Francisco Flores, 31, after less than a day of deliberations. The nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores were charged with conspiring last year to import more than 1,700 pounds of cocaine into the United States. Lawyers for Campo and Flores argued no drugs traded hands and the men never intended to deliver any. They blamed a flawed Drug Enforcement Administration-led probe that relied on a longtime informant who was using and dealing cocaine as he helped build the case.  ""He was slime,"" juror Robert Lewis, a 69-year-old architect from Westchester County, said of the informant, Jose Santos-Pena. A defense lawyer told the jury on Thursday in closing arguments that the first lady's nephews should be acquitted because a U.S. sting operation was so deeply flawed that prosecutors had to take the rare step of notifying Santos-Pena, the star witness, they were ripping up his cooperation deal because of his lies.  ""He lied in your face!"" attorney David Rody told the jurors. ""You saw a rare thing, a government cooperator get ripped up in court."" Rody said the testimony by the informant was crucial to the government's case against Flores and Campo. And he said it explains why the government didn't cut ties with him after learning in April that he had been dealing drugs for the last four years even as he was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to work as an informant for the DEA and others. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty said the defendants would not be sentenced before March, though no date was set. Defense attorneys requested time to challenge the conviction. Rody, representing Flores, declined to comment after the verdict. Attorney Randall Jackson, representing Campos, said outside court that his client was ""obviously disappointed.""  ""We're going to see what our next steps are,"" he said. Prosecutors had urged jurors to look at other evidence in the case including statements the defendants made to federal agents and recordings of meetings. Lewis said jurors did just that, relying on transcripts of conversations involving the defendants and text messages to convict.  ""Nobody was in love with the witnesses,"" Lewis said. ""We clearly had some bad guys."" Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan Quigley said the defendants ""thought they were above the law.""  ""They thought they could operate with impunity in Venezuela because of who they were and who they were related to,"" Quigley said in a closing argument Thursday. ""They thought they could easily make tons of money sending drugs out of the country because, as defendant Flores said, the DEA is not here and the Americans don't come in here. But they were wrong."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

An annex to the U.S. resolution calling for an arms embargo and new sanctions, obtained Friday by The Associated Press, would slap travel bans and freeze the assets of rebel leader Riek Machar, Gen. Paul Malong and minister Michael Makuei Lueth if approved by the U.N. Security Council. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power urged the council on Thursday to authorize the arms embargo and new sanctions to curb violence that could lead to mass atrocities. But Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Petr Iliichev on Thursday called the U.S. draft resolution premature and irresponsible. He added Friday that Russia feels ""very strongly"" that targeting leaders is ill-advised because it would negatively affect ""the small progress that we have achieved"" trying to restore peace. He wouldn't say, however, if Moscow would cast a veto. Power said an arms embargo can't prevent weapons getting into the conflict-wracked country, but it would be ""an important step toward curbing the ongoing violence perpetrated by government and opposition forces against civilians."" She told the council the people targeted would be those most responsible for preventing peace. There were high hopes that South Sudan would have peace and stability after its independence from neighboring Sudan in 2011. But the country plunged into ethnic violence in 2013 when forces loyal to President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, started battling those loyal to Machar, his former vice president who is a Nuer. A peace deal signed in August 2015 has not stopped the fighting. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, more than 2 million are displaced, and U.N. envoy Ellen Margrethe Loj told the council Thursday the country faces a ""dire humanitarian situation,"" with 4.8 million people estimated to be ""severely food insecure."" According to the annex, Machar's opposition faction ""declared war on the South Sudanese government and called for armed resistance"" after a wave of violence in the capital, Juba, led him to flee the country. It said ""forces allied with Machar have raided villages and abducted civilians and aid workers."" As chief of staff of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the annex said Malong has expanded the conflict in South Sudan and broken the cease-fire deal.  ""As of early August 2016, Malong was responsible for efforts to kill opposition leader Riek Machar,"" it said, including knowingly violating Kiir's orders and launching tank, helicopter gunship and infantry assaults on July 11 against the rebel leader's residence and the rebels' ""Jebel"" base. He informed SPLA commanders ""that Machar was not to be taken alive,"" the annex said. Lueth, the minister of information and broadcasting, ""has repeatedly and consistently worked to obstruct and undermine the implementation of peace deals in South Sudan,"" the annex said. It cited Lueth's involvement in planning and coordinating an April 2014 attack on the U.N. compound in Bor, the Jonglei State capital, that killed three U.N. guards and 140 civilians, and his statement in September that the government would treat ""as invaders"" members of a new regional force if they deployed without government approval on numbers, nationalities and equipment. The Security Council has already imposed sanctions on six South Sudanese commanders -- three from the government and three from the opposition. Last year, a U.S. attempt to blacklist Malong and top rebel commander, Maj. Gen. Johnson Olony, failed because of opposition from Russia, China, Angola and Venezuela.

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/11/09/from-parks-and-recreation-to-hamilton-pop-culture-turned-from-promise-to-elegy/	From ‘Parks and Recreation’ to ‘Hamilton,’ pop culture turned from promise to elegy	"   Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope in ""Parks and Recreation."" (Tyler Golden/NBC)  As a critic, I've spent years writing about the kind of world that pop culture tells us is possible, especially when it comes to visions of social change. On Wednesday, all of the stories that felt as if they were preparing for something new, all of the cultural celebrations of sincerity and dedication and people whose dedication outweighed the more difficult parts of their character, feel less like portents and a lot more like elegies. Take ""Parks and Recreation,"" a show that buoyed me through any number of difficult moments in my own life but that feels painful to contemplate today. ""Parks and Recreation,"" which chronicled the adventures of small-town civil servant Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), traveled the same path with its main character that it sometimes seemed the country was traversing with Hillary Clinton. ""In the early years of 'Parks and Rec,' Leslie was less adept at her job, and almost nobody in the office except for Leslie really cared about what they were doing,"" said Dan Goor, a writer and executive producer for the show, when we spoke earlier this year about the differences between that series and ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine."" ""And that was an adjustment over time to where they were all super-competent and all, even though they had their own separate agendas, wanted to support Leslie's."" Watching this adjustment as it happened -- seeing Leslie turn from a foolish, vainglorious joke into a powerful, inspirational figure who embodied our best ideals of public service and who was loved precisely for the optimism and dedication that once made her a source of mockery -- was one of the more gratifying experiences of my career as a critic and my life as a television viewer. I won't pretend ""Parks and Recreation"" wasn't personal, for me and for the other women I know who live fully through our enthusiasms, who are incapable of ironic detachment and who have been fortunate enough to find partners who are fully invested in our success. But the show bolstered my optimism about politics, too, even if it regularly reminded viewers about the obstructionism, recalls and rejection that a person with Leslie's temperament would inevitably face in the course of pursuing a political career. The series' final season, and in particular its finale, gave in to a wave of gauzy optimism that betrayed the show's clear-eyed streak. The prospect of Leslie becoming governor of Indiana, and possibly president of the United States, was irresistible enough to cloud my critical judgment and the experience of observing politics. But in retrospect, the most fantastical elements of the series' time jump weren't new advancements in tablet technology or video calling: They were the dreams of a country in which a person like Leslie Knope's rise is inevitable, and that there's some sort of consensus that a commitment to public service is a good and admirable thing. Maybe the moment in ""Mad Men"" when Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) swaggers down an ad agency hallway smoking a cigarette, carrying a piece of Japanese erotic art and feeling for a moment like she owns the world, is as good as it gets.    Maybe now when we see Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) unleash her dragons or Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) draw Needle on ""Game of Thrones,"" we'll hear the scream of despair in dragonfire, in the scrape of steel. This is not to say that we should declare surrender, but merely that we should be cautious of happy endings, whether stated, implied or merely hoped for. ""Hamilton,"" Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical about the first Treasury secretary, with an ending that acknowledges the pain and waste of Alexander Hamilton's premature death while also expressing faith in the institutions that he helped to shape, has played a number of emotional roles in this election year. ""One Last Time,"" which chronicles George Washington's farewell address to the nation, expresses the gratitude that many Americans feel toward President Obama near the end of his time in office, as well as a sense that an extraordinary time is passing away from us. Eliza and Angelica Schuyler's arcs during the musical are a reminder that even in an era when a woman could describe herself ""a girl in a world in which / My only job is to marry rich,"" American women have found a way to use the energy and intellectual talents that our country has been inclined to waste. And when, during her acceptance speech at the Democratic convention this summer, Clinton invoked ""Hamilton"" in saying ""Let our legacy be about 'planting seeds in a garden you never get to see,' "" she offered herself as a fulfillment of that dream. Today, it's the next lines of the song that Clinton was quoting (""The World Was Wide Enough"") that have lingered with me: ""I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me / America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me."" ""Hamilton"" shares notes of caution and joy with ""Parks and Recreation,"" but the realities of history always put a check on Miranda's joyful reinterpretation of America's founding. I know I'll come back to Leslie Knope's fierce optimism someday. But it may be a long time before I can watch ""Parks and Recreation"" with the same lightness it gave me before. For now, and for a long time to come, it's quiet uptown."
5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/11/09/whither-conservatives-and-conservatism/	Whither conservatives and conservatism?	"   House Speaker Paul D. Ryan speaks during the 1st Congressional District Republican Party of Wisconsin's annual Fall Fest event held in Elkhorn, Wis., on Oct. 8. (Anthony Wahl/The Janesville Gazette via Associated Press)  President-elect Donald Trump memorably said, ""This is called the Republican Party, it's not called the Conservative Party."" That declaration is about to be put to the test. Trump captured the party and won the presidency not by running a staunch conservative ideological line but as an idiosyncratic populist. He is not only the president-elect but the head of the GOP. As Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) said in a press conference Wednesday morning, Republicans' unexpected GOP Senate majority and the better-than-expected result in the House are due largely to Trump's overperformance in battleground states. Like it or not, they are in his political debt. Ryan stressed the importance of bringing Republicans together. He lavishly praised Trump's victory, remarking that he spoke to both Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence by phone twice in the last 18 hours. Almost immediately he pivoted to extolling the potential to work ""hand in hand on a positive agenda."" But whose agenda? He plugged the House Republicans' ""Better Way,"" a collection of interesting policy ideas. Trump has never spoken about any of them. His agenda, if we judge from the campaign, is about protectionism, mass deportation and enormous tax cuts that add trillions to the debt. Ryan is a free-trader, immigration reformer and fiscal hawk. Likewise, their foreign policy visions could not be more different. Ryan is a mainstream conservative, a defender of international leadership and alliances and a steely-eyed critic of Vladimir Putin. Trump, judging from the campaign, is none of those things. Then again, maybe Trump believes in no specific policy, just ""making America great"" and getting praised for doing a good job. And that might be the good news. There are several possibilities for how the right proceeds: Trump could adopt Ryan's entire agenda; Ryan could agree to Trump's cockeyed populism; or they could work only on areas where they overlap (e.g. replacing Obamacare, infrastructure improvement). Ryan argues that the Republican Party isn't going to be remade; Trump wholeheartedly believes he has conquered the party. We will be looking for six things. First, do House and Senate Republicans do Trump's bidding or do they, as so many promised, act as a brake on crazy, unworkable and unpopular ideas? Trump's tax cut plan, for example, delivers huge benefits to the rich and vastly increases the debt. Do Republicans have the nerve to pass such a measure and then cope with the backlash over giveaways to the rich and with markets' reaction to a ballooning debt? Second, can Senate Democrats, in any way, shape or modify the GOP agenda, and if they try, will Republicans scrap the filibuster? (Watch for the umpteenth time the parties switch positions on the filibuster.) Each side will try peeling off members of the other side in a still-closely-divided Senate; the trick for Democrats will be to cooperate just enough to shape outcomes. Third, does Ryan's brand of reform conservatism become the new, the only conservatism? In other words, do his agenda items, not Trump's, define the modern conservative approach to governance? His is not the libertarian vision of dismantled government. It's not, with very few exceptions, concerned with social issues. Rather this is the Reformacon agenda that many right-wingers don't like. What we do know is the days of ideological checklists and purity tests are over. Conservative hall monitors should finally realize the American people are practical, not ideological; no one much cares about how Senator X voted on a farm bill. It's about results. Fourth, do conservatism and conservatives separate from the GOP? Perhaps the agenda of conservatism (supply-side tax breaks, social conservatism, ""small government"") is no longer viable. The Reagan era seems finally done. Perhaps conservatism endures by virtue of adherence to its governing principles (a preference for free markets, federalism), which can moderate and modulate whatever agenda Trump is pushing. Whether conservative or center-right, those who came to politics to pursue policy outcomes will need to stand apart from partisanship. A smartly designed anti-poverty program, for example, may need to engage a bipartisan coalition that leaves out far-right elements opposed to much of any role for the federal government. Bad ideas from the White House were criticized under President Obama, and they should get the same treatment under the new president. Fifth, ambitious GOP senators now have a problem: They cannot prepare themselves for 2020. Do they become cogs in the Trump movement or do they branch out on their own, pushing and prodding him to follow their own ideological preferences? It is some small consolation that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) will likely never be president. Maybe Trump will appoint him to the Supreme Court. (His colleagues might unanimously vote to banish him from their midst.) Sixth, do Republicans extract from this election the lesson that their sole concern should be white working-class voters, the people who brought them this far? A smarter approach would acknowledge that we are becoming more diverse and millennials will want a positive, tolerant agenda. If the GOP uses the majorities it has been granted to devise programs that serve its supporters but also other sections of the American electorate, it can build a lasting governing majority. With power comes responsibility and, we hope, sobriety. With power, we hope, comes a greater appreciation for the complexities of governing, which does require compromise. And with power, we hope, comes the appreciation that no successful president and no governing party can practice the politics of division, exclusion and incitement. If Trump's election serves as catharsis, allowing angry outsiders to feel empowered and giving their ringleaders exposure to the complications inherent in governance, we might find room for solutions and some interesting bipartisan alliances. That's the hope."

Balloting in state House and Senate races also will define the balance of power in the General Assembly, where Republicans are hoping to end years of Democratic rule and regain control of the Senate. The GOP faces an uphill battle in a traditionally blue state where Democrats have maintained significant advantages in fund raising and voter registration.  ""We're outnumbered, and it's a presidential year in which the other side just has more numbers,"" state Republican Party Chairman Charlie Copeland acknowledged last week. ""That's a Republican problem nationwide."" Still, the general election campaigns in Delaware have been mostly civil.  ""This is the way it's supposed to work,"" Democratic congressman John Carney Jr. said during a recent gubernatorial debate with Republican state Sen. Colin Bonini, who described Carney as a friend and ""a smart guy."" Despite the relative civility of state and local campaigns, some Delaware voters are glad that the politicking is ending.  ""All this back-and-forth, back-and-forth, I don't even watch the news no more. I'm just glad to know it's over. I'm sick of it,"" said Deborah Moody, 61, of New Castle. Moody, who works part time in record-keeping, plans to vote a straight Democratic ticket, albeit with little enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton.  ""I wish I had someone else to vote for. ... There's no other options,"" she said. William Thomas, a retired police officer, also is looking forward to the end of the campaigning.  ""I can't wait,"" he said, referring to the bombardment of political ads on Philadelphia-area TV stations. Thomas and his wife, Maria, a retired nurse, both cast absentee ballots for Donald Trump last week in Wilmington.  ""He's saying what we're thinking,"" said Thomas, who also voted for Bonini in the governor's race. Carney, a former state finance secretary and lieutenant governor, is making a second run for governor, having lost a 2008 Democratic primary to then-treasurer Jack Markell. Carney went on to be elected as Delaware's lone representative in the U.S. House in 2010. But after the death of former Attorney General Beau Biden, whom Carney had planned to support in the 2016 governor's race, Carney decided to give up the congressional seat and run himself. Bonini, meanwhile, is making a second bid for statewide office, having narrowly lost the state treasurer's race in 2010. Carney and Bonini agree that job creation and public education must be priorities for the next governor, who likely will face significant budget constraints amid soaring costs for state employee health care and Medicaid, and lackluster revenue projections. They disagree on social issues such as the death penalty and marijuana legalization, which Bonini supports and Carney opposes. Meanwhile, former state labor secretary Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Democrat, is poised to make history in her congressional race against Republican Hans Reigle, an aviation instructor and former military pilot who served as a small-town councilman and mayor in Kent County. Should she win Tuesday, Rochester would be the first black and first woman to serve in Delaware's congressional delegation. In another statewide race, Democratic state Sen. Bethany Hall-Long of Middletown faces Republican businessman La Mar Gunn of Dover, president of the Central Delaware branch of the NAACP, in a contest to fill the vacant lieutenant governor's seat. Tuesday's other statewide contest is the insurance commissioner's race, which pits Democrat Trinidad Navarro, currently the New Castle County sheriff, against Republican businessman Jeff Cragg, who lost the 2012 gubernatorial race to Markell. All 41 state House seats and 11 of 21 Senate seats are on the ballot, although many incumbent lawmakers, most of them Democrats, face no opposition. Voters also will choose a new mayor in Wilmington and new chief executive of New Castle County, both Democratic strongholds where incumbents were defeated in September primaries.

7	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/11/07/sometimes-even-the-best-senate-candidates-cant-win/	Sometimes even the best Senate candidates can’t win	"   FILE - In this Aug. 12, 2016 file photo, Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, tours the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades training facility in Chesterfield, Mo. (AP Photo/Sid Hastings, File)  MEDIA, Pa. -- It's a bipartisan axiom among campaign operatives that campaigns and candidates matter. But the other side of that principle is often a more painful reality: Sometimes you could also say political plate tectonics determine the outcome of a race. Ask any Republican who's run the best race of their Senate incumbents this year, and Sen. Pat Toomey's name emerges near the top of the list. Ask any Democrat -- and quite a few Republicans -- who has run the best Senate race, and almost universally they cite Jason Kander. Yet both Toomey (R-Pa.) and Kander (D-Mo.) head into Tuesday as 50-50 bets, and some of the same smart people who praise their campaigns wouldn't be surprised to see both lose.   [Why Democrats are likely than not to win the Senate majority]     Toomey is running in a state that has gone to the Democrat in six straight presidential elections and seems poised to give Hillary Clinton a seventh straight Democratic win. Of the last four races, only once, in 2004, did the Republican lose by less than four percentage points here. And Kander, Missouri's secretary of state, is running against Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) in a state that has delivered its electoral votes for the Republican four straight times -- seven of the last nine. Polls show Donald Trump heading toward a victory resembling the 2004 and 2012 races, when the GOP nominee won Missouri by more than 7 percentage points. Taken together, these two Senate races will do more than just help determine which party claims the majority. They will also show whether it's possible, in this hyper-partisan era, for quality campaigns and candidates to overcome tough political geography. It's the political version of the head versus the heart. So last week in Media, 20 miles west of Philadelphia, Toomey's pitch was all about his work as a bridge-builder to Democrats, both embracing the fact that most people in southeastern Pennsylvania will vote for Clinton and that many aren't particularly happy about it. ""A lot of her supporters are very open to my message, very open to someone who would be a check on her if she should become president,"" Toomey said in the Court Diner, pivoting to an attack against his opponent. ""Katie McGinty is clearly a rubber stamp for Hillary Clinton. Most Pennsylvanians want to have an independent senator who thinks through things himself or herself and is willing to criticize and separate himself from, you know, one's party nominee if necessary. I've done that. She won't."" McGinty is a political work in progress. A chemistry major at St. Joseph's University who went on to Columbia Law School, she's an expert on environmental policy and served in top posts in the Clinton administration in the '90s and in Harrisburg under then-Gov. Ed Rendell (D). However, this is her first race as the statewide Democratic nominee, and her public speaking is far from polished. She has relied heavily on the agenda crafted by Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming Democratic leader who helped recruit her. Her talking points are Democratic boilerplate. ""People are responding positively to the message that I'm delivering, which is a message about working for and standing with families like the one I came from,"" she said in an interview last month after a rally in Philadelphia with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). McGinty has wrapped herself around the Democratic stars stumping for Clinton here, including an election eve appearance with the Clintons and Obamas Monday outside Independence Hall. One of her closing ads is narrated by Vice President Biden, who remains very popular in the Philadelphia area after 36 years of being in its media market while representing Delaware in the Senate.    Toomey, meanwhile, has tried to shed his national image. He has declined to say who he will vote for in the presidential race, never endorsing or disowning Trump. ""My message hasn't changed,"" he said last week, suggesting he couldn't vote for Clinton but couldn't decide who to support. ""I'm still wrestling with the alternative."" The incumbent has a fine-tuned message built around security. His stump speech moves seamlessly from his work on gun-control legislation to tough stands against the Islamic State and Iran, to stopping crime among illegal immigrants. His only path to victory was to over perform in Philadelphia and its suburbs, which will account for more than 40 percent of the vote. Toomey has done just that, polling way ahead of Trump in that key region, but in other parts of the state he is lagging successful Republican campaigns of the past. That's been enough to give McGinty the slight edge in 10 of the last 12 public polls, and many Republican and Democratic insiders give her the overall edge -- despite the fact that Toomey is mostly acknowledged to be the better candidate. In Missouri, Kander's run the opposite campaign, trying to win over anti-establishment Trump voters. He gained national attention for his ad supporting background checks on gun purchases when the former Army captain, who served in Afghanistan, assembled an assault weapon blindfolded.    But by then Kander had already turned the race into a referendum on Blunt and his family's work as lobbyists, painting a portrait of the incumbent as the sort of Washington fixture that Trump backers despise. Democrats fell in love with Kander, 35, even as they knew he had an uphill race. ""You judge horse flesh, man. You don't just look at the numbers, you look at the numbers, but you look and you make a judgement,"" Biden said in an August interview, sizing up Kander. ""Whoa, this horse can run. This guy can run, this guy's a candidate."" Blunt's campaign has been ridiculed in private by senior Republicans for not recognizing the threat and by mid-October they whispered about his candidacy the way someone speaks of a dying relative. But in the last 10 days, particularly after FBI Director James Comey announced a further review of new emails from Clinton's secretary of state tenure (though that is now over), Missouri reverted to its partisan form. Day after day, more Republicans came home to support Trump and, with him, also Blunt. Now, Blunt is in a coin-toss race that few strategists in Washington, in either party, believe that he deserves to win.  "

It has united the rival Koreas, at least in one area: indignation against South Korea's leader. North Korea's propaganda mavens have never been shy in calling South Korean President Park Geun-hye an incompetent, power-hungry clone of her late dictator father, Park Chung-hee -- and that's when they're pulling their punches. Inconceivable a week ago, many South Koreans now seem to be reaching Pyongyang levels of fury over an investigation into whether Park allowed a longtime confidante with no official government role to manipulate her administration from the shadows. The North's fondness for vicious threats is generally missing in the South, but the anger over the scandal -- sometimes partisan, mostly spontaneous on the part of many South Koreans, but more violent and somewhat canned in the North, where carefully cultivated outrage is a state commodity -- often seems to be in lockstep. For instance, in wording that North Korea would be right at home with, Ahn Cheol-soo, a lawmaker from a small South Korean opposition party and a potential presidential candidate, recently said of Park: ""You no longer have the authority to destroy the constitution. You no longer have the authority to stomp on the pride of our people."" Here's how a similar sentiment looked when North Korea's main newspaper recently attacked Park: ""It's deplorable that the South's politics have become the joke of the world and its economy and people's livelihoods are left in shreds."" To be clear, the expressions in South Korea, even at their sharpest, are still a long way from the odious linguistic swamp of violence and sexism that characterizes much of North Korea's propaganda. The North, for instance, has called Park a ""dirty prostitute who licks her master's groin,"" an ""aging witch,"" a ""female dog"" and an ""American parrot."" Pyongyang has also repeatedly called for her death. But there has been an uptick in both rage and sexism in the South, especially online, where Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, have been called ""crazy bitch,"" ''chicken head,"" a slur meant to attack their intelligence, and ""stupid Gangnam ajumma,"" a term often used to insult middle-aged women living in affluent southern Seoul. People have also declared that South Korea will never again vote for a female president or trust a woman's leadership. It is not just happening in obscure corners of South Korea's social media or the web, never the cream of public discourse.  ""Park Geun-hye threw away her authority as (the person) ultimately responsible (for governing the state) to a common street woman of unknown roots,"" Jae-myung Lee, the opposition mayor of Seongnam, told more than 10,000 people taking part in a recent anti-Park rally, referring to Choi. ""Park has lost her authority as president and has shown that she doesn't have the basic qualities to govern a country."" That Park, who has 15 months to go in her single five-year term, should go has long been a mainstay of North Korean rhetoric. But similar sentiments are also emerging in South Korean media.  ""If we had to pick one person who made the country into the shattered mess that it is now, it's none other than President Park,"" the South's Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper said in an editorial on Saturday, calling for Park's resignation. ""The citizens no longer want Park to govern state affairs ... She lost the political leadership to persuade and guide the ruling and opposition parties, the parliament and the people. Her moral authority as the head of state has fallen to the ground ... Continuing this state for another year and three months will make everyone miserable."" North Korea's state media have at times seemed overwhelmed with the amount of negative stories, both international and South Korean, about Park, and have often just rounded up the coverage, with some insulting comment added. Six days after Park first acknowledged that she had sent Choi, the daughter of a shadowy religious figure who emerged as Park's mentor in the 1970s, drafts of her speeches for editing, North Korea's main newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, released a lengthy, painstaking summary of the saga, replete with sexist, violent insults. The newspaper described Park and Choi as ""two women who have lost their minds."" It also broke down reports that Choi influenced important government decisions, including Park's move to shut down the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, a jointly run factory park in the North Korean city of Kaesong.  ""This shows to the world that Park Geun-hye is not merely a first-class dog controlled by a large monster that is the United States, but also doubly and triply a puppet manipulated by strings pulled by one 'Gangnam' woman,"" the North Korean newspaper said, referring to the Seoul neighborhood where Choi reportedly built a fortune on real estate investments. Observers of North Korean propaganda have wondered about the length of time it took the newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party, to weigh in on the scandal -- nearly a week. It's almost as if the paper's propaganda experts, after firing at much smaller targets for so long, couldn't quite believe the huge gift they'd been given. Pyongyang has more recently stepped things up. For instance, the North's official Korean Central News Agency published a statement by a Foreign Ministry unit that called the scandal a ""hideous power-backed scandal unprecedented in history."" It predicted that a ""mass struggle"" of enraged South Koreans will leave Park at a crossroads where she is forced to choose between quitting her presidency on her own or facing impeachment. With tens of thousands of South Korean protesters calling for Park's ouster over the weekend and bigger crowds expected in coming days, Pyongyang's breathless, over-the-top propaganda might not be so far off the mark. ___ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.
