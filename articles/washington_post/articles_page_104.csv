The prosecution wants crime scene investigator Bill Williams of Georgetown to take the stand. He has created an animation of the shooting of Walter Scott by Michael Slager using cellphone video, dashcam video and police radio calls. Slager, who is white, is charged in the April 2015 shooting death of Scott as he fled a traffic stop. Williams is largely self-taught and the defense argued he lacked the formal training to be allowed to testify as an expert. The jury was out of the courtroom for more than four hours Tuesday as attorneys argued and Williams showed the judge his presentation. Finally, Circuit Judge Clifton Newman ruled the witness has expertise in both crime scene recreation and forensic video. Court has adjourned and the jury will see the animation on Wednesday. ___ 2:50 p.m. Attorneys at the trial of a former South Carolina patrolman charged with murder in the death of a black motorist are sparring over whether the prosecution's last witness should be allowed to testify. Slager, who is white, is the former North Charleston patrolman charged in the shooting death of 50-year-old Walter Scott. Cellphone video recorded by a bystander shows Scott being shot in the back from yards away as he fled after an April 2015 traffic stop. The defense contends the two men wrestled and Scott got hold of Slager's stun gun before the shooting. With the jury out of the courtroom for more than two hours Tuesday, attorneys have been arguing over whether a crime scene investigator should be allowed to testify. The investigator, Bill Williams of Georgetown, has created an animation of the shooting using cellphone video, dashcam video and police radio calls.

Anthony Imel is undergoing cross-examination in the trial of Michael Slager, the former North Charleston patrolman charged with murder in the April 2015 shooting death of Walter Scott as Scott fled from a traffic stop. Imel also testified Monday, and the prosecution made available photo enlargements from the video portraying key moments of the struggle between the two men. On Tuesday, defense attorney Andy Savage asked Imel why photos of other important moments were not produced. Savage said he wants the jury to see the cellphone video frame-by-frame. Imel said the video he enhanced has 50,000 single frames. ___ 8:35 a.m. An interfaith advocacy group is calling for a civil rights investigation of the North Charleston Police Department in South Carolina. The Post and Courier of Charleston reports (http://bit.ly/2frMR1U) the Charleston Area Justice Ministry announced it had sent a letter to the Department of Justice asking for an investigation of the department's ""patterns or practices"" of racial discrimination. Their announcement comes as former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager is on trial for murder in the shooting of Walter Scott, a black man who was shot and killed as he ran from a traffic stop. Members of about 30 congregations also called for the city of Charleston to hire an external, independent, police auditing firm to audit the Charleston Police Department for ""bias-based policing."" ___ 4:30 a.m. The prosecution is wrapping up its case in the murder trial of Michael Slager, the white former South Carolina patrolman charged in the shooting death of an unarmed black motorist.

""We were wrong. The entire pundit industry, the entire polling industry, the entire analyst industry,"" said political analyst Larry Sabato the morning after the election. ""We plugged hundreds of surveys into our system and over 90 percent were wrong and they managed to miss almost entirely this tremendous turnout in rural America."" One detail: Hillary Clinton lost statewide votes in North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, even though she led in state polling. Of course, those states aren't pivotal electoral prizes or anything. Our collective certainty about the lousy polling wasn't in place on the afternoon of Aug. 17. That's when Michael Cohen, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special counsel to Donald Trump, appeared on CNN for a discussion with host Brianna Keilar. The news peg for the interview was an ostensible campaign shakeup in which Breitbart News executive Stephen K. Bannon and pollster Kellyanne Conway came in to rescue a troubled and unstable outfit. In some slightly heated back and forth, Cohen protested that the campaign hadn't, in fact, gone through a shakeup -- it was just adding some ""winners"" to the existing framework. Keilar: You say it's not a shakeup but you guys are down. Cohen: Says who? Keilar: Polls, most of them. All of them? Cohen: Says who? Keilar: Polls, I just told you. I answered your question. Cohen: Okay, which polls? Keilar: All of them. Cohen: Okay, and your question is? The Erik Wemple Blog wrote up that clash under the headline ""CNN host totally owns Trump lawyer Michael Cohen."" The topic and tone were by no means an Erik Wemple Blog Exclusive. Behold: Daily Wire: ""CNN's Brianna Keilar Wipes The Floor With Trump's Lawyer In Hilarious Exchange"" Vox: ""CNN tells Trump adviser he's losing: 'Says who?' 'Polls.' 'Which polls?' 'All of them.' "" PoliticsUSA: ""CNN Drops A Reality Bomb On Trump Surrogate Who Refuses To Believe Trump Is Losing."" Mother Jones: ""One of Donald Trump's Top Advisers Just Lost It on CNN--and the Video Is Hilarious"" (here's the URL of that Mother Jones story: http://www.motherjones.com/contributor/2016/08/this-is-so-good) Quartz: "" 'Says who?': The anatomy of a perfect political meme"" Media Matters: ""CNN Anchor Has To Tell Trump's Lawyer That All The Polls Show Him Losing"" Mashable: ""Trump staffer shut down in extremely awkward CNN interview"" TVNewser: ""'Pretty Sure Brianna Keilar Deserves a Glass of Wine Tonight'"" TPM: ""That Awkward Moment When CNN Reminds Trump's Lawyer He's Losing"" Mic: ""CNN Anchor Brianna Keilar Destroys Donald Trump's Lawyer on Live TV"" Pajiba: ""A Trump Aide's Response to His Baffling CNN Interview Is Even More Bewildering than the Interview Itself"" That's an incomplete rundown of this cable-news moment's Internet traction. On Tuesday, a reader of the Erik Wemple Blog emailed us to ask if we'd apologized to Cohen. Truth be told, we'd forgotten about the story altogether. So we Googled a bit, called a number and got Cohen right on the line. Then we apologized for having participated in this arrogant act of groupthink. ""I accept your apology and I truly appreciate the call,"" said Cohen. On the substance of the exchange with Keilar, Cohen said he'd known Trump was ahead ""all along and that's what had made me as angry as I was."" Asked whether he'd reached that conclusion based on gut instinct or on data, he said ""both."" At the first presidential debate at Hofstra University, he ran into Keilar and they ""laughed about the entire episode,"" he recalls. Did he have any idea how famous he was in mid-August? ""Are you joking? I was trending on Twitter for almost 36 hours,"" he says. On the polling nitty-gritty, Cohen says, ""I believe the polls were off once he became the nominee."" Why would polling outfits make that mistake? ""Because they wanted to,"" replies Cohen. ""There was a concerted effort by the liberal mainstream media to disparage Mr. Trump at every turn. Despite their attempts, the American people saw through their ploy and elected the person that they knew would put America first."" Though Cohen gained fame for saying ""Says who?"" perhaps he now deserves to be known for a bit of commentary that he laid down in another part of his interview with Keilar -- when they were discussing polling numbers for minority groups. Here's what he said: ""My statement to you is I don't care about those poll numbers. I have some very deep relationships into the African-American community as an example. And trust me, he's doing a whole lot better than 1 percent. And the same pundits that are giving you this answer are going to be surprised the same way they were when Donald Trump ran away with the nomination for the -- at the primaries. You're going to all be very surprised when he polls substantially higher than what any of you are giving him credit for."""

(Nicholas Kammnicholas/Agence France Presse via Getty Images)  A week ago, President-elect Donald J. Trump's victory put an end to a historic yet unconventional campaign season with many surprises, twists and turns. The American people decided on a bold new direction for Washington by electing an outsider, a businessman who had never held elected office before. As a Republican, I am excited about this change of direction for Washington. However, this campaign season brought many surprises and some drama. Locally, many Republicans experienced an unusually high rate of vandalism and theft of campaign signs and property because of their support for Trump. In fact, the Prince William County Republican Committee filed police reports on at least eight instances of stolen or vandalized property. In my many years of political activism, I have never seen anything like the vandalism and threats of violence here in Virginia, and around the nation, in an election year. Now that the election is over, we have seen tensions continue among a divided nation. Some Americans, including some in the media and elements affiliated with the Democratic Party, have wrongly stereotyped all Trump supporters as racists, bigots or xenophobic. Also, some Trump supporters have reacted against ethnic minority groups in an unacceptable manner, as if Trump's victory is a license to behave badly. Both are wrong. Both must end. First of all, the mischaracterization of Americans who voted for Trump is divisive and irresponsible, and it harms legitimate efforts to unify the nation. Many Prince William County residents cast their ballot for Trump because of the Supreme Court or because of his business success and his ability to grow the economy. Some voted for Trump because they want to see a Washington that gets things done, and some voted for Trump to see a strong national defense. Many voted for Trump because they simply want change. It's notable that Trump's coalition of support included many minorities here in Virginia. An early look at election returns actually shows increased support for Trump among minorities compared to previous Republican candidates. Trump got more votes from people of color than Mitt Romney did in 2012. Secondly, as chairman of the Prince William County Republican Party, I know that those who are misreading or misrepresenting what Trump's election means and using it as an excuse to disrespect others are wrong and do not represent the Republican Party. To our neighbors in the community, the Prince William County Republican Committee expressly disavows any racist, bigoted and intolerant rhetoric stemming from the election. As Trump said on the CBS 60 Minutes program on Sunday to those behaving badly: ""Stop it."" Those who call themselves Republican and disrespect others don't understand what we stand for. The Virginia Republican Creed accurately states what we, as Republicans, stand for. We believe, ""That all individuals are entitled to equal rights, justice, and opportunities and should assume their responsibilities as citizens in a free society."" We also believe, ""That the Federal Government must preserve individual liberty by observing Constitutional limitations.""  Go to our website to read the rest of the Virginia Republican Creed. Prince William County is now a minority-majority community that welcomes all peoples and all religions. We value diversity. Hateful people don't represent us. Prince William County was the focus of election coverage as a key bellwether for Virginia, and I am proud that Election Day was peaceful. It is my hope that we can continue to work together to show the nation how Americans can disagree on politics and yet still live together in harmony and peace. Dottie Miller is the chairman of the Prince William County Republican Party."

Chris Christie's appeal of a resident's complaint Christie allowed the closure of lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013, creating a traffic nightmare that ensued for days. State Superior Court Judge Bonnie Mizdol on Monday signed an order setting oral arguments for Jan. 11. The appeal stems from a Bergen County judge's order Christie appear at a Nov. 23 hearing, postponed by Mizdol's order. The complaint was filed by a retired Teaneck firefighter. It alleges Christie failed to order subordinates to re-open bridge access lanes from Fort Lee. Christie denies wrongdoing. He has not been charged in what prosecutors say was a political payback scheme targeting Fort Lee's Democratic mayor. Two former Christie allies recently were convicted in the case.

To see how true he is to his word, watch how he handles the direction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The agency was created as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010, which was passed in response to the unscrupulous behavior of many companies on Wall Street. Will the Trump administration replace the CFPB's current director, Richard Cordray -- who has been aggressively going after businesses that take advantage of consumers -- with someone who is cozy with corporate America? Cordray's term isn't up until 2018, but a court has ruled that he can be removed at will by the president. The CFPB has been under attack since its inception mostly by Republicans who have argued that the financial services industry is already heavily regulated. And yet some of those same companies caused a housing and financial crisis that harmed millions of consumers nationwide. We don't even have to go back as far as the Great Recession to see that financial companies need more, not less, oversight. Two months ago, the CFPB fined Wells Fargo $100 million for -- unbeknown to its customers -- opening hundreds of thousands of unauthorized bank and credit-card accounts. In its short existence, the watchdog agency has forced corporations to return more than $11.7 billion to consumers. To that point, Wells Fargo has to pay full restitution to all of its victims. Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit opened a door to weaken the CFPB by ruling that its structure is unconstitutional. The case was brought before the court by PHH, a mortgage lender that had been fined $109 million after the agency concluded that it had illegally referred consumers to mortgage insurers in exchange for kickbacks. In addition to wanting its fine vacated, PHH sought to disband the CFPB. The company was successful regarding the fine, but thankfully the court didn't destroy the agency. It did, however, effectively turn the CFPB into a political pawn -- which is something that Dodd-Frank had attempted to avoid. Under the ruling, the agency's director can be removed at the president's discretion. Under Dodd-Frank, the director could be removed only for ""cause."" That's an important distinction, because my fear is that a new director who is too sympathetic to corporations rather than being a fierce champion for consumer rights could render the agency largely impotent. One of the major criticisms of the CFPB is that it is an unaccountable bureaucracy, because its funding comes from the Federal Reserve and not Congress. But that's a good thing. Congress wants to hold the purse strings so it can make the CFPB dance for it. But this puts the agency in the position of playing politics when it should be singularly focused on protecting consumers. In other words, the CFPB works for us -- we the consumers, who don't have as much money or lobbying power as well-heeled financial companies. Just look at the recent funding cuts at the Internal Revenue Service. In a report this past spring, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities -- which was founded to focus on how federal budget decisions affect the most vulnerable Americans -- said that cuts to the IRS's budget since 2010 ""have significantly weakened taxpayer services."" Just try to get through to the agency on the phone during tax-filing season. The IRS has some problems, to be sure, but the budget woes are keeping this agency from responding more quickly to people with tax issues. National Taxpayer Advocate Nina E. Olson has repeatedly complained in her reports to Congress about the toll that the funding decreases have had on the quality of taxpayer services. Do we want the CFPB to be yoked back like the IRS just at a time when the agency has its sights set on more protections for consumers in a number of areas, including payday lending and unfair debt collection? The CFPB has a complaint portal that works with consumers to get a response from companies. It has handled more than 1 million complaints involving financial products and services. The agency is using the database to identify trends in unfair financial practices. That's a great service to consumers. What if that gets shut down? In a recent blog post, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) put Trump on notice. ""Americans want to hold the big banks accountable,"" she wrote. ""That will not happen if we gut Dodd-Frank and fire the cops responsible for watching over those banks."" Trump hasn't provided specifics on any meaningful policies that would protect consumers. And it's clear why. He's aggressively pro-business, a stance that far too often is at odds with consumer protection.

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)  One of the things that will be funniest to watch once Donald Trump becomes president will be how, all of a sudden, core economic data reflects hard realities and not the machinations of an anti-Trump conspiracy. You may remember way back during the presidential campaign a week ago that Trump would regularly suggest that economic data, like the unemployment numbers, were artificially low and that the real numbers were being suppressed or ignored and so on. They weren't then, and they won't be under Trump, but rest assured that Democrats will quickly point out that Trump once mocked the numbers he's soon going to try to take credit for. It's almost amusing the extent to which politicians and their supporters try to take credit for/assume the best about themselves and the worst about their opponents. Remember when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stood on the Senate floor in January 2015 and tried to argue that good economic numbers were the result of the Republican sweep in 2014? That was funny. It was also not unique. Gallup looks at economic confidence numbers on a regular basis, and it polled members of the two major parties before and after last week's election. And guess what! Republicans are suddenly much more confident about the future of the economy and Democrats are suddenly far less confident, as Bloomberg News' Joe Weisenthal noted on Twitter.     It's almost as though . . . opinions . . . are driven by politics?? The exact same thing happened when President Obama first took office, as Gallup noted during his first term.     When George W. Bush was president, Republicans were more likely to think that things were going well. Then Obama came in, and suddenly Republicans were much more skeptical. Here's a safe prediction I will make: Come January, Republicans are going to have a much more positive view of the president of the United States and Democrats will have a much worse one. Why do I say that? Because that's what happens.     The extent to which partisanship is a driver of economic attitudes, though, is best shown by this chart from the Pew Research Center, noted by Vice News' Matt Phillips in an article this week. Republicans have generally been pretty comfortable with free-trade agreements -- until a certain presidential candidate made them a focus of negative attention on the campaign trail. At that point, support for the agreements collapsed among Republicans.     This is hugely advantageous to the incoming president, of course. Trump is getting the benefit of the doubt on the economy already, and getting the benefit of its general strength. That may not last long, because we can expect the numbers among Democrats to tank. In the meantime, though, Trump could point to that increased confidence as he tries to win over the Americans who didn't vote for him. Not much has changed with the economy over the past seven days, which itself defies some expectations. But American politics has, and that's a primary driver for much of how the country views itself and what it does.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)  There are many reasons for D.C. officials to be wary of a Donald Trump administration. Health insurance for the poor and gun control restrictions could be rolled back. Abortion rules could be tightened. In a city where 93 percent of voters favored Hillary Clinton, those are sobering prospects. But there's also reason to think Trump may help greenlight one of D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's long-held interests: returning the Washington Redskins to D.C., in a new stadium that would replace RFK. D.C. officials are studying how to re-use the 190-acre RFK site along the Anacostia River and one of the options on the table is a new 65,000-seat stadium that would allow the team to return to the District by the time its lease expires at FedEx Field in Landover, in 2027. The District leases the RFK land from the National Park Service and to advance stadium plans Bowser inquired last year with Sally Jewell, Interior secretary under Barack Obama, about extending the lease. Jewell's declined, saying she was unlikely to rework the agreement to accommodate an organization with a name she felt was a ""relic of the past"" that ought to be changed. Since then, the political ground has shifted considerably around the team's name as it relates to the stadium discussions. In May, a Post poll found that nine in 10 Native Americans aren't offended by the name. Then Trump won the presidential election, in part by railing against Democratic officials he deemed preoccupied with political correctness. A pro-Trump super PAC, Rebuilding America Now, even ran a television ad against Hillary Clinton, saying she wanted to ""mess up your football too"" by changing the team's name. Trump has not named whom he will nominate as Interior Secretary (a post that oversees the Park Service) but reports from Politico and Buzzfeed this week suggested that former Alaska governor Sarah Palin is being considered. There may be no better advocate for the Redskins name in that position than Palin, a frequent critic of the politically correct crowd who has previously come to the team's defense. ""The government's intent to force any owner of anything, in this case an NFL entity, to change a name is the antithesis of the American way of working through differences,"" Palin wrote in a lengthy 2014 Facebook post. She continued, coming to the defense of Chicago Bears legend and sportscaster Mike Ditka for backing the name and working in a dig at the D.C. political establishmnent to boot. ""[Ditka] thinks the name should always be Washington Redskins, as a source of pride? Take the word 'Washington' out and I'll agree the team name is a great source of pride,"" she wrote. Asked at a Wednesday press conference whether Trump and the federal government potentially dropping opposition to the Redskins name could improve the odds for a stadium in D.C., Bowser said regardless of the election result she was expecting she would have to approach the post-Obama administration on the issue. ""We always knew that on January 21st that conversation would restart, regardless of what happened"" on Election Day, she said. Bowser's deputy mayor for planning and economic development, Brian Kenner, said he didn't know yet ""what kind of an effect the Trump administration is going to have"" on prospects for the team. ""It's too early to tell right now. The mayor has been pretty consistent that RFK location would be the best location for the football team,"" he said. ""It's close to public transportation, it's close to highways and other things to get people in and out. It's already been used as a football facility in the past. So I think it just makes sense to be honest with, because it's in the middle of the region."" There is an important caveat to those hopeful that Trump will return the burgundy and gold to the District. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (a Republican who cast a write-in ballot naming his father for president) has also said he wants to keep the team and has nearly 300 acres of national parkland in Oxon Hill, north of National Harbor, that could fit a new stadium. A Redskins spokesman declined to comment. Aaron C. Davis contributed. Follow Jonathan O'Connell on Twitter: @oconnellpostbiz"

Terry McAuliffe of acting ""illegally"" to return voting rights to convicted felons who've served their sentences. The GOP nominee tells supporters at a midnight rally in the state that the governor is ""letting criminals cancel out the votes of law-abiding citizens."" He's imploring his supporters to get out to vote.   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally, Sunday, Nov. 6, 2016, in Sioux City, Iowa. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)  He says, ""We are going to have one of the great victories of all time,"" comparing it to the ""Brexit"" vote by The UK to leave the European Union ""times 50."" Virginia's highest court ruled in July that governors cannot restore felons' right to vote en masse, but must consider them on a case-by-case basis. That ruling invalidated a sweeping executive order issued by McAuliffe that had given more than 200,000 felons who'd completed their sentences their right to vote back. 12:49 a.m. Donald Trump is ending a marathon day of campaigning with a final rally well past midnight in Virginia. Trump took the stage in Leesburg, Virginia, and was cheered by supporters who arrived for the event they expected to start at 9:30 p.m.  ""This is a marathon,"" he told supporters in Leesburg, Virginia. He dubbed the event his ""midnight special speech."" Trump joked that the traveling press were exhausted after following him to five rallies in five states. He said even the cameras were sagging. Trump also took note of a woman in the audience that he depicted as ""obnoxious."" He shook his head and then said, ""You even find them at 12 o'clock in the evening."" The woman was asking the candidate about allegations that he grabs women. ""Do you respect women, Donald?"" she asked. ___ 9:40 p.m. A New Hampshire crowd is booing as Mike Pence mentions the FBI's new announcement that Hillary Clinton will not face charges related to a new email investigation.

Clinton is closing out the final hours of her presidential campaign with a more positive message focused on uniting the country, as she appeals to Americans of all political affiliations. The Democratic presidential candidate says she is ""hopeful and optimistic"" about the future. She says: ""We have to heal this country."" The Democratic presidential candidate is campaigning in Manchester, New Hampshire. She was introduced by Khizr Khan, the Muslim-American father of a slain Gold Star solider and folk singer James Taylor. She plans to conclude her campaign with stops in Pittsburgh, Grand Rapids, Philadelphia and Raleigh on Monday. ___ 9:15 p.m. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says the latest letter from FBI Director James Comey about newly discovered emails ""underscores the irresponsibility"" of the law enforcement chief's notice to Congress nine days ago about Hillary Clinton. Reid issued a statement late Sunday noting that Comey created a political firestorm in the presidential race 11 days before the election about emails that might be related to Clinton's use of a private email server. On Sunday, Comey sent a new letter informing Congress that a review of the emails had not changed the FBI's July view that there were no grounds for criminal charges against Clinton. The Nevada lawmaker complained that Comey's actions were contrary to Justice Department rules and longstanding practices and may have violated the law barring federal officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Reid said of the latest letter from Comey: ""By confirming that the new emails were meaningless, today's letter underscores the irresponsibility of Director Comey's original letter."" ___ 7:46 p.m. Donald Trump is accusing the FBI of impropriety after its director lifted a cloud hanging over his rival Hillary Clinton. FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers Sunday that the bureau had found no evidence to warrant criminal charges against Clinton in a trove of newly-discovered emails. Trump insisted at a rally in the Detroit suburbs that it would have been impossible for the FBI to review what has been reported to be as many as 650,000 emails in so short a time. He claims she's being protected by ""a rigged system."" Trump says, ""Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, The FBI knows it. The people know it."" He says it's now up to ""the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8."" ___ 7:19 p.m. In financial trading Sunday evening, Dow Jones index futures jumped about 200 points ahead of Monday's stock market opening, apparently in response to FBI Director James Comey's decision that seemed to lift a cloud over Hillary Clinton. Comey announced Sunday that a review of new Hillary Clinton emails did not change the FBI's recommendation that she should not face charges. The futures jump Sunday presaged possible substantial gains. The market wilted on Oct. 28 after the FBI notified Congress that it was reviewing new, potentially relevant emails linked to Clinton. The stock market is allergic to that kind of uncertainty coming so close to Election Day. ___ 6:38 p.m. Donald Trump says he would give local residents the power to prevent refugees from settling in their communities. Trump told supporters at a rally in Minneapolis that the U.S. would ""not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they are being placed."" He says, ""It's the least they could do for you. You've suffered enough in Minnesota."" Trump cited the September knife attack in a St. Cloud mall as he warned about the risks posed by radicalized immigrants. And he again singled out the Somali population, which in the past has condemned Trump's comments. He says, ""Here, in Minnesota, you've seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without your support or approval and with some then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our county and all over the world."" Trump has vowed to stop admitting immigrants from ""terror-prone regions"" until new, more intense vetting mechanisms are put into place. ___ 6:04 p.m. Republican presidential nominee Mike Pence is suggesting he isn't satisfied with the FBI's conclusion on Hillary Clinton's handling of national security documentation while serving as secretary of state. Pence told a raucous crowd in Hickory, North Carolina, that ""mishandling classified information is a crime."" The Indiana governor's marks came hours after FBI Director James Comey confirmed that that agency still recommends no criminal prosecution related to Clinton's use of a private email server while leading the State Department. Comey had rocked the presidential election with a late-October announcement that agents were reviewing another cache of emails potentially related to the investigation he had declared closed in July. ___ 4:55 p.m. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is campaigning with basketball star LeBron James in Cleveland on Sunday, hoping to motivate African-American voters to the polls. She's praising the NBA player for his basketball skills and ""what he does off the court."" Clinton says: ""What he does off the court is to care for every child as though that child is his own."" James tells the crowd that their votes matter. He says, ""it really does."" Clinton's team is worried about their chances in Ohio, where polls show her in a dead heat with her Republican rival, Donald Trump. She hosted a free concert in the state on Friday with rapper Jay Z and his wife, Beyonce Carter Knowles. Clinton will campaign later on Sunday in Manchester, New Hampshire, with songwriter James Taylor. ___ 4:40 p.m. House Speaker Paul Ryan says Americans can end the Clinton era by voting for Donald Trump. Ryan's tepid support for the Republican presidential nominee has elicited criticism from some fellow Republicans. But the speaker issued a statement Sunday shortly after FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that a review of additional emails provided no grounds for criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. Ryan said regardless of Comey's decision, Clinton put the country's secrets at risk and compromised national security. Ryan's statement comes a month after the Wisconsin Republican told his House GOP colleagues that he would neither defend Trump nor campaign with him. Ryan is running for speaker again. He retains the support of a strong majority of congressional Republicans, but some GOP lawmakers are unhappy that he distanced himself from Trump and didn't campaign for him. ___ 4:25 p.m. Donald Trump made no mention of FBI Director James Comey's announcement that a review of new Hillary Clinton emails did not change the FBI's recommendation that she should not face charges. But Trump, holding a rally in Minnesota on Sunday, did make his usual claim that Clinton ""will be under investigation for a long, long time, likely concluding in a criminal trial."" Trump went on to say that Clinton is ""protected by a rigged system. She shouldn't even be allowed to run for president."" Comey's letter was released minutes before Trump took the stage in Minneapolis. He has three more rallies slated for Sunday. Comey's initial announcement last month that the FBI was reviewing the emails was a political gift to Trump, who claims that a cloud of scandal would follow her into the White House. ___ 4:20 p.m. A former Republican senator from New Hampshire is featured in a new digital ad urging people to vote for Hillary Clinton. Gordon Humphrey served New Hampshire in the U.S. Senate through the 1980s and was known as a staunch conservative. He backed John Kasich in the Republican primary and has been vocal with his anti-Trump stance. Humphrey calls Trump ""cruel,"" ''shameless"" and ""a bully"" in the direct-to-camera appeal. He warns Trump could lead the nation into nuclear war. He ends the video by saying voting for Clinton is ""the responsible thing to do."" ___ 4:07 p.m. President Barack Obama is telling voters in Florida the race for the president is over if Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wins the state. Obama has returned to Florida on the final day of early voting before Election Day. ""If we win Florida. It's a wrap,"" he says. Obama is speaking at a baseball stadium in Kissimmee where Stevie Wonder performed earlier. He is telling the audience that's he's read that the campaign for Republican nominee Donald Trump has shut down his Twitter account in the campaign's final days. Obama says if somebody can't handle a Twitter account, they can't handle control of the nation's nuclear weapons. Obama is also reaching out to minority voters in Florida and says Trump has vilified minorities and called immigrants criminals and rapists. ___ 4:05 p.m. President Barack Obama is telling voters in Florida they can't stick Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with a Republican-controlled Congress. Obama is in Kissimmee trying to sway voting in the state's U.S. Senate race where incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican, is running against Democrat Patrick Murphy. Obama says ""if you want more endless gridlock, vote for Republicans."" He also is trying to tie Rubio to Republican nominee Donald Trump. Obama says Rubio once sent a tweet that said friends don't let friends vote for con artist -- a reference to Trump -- but then ended up voting for him because it was politically expedient. ___ 3:55 p.m. Donald Trump is defending his decision to make a last-minute campaign stop in Democratic Minnesota -- saying the pundits have been wrong about him before. Addressing a rally that drew thousands in Minneapolis, Trump is criticizing rival Hillary Clinton for not spending enough time in the state. She last campaigned here in July. He says, ""Hillary doesn't even come here. She refuses to campaign in Minnesota. Do you really want a president who's never shown up?"" Trump says that he ""took so much heat"" for adding the stop to his scheduled Sunday. But he says that he expects to win, despite the fact that the state hasn't cast its electoral votes for a Republican since 1972. He says, ""Two years, I've been right"" and the pundits have ""been wrong."" ___ 3:50 p.m. FBI Director James Comey says that agents have ""reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton"" that were part of newly discovered emails. Comey sent a letter to Congress Sunday informing them that the FBI has ""not changed our conclusions"" from earlier this year that she should not face charges. The emails were found on the computer of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Comey's brief letter did not indicate how many emails were reviewed or what sort of material was found in Abedin's emails. Comey's initial letter last month revealing that agents were reviewing the newly discovered email breathed new life into Donald Trump's campaign. Trump has repeatedly warned that a cloud of scandal would follow Clinton to the White House. ___ 3:43 p.m. Hillary Clinton will be joined by another special guest on Monday night: Singer Bruce Springsteen. The rock star will perform at an event with Clinton, her husband, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama in Philadelphia. The event is being billed as the capstone of her presidential campaign. Clinton has been trying to tap into star power in the final days of the race, hosting a series of events with celebrities designed to boost turnout among young and minority voters. ___ 3:40 p.m. Hillary Clinton's campaign is praising a letter by FBI Director James Comey confirming his July conclusions in her email case. Says campaign communications director Jen Palmieiri: ""He has confirmed the conclusions that he reached in July and we're glad this matter is resolved."" In a July press conference, Comey said he did not recommend charges against Clinton for her use of a private server as secretary of state. A letter sent nine days ago to congressional leaders said he was re-examining emails for relevance to her case. ___ 3:30 p.m. FBI Director James Comey tells Congress that a review of new Hillary Clinton emails has ""not changed our conclusions"" from earlier this year that she should not face charges. Comey sent the letter Sunday, just two days before Election Day. In July, he chastised Clinton's use of the private mail server but said that the bureau would not be recommending criminal charges against the Democratic nominee. The new letter follows one Comey sent late last month in which he said agents would be reviewing newly discovered emails that may be connected to Clinton. They were found on the computer of Anthony Weiner, the disgraced congressman and estranged husband of Clinton's close aide Huma Abedin. ___ This story corrects the spelling of James' first name LeBron, not Lebron.
