Countries say climate fight ‘irreversible’	" MARRAKECH, Morocco -- Government delegates meeting for U.N. climate talks reiterated their commitment to the Paris Agreement with a proclamation Thursday saying climate action is ""irreversible,"" the buzzword at the two-week conference after the uncertainty caused by the U.S. election. The proclamation calls for ""the highest political commitment to combat climate change"" and reaffirms the promise by rich countries to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries deal with it. President-elect Donald Trump pledged during his campaign to ""cancel"" U.S. involvement in last year's Paris deal and to cut off American funding for U.N. global warming programs. Delegates at the talks in Marrakech have downplayed his remarks and adopted a wait-and-see approach about how Trump will approach the Paris deal once in office.  ""The direction of travel from Paris is indeed irreversible,"" South African Environment Minister Edna Molewa told reporters. ""There can be no backtracking on commitments made by developed countries and no attempt to renegotiate the terms of the text agreed in Paris."" Brazil's chief climate negotiator, Jose Antonio Marcondes de Carvalho, had a similar message, saying Paris put the world on an ""irreversible path"" while China's top climate official Xie Zhenhua said the global trend toward a low-carbon economy is ""irreversible.""

Richard Jones, who owns East Coast Bail Bonds in Frederick, said business has dropped nearly 75 percent since District Court Chief Judge John P. Morrissey advised judges and commissioners last month to impose the ""least onerous"" conditions on defendants who cannot be released on their own recognizance.  Morrissey was reacting to a recent opinion from state Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) that cash bail could be discriminatory and unconstitutional.  ""They are just letting everybody go,"" said Jones, who is part of a powerful lobby that has thwarted past legislative efforts to reduce the prevalence of cash bail. On the first weekend following Morrissey's advice in October, Jones had eight bonds over three days. Normally, he said, he would have about 70 bonds during that period. Prosecutors and defense lawyers said they do not think the change has been quite so drastic, although they agreed that judges are releasing more poor defendants -- including some whom prosecutors consider a flight risk. Judges also are taking more time to explain their decisions, Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger said. The head of the state's Office of the Public Defender, Paul DeWolfe, who supports a major overhaul of the bail system, called the reduced use of bail ""a step in the right direction.""  It is happening as the rules committee for the Maryland Court of Appeals weighs whether to alter the state's existing bail policies, and amid pushback from those who support the cash-bail system and those who think changes should be channeled through the state legislature.  [Released on a promise, not a bond: bail is almost nonexistent in D.C.]  The merits of money bail have been under scrutiny for decades, with critics saying poor defendants should not have to remain in jail for months before trial simply because they can't make bail, while those who can pay go free. Lawmakers and advocates have been pushing for changes, part of a broader effort aimed at shrinking prison and jail costs and reversing racially biased sentencing practices.  Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch describes bail revision as a key element in addressing what she called a two-tiered judicial system that treats poor people and minorities differently.  ""Thousands of nonviolent, non-felony defendants languish behind bars, not because they have been found guilty of a crime or pose a flight risk but simply because they cannot pay,"" she told an audience of judges, lawyers and law clerks in a speech Tuesday at the U.S. District Court in Washington.  Lynch said criminal-justice reforms must continue under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who during his campaign emphasized ""law and order"" over individual civil rights and touted more aggressive anti-crime techniques, such as ""stop and frisk.""  [Attorney General Loretta Lynch: defendants are not cash registers]  According to a 2014 report by the Commission to Reform Maryland's Pretrial System, about 7,000 to 7,500 defendants are in jail awaiting trial on any given day.  Lawmakers pushing for pretrial reform in the state often cite the D.C. system, in which judges release most defendants without requiring them to leave any money behind. Suspects must promise to return to court and, often, agree to drug testing or to check in with a pretrial officer. Those deemed too dangerous to release are held without bond. Shellenberger, a conservative Democrat, said that he is ""not opposed to bail reform"" but feels ""there is a place for bail in our system. I believe that certain defendants show up because their family has what I call skin in the game."" Since Morrissey issued his letter to judges and commissioners last month, Shellenberger said, he has seen a number of ""questionable"" no-bail releases of suspects, including a defendant who was charged with a handgun violation and who gave a post office box in Kentucky as his address.  ""There's concern from a public safety point of view but also from a failure-to-appear-rate point of view,"" Shellenberger said. On Friday, the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedures of the Maryland Court of Appeals will hold a hearing on pretrial reform and is expected to recommend possible changes for the court to consider. Retired judge Alan N. Wilner, who chairs the rules committee, said in a memo to his colleagues that ""most independent studies nationwide have found the reliance on money bail set at levels that the defendant cannot afford to be irrational, unnecessary, racially and ethnically discriminatory, and fiscally unsound.""  He also noted that ""some judicial officers, some legislators, some law enforcement personnel and, unsurprisingly, the great majority of bail bond companies"" oppose any change.  [Read Judge Wilner's full memo]  Frosh's office issued its opinion last month after five state lawmakers asked whether setting bail, without considering whether a defendant can afford to pay, violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment.  Those lawmakers plan to introduce bills outlawing cash bail during the upcoming legislative session, which starts in January. But Frosh suggested that the rules committee consider overhauling the system without legislation -- an idea opposed by some at the State House. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert) and Sen. Robert A. Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), the chairman of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, recently sent a letter to the rules committee in which they urged it to leave any changes in the hands of lawmakers. ""I believe we need some type of reform, but this is an inappropriate forum for this,"" Zirkin said, saying that the General Assembly is better suited to discuss the budget ramifications of any changes. ""It just sets a bad precedent.""  Maryland's approximately 150 bail bondsmen -- who make their money by helping defendants make bail and then keeping a percentage of what is paid -- say they will fight to preserve at least some forms of the practice, which they say is important for public safety.  Gerald Evans, a lobbyist who represents the bail bondsmen, said they oppose any effort by the judiciary to adopt its own changes. He accused Frosh, who pushed for bail reform when he was a state senator, of trying to circumvent the legislative process.  Tyler Mann, a defense lawyer in Baltimore, said regardless of how it happens, an overhaul is needed. Too often, he said, innocent defendants who can't afford bail choose to plead guilty after months behind bars, so they can be released for time served and not have to await trial. ""They are literally being held hostage until they take the plea and admit guilt,"" Mann said. ""The system as a whole needs to be overhauled.""  "

The idea that the former home of militarism and nationalism could become a beacon for human rights and peaceful international cooperation within one lifetime may seem far-fetched. But with outsider Donald Trump's election as U.S. president and the rising strength of far-right and populist movements in Europe, some have suggested that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is left as the last powerful defender of liberal values in the West. Since taking office in 2005, Merkel has been a fixture of the international summit circuit, often providing the only dash of color in row upon row of grey suits. She has outlasted most of her contemporaries -- save for Russian President Vladimir Putin -- and won plaudits for successfully steering her country through the turmoil of the global financial crisis. Along the way, the trained physicist has deftly maintained relations with allies as they gained new leaders, including prime ministers and presidents whose positions were very different from her own.  ""I could not have asked for a steadier and more reliable partner on the world stage,"" President Barack Obama said Thursday after meeting with Merkel in Berlin during his final foreign tour. He described the German chancellor as ""a great friend and ally"" who looks out for her own country's interests while recognizing that this also requires working closely with others to solve common problems. Merkel raised eyebrows last week when she departed from the usual diplomatic script after Trump's election by suggesting that respect for liberal values was a precondition for Berlin's continued good relations with Washington. Many commentators saw her remarks as a sign that the chancellor was prepared to thrust Germany into the forefront of international politics and challenge the new U.S. administration if necessary. Standing beside Obama, she pledged to ""do everything to work well with the new president,"" but insisted that the basis for cooperation would have to be ""democracy, freedom and human rights worldwide, and to strive for an open and liberal world order."" Obama's decision to stop in Germany for two days reinforced the image of him passing the baton to Merkel. Rather than bid farewell to Europe in Paris, the capital of America's oldest ally, or in Britain -- which prides itself on a having a ""special relationship"" with Washington -- Obama's choice signaled a recognition that the heart of the old continent now lies in Berlin. The leaders of Europe's other major powers -- Britain, France, Italy and Spain -- will meet Obama in the German capital Friday, a day after he confers at length with Merkel.  ""The phrase 'leader of the free world' is usually applied to the president of the United States, and rarely without irony,"" Timothy Garton Ash, a historian and professor of European studies at Oxford University, wrote Friday in Britain's left-leaning Guardian newspaper. ""I'm tempted to say that the leader of the free world is now Angela Merkel."" Yet skeptics point out that Merkel may not be suited to rally the West. Her decision last year to open Germany's borders to hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty was seized upon by European nationalists and featured prominently in Britain's debate over quitting the European Union -- which the 'leave' camp narrowly won. European allies blame her for earlier stoking popular unrest by insisting on the need to cut public spending during the continent's debt crisis. And in Ukraine, Merkel's recent efforts to maintain a united European front in the face of Russian aggression are looking increasingly fragile. Domestically, Merkel is battling a new nationalist foe in the form of Alternative for Germany, a party that has surged in popularity by railing against refugees. Rather than confronting the party head-on, Merkel has instead stuck to her measured mantra of ""We will manage.""  ""Germany can't replace the United States as the leader of the free world,"" Josef Braml, an expert on international affairs at the German Council on Foreign Relations, said. ""At best, it can protect Europe from nationalist tendencies and remind America that the liberal world order it established is also in the economic interests of the United States. That's something the new businessman in the White House should be able to understand."" Close allies say Merkel -- who is expected to declare her intention to run for a fourth term in the coming days -- is aware both of her responsibility and the limits of her power.  ""She is absolutely determined, willing and ready to contribute to strengthen the international liberal order,"" said Norbert Roettgen, the head of the German Parliament's foreign affairs committee. ""But we can't see the chancellor of Germany as last man standing. This will only work together, within Europe, and if we can have the backing of the trans-Atlantic alliance."" German officials, conscious that Berlin is in no position to solve problems such as climate change and crises in the Middle East without American help, are hoping Trump will tone down his rhetoric once he's inaugurated. The Republican candidate called Merkel's immigration policy a ""catastrophe"" during the campaign, saying Germany was ""being destroyed by what Merkel has done there."" On Thursday, Merkel stressed the debt that her country owes the U.S. for its support in rebuilding the western half of a shattered nation after World War II and eventually reuniting with the East after the fall of the Berlin Wall. She said Berlin was prepared to step up its effort to achieve the same peace and stability abroad that it enjoys at home. Obama, who jokingly said he might vote for Merkel if he were German, praised her country as a model student of democracy in a fragile world.  ""What the history of post-war Germany shows is that strength and determination, focus and adherence to the values that we care about will result in a better future for our children and our grandchildren,"" he said.  ""It is absolutely true that Chancellor Merkel is going to have significant responsibilities,"" Obama added. ""I wish I could be there to lighten her load somewhat, but she's tough."" ___ Associated Press writers David Rising in Berlin and Maria Danilova in Washington, D.C. contributed to this report.

Charred bodies with their arms bound. Women who were gang-raped. Men who were spared death but arbitrarily detained. These are the tales of horror told in Yei, a formerly peaceful town surrounded by farms in southern South Sudan near its border with Uganda and Congo. Once a beacon of coexistence, Yei is now a center of the country's renewed civil war, gripped by a wave of killings among South Sudan's dozens of different ethnic groups. And things could get worse.  ""The signs are all there for the spread of this ethnic hatred and targeting of civilians that could evolve into genocide, if something is not done now to stop it,"" said Adama Dieng, the U.N.'s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, after visiting Yei last week. Civilians and local government officials in Yei told The Associated Press of army troops and, to a lesser extent, the rebels terrorizing the population and killing people based on their ethnicity.  ""Some leaders will not hide their (loyalty) to their ethnic groups. They cannot hide it. Genocide is not an event that one day comes. It builds and it builds up. The indicators are there,"" said Jacob Aligo, a minister in the Yei state government. At night, gunshots echo through the town and soldiers prowl the streets, looting and raping, according to more than a dozen residents and government officials interviewed by the AP. A woman who identified herself only by her first name of Betty for fear of reprisal said government soldiers knocked on her door one night in mid-October.  ""My husband pushed me and my two children under the bed and he opened the door. They demanded money, and he had none, and then they shot my husband,"" she recalled, saying he bled to death. She said she later visited a friend who had been gang-raped by armed men. When civil war spread across South Sudan in December 2013 -- more than two years after the country gained its independence from Sudan -- the town of Yei was spared the violence that arose elsewhere. The civil war, which killed tens of thousands and displaced more than 2 million people, grew out of a political split between President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Rick Machar. The conflict often pitted Kiir's Dinka tribe against Machar's Nuer community and other minority groups. Yei became a refuge for all of the country's 64 tribes who wanted to avoid the fighting, and crime was almost nonexistent, residents said. The surrounding area produced food for the entire country and a nearby coffee plantation received support from actor and longtime South Sudan activist George Clooney. When a peace deal was signed in 2015, it seemed that Yei had avoided bloodshed. But last summer, after fresh fighting erupted in South Sudan's capital, Juba, between Kiir's army and the rebels under Machar, the renewed civil war came to Yei. Civilians in Yei began to suffer in August when the army came in to fight nearby rebels, said Gista, a resident who also refused to give her last name out of fear for her safety. She said government soldiers swarmed a village on Yei's outskirts, where her daughter and son-in-law lived. He apparently didn't hear the soldiers coming, and ""when he tried to run, the killers were already there,"" Gista said. They killed him and her daughter, as well as her 4-year-old granddaughter, and hacked a 4-month-old granddaughter with a machete, she said. The infant survived after being hospitalized, she added. The military, which residents and local government officials say are from the Dinka tribe, attacked other tribes who are natives of Yei and surrounding Equatoria state on suspicion they supported the rebels, the locals said. A militia called Mathiang Anyoor, which is allied to Kiir and Army Chief of Staff Paul Malong and is Dinka, also terrorized civilians, according to residents, local officials and U.N. officials. Residents are restricted from moving 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the center of town in all but one direction. Surrounding areas have been declared off limits by the military. When the AP traveled in a government convoy in those ""no-go"" areas, they were deserted, with fields lying fallow and empty houses and shops boarded up. Santo Domic Chol, a spokesman for the South Sudan army, or SPLA, said the allegations of soldiers targeting civilians were ""baseless,"" and part of a propaganda campaign influenced by the rebels. In early November, 11 people traveling from Yei were rounded up by unidentified individuals, placed in a thatched hut, and burned alive, local government officials said. Their charred corpses were still there in mid-November when AP counted seven bodies, some with their arms bound behind their backs.  ""We are living in crazy times,"" said Athanasio Yongule, minister for Local Government and Law Enforcement. Like other local officials, Yongule said South Sudan's army does not answer to them. Since July, hate speech has been on the rise in the region on social media, according to Stephen Ladu, the acting governor of Yei River State.  ""We can see that the boys in the bushes will be writing on the social media that they will come and attack this community,"" Ladu said. Letters sent to humanitarian groups and seen by the AP have threatened to kill civilians from Equatoria state who live elsewhere in South Sudan. Ladu and other local officials want U.N. to send peacekeepers to Yei to protect civilians. Nearly 150,000 people have fled to Uganda from the Yei region since July, and 120,000 have moved elsewhere in South Sudan, according to estimates from the South Sudan Protection Cluster. The U.N. refugee agency said in September that about 100,000 people are ""trapped"" in Yei by ""military operations,"" and it is distributing items like soap and blankets. Many civilians are gripped by hunger in a region that once was South Sudan's breadbasket. About 40 percent of the area's population faces food insecurity, according to internal U.N. estimates obtained by the AP. Because of the conflict, they don't have access to their farms, said Richard Ruati an assistant external relations officer for U.N. refugee agency in Yei.  ""Sometimes when they go to their farms, they are either accused by the government soldiers of harboring the rebels or the rebels and the armed groups accuse them of harboring government soldiers,"" he said. Civilians ""are bearing the brunt of both sides, and they don't know where to turn to,"" he said. Dieng, the U.N. adviser on genocide, painted a harrowing picture of his visit to Yei as he left South Sudan last week, recounting stories of ""targeted killings, assault, maiming, mutilation, rape, and the barbarous use of machetes to hack families to death."" He said: ""Yei is one urgent example among many."" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a stark warning about South Sudan this week.  ""There is a very real risk of mass atrocities being committed in South Sudan, in particular following the sharp rise in hate speech and ethnic incitement in recent weeks,"" Ban said in a report to the Security Council. But he added that U.N. peacekeeping operations don't have the ""appropriate reach, manpower or capabilities to stop mass atrocities."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Billings, a former aide to Sen. Edmund Muskie (D-Maine) and a key author of the Clean Air Act and other landmark environmental laws, died Nov. 15 at a hospital in Nashville. He was 78. The cause was a stroke, said daughter Erin Billings. Mr. Billings, who was visiting family in Tennessee, had homes in Bethany Beach, Del., and The Plains, Va. As staff director of the Senate Environment subcommittee from 1966 to 1978, he was a primary author of the 1970 Clean Air Act, one of the first and most influential environmental laws in U.S. history and a foundation for current air pollution laws. He also played a key role in the 1972 Clean Water Act, the primary federal law governing water pollution, and 1977 amendments to both the air and water pollution laws. He served as Muskie's environment adviser for more than a decade and later was the Democrat's chief of staff in the Senate and when Muskie was secretary of state under President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Billings also directed the Washington politics program at the University of Southern California and served in the Maryland Legislature, as a Montgomery County Democrat, from 1991 to 2003, focusing on environmental issues. He later ran a consulting firm and taught college courses on the Clean Air Act and other laws. Leon Gregory Billings was born in Helena, Mont., on Nov. 19, 1937. His father edited and published a progressive newspaper, the People's Voice, and his mother was a journalist. He graduated from the University of Montana in 1959 and spent several years in the Navy Reserve.  His first wife, former Maryland Del. Patricia Harstad Billings, died in 1990 after 28 years of marriage. Leon Billings was appointed to her seat before winning election in his own right. (He was an unsuccessful candidate in 1986 for the Democratic nomination in Maryland's 8th congressional district, which included Montgomery County.) Survivors include his wife of 21 years, Cherry Allen Billings of Bethany Beach and The Plains; three children from his first marriage, Shannon Billings and Paul Billings, both of Silver Spring, Md., and Erin Billings of Washington; two brothers; and four grandchildren. Tom Jorling, who was Republican staff director on the Senate subcommittee while Billings led the Democratic majority, said Mr. Billings ""had tremendous skills legislatively and politically. He was respected and trusted by all members of the committee, majority and minority. His talent and skills led to the enactment of the foundational environmental laws of that era."" Jorling said Mr. Billings was disappointed to see clean air and water laws come under attack from President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, but said the laws have survived previous attacks from the White House and Congress. Trump has called climate change a hoax and vows to cut back the role of the Environmental Protection Agency, which he describes as a job killer.  ""Leon's work helped prevent any wholesale efforts at eliminating or rolling back those statutes"" in previous administrations, Jorling said. The current fight ""would have been a new challenge for Leon.""   Read more  Washington Post obituaries          "

In his home state, one of few that has released write-in data, Sanders won 18,183 votes despite not being on the ballot, and despite encouraging his voters to back Hillary Clinton. Vermont was home to the nation's only organized ""write-in Bernie"" campaign, which for one week involved supporters canvassing door to door, to tell liberals that they could safely write in the senator's name. Sanders, who hunkered down in Vermont in August to finish his campaign memoir, was made aware of the write-in effort several times; once, a fan asked him on camera how he ""honestly"" felt about it. ""I think in Vermont, it's okay, because Hillary's going to win,"" said Sanders, in a video released by Green Party Radio. ""But in states where it's close, I want her to win. So if you write me in here, that's okay -- I'm just not going to win, you understand.""    The write-in surge actually turned Sanders into 2016's best-performing third party candidate in Vermont. He won 5.67 percent of the vote; Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee who mostly improved on his 2012 numbers in every state, won just 3.14 percent of the vote. Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee who had not appeared on the 2012 ballot, won 2.11 percent of the vote. None of those totals made an impact on the presidential race, but they cut into Clinton's winning margin. The Democratic nominee won Vermont by 27 points, down from the 36-point win that Vermont had delivered for Barack Obama in 2012 -- the biggest vote decline for the Democrats in the Northeast. Vermont's town-by-town election map was rendered a little redder by the write-ins, too. For example, Sanders won 94 write-in votes in the town of Castleton, where Donald Trump's margin over Clinton was 13 votes. But down the ballot, Sanders might have helped Vermont progressives hold on to their offices. Democrats enjoyed a 32-seat majority in the state's House of Representatives and a 10-seat majority in its state Senate. After the election, Democrats held their House numbers and rose to a 14-seat Senate majority. In both houses, the Republicans lost seats, and the Vermont Progressive Party either held or gained seats. Sanders's personal campaigning for Democrats couldn't prevent the party's only loss in Vermont, as the governor's mansion fell to Republican Lt. Gov. Phil Scott. But having assured progressives that they could write him in without costing Clinton the state, Sanders was proven right. Few states keep detailed records of write-in votes, and the total support for Sanders (or for independent Evan McMullin) may not be known until December. But according to Dave Reip's Atlas of Presidential Elections, which is frequently updated with new data, at least 751,112 votes were cast in 2016 for write-in candidates. That was up from the 284,920 write-in votes cast in 2012, and by far will set the all-time record for write-ins."

No, it wasn’t simply economic anxiety.	"      Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump rejoiced across the nation on Election Night as their candidate defied the polls. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   We knew all along that Donald Trump drew his strength from the white working class. We knew this from the patterns in the primaries. We knew this from the nonstop polling conducted over the past 18 months. We knew this from all of the campaign-trail dispatches showing his anti-trade, anti-elite message thrilling crowds in the heartland. Tuesday proved that this demographic remains a powerful force in U.S. politics -- and the president-elect has thoroughly charmed the group. He vastly overperformed 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in the Midwest and the Rust Belt, in many cases flipping counties that had decisively voted for President Obama in 2012. For instance, Obama won Iowa's Howard County, a farming community that is 97 percent white by 21 points in 2012. On Tuesday, Trump took Howard County, which bills itself as ""Iowa's Year 'Round Playground,"" by 19 points. In Luzerne County, Pa., a place just outside of Scranton, Obama won by five points in 2012; Trump took it by 20 points. In Juneau County, Wis., smack in the middle of the state, residents voted for Obama by a seven point margin in the 2012 election. Voters there picked Trump over his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, by 26 points.     The specks of red -- where Trump won counties that previously voted for Obama -- dot the Rust Belt. And these counties all had something in common. They were dominated by whites without a bachelor's degree. In the charts below, I have plotted the correlation. Even within the Midwestern states, it was the counties with higher populations of working-class whites who handed Trump his victory. Many of these areas have been going red for decades -- but Trump went above and beyond. He performed significantly better than Romney in places dominated by working-class whites.     Even after controlling for income levels, employment levels, population size and the foreign-born population in a given county, the more white people there were who lacked a four-year degree, the more likely Trump outperformed Romney in that county. Roughly speaking, if you took an average county and increased the portion of less-educated whites by 10 percentage points, you would boost Trump's winning margin by about three percentage points. What made these white voters change their minds? Certain economic factors were important. Trump tended to outperform Romney in places where median incomes were a little lower, places where people tended to be out of work and where middle-aged whites were more likely to die. But these places have been like this for a while. In fact, Trump's victory doesn't seem to be linked to any recent declines in people's economic circumstances. The economy has been getting better over the past four years. Median incomes have risen. The unemployment rate has plummeted including in regions won by Trump:     In fact, if you just look at the simple correlation, Trump overperformed Romney in counties where the unemployment rate fell the most between 2012 and now. Part of it is that these places tended to have higher unemployment rates in 2012, so they had more room to improve. But it's clear it wasn't some recent decline in employment that affected how these counties voted. (The same is true of changes in median income.)     Voters often say that the economy is the most important thing on their minds, but this is more evidence that for politics, the economy is a state of mind. As Gallup economist Jonathan Rothwell has pointed out, surveys show that Trump supporters are not necessarily poorer than average. It may be that many are probably doing pretty well, but they may see others in their neighborhood who are struggling and decide that the nation, as a whole, isn't that great anymore. That would accord with what political scientists have been saying for a long time. They emphasize that in politics, perceptions are important. People don't always vote in their own self-interest -- they think about what they believe will be good for the country as a whole. They also think about a candidate's character. They judge whether a politician is capable of listening to them and their community. Trump, on some level, understood the importance of making members of the white working class feel as though they were being heard. He tapped into deeper, slower-moving resentments. Political scientist Kathy Cramer has spent nearly a decade talking to rural Wisconsin voters about their views on government. In her book, ""The Politics of Resentment,"" she describes the feeling like this: The economic woes people communicated to me ... were interlaced with their sense of who they are, who is a part of their community, what their values are, who works hard in society, who is deserving of reward and public support, and how power is distributed in the world. This complex set of ideas is the product of many years of political debate at the national level as well as generations of community members teaching these ideas to each other. This entwined set of beliefs was not something that any one politician instilled in people overnight -- or even over a few months. In other words, the tension was always there. Trump just found a new way to flick at it."

(Brendan Smialowski/AFP)  In the end, it was all wrong -- or didn't matter. The polls. The pundits. The electoral map. The conventional wisdom about the need to act ""presidential."" The enshrined beliefs about Americans' willingness to vote for a candidate who threatened to ignore democratic traditions, who stirred vitriol at his rallies, who had repeatedly showed disdain for women and minorities. To vote for a man who said ""I alone can fix it."" And so Wednesday morning, America woke up to President-elect Donald Trump, a stunning and once unimaginable outcome that has sent shock waves across the world. The United States not only elected man with a temperament widely viewed as not befitting the presidency, but one who was also uniquely unprepared for it, with no prior political or military service experience in his background. Trump -- real estate mogul, reality TV show host, golf course developer -- will be the first president in the history of the United States to have neither, providing a stark rejection of political norms and expectations that have traditionally surrounded the background for leaders in its highest office. That he reached the White House running in opposition to a presidential candidate who had the broadest C.V. for the job in recent years makes the repudiation of the political resume all the more remarkable. Hillary Clinton began her career as a lawyer, a starting point for many presidents, and had been a senator, a first lady and secretary of state, a launchpad for the presidency that was common among the Founding Fathers. Trump has never held elected office or served in a presidential appointment or politically affiliated role. [Polls show a tighter presidential race. But not when it comes to this issue.] Yet many voters didn't seem to care; in fact they cheered it on, loudly and wildly, believing his outsider status will help him upend Washington's dysfunction. He represented change -- tectonic, tremendous change -- while Clinton, to many voters, represented the status quo. For those in the states that tipped the balance in electoral college votes -- Clinton is winning the popular vote -- experience paled in the face of enthusiasm for something new. Trump's win is the ultimate realization of a broad, sweeping shift in the culture that increasingly seems to disregard qualifications and knowledge. One where being an ""elite"" is a put-down; where being an ""outsider,"" even a brazen one, can confer status. Blame globalization. Blame income inequality. Blame the Internet and cable news and social media, where everyone is an expert. The erosion of distrust in American institutions -- the police, the medical system, the presidency, the Supreme Court, Congress and of course, the press -- has grown over time. Yet the irony of all this is that for Trump to succeed, in many ways he'll be dependent on the qualifications and experience of some of those very institutions. Yes, executive powers will help him enact many parts of his agenda. But his success will also be tied to working with the establishment Republicans in Congress -- a number of whom distanced themselves from him during the campaign. Putting other policies in place -- infrastructure, paid maternity leave -- will likely mean working with longtime Democrats, such as Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). To staff his Cabinet, he's likely to turn to his crew of surrogates, reports say, some of whom are political insiders themselves and hardly a unifying bunch. Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and former House speaker Newt Gingrich are both reportedly on lists for appointments; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's administration has been engulfed in a scandal, yet shows up three times on one Cabinet shortlist obtained by BuzzFeed News. The chance that a group of such loyalists would push back much on Trump -- something even the most experienced and seasoned president needs -- seems remote. The chance of appointments widely respected on both sides of the aisle, in the vein of a Robert Gates, seems even less so. Beyond those top jobs, meanwhile, he'll need help appointing the countless deputies and government executives who fill the next tier of staff in the White House and federal agencies -- the jobs that form the backbone of a functioning American bureaucracy. Here especially, one wants knowledge, competence and experience. Yet for a president who said he'd get rid of ""stupid people"" from government, who spent his campaign railing against government entities like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Education, who has been dismissive of U.S. intelligence, they could be much harder to fill. [Donald Trump doesn't read much. Being president probably wouldn't change that.] So much about this election has upended what we know about politics and the American electorate. It could forever change the long-held standards for whom we view as a viable, acceptable candidate for president and leader of this nation. Never before have we had a pending president with less experience in the ways Washington works, and with less apparent interest in general expertise and knowledge about the world. One can only hope Trump will not apply the same standard to the leaders who surround him.

Belichick addressed the letter during a regularly scheduled news conference held hours after the billionaire business was elected president and two days after he read it aloud at a campaign rally in New Hampshire. The letter congratulated Trump on his campaign and praised him for overcoming ""slanted and negative media"" to ""come out beautifully."" But Belichick said he writes hundreds of notes every month and that it ""doesn't mean I agree with every single thing that every person thinks about politics, religion or other subjects."" At the same campaign rally Monday, Trump alluded to a phone conversation with Brady in which he said the quarterback offered his support. Brady wouldn't confirm or deny that Wednesday.  ""I'm just going to talk about football this week,"" Brady said. ""I talked to my wife, she said I can't talk about politics anymore. I think that's a good decision made for our family."" But when pressed, he went a little further.  ""I just want to focus on Seattle,"" he said. ""I have a lot of relationships with a lot of people in the press and I don't think a lot of people are entitled to what my conversations are with friends of mine or people I may speak with."" Belichick reiterated that his comments were not about making a political stance.  ""I think anybody that's spent more than five minutes with me knows I'm not a political person,"" Belichick said. ""My comments are not politically motivated. I have a friendship and loyalty to Donald. A couple of weeks ago we had Secretary of State (John) Kerry in our locker room. He's another friend of mine. I can't imagine two people with more different political views than those two. But to me, friendship and loyalty are just about that. It's not about political or religious views."" Kerry visited the Patriots' locker room when they played at Pittsburgh on Oct. 23.  ""I have multiple friendships that are important to me and that's what that was about,"" Belichick said. ""So it's not about politics, it's about football."" When Belichick was asked follow-up questions about the letter and whether it caused any division in New England's locker room, he repeated ""Seattle"" five times, referencing that the team is focused on preparing for Sunday's game against the Seahawks.  ""We got a huge game this week against a great football team, and a great organization,"" he said. ""And that's where it all is going forward. On Seattle."" ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
