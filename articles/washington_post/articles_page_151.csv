Troops moved into the Muharabeen and Ulama neighborhoods after fully liberating the adjacent Tahrir neighborhood on Friday, said Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces. Al-Aridi said IS militants were fighting back with snipers, rocket-propelled grenades and mortar rounds. Thick black columns of smoke were seen billowing from the two areas, while dozens of civilians were seen fleeing to government-controlled areas. Shortly before noon, a suicide bomber emerged from a house in the Tahrir neighborhood and attacked security forces, wounding four troops. Later in the afternoon, another suicide car bomber hit the troops in Aden neighborhood, killing a soldier and wounding three others. Late on Friday, a group of IS militants attacked the village of Imam Gharbi south of Mosul, controlling most of it for hours before airstrikes from the U.S.-led international coalition were called in, an officer said. The clashes and multiple suicide bombings left three policemen dead, including an officer, and four others wounded, he said. Nine IS fighters were killed, he added. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to brief media. On Saturday, after the fighting had quietened down, the Kuwaiti government in coordination with a local NGO distributed 1,000 boxes of humanitarian aid to residents of the Samah and al-Arbajiyeh district in eastern Mosul, which had been cleared of IS militants earlier. Residents sat on the ground in a long queue waiting to receive the aid. As they emerged from their districts, some opened their jackets and raised their hands in the air to show troops they were not wearing an explosive belt. Some waved white flags.  ""We don't have any medical support,"" said Ibrahim Saad, a Mosul resident. ""There is no food, no water. I am not talking about electricity, but these three fundamental things are not available."" he said. To the west of Mosul, government-sanctioned Shiite militias took full control of the Tal Afar military airfield Friday night, said Jaafar al-Husseini, a spokesman for the influential Hezbollah Brigades. Al-Husseini said the clashes almost destroyed the airport and that it will be an important launching pad for the troops in their advance. The extremist group captured Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, in the summer of 2014. The offensive to retake the city, which was launched on Oct. 17, is the biggest military operation in Iraq since American troops left in 2011. If successful, the retaking of Mosul would be the strongest blow dealt to IS' self-styled caliphate stretching into Syria. The Shiite militias are leading an assault to drive IS from Tal Afar, which had a majority Shiite population before it fell to the militants in the summer of 2014, and to cut IS supply lines linking Mosul to Syria. According to the United Nations, more than 56,000 civilians have been forced from their homes since the operation began out of nearly 1.5 million civilians living in and around Mosul. In the heavily damaged town of Bashiqa, about 13 kilometers (8 miles) northeast of Mosul's outskirts, Christians rang the bells of Saint George's church for the first time to celebrate its liberation from IS, which was driven out earlier this month. Much of the town has been reduced to rubble from artillery strikes and air raids. Parishioners, peshmerga fighters and Kurdish officials sang hymns and played band music as they walked in procession into the church, which was heavily vandalized by IS fighters. Men prepared a large cross to mount on the rooftop, replacing one destroyed by the extremists.  ""The first thing they did was break the cross, we want to replace it and tell Daesh that the cross is still here and we are not leaving at all,"" said Rev. Afram al-Khoury Benyamen, using the Arabic acronym to refer to the group. Bullet holes marked the walls inside the church courtyard, strewn with garbage and graffiti left by the extremists, including some of their names. Much of the church's inside had been smashed, with rubble strewn across the ground and holy inscriptions covered with black paint. In an upper level, pews had been pushed back to make room for cushions and carpet beneath a broken window that had been used as a sniper's nest, marked out by scattered spent bullet casings. Broken brass instruments and a torn bagpipe from the church's boy scout band lay scattered across the site, with pills and syringes on the floor in one area. The church graveyard was desecrated, with graves broken into and tombstones smashed and painted over.  ""It's good they're gone, but how happy can we be? Look at this mess,"" said 22-year old Youssef Ragheed, a drummer from the band who had fled the town when IS controlled it but returned for Saturday's ceremony. ___ Rohan reported from Bashiqa, Iraq.

The Farmington Daily Times (https://goo.gl/9r4nwG ) reports that terms of the settlement signed Monday by a federal judge are confidential. However, the tribe said it and Urban Outfitters plan to collaborate on American Indian jewelry. Urban Outfitters claimed during the litigation that the tribe knew or should have known the ""Navajo"" name had been used in clothing, jewelry and other merchandise for years and delayed legal action. Court documents didn't quantify the amount the tribe could recover if it won the lawsuit, but a ruling in the case said a federal law allowed a minimum $1,000 a day for each type of good sold or on display for sale.

The origins of Modernism's spare functionalism can be traced to housing solutions created to solve Europe's severe housing crisis in the aftermath of World War I. And once-radical concepts like open flow plans, Pyrex glassware and linoleum flooring were initially designed for corporate or industrial settings. A contemporary example of that flow of ideas from crisis to general use is Pritzker Architecture Prize recipient Shigeru Ban's use of thick paper tubes in the quick and efficient construction of temporary housing for disaster victims. The tubes have also been employed by Ban to build innovative museums, churches and other structures around the world. In the other direction, IKEA's expertise in inexpensive flat-packed furniture has been applied to shelters, which can be rapidly and cheaply transported around the world and assembled -- and disassembled -- within a matter of hours. A new exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art invites visitors to take an entirely new look at the concept of home and design, this time through the lens of migration and global refugee emergencies, in which temporary shelters, organizers say, are being deployed on a scale akin to that after World War I. The exhibit ""Insecurities: Tracing Displacement and Shelter,"" on view through Jan. 22, brings together both artists' ideas of home and what it represents and also a range of designs of shelters and refugee settlements.  ""These shelters and camps are, in reality quasi-permanent,"" said Sean Anderson, associate curator in MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design, who organized the show with Ariele Dionne-Krosnick. Shelters are de facto homes to hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world, Anderson points out, and the average time a displaced person remains in such a situation is over 20 years -- longer than many people remain in one home. The exhibit is divided into sections on borders, shelters as a conceptual as well as built phenomena, and settlements, and features a Better Shelter structure, designed by the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR and the IKEA Foundation, to give a sense of one type of structure many displaced people call home. It also includes examples of designs meant to help displaced peoples, including a UNICEF ""School-in-a-Box,"" containing materials needed to set up a makeshift school for about 80 students, and ""Adolescent Kits for Expression and Innovation,"" featuring plastic boxes filled with colored markers and other craft materials.  ""A refugee settlement is a reality where ingenuity and repurposing of resources is brought to the max, and the values and use of technologies are accelerated,"" explained Marte Terne, head of marketing and communication for the Sweden-based Better Shelter . Explaining the way the minimalist temporary housing structures evolve once in use, she said: ""Textiles and rugs are used to make the space cozier and softer, personal items are hung up on the walls, a television is in and certain corners or areas are dedicated to specific tasks or storing of certain items.. A home emerges."" The ""Insecurities"" exhibit is juxtaposed with a larger MoMA show ""How Should We Live: Propositions for the Modern Interior,"" one floor above it, which traces design solutions created to address Europe's post-World War I housing crisis to their eventual evolution into the streamlined functionalism what later became Modern design.  ""We live in a highly interconnected world, and ideas move very fluidly and very quickly,"" says Don Weinreich, a partner at the New York-based Ennead Architects, behind projects including William J. Clinton Presidential Center and the Natural History Museum of Utah. Weinreich and architect Eliza Montgomery also lead the award-winning Rethinking Refugee Communities, a collaboration between Ennead Lab, UNHCR and Stanford to design better settlements for displaced people.  ""The difference between a shelter and a home has less to do with how long someone lives there and more to do with a resident's ability to personalize and modify their dwelling,"" Weinreich says. ""We design to create the conditions where a traumatized population has the opportunity to adapt the shelters that are provided to them. Including victims in design can contribute to the very complex process of healing."" Unlike during the aftermath of World War I, these designs are employed in a range of cultures, as opposed to a situation in which Europeans were designing solutions for themselves that were designed from the start to be permanent.  ""The trick is to find a balance and create something that's efficient and durable but also flexible enough so that the user can adapt it to the way they live,"" Weinreich says. ""Whether someone lives in a dwelling for two months or twenty years, it is a place humans live, and should provide a certain quality of life and be more than just a state of limbo.""

The ruling against Yahia Qalash, the head of Egypt's press union, and board members Khaled el-Balshy and Gamal Abdel-Rahem, comes after a seven-month trial. The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the conviction, saying the ruling is a ""punishment"" and called upon authorities to ensure that journalists work without ""fear of reprisal."" The case goes back to April when the security forces raided the syndicate to arrest two journalists, who were wanted over protests against the president's decision to transfer Egyptian sovereignty of two strategic Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. The move infuriated journalists. They staged protests and demanded the interior minister's resignation, as well as a presidential apology. Instead, Qalash and two others were detained and charged for harboring the wanted men inside the press syndicate building. Following the verdict, heavy security forces were deployed to the headquarters of the syndicate in downtown Cairo, amid calls for protests. Later in the day, dozens of journalists staged a sit-in outside the syndicate and chanted slogans, such as: ""Are we in a state or a jungle?"" Courts have since struck down and annulled el-Sissi's decision to transfer the islands to Saudi Arabia. Also on Saturday, a Giza Court sentenced in absentia three TV presenters to three years in prison each, on charges of spreading false news, disturbing public safety, and inciting sectarian tension. The three TV hosts, Mohammed Nasser, Moatz Matar, and Hisham Abdullah, are vocal el-Sissi critics and believed to be pro-Islamist. Their TV shows appear on el-Sharq network, which is said to be financed by Qatar and aired from Turkey. Turkey and Qatar are rivals of Egypt's el-Sissi, giving refuge to leaders and members of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood group, from which ousted President Morsi hails. The crackdown on press and speech freedoms intensified under Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the military ouster of the Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Many journalists and TV hosts were banned from appearing on TV, deported, or had their shows canceled. Reporters and photographers were arrested, detained, and tried over alleged links to Islamists. El-Sissi has been intolerant of criticism in the press and repeatedly said that stability and national security were a prerequisite for democracy. Defendants tried in absentia in Egypt typically receive maximum penalties, but receive an automatic retrial usually ending with lighter sentences if they turn themselves in.

Decades after Portland's peace protests earned it the nickname ""Little Beirut,"" its deep blue reputation has been cemented far beyond the Northwest via the exaggerated -- and sometimes spot-on -- stereotypes of the sketch comedy show ""Portlandia."" But in recent days, as protests erupted in several U.S. cities following Donald Trump's presidential election victory, Portland's mostly peaceful demonstrations were tainted by uncharacteristic violence. On Thursday, a march turned into a seething riot as baseball-bat-wielding anarchists took aim at plate-glass windows, windshields and electrical power boxes. Early Saturday, one protester was shot in the leg. Overnight Saturday, protesters filled downtown streets despite discouragement from city officials and demonstration organizers, and 71 people were arrested, most on charges of disorderly conduct. They were mostly male, with an average age of 25. Visibly frustrated at a news conference on Saturday afternoon, Mayor Charlie Hales said he had a message about Portland for the rest of the world: ""We're a proud liberal city,"" he said. ""I use that word with all affection despite the fact that it causes other people's blood to boil."" Violence here, he said, is ""not the norm."" On Sunday afternoon, hundreds of people gathered in the rain for what had been billed as a peaceful, family-friendly march to downtown's Pioneer Courthouse Square. They carried balloons and shouted ""Stronger! Together!"" One participant, 38-year-old Ella Gray, said she and her husband moved to Portland from New York a month ago ""to be safer."" When protesters smashed windows and lit fires in their new neighborhood on Thursday, Gray said, she was ""shocked it happened in, of all places, Portland.""     Police in Portland, Ore., said that protests against President-elect Donald Trump had turned into ""a riot,"" on Nov. 10, with some smashing windows and lighting fires in the streets. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)     ['It's now or never': How anti-Trump protests spread across the U.S.]   But Portland's kumbaya image isn't wholly reflective of its past -- or its complicated present. Tension is high over soaring rents and gentrification that are forcing out creative types and low-income residents. And the roots of racial inequality and white supremacy simmer under the clean exterior of a growing city where just 6 percent of the population is black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. When Oregon was admitted into the Union in 1859, it was founded as a white utopia, the only state with black exclusion laws written into its Constitution -- language that voters didn't take action to remove until 2000. The Ku Klux Klan found a stronghold in Oregon well through the 1920s, and a code of ethics for local real estate agents prohibited housing sales to nonwhites. Housing discrimination was finally outlawed in 1957.  The contentious presidential race and the election of Trump, whose campaign has energized white supremacists, seems to have provided an opportunity for Oregon's racial tensions to surface. A local high school was roiled last week after a commenter on the 2017 class's Facebook page suggested that students create a ""Ku Klux Klub."" On Election Day, dozens of students at a high school in a town north of Salem gathered with pro-Trump signs, displayed a Confederate flag and shouted comments including ""Pack your bags, you're leaving tomorrow"" to Hispanic students, the Salem Statesman Journal reported. ""Oregon is very rural and racist, even though we perpetuate progressiveness,"" Teressa Raiford, a Black Lives Matter protester and organizer of Don't Shoot Portland, said Thursday night.         1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flared up across the country as opponents of President-elect Donald Trump expressed dismay with the election results, underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting a fractured country.

""To me it's just a very unfair advantage,"" she said. ""It's another way of promoting their own privilege."" One self-identified anarchist, 20-year-old Armeanio Lewis -- not his real name, he says -- defended the Thursday violence. ""It's not against marginalized communities,"" he said Friday. ""It's a declaration that they're safe. We'll protect them."" He described the unrest ""an unleashment of rage"" at what he calls violence advocated by Trump. The chairman of the Oregon Republican Party, Bill Currier, called Sunday for Hales to resign and for Gov. Kate Brown (D) to deploy the Oregon National Guard to the city, according to the Portland Tribune. ""He has lost control,"" Currier said of Hales. ""The governor needs to step in to restore order."" After Thursday's violence, protest organizers struck a tone more familiar to Portland activism. Portland's Resistance, a loose group that led the initial demonstrations, held a ""heal-in"" Friday on the steps of City Hall. One organizer read a long list of demands the group wants fulfilled: Rent control, an end to police brutality, clean air and water, inclusion for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and stopping Nestle from opening a bottled water operation in the Columbia Gorge, among other things. He said all are necessary to position Portland as a progressive beacon under a Trump presidency.   [Demonstrators square off against opponents and police as Anti-Trump protests spread]   Emcee Adriane Ackerman directed the crowd to ""talk about our frustrations, our fears, our assets,"" and to refocus on what she called the potential harm of Trump's presidency. For an hour, the crowd of hundreds divided up by neighborhood and engaged in small group discussions. A man stood up in one group: ""The reason I'm here is I'm scared, I'm queer and I'm not happy about what . . . is going on right now."" But despite organizers' focus on the future, some in the crowd arrived with teeth gnashing and ready to march -- almost as if the previous night's violence had inspired them to lash out at the city's problems. A group of young people with black scarves over their faces carried full-length mirrors. ""That's for when the riot police come,"" one said. ""We'll show them their faces."" As Ackerman began to direct the crowd to come back together, cheers of ""Let us march"" drowned her out, and the crowd divided. By 8 p.m., the heal-in had transformed into a full-blown anti-Trump protest, with the crowds cheering ""No Trump! No KKK! No fascist U-S-A!"" But on Saturday, Jeff Surgeon, of Beaverton, Ore., watched that night's protest unfold wearing a jacket unzipped with a white Trump Pence shirt underneath. He smiled at the protesters. ""It's kind of crazy that people are so against Trump,"" he said. ""I don't think he's going to build an actual wall,"" Surgeon added. ""He just wants secure borders."" He points to other countries: ""Look at Korea, they have strict borders."" Surgeon said no protester had harassed him because of his shirt. ""Everybody's entitled to their free speech.""   In a Sunday afternoon march, families gathered with balloons and signs that boasted more positive messages: ""Kids Have a Voice Too!"" and ""This Mama Will Miss Obama."" The crowd chanted, ""Stronger! Together!"" If the afternoon march captured the do-gooder spirit of ""Portlandia,"" the mood of the previous day's protests was starting to boil, for a sixth night. Portland's Resistance held a candlelight vigil in Tom McCall Waterfront Park, where people gathered again to hear Gregory McKelvey, Lewis and others speak. Organizers were clear: They would not distance themselves from the behavior of anarchists -- those who they say had been blamed by Portland police and media for damage to the city. On Sunday afternoon, 10 windows remained broken in the Pearl District: at Chase Bank, Bank of America and a restaurant.   McKelvey, for a third time this week, quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.: ""A riot is the language of the unheard."" ""I don't think it's fair to blame any group for the actions of individuals,"" McKelvey told the crowd. ""I'm sick of singing 'We Shall Overcome.' Donald Trump is going to be president, and we need to overcome."" Nearby, as attendees gathered in the park, police were stationed under the Morrison Bridge.  Karin Brulliard in Washington contributed to this report. "

But as the results rolled in from across the country, and Clinton kept losing in key states, her supporters grew quieter and more desperate. Slowly at first, then faster, those who backed Donald Trump began to make their presence known.  Austin Daily, a 20-year old from Troy, N.Y., who is a sophomore at Catholic University stood amid a group of friends before midnight, reading the latest projections from his cellphone.  He voted for the first time this year, casting a ballot for Donald Trump. As the billionaire won Florida and North Carolina and stayed ahead in Michigan and Wisconsin, it began to seem as if his candidate would soon take over the Oval Office.  Daily was stunned. He had come to the White House in a blazer and tie prepared to protest a Clinton victory. Now he was getting ready to celebrate.

(Photo by Jasper Scherer/The Washington Post) (Jasper Scherer/TWP)  ""Every poll showed a victory for Clinton,"" Daily said. ""Not one poll showed a Trump victory. Not even Fox News."" Daily supported Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the primary. He acknowledged Trump's flaws, but was convinced the businessman was better suited to lead the country than the former New York senator and secretary of state.  ""The corruption of Hillary Clinton has kind of disqualified her for president,"" Daily said. ""I see Clinton as, if you're playing Russian roulette, there are six bullets in the revolver. With Trump, it's more like three.""  [A delirious night at the Trump Hotel in Washington]  Staffers from Avaaz, a globally minded civic organization for progressive causes such as climate change and the Syrian refugee crisis, had also come to the White House, planning to stage a choral performance outside the presidential mansion for at a rally that was aimed against Trump.  Its members prepared the stage and carried signs that spelled out ""We are better than bigotry."" By 10 p.m., Avaaz leader Andrew Nazdin said he was nervously realizing that his group may be about to host ""the first protest of the Trump administration.""      As Donald Trump's victory became apparent on election night, crowds of both Trump and Clinton supporters gathered at the White House. (Reuters)   He, and others who were staunch opponents of the Republican nominee and his divisive rhetoric, described a slowly engulfing fear. ""There has been a rise of hate-filled right wing politics all over the world,"" Nazdin said. Naja Nelson, a George Washington University student, suddenly felt voiceless. In addition to the White House, the GOP appeared to have captured both chambers of Congress, putting in peril the major policy initiatives President Obama championed during his two terms.  She wondered whether her vote for Clinton mattered. She wonders whether the efforts made to make women's and black lives matter mattered.  ""I'm starting to question everything,"" the 18-year-old said. ""I'm afraid things will go back to the way it was years ago. Racism has never gone away, but now those racists feel like they can step it up. . . . I mean, the KKK endorsed [Trump]. I don't know what's happening."" Howard University sophomore Kaylin Young said she could not ""even begin to describe"" how different it would be to go from a President Obama to a President Trump.  ""It's scary being a minority right now,"" Young said. ""The things that he said about minorities, the things that he said about people of different colors, of different nationalities, has been incredibly hurtful."" Not everyone who came to the White House was strongly partisan. Catholic University students Elizabeth Rich, Irene Wilson and Amanda Martin said they thought it was important to show awareness and to be present during their first presidential election while living in D.C.  Rich said she grudgingly cast her California absentee ballot for Trump because he is antiabortion, like her. But as a self-described feminist, she said the prospect of Trump winning does not excite her. ""I hate him as a human being and I get offended every time he speaks,"" Rich said. ""I just wish there was a better candidate. I think it's pathetic that as a nation we're choosing the person we hate less."" Wilson, 18, said she planned to write in John Kasich, but her absentee ballot didn't arrive from Michigan on time. ""I would have chosen Hillary, but because I am strongly pro-life, that was a difficult thing to put myself behind,"" she said. Martin, who cast an absentee ballot for Trump in Pennsylvania, said she was nevertheless worried about the prospect of his victory because she thinks it may damage the country's international image. Minister Carol Kelly, 64, and seminary student Bettina Hindes came to Lafayette Square to help sing in what they thought would be a new Democratic regime. Their excitement over Clinton, however, quickly turned into depression about Trump.  They sang along with the Avaaz activists -- songs like ""God Bless America."" The hymns sounded more funereal than celebratory.  Kelly, who is from College Park, said she had expected to ""put this polarizing election behind us and move toward progress"" after the voting. ""But I'm concerned if Trump is president we won't get that. He's so divisive,"" Kelly said. ""It is so disheartening. . . . It's time to head home."" After midnight, the crowd had grown to well over than 1,000 and was increasingly more vocal. Both Trump and Clinton supporters climbed trees to get a better view of the gathering, which seemed heavily dominated by college students.  Around 1 a.m., a group of Latino activists called United We Dream arrived with a big white sign that said: ""Donald Trump is a racist."" As the clock passed 2 a.m., and the race still hadn't been called, people began to pace aimlessly. The United We Dream group chanted ""Racism! Shut it down!"" Every so often, the Clinton crowd called out ""F-- Trump!,"" and sometimes a separate cluster of Trump supporters started its own chant in response:  ""Build that wall! Build that wall!""  At one point, they were drowned out by the Clinton die-hards.  ""I believe that we will win! I believe that we will win!"" By the time Trump was declared the winner and addressed jubilant supporters in New York, only a few hundred people were left. Most were Trump opponents. One burned a Trump hat. Someone burned a small American flag. A small circle of people near the north entrance to the White House chanted ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""si se puede,"" and ""no justice, no peace.""  But many more stood in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue NW, trying to make sense of what had just happened as they scrolled down their Twitter feeds. "

That could be good news for Hillary Clinton. At least 44.9 million people have cast ballots by early voting -- by mail or at polling stations, according to Associated Press data. Record levels have been reported in 28 states and the District of Columbia. Millions more ballots are still coming in. The AP estimates that early votes could top 50 million. That comes to nearly 40 percent of all ballots in a presidential election expected to have high turnout overall due to intense public interest. In 2012, there were 46 million early votes, or 35 percent.  ""Interest in early voting has been unprecedented in many states,"" said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor and expert on voter turnout who is a consultant to AP. The latest numbers show declines in voting from blacks in North Carolina -- a drop-off after historic levels for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. But higher turnout by Latinos, who often lean Democratic, may be buoying Clinton in Florida. Both are must-win states for Donald Trump. The Hispanic vote is also surging in Nevada and Colorado, where Democrats are running near or above their successful 2012 pace. Trump could be holding an edge in Ohio and Iowa, but that won't be enough if Latinos drive Clinton to victories in other battleground states. A look at early voting trends: ___ TOP BATTLEGROUNDS: FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA Trump's campaign acknowledges he can't win without Florida and North Carolina. In Florida, a record 6.4 million early ballots are already in, or more than three-fourths of the expected vote. Democrats are ahead, 39.9 percent to 38.5 percent. Democrats had slightly wider margins in 2008 and 2012. Obama narrowly won the state both years. While the black share of the vote is lower, ballots from Hispanics have nearly doubled to more than 976,000. Roughly one-third of those did not vote in 2012, according to an analysis by Daniel Smith, a University of Florida professor. That could help Clinton. Democrats are seeking to draw in new and sporadic voters to boost overall turnout. In North Carolina, more than two-thirds of the expected votes have been cast. Democrats lead in ballots submitted, 42 percent to 32 percent. Democrats were apparently hampered by fewer polling locations in the first week of early voting. After more locations opened, the party made up ground, but black turnout remains lower by nearly 65,000, or 8.6 percent. Republicans are running ahead of their 2012 pace, when Mitt Romney narrowly won the state. Scott Tranter, co-founder of the Republican data firm Optimus, said the outcome may hinge on unaffiliated voters and ticket-splitters. ""It's unclear whether Trump can consolidate 90 percent of the Republican Party,"" he said. ___ GOOD SIGNS FOR CLINTON Latinos may be boosting Clinton in the West. In Nevada, more than three-fourths of the likely vote has been cast. Democrats lead, 42 percent to 36 percent. That pace is largely comparable to 2012, when Obama won by 6 percentage points. Latino and Asian-American turnout are up by double-digits while black participation is down slightly. The white share of the vote is down, from 77 percent to 75 percent. In Colorado, the two parties are virtually tied at 35 percent. More than 70 percent of the ballots are in. At this point in 2012, Republicans held an advantage. Clinton also appears to be holding ground in other states won by Obama, but targeted by Trump. In Virginia, early voting has surpassed 2012 levels, lifted by higher turnout in Democratic-leaning northern counties. The state does not provide breakdowns by party. Turnout is also outpacing 2012 levels in Wisconsin, with bigger shares coming from Democratic counties such as Dane and Milwaukee. ___ GOOD SIGNS FOR TRUMP Trump may hold a slight edge in Iowa and Ohio. In Iowa, Democrats currently lead in early ballots, 41 percent to 35 percent. That is a narrower gap than in 2012. Republicans are matching 2012 levels while Democrats are running below. Obama won the state by 5 percentage points. Ohio does not provide breakdowns by party. But voter modeling for the AP by Catalist, a Democratic analytical firm, shows that black turnout continues to lag 2012 levels. African-Americans make up about 9 percent of the vote share, compared to 12 percent in 2012. Ballots from whites have risen. In Georgia, where early voting has already exceeded 2012 levels, turnout is up across racial groups. But ballots from whites have risen more. In all, blacks made up about 30 percent of early votes compared to 36 percent in 2012. White ballots rose from 63 percent to 66 percent. In Utah, Trump may be holding ground despite a challenge from third-party candidate Evan McMullin. Republicans lead in returned ballots, 49 percent to 13 percent for Democrats; no-party voters make up 34 percent. The Republican share is down from 2012 but has been improving, according to Catalist. ___ HOW MUCH WILL LATINOS BOOST CLINTON? Rising Latino participation could benefit Democrats in two Republican-leaning states. In Arizona, with more than two-thirds of the expected total votes cast, Republicans lead in balloting, 40 percent to 34 percent. That is a narrower gap compared to 2012, when the GOP led by roughly 10 percentage points. At least 4.5 million votes have been cast in Texas' top 15 counties, up 32 percent. The state does not provide party breakdowns, but voter modeling by Catalist found sharper rates of increases among Latinos. ___ AP's Election Research and Quality Control Group contributed to this report. ___ Follow Hope Yen on Twitter at http://twitter.com/hopeyen1 Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Ross D. Franklin/AP)  Arizona  Sen. John McCain (R) is poised to win a sixth term after a tough two-front battle with his state's far-right wing and Democrats accusing him of flipping his positions to fit the moment. McCain, 80, first had to get through a primary against Kelli Ward, who ran as a tea party insurgent proudly backing Donald Trump and aped Trump's criticism of McCain over veterans' legislation. McCain won comfortably, but received a tad more than 50 percent of the GOP vote. That set up a quick and potentially difficult general-election battle against Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D), who represents the state's largest district. But McCain quickly galvanized most of the Republican vote, running as a check against a possible Hillary Clinton presidency and trying to steer clear of discussing Trump. Kirkpatrick has aired tough ads showing McCain's changing positions, including in 2010 calling for a ""danged fence"" along the Mexican border. But Washington Democrats took a pass on engaging the race. Both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and its super PAC ally, Majority PAC, have not devoted resources to the race. McCain formally dumped Trump in early October. A CNN poll showed him with a 13-point edge in the past week.   -- Paul Kane     Harris gives a thumbs up to supporters during her visit to the campaign office of Rep. Ami Bera in Elk Grove, Calif., on Nov. 3. (Rich Pedroncelli/AP)  California When Sen. Barbara Boxer (D) announced her retirement, California Attorney General Kamala Harris became the instant front-runner. Other Democrats stepped back, and no strong Republicans came forward in the deep-blue state.  Enter Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D). Sanchez made it through the June primary, defeating several GOP candidates to finish a distant second to Harris. State election rules allow the top two finishers, regardless of party, to advance to the general election. But the Orange County congresswoman has struggled to catch up to Harris, who in recent polls was leading by more than 20 points. Sanchez has campaigned as a moderate and she'd hoped to mobilize Latinos, California's largest ethnic group. She has modest leads with Latino voters in polls, but Harris boasts double-digit margins with nearly every other demographic group. Harris has the backing of the California Democratic Party, labor unions and progressive groups, and President Obama, who appeared in a campaign ad for her. Sanchez, 56, would be the first Latina elected to the Senate. Harris, 52, whose parents emigrated from Jamaica and India, would become the second black woman elected to the Senate since 1992.  -- Vanessa Williams     Rubio, right, and Murphy debate on Oct. 26 at Broward College in Davie, Fla. (Wilfredo Lee/AP)  Florida The most important day in Florida's Senate race was June 22, when GOP Sen. Marco Rubio announced that he would seek reelection -- reversing a pledge he made when he began his ill-fated presidential campaign. Without Rubio, Republicans faced a messy primary featuring several unknown, untested candidates. Democrats, meanwhile, thought they had a winner in Rep. Patrick Murphy, a young up-and-comer who had triumphed in the nastiest and most expensive House race of 2012. Rubio's reversal instantly gave the GOP an advantage, and they have not given it up. Rubio and GOP allies have spent tens of millions of dollars attacking Murphy, trying to paint him as a spoiled rich kid with a questionable professional record. Murphy has fought back with ads capitalizing on Rubio's presidential ambitions and his poor Senate attendance record while pursuing them. But Democrats pulled millions of dollars of ad reservations over the course of the fall as other races proved to be more competitive, leaving Murphy unable to match Rubio dollar for dollar.  Murphy hasn't caught up in polling, but he's not far behind. A late influx of Democratic spending and a stronger-than-expected Clinton win could spell an upset -- and a devastating loss for Rubio.  -- Mike DeBonis     Kirk, right, and Duckworth debate on Oct. 27 at the University of Illinois in Springfield. (Seth Perlman/AP)  Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk (R) has used a wheelchair since he had a stroke in 2012, and against virtually any other opponent, his return to the Senate would be a powerful narrative on which to run.  But his Democratic opponent, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, has a story just as powerful, having lost her legs in 2004 when her helicopter in Iraq was struck by an enemy rocket. It was during her recuperation that her home state's two Democratic senators -- Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama -- drafted her into politics. She has run a cautious but competent campaign withstanding attacks on her tenure as head of the state Department of Veterans Affairs and on her thin legislative record.  For Kirk, meanwhile, reelection was a tough bet, as Illinois last elected a Republican senator in a presidential year in 1972. And Kirk is his own worst enemy, talking his way into controversies that culminated in the most stunning congressional debate gaffe of 2016.  After Duckworth described her family's military heritage, Kirk said he had ""forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington."" Although Duckworth's mother is a Thai immigrant, her late father's lineage can be traced to the Revolution.  -- Mike DeBonis      Bayh participates in debate for Indiana's open U.S. Senate seat in Indianapolis on Oct. 18. (Michael Conroy/AP)     Young participates in debate for Indiana's open U.S. Senate seat in Indianapolis on Oct. 18. (Michael Conroy/AP)    Indiana Everything changed in Indiana's Senate race when former senator Evan Bayh (D) announced on July 11 that he would be running to retake his seat. Until that day, Republicans were convinced that Rep. Todd C. Young (R) had an easy path to victory. Bayh entered the race with strong support from Democrats, who have fond memories of his time as governor and senator.  But Bayh proved ill-prepared for a punishing Senate contest and has been pummeled by accusations that he is a Washington insider who is out of touch with Hoosiers. First, he incorrectly listed the address of his Indianapolis condominium, then he battled reports that he spent the final days of his last Senate term interviewing for high-paying jobs.  A poll conducted Oct. 22 to Nov. 3 by WTHR-TV and Howey Politics shows Bayh trailing by five points.  Young, who served as a Marine, has made a name in the state as fresh-faced alternative to Bayh's storied career. His campaign has benefited from a flood of outside support from groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Senate Leadership Fund, the Karl Rove-backed super PAC run by former aides to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).  -- Kelsey Snell      Kander speaks to supporters at a St. Louis union hall on Nov. 1. (Jim Salter/AP)     Blunt, left, and his wife, Abigail, campaigns in Missouri on Oct. 8. (David Weigel/The Washington Post)    Missouri Many Republican and Democratic operatives agree: No Senate challenger has run a better race than Jason Kander (D), Missouri's secretary of state. It was a viral TV ad that had Kander assembling a military-style rifle with a blindfold that caught Washington's eye, but it's months of disciplined, pitch-perfect campaigning that puts him within a hair of unseating Roy Blunt (R) in a state likely to favor Donald Trump by double digits.  Kander, who was an Army intelligence officer, has leaned heavily on his military background and has found a receptive audience for his attacks on Blunt as a Washington insider.  Republican groups have been forced to come to Blunt's rescue, financing ads linking Kander to Hillary Clinton and President Obama -- some of them showing Kander's face morphing into theirs. Kander, meanwhile, has not passed up an opportunity to remind voters that Blunt lives in a D.C. mansion and that his wife and three of his children are lobbyists. And although Blunt has not distanced himself from Trump, he fits the profile of the D.C. denizen Trump is running against. Virtually every independent poll since September has shown a tied race or Blunt leading within the margin of error.  -- Mike DeBonis     Cortez Masto shakes hands with Heck after an Oct. 14 debate in North Las Vegas. (Erik Verduzco/AP)  Nevada Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid's retirement announcement rocked Nevada's political scene, creating the GOP's only chance to capture a Democratic seat on the Senate battleground. The race pits Rep. Joe Heck (R), who represents the Las Vegas suburbs, against former state attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto (D), who would be the first Latina senator. The state is difficult to poll, both because of its new Hispanic population and because employees working in the Las Vegas gambling and nightlife industry are hard to reach. Divergent polls show Heck leading by about seven points, or Cortez Masto ahead by the same margin. Neither candidate has broken through policy-wise, nor has either's personality crashed through the din of commercials here. Much of Heck's campaign isn't focused on his rival but instead on Reid -- casting him as a villain who chose his puppet to succeed him. And Cortez Masto's is focused on Donald Trump, trying to energize Hispanics and mocking Heck's wavering support for the GOP nominee. The race may be decided in ""the rurals,"" counties far away from the Las Vegas Strip where Trump is expected to do well. Heck has withdrawn his support for Trump and called for him to quit the race, which may be why he is underperforming there.  -- Paul Kane     Ayotte, left, and Hassan during a Nov. 2 debate. (Jim Cole/AP)  New Hampshire For months, polls in New Hampshire have shown Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) in a near dead heat with Gov. Maggie Hassan (D). The latest Boston Globe poll, conducted at the end of October, showed Ayotte leading by 2.5 points, well within the margin of error.  The outcome of the closely watched race is expected to play a critical role in determining which party will hold the Senate majority next year. Ayotte, a former state attorney general, has struggled to overcome a powerful downdraft created by the unpopularity of Donald Trump. She sank in the polls when struggling to respond to a leaked 2005 recording of Trump talking about kissing women and grabbing them without their consent -- at first standing by Trump and eventually rescinding her support.  Hassan has benefited from running as a well-liked sitting governor but she has struggled to eke out a consistent lead. Hassan had to overcome her own gaffe when she struggled to answer whether she thinks Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy.  The race has attracted more than $89 million in spending from outside groups, making it the second most expensive Senate contest this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   -- Kelsey Snell      Strickland greets a poll worker before voting at the Franklin County Board of Elections on Oct. 27. (Jay Laprete/AP)     Portman tours Pioneer Pipe while campaigning in Marietta, Ohio, on Oct. 25. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)    Ohio  Sen. Rob Portman (R) was originally expected to be fighting for his political life in the campaign's final days.  A consummate insider, having worked in both Bush administrations and as part of the House GOP leadership, he seemed ill-suited for the anti-Washington environment epitomizing this cycle.  But Portman seems to have prevailed after running what was probably the best race of any Republican candidate this year. He raised more money than all but one Senate Republican (Patrick J. Toomey, who is in a close contest), and spent it early and often, a smart tactic in hindsight.  His ads reintroducing voters to their first-term senator were effective, portraying his work to fight an opioid crisis with Senate legislation and to combat sex trafficking. Meanwhile, Portman's negative ads battered Ted Strickland, who began the race as a well-liked former governor. But after being reminded of the job losses during Strickland's term, voters had turned against the ex-governor by late August. National Democrats abandoned the race. Of the 10 most recent public polls, all in October, Portman had a lead of at least 11 points. GOP strategists are already studying this campaign as a blueprint for future Republican Senate races.   -- Paul Kane     Burr and Ross in a debate on Oct. 13. (Gerry Broome/AP)  North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr (R) cuts an increasingly rare figure on Capitol Hill, a low-octane throwback to a time when the soul of the GOP was country-club conservatism, not sharp-edged populism. He has the old-school campaign ethos to match.  National Republicans fumed as he stuck with the winning formula from his previous two runs: Keep your powder dry until October, then hold on for dear life at the end. His opponent is Deborah Ross, a lawyer and former state lawmaker whose record as a civil-rights advocate many assumed would be too liberal for the state.  But Ross has proven a masterful fundraiser and fierce campaigner, and an avalanche of ads highlighting her past objections to the state's sex-offender registry seem not to have deeply affected voters. Polls have shown a tight race for months, and although Burr has had a small lead in most recent polls, he has not been able to run far ahead of Donald Trump in a state where Democrats are making an extra-hard turnout push.  The final week was roiled when Burr was recorded in a private meeting cracking a joke about gun owners putting a ""bullseye"" on Hillary Clinton. Ross, meanwhile, has benefited from a pair of presidential visits.  -- Mike DeBonis     McGinty and Toomey at a debate at Temple University in Philadelphia on Oct. 24. (Matt Rourke/AP)  Pennsylvania The most expensive Senate race in history is in Pennsylvania, topping $140 million by late October, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.  The money reflects the stakes of this contest. Democrats always believed their path to the majority probably required knocking off Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R). Toomey tells supporters everywhere that their votes will keep the Senate in Republican hands. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the incoming Democratic leader, recruited neophyte Katie McGinty, persuading Vice President Biden to coax President Obama to endorse her in the primary.  Toomey and McGinty are basically deadlocked. McGinty has held a small lead in the past few polls -- but over the past month, four showed the race tied and four gave Toomey a slight lead.  Toomey is performing well in the vote-rich Philadelphia suburbs. But he is doing less so in the rural stretch between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, in part, strategists say, because he hasn't said whom he supports for president. That may work near Philadelphia, where Hillary Clinton is crushing Donald Trump, but Trump is well-liked elsewhere.  Whichever party wins this race will have the edge to win the majority.   -- Paul Kane      Johnson, left, and Feingold, right, meet in their second and final debate Oct. 18 in Milwaukee. (Mark Hoffman/AP)  Wisconsin For months, Democrats considered Wisconsin a near-certain pickup. It has been a reliably blue state in presidential years, one-term incumbent Ron Johnson (R) had not done much to raise his profile and well-known former senator Russell Feingold (D) had signed up for a rematch. Summer polls showed Feingold with a double-digit lead, but the well-respected Marquette Law School Poll found last week that that margin had shrunk to a single point amid a late GOP ad blitz.  In the final week of the campaign, about $6 million was spent by campaigns, party committees, super PACs and outside groups -- many of which had canceled earlier reservations. Johnson, an Oshkosh plastics manufacturer, has sought to refresh his image as a no-nonsense outsider businessman, while casting Feingold as a career politician and a throwback. Feingold, meanwhile, has relentlessly driven a middle-class economic message focused on opposition to trade deals and tax loopholes, while tarring Johnson as an advocate for corporate interests.  Although the race has tightened, Democrats and some Republicans think Feingold has an edge: Early voting has outpaced expectations in Democratic strongholds, and Johnson is only now showing signs of outpacing Donald Trump.  -- Mike DeBonis        The Democrats aren't likely to take back control of the House of Representatives on Election Day 2016, but they could see some wins.
