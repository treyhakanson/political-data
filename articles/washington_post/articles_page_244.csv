Security Council is set to vote on an extension of the mandate for inspectors charged with determining who is behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria. The resolution introduced Thursday would extend a joint investigation by the U.N. and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, set to expire on Friday. Investigators have determined that the Syrian government was behind at least three attacks involving chlorine gas and the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas. Western powers want the Security Council to impose sanctions on the Syrian government for using chemical weapons. But Russia, Syria's closest ally, has repeatedly questioned investigators' conclusions linking chemical weapons use to the regime of President Bashar Assad. Syria has denied its forces used chemical weapons. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

(left: Agence France-Presse via Getty Images; right: Associated Press)  Patrick Gathara is a strategic communications consultant, writer and award-winning political cartoonist in Kenya. To read more of Patrick's opinion pieces, visit his blog, Gathara's World, or follow him on Twitter (@gathara). Trevor Noah, the South African comedian and host of ""The Daily Show,"" a popular late-night news satire and talk show in the United States, once described Donald Trump as America's first African president. In fact, Americans could do worse than look to the continent in general, and Kenya in particular, for a preview of what life under a Trump administration would be like. President-elect Trump and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta have much in common. Both are fabulously wealthy, the children of privilege with questionable success in business, and both have been accused of fanning ethnic and racial hatred. Both have risen to head their respective countries in the most unlikely of circumstances and in the face of global opprobrium. Many across the world eschewed Trump's xenophobia and reckless approach to international affairs; Kenyatta faced similar opposition to his candidacy three years ago. This was a consequence of his - -and his running mate's -- indictment at the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity in relation to Kenya's 2008 post-election violence, in which more than 1,000 people died.      The International Criminal Court dropped ""crimes against humanity"" charges against Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday. Prosecutors say Kenyatta arranged a wave of deadly violence after Kenya's 2007 elections. (Reuters)   Trump and Kenyatta even have similar ideas about how countries should be governed. Take their shared suspicion of and contempt for the media. Where Trump has called journalists ""scum,"" ""illegitimate"" and ""horrible people"" and declared his aim to make it easier to sue them, Kenyatta regularly derides newspapers as only good for wrapping meat, and his administration has introduced laws meant to stifle independent reporting. It has arrested and beaten journalists who persist in asking uncomfortable questions, and, leveraging its advertising and regulatory muscle, leaned on media houses to fire journalists or pull their stories. Just recently, in response to a spate of corruption stories, Kenyatta declared that journalists should be required to prove any allegation of government graft they dared to report on or face the consequences. When it comes to fighting terrorists, the two leaders' pronouncements are also remarkably similar. Both Trump and Kenyatta prefer to speak in vague and bombastic terms and to demonize Muslim refugees and immigrants rather than offer detailed policy prescriptions. Trump says his plan for defeating the Islamic State is a secret whose details he won't be revealing to the public anytime soon. One hopes he'll be sharing them with U.S. generals, as he claims to know more about fighting extremists than they do. The Kenyatta administration, after all, has taken more than three years to come up with a strategy to tackle radicalization and is no closer than Trump to articulating a strategy to defeat the al-Shabab, the Somali-based terrorist group that has murdered nearly 800 Kenyans, most of them after Kenyatta took office. There is also the question of whether Trump will follow through on his oft-repeated promise to get Mexico to pay for a wall on the United States' southern border to keep out immigrants (which Mexico has repeatedly vowed not to do). Here, too, Kenyatta can offer some guidance. Depending on which of its officials you choose to believe, the Kenyatta government is building a wall to keep out terrorists either along the entire 700-kilometer border with Somalia or just on a small section near the border town of Mandera. It may or may not be a physical barrier (there has been some talk of a human wall), and its construction is either ongoing or has stalled. In addition to the wall, Trump has vowed to round up and deport illegal immigrants, who he says are gaming and mooching off the system, driving up crime, taking jobs and opportunities away from U.S. citizens, and depressing wages in America. That little of this is true doesn't seem to matter a whole lot. Similarly, the Kenyatta regime has developed a fondness for demonizing refugees from Somalia, blaming them for everything from terrorist attacks to draining the Kenyan economy, as a way of distracting from its own failures. In 2014, under Operation Usalama Watch, it began rounding up and deporting them, and restricting those that remained to the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps in the desolate north. This year, the government declared it would close the Dadaab camp by the end of this month and has been effectively dumping hapless and unwilling refugees back into their war-ravaged country ever since. (That effort has been suspended following an international outcry). In September 2013, the prolific Ugandan columnist Charles Onyango-Obbo wrote that the International Criminal Court ""had finally made Kenya an African country."" What he meant was that as the government worked to scuttle the cases against the president and his deputy (and with them any prospect of accountability for the 2008 violence), it had brought the country into closer alignment with authoritarian regimes in vogue across much of the rest of the continent. In similar fashion, it is perhaps not so far off the mark to suggest that with the election of Trump, America too has become something of an African country."

Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin made the revelation after Ahmad Khan Rahimi pleaded not guilty to an indictment charging him in the Sept. 17 attacks, which wounded 30 people when a pressure cooker bomb exploded in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. Another bomb nearby did not explode. Lewin told U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman that evidence against Rahimi includes two FBI reports of statements he made across multiple days after his Sept. 19 capture during a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey. The prosecutor didn't disclose what Rahimi told the FBI. Other evidence prosecutors plan to turn over to defense lawyers within weeks includes video clips of Rahimi's movements on the day of the bombings, internet records showing he bought bomb-making materials and proof his fingerprints and DNA were found on explosive devices, Lewin said. Besides the Manhattan attacks, Rahimi, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen from Elizabeth, New Jersey, is charged with detonating a pipe bomb along a Marine Corps charity race in Seaside Park, New Jersey, earlier in the day. Another bomb found at a train station didn't explode. The prosecutor said video clips would show Rahimi ""carrying and planting"" at least one of the bombs. The videos show him carrying bags outside his New Jersey home, walking on the Manhattan street where the injuries occurred and leaving materials in a bag a few streets away where the second pressure cooker bomb was found, he said. Rahimi, who was hospitalized with gunshot wounds after the Sept. 19 police shootout, coughed into his shirt repeatedly during his court appearance on Thursday as his lawyers, Peggy Cross-Goldenberg and Sabrina Shroff, gave him water. Cross-Goldenberg said he had to cut short a medical appointment to come to court, and she suggested hearings be held sparingly. The judge scheduled one for next month and January, though no trial date was set.  ""Not guilty is the plea you want to enter?"" the judge asked Rahimi after describing the eight-count indictment.  ""Yes, sir,"" Rahimi responded. Initially after Rahimi was captured judges in both states denied attempts by public defenders to represent him, agreeing with prosecutors' arguments he hadn't officially been arrested by federal authorities. Rahimi's father and wife requested the American Civil Liberties Union represent him until he was appointed a lawyer. The ACLU was able to step in after about a week, and then Rahimi's family was allowed to speak with his doctors for the first time. The ACLU said then that denying Rahimi's right to a lawyer after his capture in New Jersey violated the Constitution and sacrificed civil liberties in the name of national security. Rahimi is still recovering from multiple bullet wounds. He was moved last week to a federal lockup next to the Manhattan courthouse. If convicted of all charges, he could face a mandatory life prison sentence. The head of New York's FBI office, William Sweeney, said Rahimi ""had no regard for human life when he allegedly placed not one but four bombs in the New York and New Jersey area in September."" He said in a statement ""it's clear that Rahimi's goal was to bring fear and destruction to innocent people."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Thompson)  If you are tired of reading about Donald Trump, take a look a this. Peter Greene,  a veteran teacher of English in a small town in Pennsylvania, wrote on his  lively Curmudgucation blog that he has found himself in conversations about standardized testing that go something like this: people who like standardized testing defend it to the max while he counters that the number of standardized tests necessary for students to take is zero. For taking that position he writes, he has been called a ""union shill,"" lectured that data from these tests are the life blood of education, and asked to be explain what the alternative to standardized testing is. Here in this post, he explains his thinking. This is a shortened version of the original, which you can find here.   By Peter Greene Is there such a thing as a useful standardized test? To have this conversation, we have to get one thing out of the way. If you believe (and I think some school reformers sincerely do) that the only reason that teachers oppose the current high stakes test-and-punish status quo is because their self-serving union tells them to, you are blinding yourself to some real issues. First, there is a real gulf between national union leadership and rank-and-file teachers precisely because union opposition to reformer policies has usually been tepid. Teacher opposition to testing comes first and foremost from teachers who have been watching testing become a toxic, destructive element in our classrooms that interferes with our ability to deliver real education. It's detrimental to our students. And it is used in many places to deliver a professional verdict on our schools and ourselves with an accuracy no greater than a roll of the dice. Opposition to testing also comes from other people who see how it plays out on the ground: parents. The Opt Out movement -- in which hundreds of thousands of parents have not allowed their children to take state-mandated accountability standardized tests -- was not created by teachers. It is not led by teachers -- and in some places, it is actually potentially damaging to teachers under the current bizarre test-driven accountability system. So if you imagine that test opposition is some sort of political ploy engineered top-down by unions, you are kidding yourself. None of That Answers the Question, so Let's Get Back To It  If I am such a dedicated opponent of standardized testing, what do I propose as an acceptable substitute? Let's first clarify our rather fuzzy terms. ""Standardized"" Test?  Come to think of it, we'd better clarify ""test"" as well. For many folks, it's only a ""test"" if the student is answering questions. A five-page paper assignment, for instance, is usually not called a test. In fact, the more open-ended the assessment, the less likely folks are to call it a ""test."" ""Standardized"" when applied to a test can mean any or all (well, most) of the following: mass-produced, mass-administered, simultaneously mass-administered, objective, created by a third party, scored by a third party, reported to a third party, formative, summative, norm-referenced or criterion-referenced. This broad palate of definitions means that conversations about standardized testing often run at cross-purposes. A teacher talking about performance assessment task piloting in New Hampshire may think she is making a case for standardization, while I think that performance assessment is pretty much the opposite of standardized testing. There's a lot of this happening in testing debates -- people arguing unproductively because they have very different things in mind. Acceptable substitute for what purpose? The confusion is further exacerbated by a myriad of stated and unstated purposes for standardized testing. This confusion about purpose has emerged as a huge issue in the ed debates because far too many of the amateurs designing testing policy don't understand this at all. At. All. It's not just that corporate school reformers argue that you can make the pig gain weight by measuring it. It's that they also assert that the scales used for weighing the pig can also be used to measure the voltage of your house's electrical system and the rate of water flow in the Upper Mississippi. If we want to find an acceptable test, we have to first declare what the test is going to be used for. Ranking schools, students and teachers This is where purpose becomes important. I can't think of a good test for achieving the goal of ranking students, teachers and schools -- for which many of today's ""accountability"" tests are used -- because I don't think these goals are worth achieving. As a teacher, I don't need to know how my student compares to students in Idaho. I don't need to know that as a parent, either. It's a fool's game to compare teachers to other teachers, schools to other schools, and students to other students. First of all, I can only make the comparison based on a narrowly defined criteria. Otherwise I'm reduced to deciding if my insensitive smart flabby artist student ranks lower or higher than my sensitive tall winning cross-country racer student. The comparison only has meaning if it is based on narrow criteria (which student answered the most math problems correctly on Tuesday) -- but what good is a narrowly defined comparison? If I find that my smart, funny wife is not as smart and funny as some other woman, should I be unhappy in my marriage? If this delicious steak is not as delicious as the steak I had last night, should I spit it out? If all the teachers in my school are great, should it be closed down because some other school has greater ones? The signature feature of a ranking system is that it locates losers. But what decent teacher would stand in front of a class of 30 on the first day of school and say, ""Five of you will turn out to be losers."" Ranking and rating means that even if everyone is excellent, the least excellent must be marked Below Basic or Underperforming or Just Not Good Enough. A system based on ranking and rating is a system that assumes that in every endeavor, there are people who just aren't good enough. I reject that view of the world, and so I reject any testing system designed to reinforce that view. If everybody in my classroom does a great job, everybody in my classroom gets an A. Providing feedback for parents Here we have a standardization problem because not all parents want the same feedback. Is she getting an A? Is she passing? Is she developing a better grasp of abstract language particularly as used in classic literature? Is she okay? Does she seem happy? These are all types of feedback I've been asked for by some parents. What one measuring tool would satisfy all those questions? Standardized testing is repeatedly sold with the myth of the clueless parents, the parents who have no idea how their students are doing. But the solution to this problem is transparency, the levels of which can be controlled by the parents. For example, the electronic gradebook. Our parents can look up their students any time and see exactly what I see when I pull up the gradebook. Some of my parents look every day. Some look never. Some look and then call or email me to ask, ""So what exactly was this one assignment."" When we control the available information, we do parents a disservice. Only revealing the grade at report card time is a disservice. But anyone who has taught at a school with big detailed portfolio gradeless systems can tell the story of the parent who looked at all that data and said, ""Look, can you just tell me what grade she's getting?"" Parents deserve just as much feedback as they want. Standardized testing has nothing to do with providing that. Feedback for teachers Any decent teacher generates this kind of data daily. Any lousy teacher will have no use for standardized test data even if it arrives on gold-clothed ponies. You are dodging the question Okay, yes. I've laid out my usual assortment of objections to standardized testing, but I still haven't said what would be an acceptable substitute. If you're still here, I'll try to address that now. What qualities would an acceptable-to-me standardized test have? If I ever were to find a standardized test that I could live with (or even date regularly), this is what it would look like.  Criterion-based (and so, objective) If I'm going to measure my students against a standard, not against each other, I can use the test to answer the question, ""Do my students know how to find verbs"" or ""Can my students identify dependent clauses?"" If every student in my class can't potentially get a top score, I'm not interested. And if it's not objectively scoreable, it's no help. That means that no standardized test is going to be used for any higher-order critical thinking-type skills. (This is part of the whole point of Depth of Knowledge testing love -- it creates the illusion that higher order stuff can be scored objectively. But it can't). It is possible to come up with standardized questions. I once had a textbook with great literature questions -- but I still had to evaluate the answers myself. In fact, I can only see using a standardized test for checking the lowest levels of simple operations -- simple recall, basic application. As Close to Authentic as Possible I want a task that actually assesses what it claims to assess. Multiple-choice questions don't assess writing skills. Click-and-drag questions don't assess critical thinking. Transparent  This ought to go without saying, but if I, the teacher, don't get to see the questions, the answers, and the exact results from my students, then, no, thank you. I can do better myself. Adaptable I rarely re-use my own test-like assessments; instead, I make new ones each year to fit the class and the instruction. Particularly when I'm working summative assessments, I'll create something that focuses on the issues with which we are addressing. For instance, if we're solid on spotting infinitive phrases but have trouble picking out gerunds used as direct objects, I can design a test that will help both me and my students. Expertise and Convenience There are lots of things I don't know. Materials prepared by people who are experts in particular areas are a necessary aid, and those sometimes include assessments. I'm happy to have an expert in a particular field in my classroom. And at some points, I can use the convenience of having something pre-built to save me some time. So, the acceptable alternative...? Do I really think that there are no necessary standardized tests? Well, it is true that we all use standardization because we don't completely individualize everything from assessment through evaluation -- but that's a hugely broad definition of ""standardized."" By that standard, everything used with two or more students is a standardized test -- and it may be useful to think of standardization as a sliding scale. The more we broaden the reach of the assessment, the more students we try to make it each, and the more we try to make the grading of the test be quick and uniform, the less useful the assessment becomes. A test that you can give to every student in America and which can be scored in just a week will by necessity be inauthentic and measure little. So for best classroom assessment, we stay as close to the individualized specifics end as we possibly can. The more that an assessment is developed in response to specific instruction by a specific teacher of specific students, the more useful that assessment will be in performing the most useful function of any test -- telling students and teachers where their strengths and weaknesses lie. Yes, that information is not what the policymakers would really like to have. But the information they would like to have is completely useless to me in the classroom (and so far, they've found no reliable method for either collecting or using such information anyway). I'm not convinced that information can be collected by standardized tests anyway. I'm not saying that all standardized tests are evil. And stripped of baseless high-stakes consequences, their awfulness is greatly reduced. There are standardized tools that are tolerable, and a few that might rise to the level of useful. But necessary? Still zero."

Mike McCaul, R-Texas is under consideration for DHS secretary. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)  President-elect Donald Trump is considering two Republican members of Congress forDepartment of Homeland Security secretary, a critical post whose occupant would oversee his proposed crackdown on illegal immigration, people familiar with the deliberations said. The incoming chief executive is looking at Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the people said. Sessions, who helped shape Trump's hardline views on immigration, is also under consideration for other top administration jobs such as defense secretary. Other names being floated for the Homeland Security post include former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who leads Trump's transition team. But both are former U.S. attorneys also reportedly interested in being attorney general, so they could view DHS as a consolation prize. Several government officials said they had been told that a more incendiary choice - ousted Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio - is also under consideration. Arpaio, a vocal Trump supporter who lost his re-election bid this week, is known for forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and has long been accused of anti-Hispanic bias. But other people familiar with the deliberations said Arpaio is viewed as unable to win Senate confirmation. He is also 84-years-old and facing legal trouble. The longtime sheriff was recently charged with criminal contempt for resisting a judge's order that he stop detaining people solely on suspicion they were undocumented immigrants. Arpaio, whose wife is battling cancer, could face up to six months in jail if convicted.   [DOJ to move forward with criminal case v. Arpaio]   Few jobs are likely to be higher profile in the Trump administration than chief of DHS, the third-largest Cabinet department with more than 240,000 employees who do everything from fighting terrorism to protecting the president and enforcing the nation's immigration laws. Trump has pledged a crackdown on illegal immigration that would be unprecedented in American history and would require an exorbitantly expensive - and logistically difficult - operation to remove millions from the country. Overseeing it all would be DHS, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks primarily to coordinate the battle against terrorism but is now perhaps equally known for its immigration role. A beefed-up U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a DHS component, will be instrumental if Trump follows through on rounding up far more undocumented immigrants. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, also part of DHS, would come under increased pressure to better secure the southwest border. Perhaps the DHS's secretary's most controversial role would be to help oversee the building of Trump's wall along that border. The wall is the president-elect's signature proposal, but experts say it would face numerous obstacles, such as environmental and engineering problems and fights with ranchers and others who would resist giving up their land. The candidates would bring different strengths to the secretary position, a job made even more challenging by DHS's persistent management problems and employee morale that is among the federal government's lowest. McCaul is considered among the few leading Republicans with homeland security experience likely to be called upon for advice by Trump, since the previous GOP homeland security secretaries - Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff - blasted the GOP candidate in highly personal terms during the campaign. ""Anyone closely associated with the two of them is likely to be suspect at best and persona non grata at worst,'' said a former homeland security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the leading candidates. Sessions would bring familiarity with immigration and strong views on the subject, while Giuliani and Christie would bring management skills and close personal relationships with Trump. Easily the most controversial choice would be Arpaio, long known for his tough immigration enforcement. The sheriff of Arizona's Maricopa County, he was defeated Tuesday in his bid for a seventh term by his Democratic challenger. Word that Arpaio might be under consideration for DHS drew consternation Thursday in law enforcement circles, where he is considered by some to be a highly political maverick. Yet selecting Arpaio could win Trump plaudits from his political base. ""If Trump is really embracing the seriousness of being President,'' one former homeland security official said, ""I hope he would see the complexities of DHS and not try to compare that to running a sheriff's office.''"

Ryan on Capitol Hill Thursday. (Reuters/Joshua Roberts)  One of the biggest super PACs that backed Donald Trump's election is refashioning itself to serve as his main outside ally, planning to put pressure on Democrats and Republicans alike who try to stymie the new president's agenda. Great America PAC spent roughly $30 million on TV and radio ads, phone calls, mailers, and a ground organization to support Trump since it formed in February, amassing a list of 250,000 donors. The group is now aiming to tap those contributors -- which includes both billionaires and small-dollar givers -- to finance a permanent effort to support Trump's legislative plans, officials told The Washington Post. Ed Rollins, the group's senior strategist, said he learned from his work in the Reagan White House the value of an outside operation that keeps supporters engaged. ""The margins are such that, from time to time, you will have to put some pressure on members,"" he said, adding that Great America can serve as ""a tool that can go out and build support in the midterms and for his reelection."" ""It's something the president-elect doesn't know he needs, but he does need it,"" Rollins added. The super PAC's new role resembles that of Organizing for Action, the nonprofit advocacy group that grew out of President Obama's reelection campaign. But unlike OFA, Great America intends to target the new president's opponents in both parties -- potentially fueling tensions within the GOP, which was deeply split over Trump's candidacy. ""Suppose there's a battle between him and [Speaker Paul] Ryan or someone else,"" Rollins said. ""We can go out there and do what's in the best interest of Trump."" Great America was one of the first super PACs created to back the real estate developer, who at the time was still denouncing his opponents for relying on outside groups. Undeterred, Great America sought to build a grass-roots presence to augment Trump's lean campaign operation.   [Trump's huge transition will start with his tight inner circle]   ""We were a real campaign,"" said Eric Beach, the super PAC's co-chairman, noting that Great America had field offices in 10 states and financed a bus tour featuring surrogates such as actor Jon Voight and former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani. In addition, Great America invested heavily in contacting voters via phone and direct mail, as well as radio ads, building a data file of close to 30 million voters. ""We are going to be able to utilize that to help other candidates,"" Beach said. Unlike most super PACs, the group courted small donors, bringing in at least $7.8 million in contributions of $200 or less through Oct. 19, according to federal campaign finance filings. But it also received an infusion of cash from wealthy Trump supporters who gave seven-figure sums. Great America raised $9 million in the final weeks of the campaign from just three donors, Beach said: Laurie J. Perlmutter, wife of Marvel Entertainment chief executive Isaac Perlmutter ($5 million), Dallas banker Andy Beal ($2 million) and Houston Texans owner Robert C. McNair ($2 million). The super PAC's donors are eager to see its work go on, Beach said. ""They have already committed to us that they want to continue the mission,"" he said. Rollins and Beach said they have not been in contact with Trump or his advisers about their plans. But Rollins said he saw the real estate mogul at the Al Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York in late October, when the then-candidate complimented the group's work. ""He loved my ads -- he said he thought they were the best ads out there,"" Rollins said. Trump also sent messages expressing his gratitude during the campaign, Rollins added, saying he was eager to meet when it was over."

Clinton, backed by an emotional appeal from Barack Obama, urged voters to embrace a ""hopeful, inclusive, bighearted America,"" while Trump vowed to ""beat the corrupt system."" The candidates rallied voters late into the night, a frenzied end to a bitter election year that has laid bare the nation's deep economic and cultural divides. Clinton and Trump were both nostalgic at times, looking back fondly at a campaign that has put each on the brink of the presidency. Clinton campaigned with confidence, buoyed by FBI Director James Comey's announcement Sunday that he would not recommend criminal charges against her following a new email review. The FBI inquiry had sapped a surging Clinton momentum at a crucial moment in the race, though she still heads into Election Day with multiple paths to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the nation's first female president. Clinton closed her campaign alongside the last two Democrats to occupy the Oval Office, Obama and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, as well as first lady Michelle Obama. In a nod to the deep divisions that await the next president, Clinton said she'd come to ""regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became."" She cast the choice facing voters Tuesday as a ""test of our time.""  ""We know enough about my opponent, we know who he is,"" Clinton said, addressing tens of thousands of people sprawled across Philadelphia's Independence Mall. ""The real question for us is what kind of country we want to be."" Obama's address amounted to a valedictory for a president whose popularity has grown in his final year in office.  ""America, I'm betting on you one more time,"" Obama said. ""I am betting that tomorrow you will reject fear and choose hope."" Trump, who sped through five rallies Monday, recalled the rivals he'd vanquished and how far he's come since launching his improbable candidacy. As he surveyed the crowd in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he declared, ""It's been a long journey."" Still, Trump was aggressive to the end, slamming Clinton as the ""face of failure."" Having made the new FBI review a centerpiece of his closing case to voters, he argued that the Democrat was being protected by a ""totally rigged system.""  ""You have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system and deliver justice,"" Trump said. ""Do not let this opportunity slip away."" The comments were a reminder that Comey's news, delivered in a letter to lawmakers on Sunday, was a doubled-edged sword for Clinton. While it vindicated her claims that the emails would not yield new evidence, it ensured that a controversy that has dogged her campaign from the start would follow her through Election Day. Across the country, nearly 24 million early ballots were cast under the shadow of Comey's initial announcement of a new email review. That number represents about half of the nearly 45 million people who had cast votes by Monday, according to Associated Press data. The inquiry involved material found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide. Comey said Sunday the FBI reviewed communications ""to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state."" Clinton tried to fly above the controversy Monday, making no mention of the FBI during her rallies. She was closing out her campaigning with a midnight rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Clinton is banking in part on high turnout -- particularly among Obama's young, diverse coalition of voters -- to carry her over the finish line Tuesday. Roughly half the states with advance voting have reported record turnout, including Florida and Nevada, which have booming Hispanic populations, a possible good sign for Clinton. In Florida alone, Hispanic participation is up by more than 453,000 votes, nearly doubling the 2012 level. Black turnout is up compared to 2012, but that share of the total vote is lower due to bigger jumps among Latinos and whites, according to University of Florida professor Daniel Smith In Nevada, where more than three-fourths of expected ballots have been cast, Democrats also lead, 42 percent to 36 percent. Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie downplayed the impact of increased Hispanic participation, telling reporters on a conference call, ""We feel that we're going to get a good share of those votes."" However, he sidestepped two questions about the level of Hispanic vote Trump needs to win the presidency. Without victories in Florida and Nevada, Trump's path to 270 electoral votes would be exceedingly narrow. He already must win nearly all of the roughly dozen battleground states. Trump had planned to keep up his breakneck travel schedule deep into Election Day, but aides revised plans, keeping the businessman in New York. Midway through his final day of travel Monday, Trump praised his supporters for having created a ""movement."" But he warned it would all slip away if he loses Tuesday.  ""Go vote,"" he urged. ""Or honestly, we've all wasted our time."" ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey, Hope Yen, Jonathan Lemire and Steve Peoples in Washington and Josh Lederman in Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed to this report. _ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC, Lisa Lerer at http://twitter.com/llerer and Jill Colvin at http://twitter.com/colvinj Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)  This week, President Obama told Americans that ""we don't operate on incomplete information."" It was a repudiation of FBI Director James B. Comey's decision to reveal publicly that his agency was reviewing documents relating to Hillary Clinton's emails. The truth, though, is that Comey has a track record of wading into politically charged conversations with little evidence in hand and major consequences in mind. He often undermines his superiors along the way. Last October, while speaking to an international police chief conference, Comey addressed the ""Ferguson effect,"" the idea that increased police scrutiny has led to a spike in violent crime because officers are fearful of doing their jobs. Researchers investigated and thoroughly debunked this idea, finding that the increased murder rate in 2015 was predominantly a localized phenomenon and within the range of year-to-year fluctuations. But even after Obama dismissed the theory for lack of statistical evidence, Comey entered the debate: ""The question [is] whether [increased scrutiny is] changing police behavior all over the country,"" he said to a room of hundreds of police officers. ""The answer is, I don't know. I don't know whether this explains it entirely, but I do have a strong sense that some part of the explanation is a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement over the last year. And that wind is surely changing behavior."" In May, the New York Times reported that Comey brought up this ""strong sense"" again, saying ""that while he could offer no statistical proof of the Ferguson Effect,"" he believed after speaking with a number of police officials that a ""viral video effect"" -- with officers wary of confronting suspects for fear of ending up on a video -- ""could well be at the heart of a spike in violent crime in some cities."" He again admitted that there was no evidence to support a link between violent crime and viral videos, which didn't stop him from implying, of course, that there was.   [James Comey has always believed in doing what's right and ignoring politics]        The Post's Matt Zapotosky explains why FBI Director James B. Comey has found himself at the center of the presidential campaign in recent days. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   And just this October, Comey said in a speech: ""In a nation of almost a million law enforcement officers and tens of millions of police encounters each year, a small group of [shooting] videos serve as proof of an epidemic ... Americans actually have no idea whether the number of black people or brown people or white people being shot by police is up, down, or sideways over the last 10 years."" In this statement, Comey implied that a lack of definitive data shows that there is no epidemic of police shootings of people of color. For Comey, no matter how little data exists, his own private assessment is enough to draw conclusions. It's dangerous for a top law enforcement official to embrace a theory with an underlying assumption that police need to resort to aggressive policing techniques without public scrutiny to do their job. And what makes this line of thinking even more damaging is that the dearth of information on police shootings is in large part due to his own agency's failure to collect such data in a reliable and unbiased way.  The FBI's data collection is incomplete: The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program captured less than 50 percent of homicides by law enforcement in 2003-2011. And the FBI only collects data on killings by law enforcement considered justifiable, so the data being collected, which is presented as objective, is already infused with law enforcement's own evaluation of the homicide. Collecting and publishing data embedded with the biased judgment of law enforcement creates a false sense of transparency and clouds the inquiry at the outset, much like Comey's most recent comments to Congress did with respect to Clinton's emails. In his letter to Congress last week, Comey once again pleaded ignorance: ""the F.B.I. cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant."" But his actions (with which his boss the attorney general disagreed) imply that the emails are significant, and to the dismay of Democrats and Republicans alike, the disclosure has had a major impact on the already-in-progress presidential election. Comey has yet again leveraged his own ignorance into powerful political messaging disguised as transparency. His history of making uninformed, yet substantial statements reveal at their most innocent, a penchant for irresponsible political meddling, and at their most nefarious, an active political agenda."
