For millions of us, whenever we think of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- 53 years ago this coming week -- we immediately recall the horrific images: the open presidential car, the stricken young president and his wife (in pink, with a pink pillbox hat on her head) beside him. The film has been shown so many times, seen by so many millions of people, it has entered the realm of myth: 486 frames of silent (but color) home-movie footage shot in bright sunshine at Dealey Plaza in Dallas on that day, by a Dallas resident named Abraham Zapruder. It is surely the most famous home movie ever filmed.  Now, Alexandra Zapruder, granddaughter of the videographer and a founder of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, has written a moving and enlightening account that is part memoir; part detailed history of the film and its (inestimable) role in the nation's understanding of the assassination; and part overview of the film as an inspiration for countless, often bizarre conspiracy theories, as well as for works of art as disparate as Michelangelo Antonioni's ""Blow-Up,"" Oliver Stone's ""JFK,"" Don DeLillo's ""Libra"" and ""Underworld,"" and a particularly inventive episode of ""Seinfeld."" So much history, embodied in a mere 26 seconds of footage! Not least, this film would one day be sold by the Zapruder heirs to the U.S. government for $16 million, the highest price ever paid for ""an American historical artifact,"" to be stored in the National Film Registry for scholars and historians to study. Alexandra Zapruder writes with passion and clarity about the vicissitudes of bearing a famous name without having been involved with its celebrity or notoriety. (""I could not get over my astonishment at seeing [Zapruder] in print so often."") She is very good at communicating a child's confused sense of being special and yet being admonished not to think of herself as special. Growing up in Dallas in the 1960s, after her grandfather's death, Alexandra knew virtually nothing about ""the film"" -- it was never discussed within the family, though as a child she was often told that her beloved grandfather ""should have been famous for who he was . . . and not for the film."" In time, Alexandra came to wonder ""about this thing called the Zapruder film: Why did people keep bringing it up . . . and what did other people know about it that I didn't?""    (Hachette Book Group)  Gradually she came to assimilate unspoken Zapruder family assumptions: ""We don't brag about the film. It is a gruesome, horrible record of President Kennedy's assassination, which was a tragic event for the country and the Kennedy family. It is nothing to be proud of. . . . We are tied to the film by chance and coincidence. It is an accident of fate. It happened to be taken by our grandfather and it happened to be called by our name. Apart from that, it has nothing to do with us.""  And yet, ironically, the film does have much to do with the Zapruders, who would inherit the perishable artifact after Abraham's death and be forced to deal with its ambiguous presence in our cultural history. If there is one predominant theme of ""Twenty-Six Seconds,"" it is that an individual cannot easily escape ""the inheritance of names, and how it shapes identity and life experiences.""   It is instructive to recall that the political climate of November 1963 was as bitterly polarized as our present-day United States. Reactionary hostility to the ""liberal"" Kennedy was at an all-time high at the time of the assassination; indeed, Dallas had become ""ground zero"" for a small knot of ultraconservatives (including the editor of the Dallas Morning News and H.L. Hunt, oil tycoon and ""the wealthiest man in the world"") who vehemently opposed him. Fervently convinced that the United States was in danger of an imminent communist takeover, the ultraconservatives believed that Kennedy's international policies and support for the United Nations were treasonous. In the days before his arrival, thousands of leaflets showing mug shots of Kennedy with the caption ""WANTED FOR TREASON"" flooded the city.  From the perspective of hyper-security-conscious 2016, it seems astonishing that in such a vitriolic atmosphere, the president of the United States was allowed to ride in an open, unprotected limousine, the route of the presidential procession mapped out and widely publicized beforehand. For many citizens of Dallas, including Abraham Zapruder, the assassination would seem initially to be a result of a right-wing plot. By November 1963, Zapruder had been working in the garment industry for 40 years. He'd begun as an immigrant (from Eastern Europe) in New York and had moved to Dallas in 1941, where he became a successful dress manufacturer; he was an avid Democrat, an enthusiastic supporter of Kennedy who would describe the experience of witnessing the assassination from such close quarters as a ""wound"" from which he never recovered. That Zapruder happened to film the assassination at all was something of a fluke, for he'd left his camera at home and had to be cajoled by his wife into returning to get it. He arrived early at Dealey Plaza to scout out a location; he would leave little to chance, positioning himself where the presidential motorcade was to pass closely. In his granddaughter Alexandra's words: ""Those first few seconds of the film are perfect: the sun is shining and you can clearly see the unmistakable, handsome face of the president . . . smiling, and raising his hand to wave. . . . For an instant, the back of a freeway sign obscures the limousine, and then the Kennedys reappear. 'As it came in line with my camera, I heard a shot,' Abe later recalled. The president's elbows fly up, his face distorted in pain, and he suddenly hunches forward. . . . The car dips into the lower part of the frame, and as the president's body sinks down in the car toward his wife, the fatal shot strikes him. 'And then I realized,' Abe said. 'I saw his head open up and I started yelling, ""They killed him! They killed him!"" ' ""  Following the assassination, there is panic and pandemonium at the scene, but Abraham Zapruder manages to return home and to examine the film he has taken, in something of a state of shock. From the first, the amateur filmmaker seemed to have realized: ""I've got it all on there.""   So lax was security at Dallas police headquarters after the assassination that alleged killer Lee Harvey Oswald -- arrested and held at the county jail -- was gunned down in a corridor two days later by a distraught Dallas nightclub operator named Jack Ruby. Since Oswald died before he could be interrogated in depth, the floodgates were open for conspiracy theories that ranged from the near-plausible to the absurd, based upon personal and idiosyncratic interpretations of the (mostly bootlegged) Zapruder film. These, Alexandra Zapruder does a diligent job of elucidating, though her patience may strike the reader as quixotic when she interviews, for instance, conspiracy theorist Robert Groden, who dismissed the Warren Report as ""nonsense"" and a ""massive cover-up,"" traveled to Kennedy's grave in Arlington National Cemetery in 1965 to introduce himself to the deceased president and ""swore to find out who killed him no matter how long it took and where it took him.""  The most notorious of the conspiracy theorists was the publicity-seeking New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, who misused his office to prosecute a fellow New Orleans citizen as a conspirator on virtually no evidence (the man was acquitted). Another conspiracy activist was the comedian Dick Gregory, who oversaw screenings of the bootlegged film ""to the flabbergasted attention of the media."" If Kennedy's assassination was a tragedy, the aftermath of competing and vociferous conspiracy theorists was a farce, with serious consequences: the undermining of trust in the U.S. government and in authority in general that continues to this day. ""Twenty-Six Seconds"" is at its most eloquent in confronting these issues, but it is also a meticulous record -- to some readers, perhaps over-meticulous -- of the history of the actual, perishable film. The author does not really attempt to integrate this expository material into the larger story; her transitions are blunt and pragmatic: ""Here I have to take a break for a brief technical explanation of the Bell and Howell movie camera and the development and duplication of double 8mm film."" But it is not difficult for the reader with little technical interest in film to simply skim by such sections in following the ""unbelievably torturous saga"" of the Zapruders, whose very ""dignity and restraint"" in talking publicly about the film ""had left a vacuum in the public story,"" not to their disadvantage. ""What I did not fully grasp until writing this book,"" the author writes, ""was that the ongoing life and intrusions of the film made it a living wound inside our family that could never fully heal. Over time, most of the American public moved on, deciding when and where -- or even if -- they wanted to revisit the JFK assassination. This was not so for my grandfather first of all, and then for my father.""  Committed by the lone, deranged Oswald, the assassination inaugurated an era of exceptional violence in the United States: assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.; rioting in racially distressed major cities. It has settled uneasily into our collective consciousness as an inadequately healed wound that defies our fullest understanding, even as we continue to be obsessed by it. In this eloquent passage, Alexandra Zapruder speaks for all who have found themselves unwittingly and innocently too close to the raging flames of history: ""From our point of view, the film represented a trauma for our grandfather. It was a source of pain for the Kennedys. It was a reminder of crushing disappointment and abandoned plans for my parents' generation. It was a burden. It was an intrusion. It was a serious and complicated responsibility. It was a moral dilemma. It brought public censure and personal attacks on our family. It appropriated our name and changed the course of our lives. In the end, it was a legacy we never asked for. . . . That anyone could refer to the Zapruder film as our family 'good fortune' shows a profound misunderstanding not only of what the film represented to us, but of who we are.""

(Reuters)   ""LINKED OUT"" ran the headline on Russian state television. The U.S.-based website LinkedIn, a social network for business professionals, is going to be blocked in Russia after a court found the company guilty of violating a law on data storage. Roskomnadzor, Russia's communications authority, told Interfax news agency on Thursday that the website would be blocked within 24 hours, and a number of Internet service providers appeared to have immediately begun blocking the website, according to media reports. The block of LinkedIn, a widely-used yet sometimes bemoaned social network not known for political activity, led to surprise and mirth from some quarters. However, there were also some major concerns that the move against LinkedIn could mark a newly restrictive environment on the Russian Internet. LinkedIn had been targeted under a law put in place by President Vladimir Putin in 2014 and came into force this year. The law, which was drawn up after social media was used to help organize widespread protests in Russia, required social networks with Russian users to store six months of data on Russian land. While Putin and other Russian officials said the move was designed with privacy concerns in mind, activists said that it would give the government a pretext to block social networks to shut them down. ""The aim of this law is to create . . . (another) quasi-legal pretext to close Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and all other services,"" Internet expert and blogger Anton Nossik told Reuters in 2014. Others were concerned that storing information about users on Russian soil would allow authorities to target opposition leaders and protesters. ""The aim is surveillance, obviously -- to make servers of the companies accessible to the Russian national system of online surveillance, SORM, and also to get the Internet giants effectively landed in Russia,"" Andrei Soldatov told WorldViews in an email. Soldatov is an expert on Russia's surveillance culture and the co-author of ""The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia's Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries.""  LinkedIn does not have a major presence in Russia, where it has a relatively modest 6 million users, but it has the distinction of being the first social network to be targeted under these laws. Russian authorities have said that the site was initially investigated because LinkedIn was known for having a bad privacy track record. In 2012, millions of LinkedIn passwords were stolen after the website was hacked. ""They have a bad track record: Every year there's a major scandal about the safety of user data,"" Roskomnadzor representative Vadim Ampelonsky told the Moscow Times in October, noting that while Facebook and Twitter had regular meetings with the agency, LinkedIn did not. A court ruled against LinkedIn in October, and an appeal against the decision was rejected by the Moscow city court on Nov. 10. ""The Russian court's decision has the potential to deny access to LinkedIn for the millions of members we have in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,"" LinkedIn said in a statement issued in response. Soldatov suggested that LinkedIn's relatively small size in Russia made it a target. ""They came after them because they believe LinkedIn is [a] relatively easy target in comparison with bigger companies, and they need to show some results they achieved in data localization,"" he said. ""It all stalled with bigger companies, so why not to try with LinkedIn?"" LinkedIn also has complied with Chinese data laws, setting it apart from many of its peers. Roskomnadzor told Reuters that LinkedIn's U.S. management had requested a meeting. Soldatov suggested that this may have been the intention. ""It's a game,"" he said. ""They expect LinkedIn to rush to the Kremlin for talks."" More on WorldViews Russia's war with Wikipedia"

The asymmetry of the Double Negatives.... According to the exit poll (current figures, which may be slightly revised), 18 percent of voters were ""double negatives,"" that is, had negative feelings toward both [Hillary] Clinton and [Donald] Trump. Of these 18 percent, 49 percent voted for Trump and only 29 percent voted for Clinton .... 2. The losing strategy: replicate Obama's 2012 coalition.... 3. Clinton campaign targeting: staggering incompetence. In an excellent Washington Post article, Jim Tankersley points out that in the closing weeks of the campaign, the Clinton campaign put more ads on the air in the Omaha market (aiming, presumably, at the 1 electoral vote of Nebraska [Congressional district] 2, since Iowa's 6 votes were clearly already lost) than in Michigan and Wisconsin combined (26 electoral votes).... In effect, Clinton was aiming for her 340th electoral vote and ignored the need to campaign for her 270th, which is the one that counts.... 5. The narrowness of the Obama Democratic coalition. The fact that Democratic voters are so clustered, concentrated heavily in central cities, sympathetic suburbs and university towns, has helped its presidential candidates in past elections (this one, not so much) but hurt them in congressional and legislative elections conducted in equal population districts...."
5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/11/17/trump-will-clip-the-wings-of-the-freedom-caucus/	Trump will clip the wings of the Freedom Caucus	"   Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) at his office last year in Washington. (Matt McClain/ The Washington Post)  On a day the incoming administration was reaching out to Democrats, members of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus demonstrated an extraordinary -- even for them -- obtuseness. The right-wing ideologues have started barking out orders and drawing lines in the sand: Obamacare in its entirety must go! The Senate filibuster must go! No infrastructure plan that isn't paid for! Silly geese. They imagine that the threat of exposing GOP leaders' insufficient conservative purity will make House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) quake in their boots. Apparently, the Freedom Caucus zealots missed the election of a non-conservative populist president with few, if any, objectives other than maintaining public adoration. Freedom Caucus fellows, you guys are about to be run over by a combination of ""establishment"" Republicans and Democrats who jettisoned the ""small government"" fixation months ago. Ryan, McConnell and President-elect Donald Trump don't need to kowtow to Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) or Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.). If Trump wants a big, overstuffed infrastructure bill, he'll get one -- with Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) supplying more than enough votes. So long as there is a president willing to go to the left to pass his agenda, the Freedom Caucus becomes largely irrelevant. Yes, it really is delightful, isn't it?      House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on Nov. 10 showed President-elect Donald Trump the view from his office's balcony. (Reuters)   Well, you say, there over in the Senate is Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who is still determined to get his 100 percent rating from Heritage Action. He could threaten to hold up legislation, right? Well, he might want to argue for keeping the filibuster, then. But with or without the filibuster, McConnell can now go to his bloc of 51 colleagues and a whole slew of Democrats to get business done. Collectively, they can shut down (and up) Cruz and cut deals with the White House. McConnell and Trump are both dealmakers, less concerned with ideological purity than most every president/majority leader combo (of the same party) in recent memory (e.g. President Obama/Sen. Harry Reid; President George W. Bush/Sen. Bill Frist; President Bill Clinton/Sen. George Mitchell). McConnell wants conservative judges; beyond that, there's a lot of room to deal. Democrats, if they have not already realized this, should understand that they have more power than the ideologically inflexible Freedom Caucus. The Democrats can deliver votes for a huge infrastructure bill. The Democrats can give Trump votes for Obamacare reform that doesn't look all that different from the original. Why would Trump need to deal with the penny-pinching Freedom Caucus and the perpetually angry Cruz (who wants to take things away from people) when he has the Democratic elves to help him spreed good cheer -- and pork? The Democrats will go to the mat to stop immigration roundups and other horrors. They will stand with the ""little guy"" against tax cuts for the rich. If Trump really wants to round up 11 million people or add trillions to the debt while giving his fellow moguls huge tax relief, he'll have to rely on Republicans. (You can almost see Sen. Chuck Schumer's Cheshire Cat grin at the prospect that Republicans will need to take sole responsibility for highly unpopular items -- that is, if Trump really wants them.) On judges, Democrats, if they don't want to lose the filibuster, will have to work on picking off stray Republicans to block picks they feel are the most egregious. Democrats, like Republicans under Obama, won't have the power to stop executive orders, although they will mount court challenges. Moreover, because Trump does not appear to have any fixed ideas, Schumer (D-N.Y.) and company might try some wacky trades that no other GOP president would consider. For example, Trump signs the Employment Non-Discrimination Act to protect gays in the workplace; Democrats vote for the Keystone XL pipeline. Trump increases federal college tuition subsidies; Democrats get to stop those on the no-fly list from buying guns (something Trump was interested in doing anyway). Deals, deals, deals. Spend, spend, spend. By the time the 2018 elections roll around, Trump may be doing ads for Democratic Senate incumbents. (Remember, Trump loves borrowing so much that running up the U.S. debt should not faze him.) To recap, the Freedom Caucus has far less power than it thinks, as do groups like Heritage Action that want to enforce conservative orthodoxy despite popular opposition. Democrats will do their best to block Trump on some nominations, nix tax cuts for the rich and prevent inhumane measures on immigration. Aside from that, Schumer may get much more from a Trump administration than would have been gettable under a Hillary Clinton presidency (the GOP would have crawled over glass to thwart Clinton at every turn). Welcome to the bizarro world of Trump-era politics. Welcome to the demise of the Freedom Caucus."

Warplanes from a U.S.-led coalition provided air cover for the fighters from the Syria Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters formed last year with the aim of incorporating non-Kurdish elements into the mainly Kurdish militia fighting IS in Syria. The SDF announced the start of the campaign to liberate Raqqa at a news conference Sunday in northern Syria, and the United States, France and Britain said they would provide air support for the offensive, dubbed ""Eurphrates Rage."" But the battle for the Syrian city, home to nearly 200,000 mostly Sunni Arabs and an estimated 5,000 IS militants including many foreigners, could be long and costly. IS fighters are expected to fight until the end, considering that losing Raqqa would mean the extremist group would not fully control any large cities in Syria, where a civil war has been raging for more than five years. At the same time, Iraqi forces are pushing forward against Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and the militants' biggest urban stronghold in that country. SDF fighters needed more than two months earlier this year to capture the Syrian town of Manbij, which is far smaller than Raqqa. Raqqa has been under IS control since early 2014 and is home to some of the group's top leaders. It has been the extremists' self-styled capital since they declared a caliphate in areas they captured that year in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. commander of coalition forces fighting IS said the Raqqa operation is aimed at eventually cutting off the extremists from Mosul, where U.S.-backed Iraqi forces have entered the city's eastern outskirts amid fierce resistance. Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend said the Arab element of the SDF is ""indigenous to the area"" and will help establish ""regional support"" for SDF operations. His comments appeared to be aimed at soothing concerns that Kurdish forces would take over the predominantly Sunni Arab city. A spokeswoman for the Raqqa campaign said the SDF as a whole is half-Arab and half-Kurdish, but the 30,000 troops fighting in the Raqqa campaign are 80 percent Arab. Many in Syria are wary of those figures, and they fear that the Kurds are aiming to carve out an autonomous state in Syria. The activist media group that calls itself Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, which was originally formed to smuggle information out of Islamic State territory, says the SDF is 80 percent Kurdish. Unlike other successful military efforts to drive Islamic State out of cities in Iraq, the Raqqa offensive faces several political obstacles. In Iraq, the U.S.-led coalition is working with the government in Baghdad, but Washington and its partners in Syria rely on a mixture of Arab and Kurdish opposition groups, some of which are bitter rivals. Tensions are exacerbated by Russian and Syrian forces on one side and Turkish-backed forces on another. On Monday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated Turkey's opposition to the use of Syrian Kurdish fighters against the Islamic State group. Turkey views the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militia, the People's Protection Units, or YPG, and its political wing as terrorist organizations. Erdogan did not make a direct reference to the Raqqa operation but said ""no one in the world will buy this naive attitude (of attacking) Daesh with another terror organization,"" using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. In Moscow, Stanislav Ivanov of the Institute of the World Economy and International Relations, a government-funded think-tank, said the Kurdish-led offensive on Raqqa reflects the Kurds' push for creating their own state and winning a stake in future peace talks.  ""The 40 million Kurdish people would never abandon their push for creating their own state,"" Ivanov said in remarks carried by the state news agency Tass. He said the Kurds would probably refrain from entering the city and would limit themselves to controlling access to it.  ""It's not part of the Kurds' plan to engage in fighting with the Sunni Arab majority of Raqqa,"" he said. ""Their goal in Syria is to protect their enclaves in the north."" A Kurdish official with the Raqqa campaign said the SDF had so far liberated a stretch of 15 kilometers (about 9 miles) south of the Kurdish-controlled town of Ein Issa. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said heavy fighting was underway north of Raqqa. The U.S. Central Command said coalition aircraft conducted 16 airstrikes Sunday north of Raqqa, mostly near the area of Ein Issa, where the fighting appeared to be concentrated. The SDF is made up of Arab, Kurdish and Turkmen groups that have captured wide areas of northern Syria from IS in the past year. The largest and most powerful groups in the coalition are the main Kurdish militias known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG, and the Women's Protection Units, or YPJ. Fayad al-Ghanem, the commander of the small Arab Raqqa Hawks Brigade group, said in an online video that their aim is to besiege Raqqa and liberate villages and towns around it.  ""We want to rescue the people from the injustice of Daesh,"" al-Ghanem said. SDF said its fighters destroyed a vehicle rigged with explosives on a farm north of Raqqa. The IS-linked Aamaq news agency said IS militants hit an SDF armored vehicle with a missile, killing everyone inside. It later reported that IS fighters destroyed six SUVs for the SDF with missiles, killing seven fighters. ___ Associated Press writers Philip Issa in Beirut, Susan Frazer in Ankara, Turkey, and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed.

(pivotalweather.com)  Chances are when you head to the polls on Tuesday, the weather is going to be pretty great. In many places, the sun will be shining. There's just a small area along a cold front where showers are possible, but by and far there's no heavy rain in the forecast across the entire United States. Over 97 percent of the Lower 48 is expected to hit high temperatures above 50 degrees, and almost 20 percent of it will see highs above 70. There are showers in the forecast from parts of the Midwest to the South, but that cold front is moving fast -- so voters who see rain in the morning are likely to be dry in the evening and vice versa. It's only going to be windy right along and behind that front, and that leaves a vast majority of the country in seasonable, sunny weather. All of this favors Democrats on Election Day.   [Have you experienced problems voting?]   For decades, social and political scientists have been studying how weather affects election results. One of these more recent studies found foul weather -- mainly rain and snow -- decreased voter turnout and benefited Republicans. For every inch of rain, voter turnout declined by just under one percent, and the bad weather dissuaded Democrats the most. Results from a survey conducted by the Weather Channel before the 2012 election confirmed that finding.    Less frequent voters tend to be young, black and/or Hispanic. (U.S. Census Bureau)  So what's the deal? Republicans enjoy torrential downpours, and Democrats are weather weaklings? No. It's much more simple than that: Good weather means more infrequent voters will hit the polls. In a world of reasons not to vote, weather won't be one of them on Tuesday. And the U.S. Census Bureau has a pretty good idea of who those infrequent voters tend to be, historically. The numbers show 18- to 34-year-olds have been least likely to vote when categorizing the electorate by age. Black and Hispanic populations have been less likely when categorizing by ethnicity. Tying it all together, these groups are known to tilt Democrat. If you're skeptical, it turns out removing ""bad weather"" as an excuse not to vote may have had the power to swing close elections in the past. Of note, the hotly contested presidential election in 2000. ""[A dry election] would have led ... Al Gore to win Florida in 2000,"" the aforementioned 2007 study concluded.   [Interactive: How to vote in each state]   Brad Gomez, the lead author of the study and a political science professor at Florida State University, told the Capital Weather Gang that even though early voting has been popular in this election (over 40 million people have voted early this year), the turnout on the actual Election Day could be swayed by the weather. ""It is possible that the portion of the electorate that turns out on Election Day, specifically, is disproportionately composed of peripheral voters, weak partisans who do not vote regularly -- this latter group is likely to be most sensitive to the added [burden] caused by bad weather,"" Gomez said. At the very least -- whoever wins on Tuesday -- we know that weather won't be a good excuse for low voter turnout this year. The Capital Weather Gang's Kevin Ambrose contributed to this story."
8	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/07/if-clinton-wins-the-country-will-get-even-more-liberal/	If Clinton wins, the country will get even more liberal	"   Reuters/Jonathan Ernst  If the polls are correct, late tomorrow night Hillary Clinton is going to become president-elect of the United States. Even the conservatives who opposed Donald Trump and for whom this outcome will be something of a relief will still find themselves feeling a fair bit of distress when the call is finally made.  But they should gird themselves for worse, because if Clinton does win, after Tuesday, America is going to become more liberal in a whole variety of ways. We can start with the presidency, which is of course on everyone's mind. Clinton's election will represent not just a missed opportunity for the right, but an entrenchment of everything they've fought against for the last eight years. Their hopes of repealing the Affordable Care Act will be dead -- and knowing that, some more states may finally accept the expansion of Medicaid, making the law even harder to repeal. They won't be outlawing abortion, or cutting taxes for the wealthy, or privatizing Medicare, or building any walls on the border. Clinton may not be a clone of Obama in foreign policy, but she won't be tearing up the Iran nuclear deal either. And she'll continue Obama's initiatives to address climate change and promote renewable energy. Republicans may succeed in stopping Clinton from passing ambitious new legislation, but she'll still be able to make incremental progress on a wide variety of issues with a combination of the president's bully pulpit, the regulatory levers of the executive branch, and the courts. For instance, she'll push for increasing the national minimum wage (and history shows that Republicans eventually give in to that pressure after fighting it for a few years) while her Labor Department promotes workers' rights and increasingly liberal courts uphold them. That's another vital area where things will get progressively more liberal. A third of current federal judges were appointed by Barack Obama. Even more striking, when he came into office, only one of the 13 federal appeals courts had a Democratic-appointed majority, but now nine of them do. After another four or eight years of a Clinton administration, liberal judges will completely dominate the federal courts. That includes, of course, the Supreme Court. Some Republicans are now pledging that they'll stonewall any justice nominated by Clinton, on the principle that only Republican presidents should be allowed to make appointments to the Court. But if Democrats take the Senate, they'll present Mitch McConnell and his colleagues with an ultimatum: let Merrick Garland (or whoever Clinton puts in his place) have his confirmation, or we eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees and fill that seat anyway. If Clinton were to be elected and reelected, you could see a liberal majority on the Court of not just 5-4 but 6-3 or even 7-2. Liberals are about to get their first Supreme Court majority in decades, and it could persist for decades more. But that's not all. Look at the initiatives on the ballot this year, and you'll see that liberal measures dominate. Recreational marijuana measures are up for votes in California, Arizona, Nevada, Maine, and Massachusetts -- and will probably win in all five. Medical marijuana is also on ballots in Florida, Arkansas, Montana, and North Dakota; all those could succeed as well. Minimum wage increases, which almost never lose, are on ballots in five states. California, Nevada, and Maine have gun or ammunition background-check initiatives which could all pass.  Democrats also have a chance to flip some state legislative chambers, where Republicans have enjoyed extraordinary success in recent years. Like Congress, that could flip back in 2018 -- the president's party almost always does poorly in off-year elections -- but in the meantime it could have an impact in some states.  Still, we'll probably also see states where Republicans retain complete control becoming even more conservative as a reaction to developments on the national level. That process will be fed by a heightened feeling among core Republican constituencies that they're being left behind by a country changing in ways they don't like. So we could see a particular kind of political bifurcation, where changing demographics make swing states out of places like Georgia, Arizona, and (eventually) Texas, while a diminishing number of conservative states mount a kind of rear-guard action against the dominant national trends defining the country's politics and policy.  Which is where the effects of the Trump campaign will linger. If Clinton wins, history will record that the American people -- whom both Republicans and Democrats agree are possessed of infinite good will, impeccable values, and boundless wisdom -- will have emphatically rejected Donald Trump and the things he represents. As Tommy Craggs argues in a compelling piece in Slate, despite all the complaints that we didn't spend enough time talking about issues in this campaign, in fact we had an intense and substantive discussion of many of the vital questions that define us as a country. We talked about what it means to be an American, we talked about racism, we talked about how men treat women. ""The one favor Trump did us was to be monstrous about the things in America that matter the most, to force a confrontation with all the stuff our politics typically is at pains to suppress,"" Craggs writes. Liberals won those arguments, a victory that will be even more clear if Clinton prevails. That doesn't mean that men like Trump will stop groping women against their will or that the white supremacists so cheered by Trump's rise will crawl back under the rock from which they came. But we're more conscious than ever of the issues 2016 shoved in our faces, and the societal changes that will have led to Trump's defeat will become only more clear.  It's even possible that in response to 2016 the Republican Party itself will become more moderate, finding a way to appeal to a broader swath of Americans -- especially since it looks like Clinton's victory will be delivered by the rapidly growing minority groups Trump worked so hard to alienate. If that winds up being part of Trump's legacy, he will have done the country at least one favor.  "
