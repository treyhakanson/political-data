""More than 99% of what people see is authentic,"" he wrote, adding it was ""extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election."" But such reassurances have buckled under mounting criticism. On late Monday, Zuckerberg acted, joining Google in taking the most serious steps yet to crack down on purveyors of phony stories by cutting off a critical source of funding -- the ads that online platforms have long funneled to creators of popular content.  [No, this video does not show Obama urging undocumented people to vote]  The move has raised new questions about long-standing claims by Facebook, Google and other online platforms that they have little responsibility to exert editorial control over the news they deliver to billions of people, even when it includes outright lies, falsehoods or propaganda that could tilt elections. Such claims became increasingly unsustainable amid reports that News Feed and Trending Topics, two core Facebook products, had promoted a number of false, misleading and fantastical political stories, such as an article saying Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump, which was shared by over 100,000 users. There were ""vote online"" memes that assured Democrats in Pennsylvania that they could cast their ballots from home and a widely shared news release claiming Hillary Clinton's health disqualified her from serving as president. Over the weekend, the No. 1 Google hit for the search ""final election count"" was an article from a little-known site claiming that Donald Trump had won the popular vote by 700,000 votes. (Clinton won the popular vote). Facebook, Google and other Web companies have sought to walk a fine line: They don't want to get into the practice of hiring human editors, which they believe would make them vulnerable to criticisms of partisan bias and stray from their core business of building software. Yet outsiders, as well as some within Silicon Valley, are increasingly clamoring for technology giants to take a more active role in policing the spread of deceptive information. ""It is very difficult for Facebook to say they are not a gatekeeper when they drive such an enormous share of the attention of most news consumers across the world,"" said Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. ""They need to figure out some editorial mechanism; with their scale comes responsibility.""  [Facebook has repeatedly trended fake news since firing its human editors]  When Facebook detects that more people than usual are clicking on any given story, the company's software algorithms instantaneously spread and promote that story to many other users in the network -- enabling articles to ""go viral"" in a short period of time and making it harder to catch false news before it spreads widely. The moves by Google and Facebook this week take aim at false stories but don't impact Facebook's News Feed or Google Search rankings, the places where fake news has actually spread. Instead, the tech giants are seeking to exert financial leverage that could prompt sites to clean up their act. Publishers make money when Google and Facebook help place ads on their websites, and they share that revenue with the technology giants. Companies found to be in violation of the policy risk losing a major source of ad dollars. Nearly 1.2 billion people log on to Facebook every day; almost half of Americans rely on the social network as a source of news, according to the Pew Research Center. Google accounts for roughly 40 percent of traffic to news sites, according to Parse.ly, a start-up that analyzes Web traffic data for news publishers. Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville declined to detail how the company would determine the difference between false and accurate information going forward. ""We use a combination of automated systems and human review,"" she said Facebook spokesman Tom Channick emailed a statement about the new policy: ""In accordance with the Audience Network policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news. While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance."" Facebook, Google and other sites have struggled to find automated solutions to clamp down on fake news, because there is not always a clear line between true and false news online, said a former Facebook employee who worked on the News Feed product and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to burn bridges with company. The most influential sources of political misinformation on Facebook are not Macedonian fake-news sites or satirical pages but the thousands of partisan news outlets, pages and blogs that derive their traffic from News Feed, the employee said. Because those stories aren't strictly ""true"" or ""false,"" it's difficult to design a software algorithm that can distinguish among them. Some civil-liberties experts said it was dangerous to push Facebook to take on a greater editorial role. ""If we wouldn't trust the government to curate all of what we read, why would we ever think that Facebook or any one company should do it?"" said Jonathan Zittrain, faculty director at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard. Over the past year, Facebook has struggled to strike a balance. In May, the company was accused by former employees of suppressing news stories that had a conservative bent in its trending-news section, which appears on the upper right corner of a user's Facebook page. In an effort to quell the criticism, Zuckerberg met with conservative leaders and launched an internal investigation into bias at the social network. (The investigation, conducted by Facebook and not by an outside firm, found no evidence of anti-conservative bias.) The company also published a set of editorial guidelines that detail how human editors and algorithms work together to pick what stories should appear in the Trending Topics. The controversy over trending news reflects Facebook's challenges in curating content on the medium. Facebook had quietly used a handful of journalists, hired as freelance contractors, to help the curate the Trending section. Those contractors were replaced in late August by a team of engineers who defer most editorial decisions to the Trending section's algorithms. The social network still has an editorial team that manages trending news, and it also allows users to flag hoaxes or fake stories in its News Feed product. In recent months, Zuckerberg has repeatedly emphasized that Facebook is a technology company, not a media company. Still, ""there is more we can do here,"" he said in his weekend blog post. He said he was proud of Facebook's role in the election and hoped to have more to share soon. The challenge, he wrote, is that any major changes run the risk of introducing unintended side effects or biases. ""This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully,"" he wrote, adding, ""Identifying the 'truth' is complicated.""  Abby Ohlheiser contributed to this report. "

The American Civil Liberties Union said 120,000 donations totaling more than $7 million have poured in over the past week, the largest show of support in the organization's nearly 100-year history. The Anti-Defamation League has seen contributions jump 50-fold, with the majority of the contributions coming from first-time donors. The Southern Poverty Law Center saw its Twitter following jump by 9,000 as the organization racked up a list of more than 400 reported incidents it labeled hateful harassment or intimidation, such as swastikas scrawled on church walls and women in headscarves being accosted. And groups that advocate for Muslims, women, immigrants, racial minorities and gays say they have received a similar deluge of support. The contributions are a silver lining for the groups, who say the election of businessman Donald Trump has inspired fear in the communities they were formed to protect. People are flocking to the Human Rights Campaign website to learn what the outcome might mean for gay and lesbian couples seeking to adopt, or for transgender people who, feeling a sense of security because of executive orders issued under the Obama administration, came out about their gender identities at the workplace. What happens, they ask, if those executive orders are rescinded? ""These are devastating questions to be asking,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, which had worked closely with the Obama administration over the years. ""Folks are scared. They heard what Trump and others said time and time again and they don't know what it might mean for them."" Voto Latino, an advocacy group that typically focuses on issues such as climate change and immigration, found itself giving out suicide hotline numbers and anti-bullying literature. ""We've become a de facto support group,"" said the organization's president, Maria-Teresa Kumar. Similar fears gripped supporters of Planned Parenthood, the women's health nonprofit whose political action arm vigorously campaigned for Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The organization will again be in the crosshairs as the Republican Congress seeks to cut off its federal funding, which Trump has said he would support. However, the group received an ""unprecedented"" 128,000 donations in the wake of the election, President Cecile Richards said in a statement. She pledged to ""stay open, no matter what."" The Human Rights Campaign, Voto Latino and Planned Parenthood were among several groups, including organized labor and immigrant rights groups, that met this week in Washington to plot a strategy going forward. Left-leaning organizations say they are being forced to regroup in the wake of an election that gave Republicans control of both the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade. Trump has pledged to step up deportations of undocumented immigrants in the country and roll back environmental regulations, and he has surrounded himself with advisers who oppose abortion and gay rights. The consternation is intensified by the uniquely divisive nature of Trump's candidacy. His rhetoric shook some more centrist groups such as the Anti-Defamation League, which slammed Trump's campaign for its anti-Semitic echoes. His candidacy was embraced by avowed white supremacists and neo-Nazis, though in a recent interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes"" he asked any of his supporters who might be harassing minorities to ""stop it.""  One positive for these groups is the outpouring of support from citizens who are using their wallets to do what their votes could not. ""I think it's very reassuring that even though we've seen this surge in hate, if you will, we've seen a very compelling and countervailing surge of good,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, which opposes anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry. Greenblatt's group is planning to take an approach of ""optimistic engagement"" with a Trump administration, he said. The ADL sometimes clashed with the Obama administration too; for example, it opposed the Iran nuclear deal. Less optimistic is the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a group that vociferously advocates for the rights of Muslims and has been a favorite target of conservatives. Prior to the election, the organization had hoped to push for stronger legislation banning racial profiling, but that seems off the table now, said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for CAIR. The organization blames Trump and others for inflaming anti-Muslim sentiment; in a report this week, the FBI said anti-Muslim hate crimes reached levels last year not seen since 2001. For many groups, Trump's surprise victory at the polls has instantly changed their priorities. Earlier this week, seven groups devoted to issues affecting racial minorities -- including the NAACP and the National Urban League -- held a conference call with reporters pledging to immediately make voter suppression a top issue. Strict new laws requiring voters to present identification and the shuttering of some polling places led to lower voter turnout among African Americans and young people, they alleged. The ACLU this week announced that it was refocusing its efforts to protect protesters and analyzing the civil liberties records of potential appointees. In addition, it will seek to block efforts by Trump and a Republican Congress to defund Planned Parenthood; deport immigrants brought to this country by their parents, known as ""Dreamers""; and ban Muslim refugees. The ACLU was among the first organizations to adopt an adversarial tone in the immediate wake of the election, promising to be a thorn in Trump's side if he executed all his campaign promises. ""See you in court,"" the organization said in news release. Mark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the election results have hastened what has been a shift in recent years on the part of his organization, which tracks hate groups. Increasingly, he said, his center has watched fringe figures and ideas infiltrate mainstream politics -- for example, conspiracy theories about President Obama's birthplace. That particular conspiracy theory years ago got a boost from Trump, who then was not a candidate for president. Now that Trump has won, Potok said, his eyes will be trained on the highest office in the land. ""We're increasingly looking at politicians because so much hatred was seeping into the mainstream,"" Potok said. ""Now, it's the same phenomenon but worse.""  As of Tuesday night, the organization had collected 437 reports of ""hateful intimidation and harassment,"" though not all had been verified. The largest number of incidents were directed at immigrants, but about 90 targeted African Americans.   "

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)  The conservative blogosphere is having great fun mocking students at elite colleges who are not simply upset at Donald Trump's victory, but are also expressing fears of the personal consequences of that victory. While it's understandable that, say, Muslim students or students who benefited from President Obama's executive orders on immigration would be concerned about Trump's policies, why would your average progressive white student from an upper-middle-class background attending an elite college be afraid not simply that Trump will be an awful president, but also that something bad will happen to that student personally? Isn't this an example of the self-indulgence of millennials, special snowflakes who think the world revolves around them? Isn't it paranoid and irrational? A colleague of mine begs to differ. He pointed out to me that many of these students have grown up with progressivism dominant all around them -- in the White House, to be sure, but even more so in their elite private and suburban public schools, in their summer camps, in their religious institutions, and especially at their universities. Moreover, they have noticed how dissenters from dominant political orthodoxy have been treated in these institutions -- they are ridiculed, ostracized, sometimes harassed and occasionally punished for their political views. They have seen that progressives have organized to deprive dissenters of their jobs and their livelihoods. The more politically aware among them may have even noticed that the Obama administration has been distinctly unwilling to accommodate religious dissenters. For example, the Obama Justice Department has refused to rule out the possibility that the government would seek to deny tax exemptions for religious institutions that refuse to recognize same-sex marriage. With the federal government about to be dominated by presumptively regressive and evil Republicans -- a tribe that elite students are barely personally familiar with but have heard terrible things about -- it's not wholly irrational for progressive students to wonder: Is this going to affect my job prospects in the future? Will the institutions I care about be threatened with federal retaliation? Will a wave of conservative sentiment sweep over the nation, and as a result, will I face ridicule, ostracism and perhaps even punishment for my beliefs? I would argue that these fears are, in fact, unreasonable; progressives are likely to continue to dominate most of the American establishment, and from the progressive bubble of higher education it's easy to exaggerate how much one's political and religious views actually affect most people's day-to-day life. But unreasonableness is not the same as irrationality, and because they have grown up in an intolerant monoculture, it's not irrational for students to fear the potential consequences of intolerance from the other side.

Trump's threats to tear up trade deals and hike tariffs on Chinese goods look ominous. If carried out, they could chill thriving commercial ties at a time when Beijing is struggling to shore up economic growth. At the same time, Trump's suggestion he might reduce Washington's global strategic presence to focus on domestic issues would be a gift to Chinese leaders. They could expand their political and military profile in East Asia with less risk of conflict. ___ The incoming Trump administration faces the task of maintaining influence in the face of rising Chinese strategic ambitions while accommodating Asian countries that are being drawn into Beijing's economic orbit. That calls for more nimble diplomacy that transcends the security-focused ""pivot to Asia"" and caters to countries' desire for a balanced relationship between Washington and Beijing, analysts say. It will require greater economic and diplomatic engagement, drawing on America's soft power assets in culture, media and education. China is ""without doubt trying to subvert American alliances and relationships,"" including in Europe, Australia and South Korea, said Michael Montesano, a research fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. That's been abetted by ""depressingly unimaginative"" U.S. diplomacy in Asia that is focused too narrowly on military alliances and is now hobbled by Washington's failure to advance the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact, Montesano said. Over U.S. objections, Beijing has moved to cement its claim to most of the South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and military airstrips atop coral reefs. On strategic issues, Chinese researchers have ""come around to the view that Donald Trump is better for China,"" said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center at Tsinghua University in Beijing.  ""There is a sense among many that Donald Trump will draw inward,"" said Haenle. ""This is music to their ears, because this means that the United States might not put pressure on China in the region."" Beijing has been visited in recent weeks by leaders from the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam, highlighting its economic appeal and lack of interest in their internal affairs, especially corruption and human rights -- issues the U.S. is seen as harping on. Still, it would be ""premature to write off the United States,"" said Carlyle Thayer, an expert on Southeast Asia and emeritus professor at Australia's University of New South Wales.  ""The U.S. has important equities in the region through investment and trade,"" said Thayer. ""And the U.S. has a national interest in preventing China from becoming a hegemonic power over the region."" As for the Philippines' unpredictable new president, Rodrigo Duterte, the new administration would be best advised to ""ride out the Duterte storm and let domestic politics in the Philippines take its course,"" said Thayer. Meanwhile, concerns about China's intentions will propel governments such as Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam toward closer ties with the U.S., Australia, Japan and India, said Greg Poling of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ___ How will Donald Trump deal with China on politically volatile commercial issues? Despite his threats of a trade war, no one is sure -- probably not even Trump himself. But businesspeople and economists say Washington is bound to be tougher on trade, market access and currency after the election laid bare Americans' anxiety about jobs and stagnant wages. Uncertainty about where Trump wants to take the world's biggest economy has caused turmoil in global financial markets. The answer -- and especially how that affects ties with No. 2 China -- could have been even bigger repercussions. Trump is unlikely to carry out his most extreme threats to tear up trade deals or slap 45 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, say economists. But they say high-visibility gestures such as declaring Beijing manipulates its exchange rate to boost exports -- a step that can trigger penalties -- look more likely.  ""It has been clear for some time that whoever wins the White House is going to be tougher on China by necessity,"" said Randal Phillips, vice chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. ""And I think, frankly, the Chinese government has known that for several years."" Phillips and others warn that Chinese leaders will need to be sensitive to American public sentiment to avoid disrupting their access to U.S. consumers. At the top of the U.S. wish list is more access to China's growing market, where finance, telecoms and a wide swath of other industries are mostly off-limits. Foreign governments assumed China would open up as it grew richer. But business groups complain Beijing is trying instead to squeeze foreign rivals out of technology and other promising industries in violation of its free-trade commitments. The United States, along with Germany and other trading partners, are increasingly frustrated that their companies are blocked from buying Chinese assets in most industries while China Inc. is on a global acquisition spree.  ""It's just not acceptable anymore,"" said Phillips. That could help Washington recruit allies to pressure Beijing, said Haenle of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center. He noted Germany, the biggest economy in the 28-nation European Union, is becoming more assertive in demanding ""reciprocity and market access."" Washington will talk to the EU ""to see what can be done on this issue,"" Haenle said. Others warn reckless action could backfire.  ""The biggest threats to the economy stem from Trump's protectionist stance on trade, anti-immigration policies and the weakening of government finances stemming from expected tax cuts,"" Sarah Boumphrey of Euromonitor International said in a report. Trump's election adds to the urgency of winding up negotiations begun in 2013 on a bilateral investment treaty before President Barack Obama leaves office, said Jake Parker, vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents some 200 companies. His group sees the measure, which would guarantee the legal status of investments in each other's markets, as the best way to increase access to the China.  ""This may offer an opportunity to accelerate the negotiations,"" Parker said. China's government tried to remind Washington that both sides benefit from one of the world's biggest commercial relationships despite chronic disputes.  ""Bilateral trade over the past decades has tangibly benefited the U.S. people and created jobs instead of harming their interests,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang. Tough talk on China has featured in every U.S. presidential campaign since 1992, when then-candidate Bill Clinton dubbed the ruling Communist Party the ""butchers of Beijing."" Once elected, Clinton set that aside and persuaded Congress to grant China low-tariff ""most-favored nation"" status. Other candidates have taken a similar approach.  ""What he said during the campaign, that's not government policy,"" said James Zimmerman, the American chamber's chairman. ""Government policy really requires thoughtful discussion, dialogue and compromise."" Companies and economists were waiting to see whether Trump follows tradition.  ""This scenario is still subject to considerable uncertainty,"" said Boumphrey. ""Republicans will control both houses (of Congress), which would ordinarily make for more certainty, but it is unclear how many of his policies the party will support."" ___ Christopher Bodeen has reported on Chinese politics and diplomacy since 2000.

Chamberlain believes Trump is her savior, sent by God to save America from ruin. She owns a women's clothing store in this remote town; her husband runs a construction company. They have two children and barely get by on $44,000 a year, living paycheck to paycheck. In his victory speech, Trump called people like Chamberlain and her family America's ""forgotten men and women"" -- the blue-collar workers in the manufacturing towns of the Rust Belt and the coalfields of Appalachia who propelled him to an improbable victory. They felt left behind by progress, laughed at by the elite, and so put their faith in the billionaire businessman with a sharp tongue and short temper who promised to Make America Great Again. When Trump first ran, Chamberlain thought to herself: ""That's the man everybody has been praying for."" And she now feels vindicated by his victory.  ""This is a movement,"" she said. ""This isn't a candidate anymore. This is a movement."" Not all of Trump's support came from the blue-collar downtrodden. But the Republican's overwhelming backing among whites with less than a college education is at least partly a reflection of how little the economic recovery since the Great Recession has benefited them. Their job opportunities have dwindled and their incomes have fallen, even as broader measures of the nation's job market show improvement. But they also turned to him to hold back the tide of social change: same-sex marriage, transgender rights, a society growing more racially diverse. The white working class, long ignored, found an unlikely spokesman in Trump. He promised to build the wall to keep out immigrants. He promised to tear up trade deals that have ushered American factory jobs overseas. He promised to put blue-collar America back to work and restore the country to a time when white workers felt appreciated and fulfilled.  ""I feel like, not just most, but all Trump supporters are true patriots,"" said 59-year-old Ginger Austin, who owns a graphics company in a tiny town in Jones County, one of the poorest places in North Carolina. ""They love this country. But they're taking our country away, and they're changing it. They're just changing everything. All our rights are just slowly being dwindled away."" She's angry at the Republican Party she has supported all her life. She is angry at Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act. She is angry that America is changing, and worried that her grandchildren are growing up in a world too liberal and too politically correct. The nation woke up Wednesday morning to learn just how starkly divided it has grown: Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by less than 200,000 ballots. But Trump won battleground states that had voted for Obama twice. Thousands of registered Democrats, including many former union workers from the mines and factories, crossed party lines and sided with Trump. For example, in Dunn County, Wisconsin, where Shay Chamberlain lives, Obama beat Mitt Romney 53 percent to 46 percent in 2012, and John McCain 57 percent to 42 percent four years earlier. But it flipped to back Donald Trump, 52 percent to 41 percent, over Clinton. Scott Hiltgen, a 66-year-old small business owner in Wisconsin, called Washington a ""cesspool"" of career politicians, aware of and indifferent to the plight of the American worker.  ""We are considered flyover country, as you well know, and they don't care about us,"" he said. ""And I think it was the silent majority that finally said, 'Enough's enough. We want a change. We don't like the way things are going.'"" Middle-aged white men with only high school degrees -- the core of Trump's support -- saw their inflation-adjusted incomes plummet 9 percent from 1996 through 2014, according to Sentier Research, a data analytics firm founded by former Census Bureau officials. White male college graduates in the same age bracket, by contrast, saw their incomes jump 23 percent. The Great Recession wiped out millions of middle-income jobs in manufacturing, office administrative work and construction, and those jobs haven't returned, even as the nation now has 6.5 million more jobs than it did before the recession began. In many parts of the country, they have been replaced with lower-income work in restaurants, hotels, and in home health care. This ""hollowing out"" of the nation's economy has left many Americans with high school degrees feeling shut out of the middle class. Jerry Blackburn, a retired county official in rural Virginia, said he feels like people from someplace else took all they could from him and his neighbors and then left them with nothing.  ""They took our coal out of here and everybody got rich on it. And what did we get?"" he asked. ""We got black lung. We don't have good water to drink, we don't have roads, we don't have anything except a bunch of broken-down old coal miners that's forgotten. But everybody else got rich on us."" Miners streamed into a convenience store on a highway between one struggling, West Virginia coal town and another on Wednesday morning. From behind the counter, manager Mary Jones recognized something she hadn't heard in years: Hope. They talked about jobs returning to this broken-down area. They talked about a chance at a brighter future. They talked about Donald Trump.  ""I think we sent a message to Washington that we're tired of them sitting up there doing nothing to help the working-class people,"" said Jones, who grew up in Wyoming County, where the collapse of the coal industry has left behind a string of tumbledown houses and a quarter of families in poverty. Coal trucks used to barrel by all day and the parking lot stayed full. No trucks come by anymore. The store is for sale. She's not sure she'll have a job much longer and is certain she won't find another. They struggle to make enough money to pay the bills and write the paychecks. She considers the ballot she cast for Trump as a protest against Clinton and every other member of the political elite.  ""Working-class people built this country and now the working class people have been forgotten,"" she said. ""It's about time they paid attention."" But Jones worries that in West Virginia the working class is too far gone to be saved.  ""There's some things you can do as a president. And there's something you can't. They all make promises. I just don't know how he can keep all those promises,"" she said. ""I feel more hopeful today than I have in a long time. But I'm still scared for the future."" ____ AP Economics reporter Chris Rugaber contributed from Little Rock, Arkansas; Alex Sanz from Maysville, North Carolina; Pauline Arrillaga from Phoenix; and Claire Galofaro from Pineville, West Virginia.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) cruised into the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, winning his bid to succeed five-term powerhouse Barbara A. Mikulski and allowing Maryland Democrats -- for one night at least -- to forget the humiliating loss of the governor's mansion two years ago. His victory over Del. Kathy Szeliga (R) -- by more than 20 points -- makes him the state's first senator from the D.C. suburbs in a century. It was part of a big blue night in the deeply Democratic state, where Hillary Clinton easily beat Republican Donald Trump to claim the state's 10 electoral votes.  [Full results from Maryland]  The party kept its hold on seven of Maryland's eight congressional districts, adding two new faces on a day when balloting was marred by lengthy waits and technical issues. Long lines in Baltimore City kept the polls there open well past the scheduled 8 p.m. closing time, delaying reporting of statewide results on the Board of Elections website. State Sen. Jamie Raskin (D) claimed Van Hollen's District 8 congressional seat, beating Republican Dan Cox by about 25 points. Former lieutenant governor Anthony Brown revived a political career that appeared over after his 2014 gubernatorial loss, defeating Republican George McDermott by a better than 2-to-1 margin to capture the seat being vacated by Rep. Donna F. Edwards.   Rep. Chris Van Hollen takes a selfie with friend and neighbor, Maria Recio, of Kensington at his precinct, Temple Emanuel. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)  ""Isn't it great to be back?"" Brown said to a crowd of Democrats at a victory party in Silver Spring. ""Together we've had our successes, and we've had our shortcomings."" In the 6th Congressional District, which stretches from Montgomery County through western Maryland, Rep. John Delaney (D) turned back a well-financed challenge from defense consultant Amie Hoeber to win a third term, winning by double digits. Maryland's five other incumbent House members -- Rep. Andy Harris (R), and Democrats C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Steny H. Hoyer and Elijah E. Cummings -- all won reelection. State Sen. Catherine E. Pugh (D) will succeed outgoing Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (D), despite a last-minute write-in effort by former mayor Sheila Dixon (D). Van Hollen, 57, a consummate insider and policy wonk who rose quickly in House leadership ranks over his seven terms, campaigned hard this fall after a bruising primary against Edwards. He presented himself as a negotiator comfortable working across the aisle and highlighted his roles in Wall Street reform and passage of the Affordable Care Act. Szeliga, 55, the minority whip in Maryland's House, played down a staunchly conservative voting record that included opposition to stricter gun control, same-sex marriage and an increased state minimum wage. She tried to gain traction by focusing on Van Hollen's support for the Obama administration's Iran nuclear deal -- and his support of Clinton. Mafiz Chowdhury, a Democrat who lives in Potomac, said Tuesday he voted for Van Hollen after meeting him a couple of times. Chowdhury said liked that Van Hollen, who lives in Kensington, was ""upfront and honest"" during his time in the House.      View Graphic      ""He's a very people-oriented person,"" Chowdhury, 51, said after voting at Cold Spring Elementary School in Potomac. ""He seems to have the intention to help people, and I fell for that."" Van Hollen also won votes from Trump supporters in more conservative parts of the state. In Edgemere, a blue-collar town just east of Baltimore, Shannon Nelson voted for the billionaire but backed Van Hollen over Szeliga because of the Democrat's experience and union endorsements. ""I'm concerned about keeping my job and providing for my children through college,"" the 32-year-old Republican longshoreman said. At the Democrats' victory party in Silver Spring on Tuesday night, Van Hollen took the stage at about 10:30 p.m. and announced he had received a call from Szeliga and thanked her.  ""I am truly humbled, and it is time for all of us to get to work,"" he told the crowd at the Tommy Douglas Conference Center. Szeliga, a state delegate representing Baltimore County, took the stage at the BWI Marriott with a beaming smile, flanked mostly by family. ""There is a movement for change, and I'm going to continue to fight for you,"" she said. ""I'm going to continue to carry the banner for us and for our ideas.""  Van Hollen was the choice of the Democratic establishment in the Democratic primary, which exposed racial and gender fissures within the party. Edwards, a former community activist and a single mother, was a standard-bearer for the party's progressive wing as she sought to become Maryland's first African American senator. She attacked Van Hollen as a creature of Beltway culture whose ties to Wall Street and past support for free-trade agreements put him out of touch with struggling voters.  Tensions rose when the super PAC funded by Emily's List, the abortion rights group that supports women candidates, threw more than $2 million behind Edwards despite Van Hollen's steadfast voting record on reproductive rights. But her insurgency faltered in the final weeks. The defeats of Szeliga and Hoeber, and the pending departures of Mikulski and Edwards, both Democrats, leaves Maryland with an all-male congressional delegation for the first time in more than 40 years. Jennifer Lawless, an American University professor and director of the school's Women & Politics Institute, said the immediate impact should be minimal because Van Hollen, Raskin and Brown are ""card-carrying progressives."" ""It's not a setback,"" Lawless said. ""I don't think we take any hits in terms of feminist agenda or policy."" She noted that Edwards, District 8 candidate Kathleen Matthews and District 4 contender Del. Joseline Pena-Melnyk, all of whom lost in the Democratic primary in April, ran strong races. Longer-term, Lawless said, the 2016 elections underscore the importance of encouraging and cultivating women to run at the local, state and national levels. While Hillary Clinton's candidacy shattered a historic glass ceiling, research shows that further down the ballot, the number of women running for Senate and House seats has remained more or less flat in recent years. Brown, 54, beat out a crowded Democratic primary field that included Pena-Melnyk and former Prince George's state's attorney Glenn F. Ivey, immediately becoming the overwhelming favorite to succeed Edwards in Congress. During the campaign, Brown shed his political handlers and invested $400,000 of his own money to tell voters a more personal story about his role as a father and husband. ""Sometimes in life you're going to get knocked down,"" Brown said after casting his ballot Tuesday morning. ""And if you believe in what you are doing, you pick yourself up, your brush yourself off and you and you stay in the fight."" Raskin, 53, a Takoma Park law professor, enjoyed the backing of virtually every major Democratic interest group in the state. He survived a nine-way primary that featured the heaviest self-funded congressional candidate ever, Potomac wine magnate David Trone. Trone spent $13.4 million of his own money to finish second, slightly ahead of former Marriott executive and news anchor Kathleen Matthews. In both the primary and the general election campaigns, Raskin promised to pursue the kind of liberal agenda he set in Annapolis, including prison reform, a ban on assault weapons and an increased minimum wage. ""It is not my job to be in the political center; it is my job to be in the moral center,"" Raskin told supporters Tuesday night. ""When they call me a progressive, I say darn right, because at the heart of that word is progress, and if we aren't making progress, what are we doing in politics?"" Delaney, a financial services entrepreneur listed as the third-wealthiest member of Congress in some surveys, was aiming for a strong win over Hoeber after nearly losing his seat in 2014 to conservative talk radio host Dan Bongino. Political professionals in the state said he needed an impressive victory to keep his options open for a possible challenge to Hogan in 2018. Rebecca Lipscomb, a special-education consultant who describes herself as a Libertarian, said she voted for Delaney because Hoeber's positions ""aligned more with that of Trump's.""  ""I can't support any candidate who is that discriminatory toward that many people,"" the 35-year-old from Gaithersburg said.         "
