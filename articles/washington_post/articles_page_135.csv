Trump's Sunday schedule in Bedminster includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Setting a rancorous year aside, the pugnacious billionaire put on a smiling show of goodwill Saturday with former rival Mitt Romney. But Trump did not reveal or indicate whether the 2012 Republican nominee could be in line for a cabinet post. He also met with education activists Michelle Rhee and Betsy DeVos, as well as retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, considered a contender to lead the Pentagon. Trump said he may announce some of his picks on Sunday.  ""We're seeing tremendous talent,"" Trump said Saturday. ""People that, like I say, we will 'Make America Great Again.'"" Both Romney and Trump were positive about their sit-down, a marked shift in tone after a year in which Romney attacked Trump as a ""con man"" and Trump labeled him a ""loser."" But the two have started to mend fences since Trump's victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Before turning to his visitors, Trump took to Twitter, where he rushed to the defense of Mike Pence on Saturday after ""Hamilton"" actor Brandon Victor Dixon challenged the incoming vice president from the Broadway stage after the show Friday night. ""Apologize!"" Trump tweeted to the actor. ""Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!"" Dixon tweeted back: ""Conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @Mike_Pence for stopping to listen."" Trump posted a similar Tweet Saturday evening, only to later delete it. Staffers did not immediately respond to an email asking why. Trump also bragged on Twitter about agreeing to settle a trio of lawsuits against Trump University, claiming: ""The ONLY bad thing about winning the presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!"" It was announced Friday that Trump had agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve three lawsuits over Trump University, his former school for real estate investors. The lawsuits alleged the school misled students and failed to deliver on its promises in programs that cost up to $35,000. Trump has denied the allegations and had said repeatedly he would not settle. Trump started filling key administration positions on Friday, picking Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signaling a sharp rightward shift in U.S. security policy as he begins to form his Cabinet. Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. Trump's initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam's role in stoking extremism. Sessions, who is best known for his hard line immigration views, has questioned whether terrorist suspects should benefit from the rights available in U.S. courts. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders are ""potentially complicit"" in attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam. Pompeo's nomination to lead the CIA also opens the prospect of the U.S. resuming torture of detainees. Trump has backed harsh interrogation techniques that President Barack Obama and Congress have banned, saying the U.S. ""should go tougher than waterboarding,"" which simulates drowning. In 2014, Pompeo criticized Obama for ""ending our interrogation program"" and said intelligence officials ""are not torturers, they are patriots."" Sessions and Pompeo would both require Senate confirmation; Flynn would not. ___ Associated Press writers Julie Pace, Laurie Kellman, Mark Kennedy, Errin Whack, Jonathan Lemire, Jill Colvin, Stephen Braun, Robert Burns and Jack Gillum and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.

The remarks by Naftali Bennett reflect sentiment in the nationalist Israeli right wing that Trump's election could usher in a new era of relations with the United States. While the two countries are close allies, relations were sometimes tense between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because of their vastly different world views. Bennett last week welcomed Trump's election, predicting that ""the special relationship"" with the U.S. would grow stronger and noting that the Republican campaign platform had no mention of a Palestinian state. ""The era of a Palestinian state is over,"" he declared at the time. Speaking to foreign reporters on Monday, Bennett was more cautious, citing an order by Netanyahu for his Cabinet not to talk about the election in public. But he made clear that he will push his own government to rethink its commitment to Palestinian independence.  ""The combination of the changes in the United States, in Europe and the region provide Israel with a unique opportunity to reset and rethink everything,"" Bennett said.  ""It's no secret that I think that the notion of setting up a Palestine in the heart of Israel is a profound mistake,"" he added. ""I believe that we have to bring alternative new ideas instead of the Palestinian state approach."" Though Bennett said he didn't know whether Trump would support that view, he said it's critical that Israel now clearly define its own vision.  ""My expectation is not from anyone abroad,"" he said. ""After many years, the Israeli government has to decide what do we want."" Bennett's comments were also an indicator of the pressure Netanyahu could soon face to abandon his commitment to the ""two-state solution"" favored by Obama and the international community. For two decades, the international community has been pushing for a negotiated peace deal that would include the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip -- areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. The thinking was that Israel's continued occupation of millions of Palestinians would create a demographic time bomb in which Arabs would eventually outnumber Jews, threatening Israel's status as a democracy with a Jewish majority. After opposing Palestinian independence for most of his career, Netanyahu reluctantly endorsed the idea shortly after Obama took office in 2009. But critics, including Obama, have said that continued Israeli settlement on occupied territories have undercut this goal, and the Obama administration has at times questioned Netanyahu's commitment to seeking peace. Bennett leads the Jewish Home party, a coalition partner that is affiliated with the West Bank settler movement. He is one of the most influential voices in Israeli politics, and both his party and most members of Netanyahu's Likud oppose Palestinian statehood on either religious or security grounds. Bennett has instead called for annexing parts of the West Bank and granting the Palestinians in other parts expanded autonomy, with new roads, office parks and economic opportunities, with Israel retaining overall security control. Israeli hard-liners welcomed Trump's election last week, noting the strong support for Israel in his campaign platform and the many pro-Israel officials who advised him during his campaign. Their spirits were further boosted after a Trump adviser, Jason Greenblatt, told an Israeli radio station last week that his boss doesn't think West Bank settlements are an ""obstacle to peace."" Following Greenblatt's comments, Cabinet Minister Ofir Akunis, a close Netanyahu associate, called for a renewed wave of settlement construction. But such sentiments may have been premature. Trump's unpredictability has raised concerns that he might change his attitudes once in office. Over the weekend, for instance, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he would like to help broker a solution to the conflict ""for humanity's sake."" In an interview with ""Israel Today,"" a free daily owned by Republican super-donor Sheldon Adelson, Trump said he believed his administration can play ""a significant role"" in helping the Mideast parties reach an agreement. Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday that he would soon be meeting Trump. He ordered his Cabinet and lawmakers to avoid speaking to the media about the election while the incoming U.S. administration formulates its policies. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Not quite.	"   Constanze Stelzenmuller is Robert Bosch Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and a contributing writer for The Post.   Aaand the Leader of the Free World is: . . . Angela Merkel! That, at least, is what you might conclude from a spate of commentary in the U.S. media following the German chancellor's finely barbed message of congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump, in which she offered cooperation on the basis of shared values: ""democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of the individual, regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation or political views.""  She's right. Trump's toxic campaign left few Western values unquestioned, from his threats to reintroduce torture, to summarily deport Muslims or to lock up his opponent, to his disparagement of women, African Americans, Hispanics and people with disabilities. His nomination of Stephen K. Bannon, co-chair of his campaign and chief executive officer of the alt-right Breitbart News website, to a senior White House position can only deepen German concerns. (Merkel's oblique criticism was also rather more elegant than the reaction of her Social Democrat coalition partner, Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who greeted the election winner as ""the trailblazer of a new authoritarian and chauvinist movement."")  For those looking to Germany hopefully now, there are encouraging signs. After decades of free-riding on U.S. power, it is making a genuine effort to live up to its responsibilities as the de facto leader of Europe. It's spending more on defense, to shoulder more of the burden of Europe's defense within the transatlantic alliance. Germany is arming and training Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in the war against the Islamic State in Iraq. It's sending combat units to protect Lithuania , and is about to deploy 650 soldiers to Mali to fight Islamic terrorism. And those are Luftwaffe fighter planes currently scrambling up into Estonian airspace to head off Russian incursions. Berlin has been holding together the European consensus on sanctions against Russia -- at some cost to German business. Anger at Russia's annexation of Crimea and its ongoing aggression against Ukraine is one cause of Germany's more muscular stance. The dramatic arrival of more than 800,000 refugees in Germany last year is forcing it to invest more in stability for the Middle East and Africa. We know that to have peace and prosperity in Europe, we have to do more to protect a rules-based international order.     German Chancellor Angela Merkel congratulated President-elect Donald Trump on his victory and offered to work closely with him on the basis of ""democratic values"" including respecting people's dignity regardless of their origin or religion. (Reuters)   We also empathize with Americans who are war-weary and want nation-building at home. Congress wants allies to contribute more: We get that. The United States may be more worried about China than about Europe: understood.  It's been a bit trickier explaining to Washington that American expectations about German hegemony (at least in the sense of Germany identifying with U.S. interests and getting the rest of Europe to fall in line) weren't realistic. Berlin doesn't always agree with Washington; Europe doesn't take orders from Merkel. But what mattered was that the Obama White House was willing to work closely with Europe and Germany on a host of issues of common concern, such as standing up to Russia. But now we are faced with the prospect of an elected U.S. president who questions the value of NATO and wants to be friends with Vladimir Putin. His victory was greeted with a roar of encouragement from populists, identitarians and culture warriors all over Europe -- including Frauke Petry, the leader of the right-wing Alternative for Germany.  So Merkel's job has just become infinitely harder. She hasn't declared whether she will seek a fourth term in the fall 2017 elections in Germany. Yet the time has passed for her to declare she will not run; it would throw her party into disarray. That makes her the de facto candidate of her Christian Democratic party. It falls to her to apply the lessons of this historically divisive U.S. election to Germany, and to defend Western liberal constitutionalism against the politics of resentment and anger. In this, she will have to learn from Hillary Clinton's mistakes, and to address real and legitimate grievances while countering imaginary or manipulated fears. Part of the challenge is accurately distinguishing between the two. And the hardest test of all: Merkel, a supremely rational thinker and a diffident communicator, will have to learn how to defend Germany's place in the European project and the West with passion. Whether the United States remains her partner in this endeavor is now uncertain. So is whether she can succeed against odds that are piling up against her. This much is sure: Should she lose, the loss would not just be Germany's. But don't replace the Statue of Liberty with one of Angela Merkel just yet.  cstelzenmueller@brookings.edu    Read more on this topic:   Constanze Stelzenmuller: Germany's grand refugee experiment   The Post's View: A respectful but firm message to Mr. Trump   Jackson Diehl: The two immediate tests for Trump's foreign policy   Constanze Stelzenmuller: A newly confident and audacious Germany    "

Montgomery County Public Schools spokeswoman Gboyinde Onijala says Montgomery Blair High School officials expected a protest in the football stadium Monday morning and about 800 students attended. Most returned to class, but she says some left the Silver Spring campus. Onijala says the group joined students from nearby Northwood High School. She estimates that there were 200 to 300 in the group. Media outlets report the group, chanting ""not my president,"" walked a few miles to Westfield Wheaton mall and then four more miles to downtown Silver Spring before dispersing. Police spokesman Capt. Paul Starks says the protesters were peaceful except someone threw a bottle. No one was hurt. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The group called Association for Artists for Change posted a statemen t on Twitter on Monday asking why the artwork they put up early Sunday is more offensive than the name of Winthrop University's Tillman Hall. The group said the display was meant to provoke change.  ""Pitchfork"" Ben Tillman helped lead a mob that killed four blacks in July 1876 as racist whites pushed to regain control of state government during Reconstruction. He served as South Carolina governor from 1890 to 1894. Eighteen stockings filled with dirt to look abstractly like a human head and body were left hanging on branches and a sign with ""Tillman's Legacy"" was taped to a plaque. The university called the display ""hurtful."" ___ 10:55 a.m. Authorities are investigating after someone left black nylon stockings filled with dirt hanging from trees outside a South Carolina university hall named for an avowed racist. A Winthrop University Police report says 18 stockings were found Sunday outside Tillman Hall, with a sign taped over a plaque reading ""Tillman's Legacy."" Tillman was a South Carolina governor and a U.S. senator. He helped lead a mob that killed four blacks in July 1876 and said African-Americans were barbarians and savages. The police report says the stockings appeared to be placed overnight. There was no security camera footage. Winthrop president Dan Mahony says the university doesn't know the reason for the display and will fully investigate the actions. The university can't change the name of Tillman Hall without legislative approval. ___ This story has been corrected to state 18 stockings were found hanging from branches.

""Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday night.     Trump, who aggressively tweeted during the campaign, had been notably muted on Twitter in the final days leading to the election. Reports suggest that his staff had been managing his Twitter feed to avoid messaging hiccups.  Trump's tweet came after thousands of protesters took to the streets Wednesday and Thursday to protest his victory, his character and campaign rhetoric, which was described as racist, misogynistic and inflammatory. Critics argued that Trump's tweet came when he should be working to unite the nation after one of the most heated campaigns in modern political history. By Friday morning, Trump's tweets had changed tone. ""Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!"" he tweeted early Friday morning.     "

Now, for some, there are tears and disappointment -- but a desire, too, to reach out.  ""To all of the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams,"" Democrat Hillary Clinton said in her concession speech after Republican Donald Trump was declared the president-elect. This week, a number of girls have pulled out their pencils and keyboards to write notes and blog posts -- not just to Clinton but also to Trump, whose sometimes harsh remarks about women throughout the campaign did not go unnoticed. Below are letters that were sent to The Associated Press following an online request for notes to either candidate; others were found through internet searches. The AP obtained permission from parents and the young authors to share these words, along with drawings and photographs. Here are some excerpts, first from letters to Clinton and the rest addressed to Trump. ___ Grace Songer, 13, Cold Spring, Kentucky:  ""Dear Secretary Clinton . Thank you for allowing me to say I remember when, for the first time, a woman was nominated as a major party candidate for president. . Thank you for planting seeds in a garden that will flourish from this day on, maintained by all of the independent women in our country and the world.

Thank you for inspiring me to become a leader."" ___ Amaya Johnson, 12, Lansing, Michigan:  ""You inspired me to look past the sexism in this world and stand tall and proud as a female who is equal. ...

Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs to cheat his way to seven consecutive Tour de France wins. The two largest political parties have used gerrymandering to create performance-enhancing districts that rig elections for their congressional and legislative nominees.  Maryland's 3rd Congressional District staggers like a drunken sailor from Annapolis to Towson to Olney, dividing neighborhood after neighborhood. The 6th District, drawn by Democrats to defeat U.S. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R) , and the 8th District slice communities across Montgomery and Frederick counties. Used as pawns, more than 60 percent of Montgomery's residents were moved to a different congressional district in 2011. Appalled by his party's gerrymander, Bethesda resident and American University law school student Steve Shapiro sued Maryland. In 2015, after years of hard work, he and his attorney, Michael Kimberly, persuaded the Supreme Court to unanimously order that a three-judge panel review whether Maryland's gerrymander, which looks like blood spatter from a crime scene, violates the First Amendment by intentionally depriving a group of voters -- in this case, Republicans in Maryland's 6th District -- of a voice in the House of Representatives because of their party affiliation. In August, the panel ruled that the case has merit and can proceed. The results could sink gerrymandering throughout the country. In Virginia, Republicans drew performance-enhancing congressional districts that rig most elections for their nominees by packing registered Democrats into as few districts as possible. Republicans hold eight of Virginia's 11 House seats, even though Democrats consistently win statewide elections. After Democrats sued, a three-judge panel redrew the redistricting map this year to give African American voters a better chance to have a potentially decisive impact in two congressional districts rather than just one. Democrats won both districts on Nov. 8. In no small part because of gerrymandering, low-turnout primaries rather than higher-turnout general elections are the key contests in an overwhelming majority of congressional and legislative elections. Gerrymandering cheats the public of legislators who must appeal to an ideologically broad group of people to get elected and creates incentives for officials to legislate as if only primary voters matter, especially in states with closed primaries where unaffiliated voters -- more than 140,000 in Montgomery County alone! -- are prohibited from voting in all but the nonpartisan races. Gerrymandering exacerbates political polarization, contributes to gridlock in Congress and undermines competition in legislative seats as well. In the 2014 general election for Virginia state House and state Senate, most incumbents faced no major-party opponent.  But gerrymandering isn't inevitable; California has eliminated it. In 2008 and 2010, California voters used their initiative power to petition to the ballot and approve an independent redistricting commission that excludes elected officials from any decision-making role in redrawing congressional and legislative boundaries. California's districts are now compact and aren't drawn to rig elections for one party or for incumbents. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), the first governor in the state elected using public financing, fulfilled his 2014 campaign pledge to tackle gerrymandering by proposing an independent redistricting commission. Democrats in Annapolis promptly deep-sixed the bill. Since a September 2015 Goucher Poll of Marylanders found that 73 percent support an independent redistricting commission, Hogan's approval ratings will likely increase as his championship of political reform becomes better known.  In 2011, few Democratic legislators in Annapolis broke party ranks and voted against the nation's worst congressional gerrymander; no Republican state senators in Richmond opposed the gerrymander there. Unlike in California, voters in Maryland and Virginia can't initiate a ballot measure to establish a new law. Given that reality -- and the difficulty of persuading legislators who benefit from gerrymandering to remove themselves from the process -- court-imposed congressional redistricting standards, which Shapiro's case may bring about, are needed to prevent legislators in Maryland, Virginia and other states from creating ""gerry-rigged"" districts again after the 2020 Census. Eventually, Lance Armstrong was held accountable for using performance-enhancing drugs to rig races. Voters should hold state officials accountable who undermine democracy by approving performance-enhancing districts to rig elections.

But the nation's problem with homelessness is writ large here in the capital. The Post reported in May 2015 that 11,623 people in the area were homeless during that year's winter. According to a study released in May 2016, the number of homeless people in the D.C. area grew 14 percent in one year. If you walk through the District, you are essentially guaranteed to bear witness to homelessness. Our political leaders do not live in Duloc, the pristine, fictional city in the movie ""Shrek."" Our political leaders cannot be oblivious to a problem in front of their eyes. While walking past a certain hipster salad joint in Dupont Circle that charges $12 for a bowl of romaine and quinoa, I saw a homeless man sitting outside the restaurant with a cup out for change.  Now, the problem here is not the dozens of relatively affluent people who frequent the local business. Rather, the injustice is that we can see the salad joint as evidence of the capital's strong economy, yet so little economic resources are used to give essentials to the city's most vulnerable. I bought the man a salad, because how could you not? But the problem can't be solved with one bowl of salad and some goodwill. When U.S. leaders consider shaping foreign policy, the idea is often discussed that the country should lead by setting an example with its economic and human rights record. The nation's political leaders should likewise set an example for the rest of the major U.S. cities by taking it upon themselves to tackle the capital's homelessness head-on. In the District, Congress has a peculiar, and often-resented, degree of authority over local affairs. In the simplest terms, with great power comes great responsibility to the residents of the city that the federal government inhabits.  Let's not ignore the efforts made by nonprofit agencies to help the most vulnerable in our capital and nation at large. At the same time, let's call upon our representatives in Congress, the most powerful entity that calls the District home, to help  their neighbors. Let's look our neighbors in the eye and commit to helping them, to helping our homeless and hungry citizens. If we want our nation's capital to represent our most dearly held American values, then we must help everyone, and especially the most vulnerable residents, have a place to call home.

Obama leaves Monday for a six-day trip to Greece, Germany and Peru. In Greece, he'll tour the Parthenon, give a speech about globalization and meet with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. The White House says the stop in Greece is Obama's final state visit before leaving office. Obama in Germany will meet and have dinner with Chancellor Angela Merkel, and also meet with a group of European leaders that includes British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Francois Hollande. He'll attend an Asia economic summit in Peru, and while in Lima will also meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Australian Prime Minster Malcolm Turnbull. The trip was imagined as a goodbye tour and a chance to bolster support for Obama's agreements on Iran's nuclear program, trade and climate change. But deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes says Obama expects to face questions about how Trump's election affects those deals. In the case of trade, White House officials acknowledged on Friday that it was now up to Trump and Republican congressional leaders to determine the future of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Although many Republicans support free trade, Trump spent months blasting the 12-nation agreement, and both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have indicated it won't come to a vote before Obama leaves office. On Friday, Rhodes could not describe a path ahead for the deal.  ""We're clear-eyed about the current situation,"" Rhodes said. ""But we believe what we believe about the value of trade and the importance of the Asia-Pacific region to the United States. And I think, given its size and importance, it's going to have to continue to be a focus for the next president and Congress going forward no matter what."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
