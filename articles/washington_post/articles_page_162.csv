The Democratic mayor has said President-elect Donald Trump will have to work to mend relationships in a city where 93 percent of voters supported other candidates. She has also reaffirmed that Washington is a ""sanctuary city"" where police don't ask for people's immigration status or share that information with federal authorities. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 12-to-1 margin in the city. The conference call on Saturday afternoon will include Bowser and community leaders and is free to anyone who wishes to join. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

""Signals I am receiving are increasing the possibility of reaching an agreement,"" said Zanganeh. Speaking after meeting with visiting OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, Zanganeh reiterated that his country will push for more production. Iran has been trying to increase its production after the lifting of international sanctions over its nuclear program in January, and said it would only consider a ceiling once it starts producing its pre-sanctions volume of 4 million barrels per day.

(Chuck Kennedy/White House)  An Alabama police officer has been fired for sharing racist memes, including one about Michelle Obama. Talladega Police Officer Joel Husk was terminated Wednesday for violating the department's social media and code of conduct policies, City Manager Patrick Bryant said. Husk had posted several memes on his Facebook page, including one showing Obama and Melania Trump. ""Fluent in Slovenian, English, French, Serbian, and German,"" it said over Trump's photo. Over Obama's, it read: ""Fluent in Ghetto."" Bryant, the city manager, said statements that are ""deemed to be biased or racially insensitive or derogatory"" can affect the community's trust in the police department and, when that happens, ""we have to take action to correct it.""    (Courtesy of the City of Talladega)  ""As public employees, and especially law enforcement officers, we have a standard of excellence to uphold,"" Bryant told The Washington Post.   ['Ape in heels': W.Va. mayor resigns amid controversy over racist comments about Michelle Obama]   Husk, 37, who had been with the department for about two and a half years, had also shared a meme showing President Obama with the words: ""Was Dallas a terrorist attack? Yes! Carried out by Obama's own homegrown terrorist group!"" Another meme he shared depicted Klansmen carrying a Confederate flag. ""The KKK is a hate group right? Isn't it about time we start being honest in America . . . and admit that #blacklivesmatter is also a hate group?"" it read. Husk could not be reached for comment. Since Donald Trump was elected president, a wave of racially and religiously motivated acts of intimidation, violence and harassment have swept across the country -- from a middle school in Michigan and a high school in Pennsylvanian to universities in Texas and elsewhere. On Saturday, an Episcopal church in Maryland was vandalized with the message: ""Trump nation. Whites only."" The next morning, in Indiana, the organist at an Episcopal church discovered a swastika, an anti-gay slur and ""HEIL TRUMP"" spray-painted on the outside walls. In an interview on CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" Trump said he was ""so saddened to hear"" people were harassing others in his name. ""And I say, 'Stop it,' "" Trump said in the interview, which was broadcast Sunday. ""If it -- if it helps, I will say this, and I will say it right to the cameras: 'Stop it.' "" Days later, a Maryland high school student wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat was injured and taken to a hospital after a fight with a group of anti-Trump protesters who punched and kicked him.    (Courtesy of the City of Talladega)  The ugliness has also swept across social media and has even involved some community leaders. The mayor in a tiny town in West Virginia resigned this week and the director of a government-funded nonprofit was removed from her position amid a nationwide uproar over a racist comment about the first lady.      The mayor of a tiny West Virginia town has resigned amid outrage over her comment on social media describing first lady Michelle Obama an ""ape in heels."" (Reuters)   Pamela Ramsey Taylor, who was director of the Clay County Development Corp., took to Facebook to comment on the upcoming shift to Melania Trump, writing: ""It will be so refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady back in the White House. I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels."" ""Just made my day Pam,"" Clay Mayor Beverly Whaling responded, according to news reports. On Tuesday, Whaling, who had three years left in her term, submitted a letter of resignation.   [A Tenn. jail official called the KKK 'more American' than Obama. Now he's out of a job.]   Michelle Obama, who graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, has spoken in the past about being the target of racism. In 2014, she urged high school seniors in Topeka, Kan., to help break down ""old prejudices."" ""As you go forth, when you encounter folks who still hold the old prejudices because they've only been around folks like themselves, when you meet folks who think they know all the answers because they've never heard any other viewpoints, it's up to you to help them see things differently,"" she said. The next year, she talked to graduates at Tuskegee University in Alabama about having been targeted. ""There was the first time I was on a magazine cover -- it was a cartoon drawing of me with a huge Afro and machine gun,"" she said. ""Now, yeah, it was satire, but if I'm really being honest, it knocked me back a bit. It made me wonder, just how are people seeing me? ""Or you might remember the onstage celebratory fist bump between me and my husband after a primary win that was referred to as a 'terrorist fist jab.' And over the years, folks have used plenty of interesting words to describe me. One said I exhibited 'a little bit of uppity-ism.' Another noted that I was one of my husband's 'cronies of color.' Cable news once charmingly referred to me as 'Obama's Baby Mama.' "" She warned the graduates at the historically black university that people may not always see them for who they are. ""Instead they will make assumptions about who they think you are based on their limited notion of the world,"" she said. ""And my husband and I know how frustrating that experience can be. We've both felt the sting of those daily slights throughout our entire lives -- the folks who crossed the street in fear of their safety; the clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores; the people at formal events who assumed we were the 'help' -- and those who have questioned our intelligence, our honesty, even our love of this country."" Although the first lady acknowledged those moments ""can feel isolating,"" she said that ""those feelings are not an excuse to just throw up our hands and give up."" Then, in April, she told graduates at Jackson State University: ""When they go low, I go high."" As outrage swelled over the former Alabama officer's Facebook posts, the Talladega city manager said Friday that he was ""incredibly disappointed and frustrated."" Bryant said he was alerted to Husk's social-media activity late Tuesday and ""immediately initiated disciplinary procedures,"" but he said he could not go into detail about the case because it's an ongoing personnel issue. Employees, he said, have a right to appeal disciplinary actions. But Bryant confirmed that Husk has been fired from the police department. ""Honesty and integrity are of the utmost importance, and those qualities in a public servant are the foundation upon which good government is laid,"" Bryant said. ""We're as only effective as the trust the community has in us,"" he added. Read more: 'I voted for Trump!

The first convoy of Chinese trucks carrying goods for sale abroad arrived in Pakistan a day earlier through newly constructed roads which link China's northwestern Xinjiang region with southwest Pakistan. China is building a network of roads and power plants under a project known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC, which is expected to absorb $46 billion in Chinese investment in the coming decades. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the country's powerful army chief Gen. Raheel Sharif traveled to Gwadar to see off the Chinese ship. The premier said the Chinese-funded multi-billion dollar project will play a significant role in improving Pakistan's economy and raising the national standard of living. In speech to a gathering of diplomats, civil and military leadership, Nawaz Sharif vowed to provide best the possible security to all foreign investors. He said that CPEC will benefit for 3 billion people in the region. ""The Enemies of CPEC are enemies of Pakistan,"" he said. Amid security concerns for foreign workers, the Pakistani army has created a special force to guard the new trade routes and the port, which is located in the same province where a Saturday blast at a Sufi shrine killed more than 50 people. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State group and Pakistani officials said it was partially aimed at harming the Chinese-funded projects in the southwest and elsewhere in the country. Sunday's ceremony provided the rare sight of the prime minister and the army chief sitting together and smiling. Relations between Pakistan's civil and military leadership have been publicly strained for months. A prominent newspaper reporter recently published an article alleging tensions between the government and army over the country's counter-terrorism strategy. The article prompted accusations from the army that details had been leaked by the government, and Prime Minister Sharif launched an investigation into the issue. China and Pakistan have long maintained close political and military relations, based partly on mutual antipathy toward neighboring India. The Gwadar port is located on the Arabian Sea and it occupies a strategic location between South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. The port is also located at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, just outside the Straits of Hormuz. China is seeking convenient and reliable access to the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. Chinese ships now use the Strait of Malacca, a narrow passage between the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia. The proposed new route would give China access to the Persian Gulf region and the Middle East.

Suddenly, she swiveled around -- and there was Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Cheers and prolonged applause rang out from the crowd at the Kennedy Center on Saturday night even before Ginsburg, a life-long opera lover who was making her official operatic debut, opened her mouth to speak as the imperious Duchess of Krakenthorp. Her character, a non-singing role in Donizetti's frothy 1840 comedy, had come to find out whether the title character, Marie, was worthy of marrying her nephew. Looking frail but determined and wearing an elegant acid green silk dress, the 83-year-old justice read from a crib sheet a series of qualifications that sounded very much like requirements for high political or judicial office. Her deadpan delivery was boosted by a microphone, although laughter from the audience occasionally drowned her out. Some samples: --""The best of the house of Krakenthorp have open but not empty minds. The best are willing to listen and learn. No surprise, then, that the most valorous Krakenthorpians have been women."" --""Applicants seeking a station so exalted must have the fortitude to undergo strict scrutiny. Their character must be beyond reproach."" Her biggest laugh came when -- in apparent reference to the bogus ""birther"" campaign against President Obama -- she asked whether Marie could produce a birth certificate and added: ""We must take precautions against fraudulent pretenders."" Ginsburg herself wrote her dialogue, in collaboration with Kelley Rourke, dramaturg for the Washington National Opera, which is presenting a new production of the opera. In the original version of ""La Fille du Regiment,"" as it is known in French, the duchess has little dialogue, but the role is often taken by comedians or aging singers who improvise their own lines. Francesca Zambello, the WNO's artistic director, had asked Ginsburg to appear in all eight performances, but she declined to do more than opening night, citing her ""day job."" Actress Cindy Gold takes over for the remainder of the run. It wasn't Ginsburg's first time on an opera stage. She had appeared three other times dating back to 1994 but always as a non-speaking supernumerary. This time her presence added a unique luster to a performance that would have been memorable even without her, thanks to world-class singing by the cast, led by soprano Lisette Oropesa as Marie and tenor Lawrence Brownlee as her sweetheart, Tonio. After Ginsburg's first scene she was escorted off stage, while many in the house gave her a standing ovation. But she was back again near the end, this time brought in by a servant in a white powdered wig of the type worn by British judges. Hearing that Marie has decided to marry Tonio instead of the duke, she exclaimed, ""Quel scandale!"" and retreated to a chair, fanning herself vigorously until the curtain fell. And she would appear one final time, led on during the curtain calls by Brownlee. Then, leaning on him for a bit of support, one of the most influential and revered women in American life smiled and curtsied three times to the audience. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Bernie Sanders listens as the Vermont delegation casts its roll-call vote at the Democratic National Convention in July. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)  As Democrats search for a way forward, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) offered this advice on Sunday: ""Pound away"" on issues on which most Americans agree with the Democratic Party's positions. Sanders, the runner-up for the Democratic presidential nomination, said during an appearance on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that the contest between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton was largely devoid of issues that matter to voters. Trump was elected president on Tuesday.      Former Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on Sunday, Nov. 13, that he is prepared to ""work with"" President-elect Donald Trump provided he champions working families, and vowed to ""oppose him vigorously"" if Trump resorts to ""discrimination"" and ""xenophobia."" (Reuters)   ""I am tired of watching television where you have a campaign which is about Mr. Trump's attitude toward women versus Hillary Clinton's emails,"" Sanders said. ""You know what? Those are not the major issues facing America. The middle class of this country for 40 years has been in decline.""   [A series of strategic mistakes likely sealed Clinton's fate]   Sanders said the way for Democrats to win back working-class voters lost to Trump is to focus relentlessly on issues on which polls show a majority of voters on the side of Democrats. ""On virtually every major issue -- raising the minimum wage, climate change, pay equity for women, rebuilding our infrastructure, making public colleges and universities tuition-free -- we are the majority,"" he said. ""That is what the American people want. And the Democrats will win elections by pounding away on those issues."" ""By the way, let's not forget Hillary Clinton did win more voters than Mr. Trump,"" Sanders added, referring to her share of the popular vote. ""So pound away on the issues that bring people together, fight vigorously against all forms of bigotry."" Sanders's appearance coincided with the release of his book, ""Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In."" The first half of the book recounts his upstart campaign, while the second half details his policy prescriptions for the country."

The Fix's Peter Stevenson explains what his relationship with the press might look like going forward. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   President-elect Donald Trump sounded very much like presidential candidate Donald Trump on Sunday morning in a pair of misleading tweets about the New York Times.   Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the ""Trump phenomena"" -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016     The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it? -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016   According to the New York Times Co.'s latest earnings report, the number of print copies it sold in the third quarter was down from the same period in 2015, but the decline was more than offset by 116,000 new digital-only subscriptions. Overall, third-quarter circulation revenue rose 3 percent; through the first nine months of the year, circulation revenue was up 2.8 percent. Since Trump launched his White House campaign in June 2015, digital-only news subscriptions to the Times have increased 35 percent, to more than 1.3 million. Trump's suggestion that the Times is bleeding readers because of ""very poor and highly inaccurate coverage"" does not square with the numbers. The president-elect's interpretation of a letter to subscribers as an apology for bad coverage is a stretch. Times publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. wrote Friday that one of the ""inevitable questions"" in the aftermath of the campaign is: ""Did Donald Trump's sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?"" ""As we reflect on this week's momentous result, and the months of reporting and polling that preceded it, we aim to rededicate ourselves to the fundamental mission of Times journalism,"" Sulzberger added.   Letter to NYT readers from Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet pic.twitter.com/jORqzx3BA9 -- Sydney Ember (@melbournecoal) November 11, 2016   Trump's tweet mirrored coverage of the letter in some conservative media outlets, which seized on portions of Sulzberger's message. ""NY Times admits biased coverage on Trump,"" read a headline on Newsmax. A headline on Breitbart News, chaired by Trump campaign chief executive Steve Bannon, read, ""New York Times publisher promises to 'rededicate' paper to honest reporting."" ""Had the paper actually been fair to both candidates, it wouldn't need to rededicate itself to honest reporting,"" Michael Goodwin wrote in the New York Post. Yet Sulzberger's full letter makes clear that he was simply renewing a promise that he believes the Times fulfilled during the campaign. ""We believe we reported on both candidates fairly during the presidential campaign,"" he wrote.

Voting experts believe the laws had some effect on turnout this year, but said it would be difficult to measure against other factors -- such as a lack of enthusiasm for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton and the decision of many people simply not to vote. They expressed frustration that some states had made it more difficult for voters to participate, even if there is no evidence the changes influenced the outcome of the presidential election.  ""There were clearly many people who bore the brunt of new voting restrictions or who were otherwise unable to participate, and that is not acceptable in a democracy,"" said Wendy Weiser, head of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU's School of Law. She said a few battleground states won by Trump were among the states that had enacted restrictions in recent years, including Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Wisconsin. In some of the states, the margins between Trump and Clinton were simply too great for voting restrictions to have been a deciding factor. But Weiser said the roughly 27,000-vote difference in Wisconsin was concerning, given the turmoil surrounding the state's voter ID law. With lower than expected turnout, Trump was the first Republican since Ronald Reagan in 1984 to win the state. It's been estimated that as many as 300,000 Wisconsin voters did not have the required photo ID. Molly McGrath, with the national group VoteRiders, spent Tuesday fielding dozens of calls from voters who had questions about the law. In one case, she picked up a 99-year-old retired university professor named Fred at his polling place and drove him to a DMV office so he could get his photo ID. He had let his license expire, preferring instead to walk or ride his bike.  ""How many Freds are there? How many Freds decided not to call?"" McGrath said. ""There is 100 percent no doubt in my mind that people fell through the cracks and didn't have their votes counted. And when we see the numbers of how close this election was, we should all be unsettled by that."" With black and Hispanic voters, Trump apparently did as well as Republican Mitt Romney when Romney lost to President Barack Obama in 2012, according to exit polls. Trump appeared to have won more than half of white voters, who made up 70 percent of the electorate. The 2016 election was the first without a key enforcement provision of the Voting Rights Act that had required some states and counties to receive approval before enacting new election laws. The 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling setting aside that requirement opened the way for voter ID and other measures that reduced early voting, straight-ticket voting and same-day registration. Those actions were taken primarily by Republican lawmakers, who said they were targeting voter fraud. Even though court decisions have rolled back some of the more far-reaching restrictions, civil rights groups were concerned that confusion over the laws could deter voters. Sandy Fambrough, a deputy poll judge in Denton County, Texas, said she witnessed violations of court-ordered changes to the state's voter ID law. Texas was forced to soften its voter ID law after a federal appeals court deemed it discriminatory. Under the original law, it was estimated that some 600,000 eligible voters didn't have an acceptable form of ID.  ""Who knows how many people didn't vote because they were given the wrong information?"" Fambrough said. In North Carolina, voter ID requirements and early voting reductions were struck down after a federal appeals court said they ""target African Americans with almost surgical precision."" Republican officials have said discrimination was not their intent. After some North Carolina counties reduced hours and polling places during the first week of early voting, one researcher found black turnout was down 13 percent compared with the 2012 election. On Tuesday, Trump won the state by about 178,000 votes over Clinton.  ""Even if those states didn't have those laws, it's not at all clear that the outcome would have been any different,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law expert and professor at UC Irvine's School of Law. He said he would not be surprised if more states pass restrictive voting laws in the years to come.  ""It's not hard to imagine that this will give a green light to engage in ever more restrictive voting laws,"" he said. ___ Associated Press writers Frank Bajak in Houston and Stephen Braun in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow Christina Almeida Cassidy at http://twitter.com/AP_Christina.

(Fotis Plegas/Reuters)  Every year, Golden Dawn, an anti-immigrant Greek neo-Nazi party, holds a rally at a rugged mountain pass once known as the ""hot gates,"" because of the sulfuric springs bubbling beneath. It's the site where a small band of Spartan warriors stalled the might of the advancing Persian empire almost 2,500 years ago. The Golden Dawn members gather, torches in hand, around a bronze statue of the Spartan King Leonidas -- who famously perished alongside his 300 companions -- sing the national anthem and chant far-right slogans. ""Greece belongs to the Greeks!"" goes one cry. ""People! Army! Nationalism!"" is another. The ancient Battle of Thermopylae, though, doesn't resonate only with them. In a year defined by growing right-wing nationalism on both sides of the pond, it remains a curiously conspicuous rallying cry for myriad populists and conservative movements. And that includes American supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Beginning with the account of Greek historian Herodotus, the clash, which took place in 480 B.C., has become a kind of foundation myth of Western civilization. The heroic Spartan stand -- whose numbers were closer to 7,000 than 300 -- in the face of the mongrel, polyglot Persian hordes is cast as a primordial act of sacrifice for the liberty of a people. The historical consensus, both among ancient chroniclers and current scholars, was that Thermopylae was a clear Greek defeat; the Persian invasion would be pushed back in later ground and naval battles. But its legacy still reverberates millennia later. ""The Spartan chant,'We are what you were; we will be what you are,' "" 19th-century French philologist Ernst Renan wrote in his seminal treatise on the idea of a nation, ""is, in its simplicity, the abridged hymn of every fatherland."" And consider the opening narration to the 1962 Hollywood film ""The 300 Spartans"" -- the cinematic precursor to the campy, overly-stylized 2007 ""300."" At a time when the Cold War was in full swing, it set down the stakes of a clash with the East: Across the hush of 24 centuries, this is the story of a turning point in history. Of a blazing day when 300 Greek warriors fought here, to hold with their lives their freedom ... and ours. This is a powerful claim that many in the West intuitively accept: Thermopylae is the Alamo of antiquity, a doomed contest between the brave few and a gargantuan foe that stirred their compatriots to action. Had Xerxes, a Persian emperor, snuffed out all Greek resistance, then the scattered city-states on the western side of the Aegean Sea would have just become one more province of what was a vast, mutli-ethnic empire. What would happen to our supposed Greek inheritance -- the principles of democracy and reason? Frank Miller, an American graphic novelist whose work gave rise to the ""300"" film series, sketched the implications most crudely with his book: ""The army of Persia--a force so vast it shakes the earth with its march -- is poised to crush Greece, an island of reason and freedom in a sea of mysticism and tyranny."" Whatever the historical merits of this belief -- and more on that below -- the ghost of Leonidas looms large in the right-wing imagination. A host of far-right groups, including neo-Nazi organizations in the United States and Australia, have invoked this history in their own political iconography. The anonymous blogger who translated the anti-immigrant writings of Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik into more than a dozen languages went by the screen name ""Angus Thermopylae."" You can get a taste of the phenomenon through a search on Twitter or Google for the phrase ""Molon Labe"": translated roughly as ""come and take it,"" the laconic response Leonidas is said to have given to an envoy of the Persian emperor who demanded the Spartans lay down their arms. Since the popularization of the ""300"" story, ""Molon Labe"" became a kind of code word for gun-rights supporters in the United States, as well as the tea party movement, a catchall slogan for those irked by the invasive power of the federal government and the supposed leftist aim to take away their weapons. On social media, that messaging now co-exists with #maga -- ""Make America Great Again"" -- and other online slang used by Trump supporters. One example: Molon Labe Industries, an online store for right-wing paraphernalia that has more than 300,000 subscribers or ""likes"" on its Facebook page, melds a whole range of right-wing memes, as can be seen in this image of its Facebook page:     The echo of Thermopylae and the lionization of the Spartans is popular among the fringe American ultranationalists and online xenophobes who have come to be known as the ""alt-right."" Earlier this year, a YouTube user named ""Aryan Wisdom"" uploaded a video where scenes from ""300"" were edited over with speeches from Trump and his political rivals. The Republican nominee, unsurprisingly, is cast here as a Spartan warlord, facing down a callow President Obama and the man behind it all -- Xerxes, or in this case, the American financier George Soros. The video makes the Persians out to be bomb-throwing Muslim terrorists, Obama a feckless lieutenant to dark forces, and Hillary Clinton a slave to the lusts of a ""globalist"" -- hint: Jewish -- elite. It has been watched more than 2 million times.    And myriad Trump supporters invoke Thermopylae in their celebration of the Republican candidate:         Golden Dawn, which overtly clings to the mythic legacy of the Spartans, is now the third biggest political party in Greece, despite a record of racially-instigated violence and Nazi apologia. Last month, it formally endorsed Trump from the floor of the Greek parliament, hailing the ""patriotic wind"" blowing through Europe and across the Atlantic. ""It's blowing in the United States, where it appears that the next president will be a patriot president,"" said party spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris. He went on: ""The geopolitical balance will change. And most interesting of all is that tomorrow's president of the United States is supported in Greece only by Golden Dawn."" Trump himself may not appreciate having such admirers from afar. But the politics channeled by his campaign are part of a larger far-right populist turn in the West, as WorldViews has documented over the course of the year. Moreover, the symbolism of Thermopylae is disconcertingly relevant to the ideology of the European far right. ""Ancient Sparta is proto-fascist,"" Paul Cartledge, a celebrated British classicist and author of ""Thermopylae: The Battle That Changed the World,"" among numerous other works on ancient Greece, said in an interview with WorldViews. Although the clash between Greeks and Persians may be remembered now as the battle that crystallized Western liberty, the ancient Spartans were no model democrats -- even in their time. Their society was communal and militarist. It practiced early forms of eugenics and infanticide. It kept a huge slave population in thrall to its warrior elite. Some contemporary scholars even liken conditions in the city-state to a kind of apartheid. For all these reasons, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler happened to be a huge admirer of Sparta. ""Sparta must be regarded as the first volkisch state,"" Hitler once said, referring to a racially ordered polity. ""The exposure of the sick, weak, deformed children, in short, their destruction, was more decent and in truth a thousand times more human than the wretched insanity of our day which preserves the most pathological subject."" In his desolation of Europe and mass slaughter of millions, the Nazi leader saw himself marching in the wake of Spartan hoplites. And what about the Persians? As much as they've come to symbolize an alien menace, an Eastern Other, an empire floating in a ""sea of mysticism,"" they weren't all that different from the Greeks they were fighting. Greek-speaking troops from the western ends of the Persian empire formed a crucial part of Xerxes's army. There's evidence, too, that Greek-speaking cities ruled by the Persians were afforded their own system of democracy. Tyranny, a Greek word, was a practiced form of government in various Greek city-states. Persian-ruled cities like Babylon and Taxila, in what's now Pakistan, were home to great centers of science and learning. ""It's a clash of political civilizations, it's not a clash of religions,"" Cartledge said, arguing the difference between the two sides was less cultural than it has been made out to be. ""Xerxes didn't conduct his campaign on the basis of a crusade."" And, ultimately, for all the heroism of the Persian wars, the Greeks would turn against one another. In the wake of the Persian retreat, the rival powers of Sparta and Athens built regional alliances and mini-empires of their own and soon locked horns in three decades of ruinous conflict that spanned the Mediterranean. ""The Greeks fought each other as much they fought others,"" Cartledge said. At a time when nationalist movements are rallying around the mythic, patriotic deeds of the past, it's important to remember how fleeting those moments can be.

Recent polling has given Republican Donald Trump a slight edge over Democrat Hillary Clinton, but Democrats cite an advantage in early voting as evidence that it could be a close night. On Friday, the final day of early voting, thousands of Arizonans stood in long lines. Two other races in the state also signal the growing power of the state's Latino voters. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who has tepidly stood by Trump's candidacy this year, is running for a sixth term. McCain appears headed to victory due partly to modest Latino support. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a Republican who became a polarizing national figure in the debate over immigration and border control, is facing the toughest reelection of his 24-year reign amid tussles with the Justice Department. National liberal and Hispanic groups have targeted the race as a chance to knock off the man they consider the poster boy for unjust immigration detention policies.   Colorado:  Colorado is one of the most widely swinging battleground states. It cast its vote for Republican George W. Bush in 2004 by a higher percentage than the nation as a whole. Four years later, it did the same thing -- except for Democrat Barack Obama. That pattern is set to hold if the nation votes for Clinton. She's been leading in most polls in Colorado for most of the general election. Her campaign didn't run TV ads in the state for most of this campaign, though she has jumped in with ads in the past few days, as the race has tightened. Only termed a swing state in the past few elections, Colorado has been shifting to the left rapidly. This year, for the first time in decades, Democratic and unaffiliated voters outnumber Republicans. The state's growing Latino population, more than 20 percent as well as the Denver area's explosion of younger voters are among the reasons for the shift. Yet, like other Western swing states, Colorado is starkly divided, with a strong conservative streak as well. If Clinton wins Colorado, it will be the first time in a century Colorado has voted for the Democratic nominee for president three times in a row.   Florida: The Sunshine State is once again the center of the presidential campaign and has been a frequent stop for Clinton and Trump. Florida is essential to Trump's chances. Barring big upsets elsewhere, failure to win here blocks the Republican's path to the 270 electoral votes he needs to capture the White House. Clinton and Trump have focused especially on winning Central Florida, which stretches east to west from Daytona Beach on the Atlantic Coast and ending in Tampa. Democrats are buoyed by record-high early voting by Latinos fueled primarily by an influx of Puerto Ricans fleeing the island's economic difficulties. Across Florida, more Latinos had voted by Wednesday than during the entire early voting period in 2012, according to the Clinton campaign. The politics of South Florida are also shifting as young Cuban-Americans buck their elders and align with Democrats. The state's closely watched U.S. Senate race pits Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who used his presidential campaign to trash Congress, against Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.). Rubio has surged ahead, and Democrats have pared back ad spending, but Murphy could be helped if Clinton pulls far ahead of Trump.   Georgia: The last Democrat to carry Georgia was a fellow southerner, Bill Clinton in 1992, so the Peach State didn't appear particularly ripe for Hillary Clinton when the race began. But it has turned unexpectedly competitive this year. Several recent polls have shown the contest to be within the margin of error or Trump leading by a modest margin. Clinton is being buoyed by an overwhelming lead among black voters in Atlanta and elsewhere. She was up 89 percent to 5 percent among African Americans in an NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released last week. The booming Atlanta suburbs have opened a possible path to victory for Democrats that does not require winning over conservative whites, the bedrock of Trump's constituency. A key will be how well Clinton can mobilize not only African Americans but also growing populations of Latinos and Asian Americans. Some Democrats acknowledge they could be another election away from being consistently competitive. Sensing an opportunity, the Clinton campaign stepped up investments in its ground game in Georgia in August, and a supportive super PAC is airing television ads.   Iowa: Donald Trump's strength among white, non-college-educated voters could help swing Iowa to the GOP this cycle, after it voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012. Iowa is more than 90 percent white. Trump has a five-point lead, according to a polling average of recent surveys calculated by The Washington Post. The Clinton campaign has touted its robust ground operation in Iowa, but the candidate herself has not held many rallies in the state. Trump has faced criticism in many battleground states for implementing a late and weak ground operation and relying on operatives who lack the strategic experience to keep pace with Democrats. But in Iowa, Trump has Eric Branstad, the son of Gov. Terry Branstad. The Branstads know Iowa politics well, giving Trump a boost he doesn't enjoy in other important states. Trump has made several appearances in the Hawkeye State in recent weeks and has frequently sent his quintessentially Midwestern running mate, Gov. Mike Pence, to campaign there. Despite the buzz, Iowa has just six electoral college votes. Still, it is a must-win for Trump, given his limited path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.       How the electoral college works View Graphic     How the electoral college works    Michigan: This industrial, Midwestern state, which dealt a surprise blow to Clinton in the Democratic primary when it backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), could be poised for another upset in the general election.  Michigan voters have not supported a Republican for president since 1988. But backlash against globalization has made trade deals a major issue in parts of the state where Trump expects to do best, especially among white, non-college-educated voters. With national polls tightening in the final days of the campaign, Trump's campaign has made a late play for Michigan, and Clinton and surrogates have recently increased visits in an effort to boost Election Day turnout. Both campaigns are now airing ads statewide. On Monday, Clinton will visit Grand Rapids, and President Obama will visit Ann Arbor. With an electorate that is 72 percent white, Michigan is one of the least diverse states, meaning Clinton's demographic advantages -- she is strong among minorities -- could be limited. Clinton is trying to maintain her strength in the state's urban centers, particularly among black voters in Detroit. But theys are key, and there are signs in early voting elsewhere that she is struggling with them.   Nevada:  Nevadans have voted for the winner in every presidential election since 1992. But like most swing states, Nevada is starkly divided between red and blue. The state's southern tip, home to Las Vegas and surrounding Clark County, is blue. The northern city of Reno and surrounding Washoe County are purple. And the rural towns dotting the vast expanse of desert in between are red. Nevada is changing, though. Almost a third of the state is Hispanic, and there's a growing Asian American population as well. Democrats have worked hard to harness the state's new population in their favor, and Nevada is leading the way among Western states trending Democratic. Nevada has an independent and libertarian streak, and Trump seems to have tapped into that. He's leading or tied three of the past four high-quality polls, suggesting that his populist economic message is resonating with a Nevadans still struggling to recover from the recession. But early voters -- a solid indicator in Nevada -- favor Democrats in similar numbers to when President Obama won the state in 2012. This race looks like it could be a nail-biter.   New Hampshire: Tiny and independent-minded, New Hampshire figures most prominently in the presidential election as the site of the nation's first primary vote, typically a few days after the kickoff caucuses in Iowa. With four electoral votes, it's not a big prize in the general election, but is considered a battleground because of significant Republican strength amid solidly Democratic northeastern states. New Hampshire has voted Democratic in five of the past six presidential elections. Barack Obama took the state by about 5.5 percentage points over Mitt Romney in 2012, but Clinton looks unlikely to match that margin. The Democrat has suffered a reversal of fortune in New Hampshire in polls over the past two weeks, falling to a two-point lead over the weekend, according to a poll average calculated by The Washington Post. Some polls suggest a strong effect from the announcement on Oct. 28 of a renewed FBI inquiry into Clinton's State Department email. She is expected to return to New Hampshire for a final rally Sunday. In addition, Obama will travel to the state on Monday on the eve of the election -- a sure sign that it is closer than Clinton would like.   New Mexico: The Land of Enchantment has been a Democratic stronghold during the past two presidential elections, with President Obama winning by double-digit margins both times. Trump recently visited the state for an evening airport rally as part of an eleventh-hour attempt to put it in play. But not a single public poll has shown Clinton trailing the Republican nominee there. Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and repeated vows to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border have made him deeply unpopular among Latino voters. That presents a major challenge for him in New Mexico, where exit poll data showed the electorate was more than a third Hispanic in 2012. Clinton has been taking no chances with New Mexico down the stretch, opting to air ads in the state during the final week for the first time in the general election. Democrats have won five of the past six presidential elections in New Mexico. George W. Bush narrowly won here in 2004. One potentially complicating factor for Clinton and Trump: Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson served two terms as governor and has pockets of support. The most recent poll showed Johnson attracting 7 percent of the vote.       What one state shows us about political polarization View Graphic     What one state shows us about political polarization    North Carolina:   North Carolina has been one of the most heavily traveled states on the campaign trail this year and could tip either way. The state has historically been favorable turf for Republicans in presidential races. President Obama narrowly carried the Tar Heel state in 2008 but lost by a close margin to GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Democrats see longer-term trends in the state working in their favor: an influx of white, college-educated professionals along an urban and suburban corridor stretching from Raleigh to Charlotte, and an uptick in the African American share of the electorate -- part of the legacy of Obama's campaigns. To win in North Carolina, Clinton has been banking on an Obama-like turnout from African American voters. According to exit polls, African Americans accounted for about 18 percent of the electorate in 1996. By 2012, the black share of the vote rose to 23 percent. But early voting among that group got off to a slow start this year, raising a flag about enthusiasm. Donald Trump is trying to drive up turnout in rural North Carolina, including the east, where tobacco was once king and where the state is still suffering from manufacturing losses.   Ohio: This Rust Belt state's demographics play to Donald Trump's strengths, with a population that is about 80 percent white -- and heavy with working- and middle-class Americans who are anxious about the economy. Although President Obama carried the state in the 2008 and 2012 elections, Ohio has consistently polled in Trump's favor this cycle. After briefly falling to a tie in some polls in mid-October, Trump now leads Clinton by five percentage points, according to a polling average calculated by The Washington Post. Republicans are bullish that Trump will carry the state, which is a must-win if Trump hopes to take the White House. His considerable strength among white voters in the state, especially those without college degrees, is also bolstered by his double-digit strength among men. (Trump and Clinton appear to be tied with women voters, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll.) The Clinton campaign has made an aggressive push in Ohio in the final days of the election, hoping to compel enough nonwhite voters to cast ballots to stave off a Trump victory. On Friday night, musicians Beyonce and Jay Z headlined a concert in Cleveland to get out the vote.   Pennsylvania: With a large population of working-class and middle-class whites, Pennsylvania is an attractive yet elusive prize for Republicans despite having voted Democratic in the past six elections. Trump has sought to energize the Republican part of the state, which, in past elections, has been outvoted by solidly Democratic Philadelphia in the east and the area around Pittsburgh in the west. Clinton has focused primarily on those two large urban areas this year. For Democrats, winning Philadelphia has become the key to holding Pennsylvania, and doing so means motivating the large African American population in the city along with whiter suburbs at the periphery. Those ""collar counties"" have held appeal for Republicans in past elections but have not given Trump much hope this year. In 2008, Obama won nearly all of the Philadelphia suburbs atop the most populous urban areas. A polling average calculated by The Washington Post gives Clinton a 5-point advantage, but her campaign may see signs of trouble. She is campaigning twice in the state in the closing days of the race, and Vice President Biden, a Pennsylvania native, was spending the entire weekend there on her behalf.   Utah:   Utah, a red state that hasn't chosen a Democrat for president since 1964, isn't likely to do so on Tuesday. But it could be the only state to hand a loss to both Clinton and Trump, thanks to a former CIA agent. Evan McMullin, a Utah-born Mormon, is running for president as an independent. He claims to be competitive in 34 states, either on the ballot or as a write-in candidate. Some polls have shown him tied with Trump here, with Clinton not far behind. McMullin's surge reflects the qualms of Utahns, many of them Mormons, about voting for Trump, a brash, thrice-married New Yorker who has made lewd comments about women and wants to bar Muslims from the country. To take advantage, Clinton opened a campaign office and dispatched surrogates. Mitt Romney, who won Utah with nearly 73 percent of the vote in 2012, strongly disavowed Trump. Others have tried walking a finer line. After a tape emerged of Trump bragging about groping women because he is a ""star,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said he could no longer endorse him. Nineteen days later, Chaffetz said he would vote for Trump.   Virginia: Although Virginia is considered a swing state, for months Clinton had such a comfortable lead that both campaigns went off the airwaves in the summer. But polls have tightened, and both Clinton and Trump are back on TV, and Trump is scheduled to make a last-minute visit on Sunday. Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, will return to his home state the day before Election Day to try to shore up support among African Americans and others in Richmond, where he was once mayor, and in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, a fast-growing region that is rapidly diversifying and trending Democratic. Clinton has several advantages, including strength among suburban college-educated women, a sizable portion of the electorate in Fairfax, Loudoun and Henrico counties. And she stands to benefit from higher enthusiasm among Latinos in the state. Trump has sought to bolster his support among rural voters and made an appeal to the state's heavy presence of active-duty and military veteran. Obama carried the state in 2008 and 2012. A Democratic win could cement Virginia's status as a blue state in presidential races.       In less than a week, the United States will have a new president-elect. These are the pivotal points in Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's campaigns that led to this moment. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)     Wisconsin: The state where the Republican Party was formed has not gone to the GOP nominee for president since 1984, but Trump is making a last-minute and unsteady push to try to turn the state red. Trump had planned to campaign in the state Sunday but abruptly canceled his trip the day before. He had included Wisconsin in his $25 million multistate advertising investment during the final week of the campaign. Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, will barnstorm here Sunday as Democrats hope to maintain the lead they have built. Trump is wagering that his crusade against sweeping multinational trade deals will boost turnout among conservative white, working-class voters who have experienced firsthand the decline of the manufacturing industry in the United States. Wisconsin is the home state of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. The latter has had a rocky relationship with Trump throughout the campaign. The last time Clinton and Trump faced voters in Wisconsin, neither experienced much success: Both lost by double-digit percentage margins to opponents during the primary.   Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly said that if Evan McMullin were to win Utah, he would be the first third-party candidate to win a state in 92 years. George Wallace was the last third-party candidate to win a state; he won five states in 1968.   "
