(Reuters)   President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, according to Trump's campaign. In choosing Priebus, 44, Trump has tapped a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the Republican Party. Priebus was recommended by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and will be a bridge between the White House and the Republican-led Congress, as well as the heads of Cabinet agencies.   [The next big political fight could be between Trump and Republicans]   The choice signals Trump's willingness to work within the very establishment he assailed on the campaign trail. Priebus, a lawyer and longtime Wisconsin political operative, has been head of the RNC since 2011 and is well liked within Washington after years of forging ties with Republican leaders and lawmakers. He will undoubtedly start to smooth over residual friction from a campaign during which a number of Republicans refused to endorse Trump, reversed their endorsements or stepped away from him after a 2005 tape surfaced in which Trump is heard saying that he could force himself on women because he was a ""star."" Trump had the chance to go in the opposite direction in picking his chief of staff: His antagonistic campaign chief executive and head of Brietbart News, Steve Bannon, also was said to be in the running for the job. Bannon will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor instead. As head of Breitbart News, Bannon launched political attacks against Ryan and other Republican leaders, assailing them as weak and ineffective, during the campaign. Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, also was believed to be in the running.   [How the Republican Party created Donald Trump]   Priebus had a few clashes with Trump during the campaign; after the 2005 tape was released, Priebus slammed Trump, stating, ""No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever."" But his main goal has been to unite his party. Since Trump's victory, Priebus said, the president-elect has worked to move away from his divisive campaign rhetoric. ""Once it was determined he was going to be the winner, he started looking at and thinking about that speech,"" Priebus said on Fox News of Trump's victory speech on Tuesday. ""He said, 'We're going to calm the waters. We're going to bring people together. We're not going to brag.' "" He added that Trump is a ""reflective person"" and that his public persona at rallies does not represent the complete man. ""The guy in private is the gracious, personable guy that I've gotten to know. ... I think that's part of the reason why he won,"" Priebus said. Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker who is on Trump's transition team, said the president-elect can work with both sides of the aisle in Congress -- something Priebus will no doubt help smooth. ""Trump has got to be the salesman,"" Gingrich said on CBS's ""Face the Nation. ""Take something big like infrastructure. He can work with [Senate Democratic leader] Chuck Schumer on infrastructure. He can find a bipartisan path that allows us to dramatically improve infrastructure, something Trump knows an immense amount about.""          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

" Okay, the sun did come up, the markets didn't collapse, tanks didn't roll down the street, a climate change denier is only being talked about  as the next head of the EPA. But let's say that Style Invitational entrants were lucky that I didn't have to judge their jokes on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. I couldn't bring myself to even crack a grim smile. (Yeah, I know I shouldn't be revealing my political preferences, but for this election I gave up on objectivity long ago.)  But Lord knows we're going to need to tap into our senses of humor, and within 24 hours or so, I was finding at least a few jokes to smile about. Here's a sampling, in addition to the tweet pictured above:  A tweet that I saw shared on Facebook last night was the first to make me laugh:  ""A brief moment of levity from my wife: 'At this point if a clown invited me into the woods, I'd just go.' "" -- from Nels Anderson, @Nelsormensch   This one by Brian Pedaci was being shared everywhere: BRITAIN: Brexit is the stupidest, most self-destructive act a country could undertake.USA: Hold my beer.    And I liked this one from a Canadian who goes by just Neil (@_enanem): Ok, don't panic... If we hold the North and South Pole down simultaneously for eight seconds, it'll automatically restore to factory settings.  And live on TV by a clearly stunned Stephen Colbert during his election night broadcast: ""We all feel the way Rudy Giuliani looks.""    Of course, the Onion couldn't take off from work. This one was from Thursday morning: ITHACA, NY-- In the hours since the Republican nominee's stunning election to the nation's highest office Tuesday night, reports have confirmed that, regardless of circumstance, it is not even remotely close to okay to act like Donald Trump. .. In fact, acting like Mr. Trump does for even a moment will result in a wide range of negative social--and in some cases, criminal--consequences for you personally. ... At press time, the reports' findings were being summarily dismissed out of hand by roughly 45 percent of the nation's population in a manner identical to that of Donald Trump.""  The Onion also posted a list of tips on explaining the election results to your children: Such as ""Put their mind at ease by confirming that the results of this election aren't the end of the world in any strictly literal sense""; ""Don't be afraid to openly share your wine with them""; and ""Reassure them that no matter what, the adults in their life will always feel obligated to tell them everything's going to be all right."" And the Tumblr blog Asses of Parnassus republished this tersest of verses by Style Invitational Loser Robert Schechter: Nostalgia What's best todayis yesterday.  And of course, here we  are. The deadline was Oct. 24 for the Week 1197 cartoon captions that ran in today's Style Invitational, and I had chosen the winners before the nation chose a new president. But I'd let in one entry whose premise was that Donald Trump would lose the election -- and so I cut Elden Carnahan's caption on the cartoon of the downward-pointing rocket on the launchpad: ""The RNC arranged for Reince Priebus to take a nice long vacation after the election.""  On the other hand, I didn't think it made sense to have a contest this week like ""What do we do now?"" Jokes about highly exaggerated things the new president might say and do in the White House would be a lot funnier as a fantasy, not as something that either will or won't happen. I do welcome ideas, however; email me at pat.myers@washpost.com.  What kind of humor toward a President Trump is no longer within the bounds of humor toward Candidate Trump? Is he due more politeness by virtue of the office? (Certainly not because Trump has threatened The Post and its owner with everything from banning its reporters to perhaps going after Amazon on antitrust grounds.) I don't think so.  For all its crudeness, the Invite has always had some taste considerations on its jokes about specific people: We don't run jokes about killing or torturing them, or saying that they're going to Hell (confirmed mass-murdering villains, say Osama bin Laden, get the exceptions). We don't make jokes whose premises are false or seriously unfair -- that Hillary Clinton is a man, for example. (Okay, we did refer to Trump as having small hands, but man, did he bring that on himself.) But while I recently offered a second prize of an electronic toilet paper roller than plays recordings of Trump's, voice, I would never offer -- and never would have offered -- the pair of white briefs with a blurry, brownish photo of Trump positioned as a disgusting stain (I'm not even giving you a link to that one. Google it if you want.)  --- So instead, we pivot away from the election, at least somewhat, to return to our annual Tour de Fours neologism contest.  While of course the four-letter block is different every year. the inking entries consistently play on existing words or phrases. Here's the ""above the fold"" ink from last year's D-I-C-E results (the whole set is here): Fourth place: Ride and prejudice: It is a truth universally acknowledged that a cabbie in need of a fare still won't pick up a black man after dark. (Lawrence McGuire, Waldorf, Md.) 3rd place:: Patton medicine: A bracing slap in the face. (Chris Doyle, Ponder, Tex.) 2nd place: Decirculation: The one number that's way up in the newspaper industry. (Frank Osen, Pasadena, Calif.) And the winner of the Inkin' Memorial: Tea iced: What Rep. Kevin McCarthy was last month. (Todd DeLap, Fairfax, Va.) [for those with short memories: he lost his bid to be House speaker] To see the results of the previous dozen Tour de Fours contests: Check out Loser Elden Carnahan's Master Contest List on the Losers' website, NRARS.org, then search on ""fours."" You'll land on the week when the contest was announced, say Week 571, but just look on the right edge of the chart a few lines down, then click to the link of the results of Week 571. (The winner of that first Tour de Fours, for THES: Transvestheight: The distance between the jockstrap and the bra. By Frank Mullen III.)  OUTRAGEOUS FOUR TOONS: THE CARTOON CAPTIONS OF WEEK 1197   As always, there were lots of entries for captions for one or more Bob Staake cartoons, and because there were only four cartoons, we had more room on this week's page for entries -- 43 of them -- letting me show the wide variety of approaches to a single drawing.  Still, in many cases, I chose a single entry from as many as 20 with the similar joke or wordplay.  That wasn't the case with our Inkin' Memorial winner this week, which was by far my favorite entry of the contest -- and while it of course wasn't expected to be, it's a heck of an introduction to The Style Invitational should the president-elect pick up a copy of this week's Style & Arts section.  It's just the sixth blot of ink for Steven Steele Cawman of New York's Hudson Valley, and his first Inkin' Memorial, though he's also been a runner-up. ""Grab them by the uvula"" was just a brilliant way to allude to an, uh, unpresidential term that we can't even use in the Invite.  The rest of the Losers' Circle also comprises relatively new blood: Larry Gray, who started about five years ago in Week 923 (a baby among the big-deal Losers), gets his 92nd blot of Invite ink, but Hildy Zampella got her 27 blots only since Week 1140, and it's the 17th for Jerry Birchmore.  And finally -- each cartoon appears online above its captions! No more of that tedious scrolling back and forth or toggling between windows. Thanks to the always super-helpful Kurt Gardner of The Post's newsroom IT squad.  -- So let's continue to find the humor in the situation. It's there -- it's just up to us to make it funny and not just nasty.    "

Trump sent the tweet on Nov. 6, 2012. A corrected version of the story is below: Clinton on pace to win popular vote, despite losing election Donald Trump has called the Electoral College ""a disaster for Democracy,"" but without it, he probably wouldn't be the president-elect By STEPHEN OHLEMACHER Associated Press WASHINGTON -- Despite losing Tuesday's presidential election, Hillary Clinton appears to be on pace to win the popular vote, an ironic twist in an election in which her opponent repeatedly said the system was rigged against him. Four years ago, Republican businessman Donald Trump tweeted: ""The Electoral College is a disaster for a democracy."" As it turns out, without the Electoral College, Trump probably wouldn't be the president-elect. A day after Election Day, Clinton held a narrow lead in the popular vote, according to unofficial results tallied by The Associated Press. With nearly 125 million votes counted, Clinton had 47.7 percent of the vote and Trump had 47.5 percent. That's a lead of about 236,000 votes. Many states count votes after Election Day, so Clinton isn't guaranteed to keep her lead. However, most of the outstanding votes appear to be in Democratic-leaning states, making it very likely she will become the second Democratic candidate for president this century to win the popular vote but lose the presidency. The biggest chunk of uncounted votes is in California. Washington state, New York, Oregon and Maryland also have large numbers of uncounted votes. Clinton won all those states, and if the trends continue, she will pad her lead by more than 1 million votes. There are also votes to be counted in Arizona and Alaska, two Republican-leaning states. But they are far outnumbered by uncounted votes in Democratic states. Under the Electoral College system, each state gets one vote for each member of Congress representing the state. California has the most, with 55. Seven states have only three. The District of Columbia has three, even though the nation's capital has no vote in Congress. It takes 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency. Trump's total stands at 279, with races in Michigan, New Hampshire and Arizona too close to call. There have been occasional calls to scrap the Electoral College, with no success. The latest push came after the 2000 presidential election, in which Democrat Al Gore lost to Republican George W. Bush, despite winning the popular vote. Any calls to scrap the Electoral College aren't likely to go anywhere this time, either, with Republicans controlling both the House and Senate. Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic candidate for vice president, praised Clinton on Wednesday for winning the popular vote. But when Clinton made her concession speech, she didn't mention it. ___ Follow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter at http://twitter.com/stephenatap Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The tough-talking New York billionaire claimed victories in the nation's premier battleground states, but his appeal across the industrial Midwest -- Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in particular -- sealed a victory that defied pre-election polls and every expectation of the political establishment.  ""I say it is time for us to come together as one united people,"" Trump told supporters gathered in a Manhattan hotel near his Trump Tower campaign headquarters.  ""For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so we can work together and unify our great country,"" he said, the stage crowded with family and his most loyal allies. Trump addressed the nation after sweeping most of the nation's top battlegrounds -- and created some new ones. He won Ohio, Florida and North Carolina. He also took down the Democratic Party's ""blue firewall"" by scoring victories in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that haven't supported a Republican presidential candidate since 1988 and 1984 respectively. Trump's win shocked political professionals and global financial markets alike. But it created pure joy inside the hotel ballroom where hundreds of Trump supporters waited for hours for his celebration speech. They hugged each other, chanted ""USA!"" and bellowed ""God bless America"" at the top of their lungs. House Speaker Paul Ryan called Trump Tuesday night to congratulate him on his ""incredible victory.""  ""We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people,"" Ryan, who had a rocky relationship with Trump at times, said in a statement. ""This has been a great night for our party, and now we must turn our focus to bringing the country together."" While Democrat Hillary Clinton was trying to make history as the first female president, Trump made a different kind of history as one of the least experienced presidential candidates ever elected. A businessman and former reality TV star, he is a true political outsider in a way that marks a sharp break from past presidents. Some were branded resume lightweights: ex-governors George W. Bush of Texas, Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Ronald Reagan of California, among them. But they had served somewhere -- whether in Congress, states or in a leadership post in an administration. Trump's outsider status ultimately helped him politically far more than it hurt. His political inexperience allowed him to cast himself as a change agent just as frustrated voters in both parties were hungry for change. The message was particularly effective against Clinton, a fixture in public service over the last three decades. Ever the showman, his strategy relied almost exclusively on massive rallies to connect with voters, ignoring the grunt work that typically fuels successful campaigns. Pre-election polls suggested he was the least popular presidential nominee in the modern era. Yet there were signs that Republicans who previously vowed never to support Trump were willing to give him a chance moving forward.  ""If Trump wins, he does deserve the benefit of the doubt because he was right on his chances and so many of us were wrong,"" tweeted conservative leader Erick Erickson. ___ Peoples reported from Washington.

Turnout data won't be available until after the polls close at 7 p.m., but long lines were reported in locations including Richmond and Chesapeake, Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortes said at a news conference. Officials were monitoring, and anyone in line by 7 p.m. will be able to vote, he said. Apart from turnout, there were a few equipment issues, including a display problem with electronic voting machines in Nottoway County, but votes were still counted accurately, department spokeswoman Dena Potter said. In general, Cortes said complaints were not any greater than in previous years. Pre-election polls have shown Democrat Hillary Clinton leading Republican Donald Trump in Virginia, the home of her running mate, Tim Kaine. Kaine represents the swing state in the U.S. Senate and previously served as mayor of Richmond and governor of Virginia. Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, voted shortly after polls opened at 6 a.m. at a retirement community near their Richmond home, where Kaine was cheered by supporters waiting in line. After voting, he encouraged Americans to vote and said that if elected, he and Clinton would try to bring the country together.  ""The sign of a vigorous democracy is one where a lot of people participate,"" Kaine said. Just outside Richmond in suburban Henrico County, Jean Montague, 48, cast her vote for Clinton at a Baptist church. Montague, a computer programmer who recently moved from the Dallas area, said she's not affiliated with a political party but backing Clinton was an easy decision.  ""I wanted that glass ceiling broken for women,"" Montague said. Montague is gay, and she said she also supports Clinton's positions on gay rights and other social issues. In Virginia Beach, Joe Hudson, 49, an engineer and registered Republican, said he's voting for Trump because he thinks the United States is giving too much money to foreign governments while failing to focus on its own citizens and infrastructure. But Hudson doubted that Trump will win and said he should concede if he loses. Other key races to watch included the battle for Virginia's 10th Congressional District, where freshman Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock is trying to fend off a serious challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett. Trump's unpopularity in northern Virginia has loomed large in the race, with Bennett trying to tie her opponent to the wealthy Republican businessman. Comstock has sought to distance herself from Trump, urging him to step aside as the GOP nominee after the release of a video in which he made lewd comments about women. She has said she cannot ""in good conscience"" vote for him. Elections for mayor are being held in several cities, including Richmond, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach. ___ Associated Press writers Ben Nuckols in Washington, D.C., Ben Finley in Virginia Beach, Alan Suderman in Richmond and Sarah Rankin in Henrico County contributed to this report.

This one, more than most. A look back at some of the historic, amusing and cringe-inducing events of Campaign 2016. ___ GOING DOWN? Donald Trump's long ride down the escalator at Trump Tower to announce his presidential bid in June 2015 wasn't huge news at the time. It only merited a mention on page 16 of his hometown newspaper, The New York Times. But his 45-minute speech laid out a road map for the next 500 days. It had denunciations of rapists from Mexico, the promise to build a border wall, complaints that the United States doesn't win anymore, assertions that the U.S. should have taken Iraq's oil before the Islamic State group got it, rants against ""stupid"" trade deals and many more themes Trump has hammered on ever since. ___ RAISE YOUR HAND Trump jolted the first Republican debate in August 2015 when he was the sole candidate among 10 men on the stage to raise his hand to signal he wouldn't pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee. The best he could offer: ""I can totally make the pledge if I'm the nominee."" This was the same debate where Trump mixed it up with Fox News' Megyn Kelly over his history of intemperate comments about women, foreshadowing a running campaign theme. Trump answered Kelly's question about whether he was part of the ""war on women"" with a riff against political correctness. ___ THOSE 'DAMN EMAILS' Hillary Clinton got a gift from Bernie Sanders in the first Democratic debate, in October 2015, when he seconded her dismay at all the focus on her use of a private email setup as secretary of state. ""The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,"" Sanders said. That took some air out of the controversy, but it never fully went away. In July, FBI Director James Comey announced he would not recommend charges against Clinton over the email issue, but said she and her aides had been ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information. In the campaign's closing days, Clinton's momentum slowed after the FBI announced it was investigating whether there was classified information in newly discovered emails. Then, just two days before the election, Comey said the new batch of emails hadn't changed the FBI's conclusions that Clinton shouldn't face charges. Republicans in Congress were sure to have more questions. ___ SMALL HANDS. EWW. A Republican debate last March strayed into cringe-inducing territory when Trump brought up GOP rival Marco Rubio's mocking reference to his ""small hands"" and then volunteered some reassurance about the size of his genitals. Trump told his debate audience and millions of TV viewers: ""He referred to my hands, if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you: There's no problem, I guarantee."" The arbiters of good taste had a problem with that. ___ CEILING: SHATTERED She wore white, the color of suffragettes. Clinton stood before voters at the Democrats' Philadelphia convention in July and at last claimed the presidential nomination of a major party for women. ""I'm so happy this day has come,"" she told cheering supporters. ""Happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. Happy for boys and men, too. Because when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone."" Clinton had finally shattered that ""glass ceiling"" she cracked in the 2008 campaign. ___ THE 'DEPLORABLES' Clinton drew laughter when she told supporters at a private fundraiser in September that half of Trump supporters could be lumped into a ""basket of deplorables"" -- denouncing them as ""racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it."" No one was laughing when her remarks became public. Clinton did a partial rollback, saying she'd been ""grossly generalistic"" and regretted saying the label fit ""half"" of Trump's supporters. But she didn't back down from the general sentiment, saying, ""He has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices."" ___ A REAL STUMBLE There are always stumbles in a presidential campaign. Clinton took a real one in September when she became overheated while attending a 9/11 memorial service in New York. It turned out she was suffering from pneumonia, a condition she'd hidden from the public and most of her aides. That gave Trump an opening to press his case that Clinton lacks the ""stamina"" to be president. ___  'YOU CAN DO ANYTHING' Trump's living-large persona is part of his appeal for many people. But the leaked release in October of a 2005 video in which Trump boasted about groping women's genitals and kissing them without permission threw his campaign into crisis. Politicians in both parties denounced Trump and some said he should drop out of the race. Trump apologized, but wrote off his videotaped comments as mere ""locker-room banter."" He denied engaging in the kind of predatory activity he'd laughed about. But a string of women came forward to say he'd made unwanted sexual advances toward them. ___ HE WENT THERE Trump toyed throughout the campaign with bringing up allegations about Bill Clinton's past sexual misconduct. Trump went there in a big way in October at the second presidential debate, seating three of the former president's accusers in the front row for the faceoff. ""Bill Clinton was abusive to women,"" Trump said. ""Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously."" ___ HE WOULDN'T GO THERE As Trump's standing in the polls faltered, he cranked up his claims that the election was being rigged against him. Asked in the final presidential debate if he would accept the results of the election, Trump refused to go there. Pressed on the matter by the debate moderator, Trump said: ""I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense."" It was a startling statement that raised uncertainty about the peaceful transfer of power after the election. Even the Republican National Committee disavowed Trump's statement. ___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A police statement said Self-Determination Movement activist Astrit Dehari died Saturday under still unclear circumstances and an autopsy would be conducted to clarify what killed him. The movement blamed the government for Dehari's death and expressed doubts about media reports suggesting he arrived dead at a hospital after allegedly swallowing a fatal dose of prescription medicine. The opposition questioned differing accounts from police, prison officials and prosecutors on what time Dehari died and whether it happened at the jail where he was being held or at a hospital.  ""The death of our supporter Astrit Dehari is a direct state responsibility because Astrit died while held in jail and because Astrit and the others ... are being terrorized with dirty and undefined charges,"" Self-Determination leader Visar Ymeri said at a news conference. Prosecutors in Prizren, the city 84 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of the capital, Pristina, where Dehari died, said he was transported to the hospital already dead, but said they are awaiting autopsy results to determine if the death was accidental, self-inflicted or a homicide. Dehari's family has asked to have an independent doctor of its choosing witness the autopsy.  ""Institutional statements qualifying our son's death as suspicious and also the contradictions in the statements of different institutions are too much of a concern for us,"" his relatives said in a statement. ""We insist that in no way the autopsy should be held without the presence of the doctors named from the family."" The Justice Ministry said it would honor the family's wish to have an outside expert observer on hand for the autopsy. Dehari and five other party supporters were arrested in late August for their alleged involvement in a rocket-propelled grenade attack on Parliament that damaged the building's exterior but caused no casualties. The Aug. 4 attack occurred amid political tensions over the government's August 2015 agreement with neighboring Montenegro determining their common border. Opposition parties vehemently oppose the deal, arguing it cedes territory to Montenegro. They also are against another agreement giving more powers to ethnic Serbs in Kosovo. Opposition lawmakers have disrupted parliamentary work in Kosovo for over a year by using tear gas canisters, blowing whistles and throwing water bottles. Outside Parliament, street rallies by opposition supporters routinely turn into violent clashes with police. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
