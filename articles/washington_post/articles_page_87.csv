Construction workers are building a research facility to study the Northern Lights, whose spectacular streaks of color light up Iceland's winter skies. Funded by China's Polar Research Institute, the facility will house Chinese, Icelandic and international scientists when it opens next year. This cement shell is a concrete achievement in the burgeoning relationship between the rising Asian superpower, population 1.37 billion, and this tiny North Atlantic island nation of 330,000 people. It may seem a lopsided friendship, but both countries perceive benefits. Beijing wants an Arctic ally as climate change opens up new sea routes and resource-extraction opportunities, while Iceland seeks heavyweight friends to anchor it against stormy economic waves.  ""It is better to be a friend to everyone when you are small than be an enemy to anybody,"" said Reinhard Reynisson, director of the nonprofit company building the Aurora Observatory. Reynisson speaks with the confidence of a country that has weathered earthquakes, volcanoes, famine and financial meltdown since it was settled by Vikings in the 9th century. But China's growing interest has also aroused suspicions among some Icelanders, who are wary of big powers trying to grab their resources, whether fish, energy or land.  ""We are a very small country, we are only 300,000 people, so we don't look at our independence as an automatic thing,"" said Asgeir Jonsson, an economist at the University of Iceland. ""It's something that you have to protect and look after.  ""In our history, we have a long story of fighting with the bigger powers around us over fish and the resources that we have. That has left its mark on the population."" Iceland was nudged in China's direction by financial calamity. When the global credit crunch hit in 2008, Iceland's banks -- whose debts had ballooned to more than 10 times the country's GDP -- collapsed. Iceland's currency nosedived, unemployment soared, and Iceland was forced to go the International Monetary Fund and the European Union for bailouts. It also began looking for new economic partners to help it rebuild -- and China was willing. In 2010, the two countries agreed currency swaps between Iceland's krona and China's yuan, and in 2013 they signed a free trade agreement -- the first between China and a European country. With Iceland's support, China was granted observer status in 2013 at the Arctic Council, whose core members are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Russia, the United States and Iceland. It also attends annual Arctic Circle Assemblies hosted by Iceland -- gatherings of politicians, officials, scientists and businesspeople to discuss the future of the region.  ""China's got a broad range of Arctic interests -- economic, scientific, political, strategic,"" said Anne-Marie Brady, editor in chief of the Polar Journal and a global fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington. ""But the main thing it wants at the moment would be to make sure it has a seat at any decision-making table and has access to any rights that are up for grabs. So it's great to have a friendly state like Iceland."" Some of the plans discussed by the two countries have been grandly ambitious, such as making a deep-sea port in a northern Iceland fjord to create a major shipping hub on the Northern Sea Route. It remains unbuilt, but the economic relationship between the two countries is growing steadily. Iceland has granted the China National Offshore Oil Company permission to explore in Iceland's waters, and Beijing has tapped Icelandic expertise in geothermal power, a major industry in volcanic Iceland and a potential source of clean energy for China. Last year, Chinese automaker Geely -- owner of Volvo Cars-- announced it was investing $45.5 million in Carbon Recycling International, an Icelandic company that operates the world's first renewable methanol plant. Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is working with Icelandic mobile phone firms and a state-owned Chinese firm has signed a deal to fund a new aluminum smelter in northwest Iceland. The Chinese Embassy in Reykjavik says bilateral trade, ""though still small in terms of volume, is growing rapidly."" In the first nine months of 2016, Iceland's imports from China were worth $330 million and its exports $77 million, a year-on-year increase of 12.6 percent. In an email to The Associated Press, the embassy said China could benefit from Iceland's ""cutting-edge technologies in renewable energy, life-science (and) carbon-fiber industries,"" as well as its fresh fish, meat, dairy products and mineral water. In return, China can provide Iceland with a wide range of Chinese-made goods. Chinese tourists -- whose numbers rose from 26,000 in 2014 to an estimated 60,000 this year-- are helping to drive a tourism boom that has been the savior of Iceland's economy since the financial crisis. Cozying up to Beijing also gets tiny Iceland noticed by much larger nations. Brady notes that Iceland's politicians have become adept at ""playing the big powers off each other.""  ""They are getting a lot more attention from the United States in recent years because of their perceived very good relationship with China,"" she said. ""And yet what the ordinary people think about that is often quite different from their government. ... the population has some misgivings about this close relationship."" Those misgivings reached a peak five years ago, when multimillionaire Chinese businessman Huang Nubo tried to buy a 300 square kilometer (120 square mile) chunk of remote northeast Iceland to build an eco-resort. Strong public opposition led the Icelandic government to block the purchase in 2011 -- in part because no foreign buyer had ever bought so much land. Suspicion lingered when the Aurora Observatory was announced for a sparsely populated region 250 miles (400 kilometers) northeast of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik. Pascal Heyman, a former official at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in 2014 that the Chinese might want to use the equipment to keep an eye on NATO airspace. Iceland is one of the best places in the world to observe the aurora borealis, or northern lights. The colorful phenomenon is caused when a magnetic solar wind slams into the Earth's magnetic field. Scientists hope the observatory will help them learn about the interaction between the sun and the Earth's magnetic field, which could help predict space weather. The observatory is behind schedule -- in part due to a shortage of building contractors in booming Iceland -- but is due to open next fall. It will include a visitors' center, and local people have begun to capitalize on the upcoming economic opportunities, opening Aurora guesthouses and thermal baths. Reynisson said the initial local skepticism about China's intentions has faded.  ""Now you might hear someone say, 'They will never finish it' -- not that they are spying on us or doing something totally different from what is said to be done,"" he said. ""Why build a station here in the valley to spy on us? Much easier to rearrange some of their satellites to spy on us."" ___ Lawless reported from Reykjavik, Iceland.

Rocker Jon bon Jovi and his wife, Dorothea, on Tuesday donated $5,000 to the Christ Church Preservation Trust to quickly push it past its $10,000 goal.

So far, that's turning into mission impossible, as EU leaders accuse him of offering insubstantial and unrealistic visions of the U.K.'s future outside the 28-nation bloc. The latest critic is Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who told the BBC on Tuesday that Johnson ""is offering to the British people options that are really not available.""  ""There is no win-win situation"" with Brexit, Dijsselbloem said. ""It is going to be a lose-lose situation."" Johnson is one of Britain's best-known politicians, famous at home and abroad for his tousled hair, rumpled appearance and florid speeches studded with Latin phrases. A leader of the victorious ""leave"" campaign in Britain's EU membership referendum, he was named foreign secretary when Prime Minister Theresa May took office in July. For the last few months he has been touring EU capitals ahead of formal exit talks, expected to start next year. British officials have been reluctant to provide details of what deal they hope to strike with the bloc. But Johnson was quoted this week by the Czech newspaper Hospodarske Noviny as saying the U.K. would likely have to leave the EU customs union, while retaining access to the bloc's single market in goods and services. The customs union and the single market are both pillars of the EU's model of tariff-free trade within its bloc of 500 million people. Members of the customs union trade tariff-free, but impose common levies on imports from outside the union. Dijsselbloem -- who also heads the group of 19 countries who use the common euro currency -- said Johnson ""is saying things that are intellectually impossible, politically unavailable.""  ""To say, 'We could be inside the internal market, keep full access to the internal market, but be outside the customs union' -- this is just impossible, it doesn't exist,"" Dijsselbloem told the BBC's ""Newsnight"" program.  ""The U.K. will be outside the internal market and there will be some hindrances,"" he said. ""The full free movement within the internal market can only be available if the U.K. also accepts the other freedoms of Europe, including migration within Europe."" Immigration was a major issue for many Britons who voted to leave the EU, and British officials insist they will end the free movement of people from the bloc into Britain -- although few details of the plan have yet been provided. Johnson is widely mistrusted in Brussels from his time as a journalist there, when he helped cement the EU's image in Britain as a bureaucratic behemoth obsessed with cumbersome regulation. That friction has not abated. Johnson declined to attend a special meeting Sunday of EU foreign ministers to discuss the win of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, and told his EU counterparts to stop the ""collective whinge-o-rama"" over the U.S. election result. He recently drew skepticism in Italy when he said the country should continue free trade with the U.K. because Britons consume a lot of prosecco. Similarly, in Germany, he stressed the large number of German cars bought in the U.K. -- fostering a sense that Britain takes other EU countries for granted. After Johnson said in September that it was ""complete baloney"" to suggest an automatic link between free movement and single-market membership, Germany Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he'd be happy to send him a copy of the EU's central Lisbon Treaty and explain it ""in good English."" Charlotte Galpin, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen who studies Euroskepticism, said Johnson's diplomatic efforts are appearing counterproductive.  ""My sense ... is that they listen to him saying these things and think ""What is he talking about? This is not how the EU works,'"" she said. ___ Follow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The two men had made up the president-elect's chief of staff shortlist, and while Priebus received that job, Bannon's post also is expected to wield significant clout. The media executive with ties to the alt-right and white nationalist movement was given top billing in the press release announcing their appointments. Trump's hires were, at first glance, contradictory, though they fit a pattern of the celebrity businessman creating a veritable Rorschach test that allowed his supporters to see what they wanted. Priebus, who lashed the RNC to Trump this summer despite some intraparty objections, is a GOP operative with deep expertise of the Washington establishment that Trump has vowed to shake up. He has close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Wisconsinite. Bannon, meanwhile, helped transform the Breitbart news site into the leading mouthpiece of the party's anti-establishment wing, which helped fuel the businessman's political rise. Ryan has been one of his most frequent targets.  ""Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory,"" Trump said. ""Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again."" Neither Priebus nor Bannon bring policy experience to their new White House roles. Chiefs of staff in particular play a significant role in policy making, serving as a liaison to Cabinet agencies and deciding what information makes it to the president's desk. They're often one of the last people in the room with the president as major decisions are made. In announcing the appointments, Trump said Priebus and Bannon would work as ""equal partners"" -- effectively creating two power centers in the West Wing. The arrangement is risky and could leave ambiguity over who makes final decisions. Trump has long encouraged rivalries, both in business and in his presidential campaign. He cycled through three campaign managers during his White House run, creating a web of competing alliances among staffers. Priebus is a traditional choice, one meant as an olive branch to the Republicans who control both houses of Congress as Trump looks to pass his legislative agenda. Ryan tweeted, ""I'm very proud and excited for my friend @Reince. Congrats!"" Ryan made no mention of Bannon. The Bannon pick, however, is anything but safe. Under Bannon's tenure, Brietbart pushed a nationalist agenda and became one of the leading outlets of the so-called alt-right -- a movement often associated with white supremacist ideas that oppose multiculturalism and defend ""Western values."" John Weaver, a Republican strategist who worked for Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign, tweeted, ""The racist, fascist extreme right is represented footsteps from the Oval Office. Be very vigilant, America."" Bannon, who became campaign CEO in August, pushed Trump to adopt more populist rhetoric and paint rival Hillary Clinton as part of a global conspiracy made up of the political, financial and media elite, bankers bent on oppressing the country's working people -- a message that carried Trump to the White House but to some, carried anti-Semitic undertones. An ex-wife of Bannon said he expressed fear of Jews when the two battled over sending their daughters to private school nearly a decade ago, according to court papers reviewed this summer by The Associated Press. In a sworn court declaration following their divorce, Mary Louise Piccard said her ex-husband had objected to sending their twin daughters to an elite Los Angeles academy because he ""didn't want the girls going to school with Jews."" A spokeswoman for Bannon denied he made those statements. The appointments came after a day in which Trump's tough-talking plan to rein in illegal immigration showed signs Sunday of cracking, with the president-elect seemingly backing off his vow to build a solid wall along the southern U.S. border and Ryan rejecting any ""deportation force"" targeting people in the country illegally. Though Trump told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" in an interview airing Sunday night that his border wall might look more like a fence in spots, one thing didn't change from his primary: the combative billionaire took to Twitter to settle some scores. During a four-hour spree, Trump savaged The New York Times for being ""dishonest"" and ""highly inaccurate"" and gloated about the GOP stalwarts lining up to congratulate him, bragging that staunch critics and GOP rivals Kasich, Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush had sent attaboys. As Trump revenge-tweeted, threats flew between power brokers, and protests across the country continued. Early in the GOP primaries, Trump had vowed to immediately deport all 11 million people living in the country illegally. But he distanced himself from that position as time went on, eventually saying that he would focus on people living in the country illegally who had committed crimes beyond their immigration offenses. He emphasized in the ""60 Minutes"" interview that securing the border is his very first immigration priority. More tension emerged Sunday when Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid should be careful in a ""legal sense"" about characterizing Trump as a sexual predator. When asked whether Trump was threatening to sue Reid, Conway said no. But Adam Jentleson, Reid's deputy chief of staff, said Trump is ""hiding behind his Twitter account and sending his staff on TV to threaten his critics."" ___ Lemire reported from New York.

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/10/heres-how-trumps-election-will-affect-u-s-russian-relations/	Here’s how Trump’s election will affect U.S.-Russian relations	"   Two women look at their cellphones in front of portraits of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, as they arrive at the Union Jack pub in Moscow, to watch a live telecast of the U.S. presidential election on Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko)  Over the course of the recent U.S. presidential campaign, Donald Trump broke new ground -- especially for a Republican candidate -- with his consistent praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin. With Trump now headed to the White House, I reached out to a number of Russian politics experts for their take on what this means for U.S.-Russian relations, as well as their expectations for the effect of a Trump presidency on Russian foreign policy more generally: Yoshiko M. Herrera, professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Andrew H. Kydd, professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison: Donald Trump has said that he wants to improve U.S.-Russian relations and in particular that he wants a closer relationship with Vladimir Putin. In 2009, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton came into office as president and secretary of state, and they too wanted to improve relations with Russia. Is there any reason to suppose that this new reset will fare any better than the previous one? One reason it might is Trump's apparent interest in reducing traditional American commitments abroad, particularly to the United States' NATO allies. Trump has often questioned the continuing value of NATO and characterized some allies as free riders who do not necessarily deserve to be defended. Putin's foreign policy is animated by a desire to restore Russian power and influence. If the United States were to step back from the European arena, Putin would be happy to step in. However, such a development, which might seem to improve U.S.-Russian relations, would be heavily criticized in the U.S., not to mention in Europe, as a surrender to Russian ambitions and a selling out of American national interests. Moreover, given Trump's mercurial temperament and unpredictability, he could easily decide to reverse a policy of conciliation and stand firm at some point. This kind of uncertainty about the extent of American commitments is highly conducive to conflict. The Korean War started in part because Kim Il Sung and Stalin thought the United States had written off South Korea after the Communist victory in China. Dean Acheson had not included South Korea in the United States' stated defense perimeter in the region, but when push came to shove, the United States decided to fight anyway. Attempting to conciliate Russia by weakening our commitment to NATO, therefore, is a very risky path to better relations, especially if it is not domestically sustainable. Dmitry Gorenburg and Michael Kofman, research scientists, CNA, a nonprofit research organization. The views expressed here are their own and do not represent CNA. Donald Trump's victory has the potential to fundamentally reshape U.S.-Russian relations, but whether such a realignment will actually take place will depend on how Trump chooses to learn and appreciate the past failures of several U.S. attempts to engage Russia. It remains to be seen whether he will be willing to follow the advice of professionals, or if he will strike off on his own. U.S.-Russian relations are founded on a complex history, with structural differences among national elites that will prove difficult to bridge through personal rapport among the national leaders. Trump's first problem will be that other than a small number of close advisers who share his instincts to engage Putin, most of the policy establishment is likely to hold hardened views of Putin's Russia, ranging from distrustful to confrontational. Rapid change is unlikely to come quickly, despite the personal attention of the president-elect, because the bureaucracy will initially take an obstructionist position. Having said that, we can make a few predictions regarding policy initiatives that are likely to be undertaken by President Trump. First of all, he is likely to restore the full range of government contacts, including between the two countries' military establishments. Second, he will pursue more extensive cooperation with Russia in Syria, against ISIS but also against other anti-Assad groups that could conceivably be described as Islamist. Most likely there will be a complete abandonment of the existing policy formulation that there is a moderate Syrian opposition and viable alternatives to Assad, which will closely bridge the U.S. position with that of Moscow's. And finally, the active sanctions policy against Russia is likely to end, though existing sanctions will not be lifted without a quid pro quo. And this brings us to the heart of the matter. Trump is at his core a dealmaker. He will want to make a deal with Putin. And he doesn't care very much about the core issues that have been driving the conflict in the U.S.-Russia relationship for the last five to six years: democracy promotion in Russia's near abroad, human rights, NATO expansion and contesting Russian influence in Europe. Russia's core interests, keeping Ukraine and Georgia in its sphere of influence, and pursuing an integration agenda toward the Soviet Union's former republics is not antithetical to how Trump will define U.S. national interest. As a result, he will be willing to trade on a range of policies. However, this initial predilection to deal with Russia should not be mistaken for a simplistic approach to freely give Moscow that which it desires. Dealmakers don't generally agree to trade something for nothing. So what happens next depends in large part on what Russia will offer in return. The Syria conflict is an obvious area for dealmaking. Another possibility is Russia making itself attractive as a potential partner in dealing with China. The inertia of distrust and confrontation may make a grand bargain elusive, and pursuing such lofty goals too quickly could actually jeopardize Trump's long-term vision for a relationship with Russia, but in the short term he can make notable changes to the current bilateral relationship. Andrew Barnes, associate professor, Kent State University Since at least the invasion of Ukraine in 2014, most Russian foreign policy actions have made sense as opportunistic efforts to prod and weaken the Western-dominated international order.  Putin and members of his administration have long seen that order as beneficial to the West at Russia's expense, and they have made no secret of the fact that they believe it is intentionally structured to damage Russian interests.  Such Russian actions as military overflights, ship deployments, involvement in Syria, and continued presence in Ukraine all serve to challenge the structures of the post-World War II system that has so benefited the United States and its allies.  Other developments, like the refugee crisis, Brexit, and rising nationalist and anti-E.U. sentiment in general, have had similar effects, whether or not Russia had a hand in them. With the American election, the United States has chosen a president who has professed similar negative views of the current international order, even if he does not believe those structures have benefited the United States. Trump has applauded Brexit, said he would defend only those NATO allies who paid their fair share, approved Russian strategy in Syria and Ukraine, and stoked an increase in nationalism in the U.S. similar to that in Europe.  I expect that Russian will continue to press against existing international institutions and norms and that Trump will generally welcome those actions, as he thinks they benefit American interests.  Potential conflict will only arise when it comes to creating new rules to replace the old ones.  How that process will go is hard to predict, as neither Putin nor Trump has expressed very clearly what new order he would like to see replace the old. Mariya Y. Omelicheva, associate professor, Department of Political Science, University of Kansas Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, was among the first world leaders to congratulate Trump. In a telegram addressed to the president-elect, Putin expressed his hope that Trump's presidency would lift the U.S.-Russian relations from the current crisis. Putin's optimism is not idle: Trump's victory in the presidential elections may be a silver lining in the relations of these two states. The Kremlin has viewed the U.S. as Russia's major competitor for regional influence in the former Soviet Union's republics, an area that the Russian government sees as its legitimate sphere of interest. The Trump government is likely to scale back the level of support for Ukraine, Georgia, and other post-Soviet republics, giving Russia greater freedom to pursue its national interests in these states. Revoking the U.S. sanctions on Russia for its annexation of the Crimean peninsula and the ongoing support of the rebels fighting in the east of Ukraine will be Russia's ultimate prize. While on the campaign trail, Trump raised the specter of the U.S. pulling out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. If his administration acts on this and reduces American support for the alliance, it will effectively scale down the U.S. military posture in Europe, including the future deployment of NATO forces in the Baltic states and Poland. This will effectively remove the major bone of contention in U.S. relations with Russia. Lastly, Trump is unlikely to be vocal in his criticisms of Russia's state of civil and political rights, and growing authoritarianism of Putin's administration. Eliminating this irritant for Russia will show what Putin called the principle of  ""mutual respect"" for Russia's own way of political life. Eric McGlinchey, associate professor of government, Schar School of Policy and Government, and Marlene Laruelle, research professor, George Washington University U.S. favorability perceptions among Russians have plummeted. According to Pew's Global Attitude survey, U.S. favorability perceptions among Russians dropped from 57 percent in 2010 to 15 percent in 2015. Much of this erosion in U.S. favorability perceptions can be attributed to how the state-run Russian media portrays Washington. And it's not only in Russia where the Kremlin's media outreach resonates. In Central Asia, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tajiks and Uzbeks see the Russian press as more reliable than Western media. Perhaps not surprisingly then, a majority of Central Asians polled in a 2015 Broadcasting Board of Governors/Gallup survey expressed support for Russia's annexation of Crimea. What will the state-run Russian media make of President-elect Trump who, as candidate Trump, (in)famously quipped ""the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were?"" Will the Russian press embrace the bare-chested Trump-Putin tandem of social media memes? Or will the Kremlin media machine grow weary of a mercurial Mr. Trump? Today Margarita Simonyan, the head of Russia's RT television network, tweeted she wants to ""drive around Moscow with an American flag on her windshield."" Simonyan's enthusiasm notwithstanding, the Kremlin's media reset will likely be fleeting. American presidents, in contrast to post-Soviet autocrats, face considerable domestic constraints. Americans who voted for Trump did not vote for improved Russia-U. S. relations. They voted against a political system that for far too long ignored the growing disaffection of blue-collar workers. Russia, as his comment on Crimea reveals, is peripheral to Trump's courting of disaffected America. Devoting attention to Putin does not advance Trump's position with his base. As Trump and America turn inward, the best Russia -- and the world -- can hope for is to not be forgotten."

While liberal-leaning urban areas helped Hillary Clinton secure Maryland's 10 electoral votes and Democratic candidates won all but one U.S. House seat Tuesday, the state's liberal base didn't perform according to expectations. Donald Trump received a higher percentage of votes than Mitt Romney in 15 of the 18 Maryland counties that voted Republican in 2012, while Clinton failed to expand on President Barack Obama's coalition from 2012. Of the six counties that voted Democratic four years ago, only two counties -- Howard and Montgomery -- supported Clinton at higher rates than they supported Obama. Maryland counties voted the same way in 2016 as in 2012, except two that flipped allegiances. Unlike the last presidential election, Anne Arundel County voted Democratic by a small margin, yet Somerset County voted Republican by a significantly larger margin. Maryland House Speaker Mike Busch, D-Anne Arundel, attributed the change in his county to the Republican candidate.  ""Citizens were turned off by the rhetoric and bigotry of Donald Trump and they voted for Hillary,"" Busch said. And while Somerset County has ""always been Republican,"" said Matt Adams, chairman of the Somerset County Republicans, the county shifted nine points to the Republican side since 2012. In the past, the county has appeared Democratic because of the presence of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, in Princess Anne, Adams said.  ""(The students) don't live here,"" he said. ""They came from somewhere, (where) they truly live, and they should vote absentee in our opinion from the county in which they lived in prior to going to college."" In the last weeks of voter registration in the state of Maryland, employees at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore -- a historically black college -- arranged for voting registration officials to visit campus, where about 200 students were able to register, said William Robinson, the director of public relations at the university. On Election Day, about 150 students took a campus shuttle bus to the nearest polling places, and about 125 other students used their own transportation, Robinson said. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Cockeysville, was re-elected as the representative for Maryland's 1st Congressional District, which includes Somerset County, and will remain the only Republican representative from the state.  ""The whole first congressional district has been gerrymandered to be the Republican district in the state of Maryland, so Andy always does well here,"" Adams said. Harris's conservative views have mobilized Republicans, he said. In his victory speech at the Maryland Republican headquarters, Harris said he looked forward to bringing ""Maryland back to the red column.""  ""In one of my precincts up in Baltimore County -- Catonsville -- there was a line around the corner at 10 p.m. at night because people can hardly wait to get out and vote for Donald Trump and drain the swamp in Washington,"" he said Tuesday night. A 2014 Washington Post article identified both Maryland and North Carolina as tied for the title of most-gerrymandered state.  ""How the districts are drawn really gives the impression that Republicans live in certain places and Democrats live in other places, and while there seems to be some trends in that respect -- Montgomery County for example is very heavily Democratic -- I think it distorts our perception somewhat,"" said Carin Robinson, an associate professor of political science at Hood College in Frederick. While the numbers signal a stark polarization in Maryland between political parties, it may not be an accurate representation, she said.  ""There is polarization, but redistricting and how the congressional lines are drawn accentuates it and over-emphasizes it in a way that probably doesn't highlight the fact that we still have diversity within the state,"" Robinson said. Gerrymandering has eradicated battleground districts in the state, which works in favor of Democrats, said Delegate Herbert McMillan, R-Anne Arundel.  ""Basically, I see gerrymandering is contributing a lot to politics in Maryland,"" he said. ""It's really sad. What happens is in the primary, there is no middle left."" Councilman Michael Peroutka, R-Anne Arundel, said he thinks voters had their own agendas and motives for the county's blue vote.  ""I would just speculate that there are so many people in our county who work directly for, or work as, a contractor for the federal government,"" Peroutka said. ""I think they vote Democrat because they are voting for a big spigot of federal spending that would stay on."" Other factors, such as shifting demographics in gerrymandered districts, may also contribute to some counties in Maryland becoming more liberal while other counties are growing more conservative, said Gregory Kline, co-founder of Red Maryland, a conservative news outlet.  ""That realignment has taken hold over the last couple of decades,"" he said. ""In more conservative counties ... there's more locally elected Republican officials. It just kind of feeds on itself."" Maryland state Sen. James Mathias Jr., D-Somerset, said his job will not change just because counties are becoming more stratified.  ""The most important person is the constituents,"" he said. ""(I will) stay true to constituents, stay true to my beliefs, but adapt to the environment and circumstances."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

6	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/11/09/the-day-after/	The day after	"Yesterday's election result was a terrible setback for those of us who opposed Donald Trump and his agenda. Following the lead of the vast majority of pollsters and election analysts, I did not expect it to happen. Obviously, I was wrong.  For the sake of the nation, I hope I also turn out to be wrong about Trump himself. Perhaps he does not actually intend to carry out the scary agenda he ran on, and is not as unfit for office as he seems. My general take on Trump has always been that what you see is roughly what you should expect to get if he wins. That's why I opposed him from the first, and believed that he was a considerably greater danger than Hillary Clinton, of whom I am no fan. As a general rule, presidents make a serious effort to carry out at least the major elements of the agenda they run on. That strikes me as the most likely scenario with Trump, as well. But, it's certainly possible that Trump will prove to be an exception to this rule of politics, as he has proven to be on so many others. Maybe he doesn't really believe most of what he says, and does not intend to act on most of it. Maybe he has no real desire to deport millions of people, start trade wars, censor his critics, target the families of suspected terrorists, and so on. Perhaps he only said those things to gain a political edge. Even if the latter scenario is true, Trump might still act on some of these ideas nonetheless. If he thinks they helped him get elected, he might also conclude that they will be politically advantageous once he's in the White House. And most of the Republican Congress might go along with him, since, after all, Trump just led them to a major electoral victory. The Republican Congress could still surprise us. Perhaps they will grow a spine and resist Trump. But in this day and age, it is very rare for members of Congress to oppose a president of their own party on any major issues.  At the very least, we should be prepared for the possibility that Trump really does mean what he says, that he does indeed plan to lead the GOP in a dangerous right-wing nationalist direction, and that most GOP members of Congress won't do much to stop him. Those who oppose that agenda should be prepared for such an eventuality. What should we do? I certainly don't have anything like a definitive answer. But it seems to me that one of the causes of Hillary Clinton's defeat was her failure to reach out to the many Republican-leaning constituencies that were uncomfortable with Trump and his agenda. She made some rhetorical gestures in their direction, but offered virtually no concessions on policy. Instead, she ran on the most left-wing Democratic platform in many years. Don't take my word for it; take that of former Bill Clinton adviser William Galston. This made it very hard for #NeverTrump conservatives and libertarians to support her. Eventually, it was one of the factors that led many of them to ""come home"" to the GOP and vote Trump. If Hillary Clinton had gotten even a relatively modest additional percentage of the traditional GOP vote, she could well have won easily. If she believed that Trump is not just an ordinary candidate, but a menace beyond the bounds of normal politics, she should have acted like it and worked to build a bigger coalition to stave off the threat than you would create for an ordinary election.  The blame here is not all on one side. Far from it. If the Democrats didn't make enough effort to reach out to #NeverTrumpers, most of the latter made little or no attempt to reach out to the Democrats either. The two sides' actions were understandable. Both saw the same polls as everyone else did, and likely concluded that Trump was going to lose anyway. In addition, we live in an age of strong partisan bias and hyperpolarization. Neither liberals nor most #NeverTrumpers were enthusiastic about working with their traditional partisan enemies.  This refusal to reach across the partisan aisle was a mistake. If Trump acts as we expect him to, the liberal, conservative, and libertarian opponents of his agenda must find a way to work together. Despite our many differences, I believe we have much in common, as well, most notably a commitment to the liberal democratic values that Trumpism imperils.  Political scientist Lee Drutman has argued that Trump's political success may realign the parties along a cosmopolitan vs. nationalist divide, instead of the current right-left political spectrum. It is too early to say if this will actually happen. But if it does, now is the time to start working on building the cosmopolitan coalition, which is also likely to be the coalition of civil liberties and constitutional values. Even if we do not see a complete realignment along these lines, there is still good reason for the opponents of Trumpism to seek common ground. I don't have any detailed proposal for what that common ground will look like. Finding it will not be easy. But it seems to me that we should make the effort to try.  I am not the only one who has advanced the idea of this kind of cross-ideological cooperation. Benjamin Wittes of the liberal Brookings Institution have put forward similar thoughts (see here and here). Conservative Dan McLaughlin has proposed a more limited form of detente between Trump's liberal and conservative opponents.  Much more work needs to be done before any of these ideas can become a reality. But now is a good time to get started.  UPDATE: It's worth noting that, despite his victory, Trump remains highly unpopular. Neither is there strong public support for his signature policies. For example, exit polls show that 54% of voters oppose his famous proposal to build a wall across the Mexican border and 70% believe that undocumented immigrants working in the United States should be granted permanent residency (only 25% say they should be deported). All of this suggests that there may be a real opportunity for an opposition movement that has cross-ideological and bipartisan appeal."

On Tuesday, that movement propelled him to the White House. Trump's stunning, come-from-behind victory over Hillary Clinton -- a far more organized and experienced rival -- served as a raised middle finger to the political establishment from his fervent backers.  ""I have been so ready for this,"" said Oklahoma resident Holly Berry, who flew all the way from Tahlequah to celebrate at Trump's victory party in Manhattan. Berry, who works in sales, said that she can no longer afford her health insurance, which has spiked 86 percent.  ""People are sick and tired,"" she said. ""This country's fed up with everything. We're ready for a change. We're ready for lower taxes, ready for our economy to grow, we're ready for jobs."" But to millions of others, the billionaire businessman's elevation to the presidency is a shocking and terrifying reality that will take time to comprehend. Many see the president-elect as a bigot and a misogynist unfit for the office.  ""He scares the daylights out of me,"" said Wendy Bennett, a Democrat and government worker from Reno, Nevada, who cast her ballot for Clinton. ""I think his personality is going to start World War III. He reminds me of Hitler."" Lisa Moore, a registered Republican from Glen Rock, New Jersey, crossed party lines to vote for Clinton, who would have been the nation's first female president.  ""As a woman, in good conscience, and as the mother of a daughter, I can't vote for somebody who's so morally reprehensible,"" said Moore, an exercise instructor. The 2016 election was vindication for Trump, a former reality TV star who was underestimated from the start. While pundits assumed his poll numbers would sink as soon as voters started taking the race seriously, Trump was drawing thousands each night to rallies packed with angry, largely white supporters who felt ignored and lied to by Washington. While statistics showed the U.S. economy improving overall, it didn't feel that way in places like upstate New York, Pennsylvania's coal country and former manufacturing towns across the Midwest devastated by outsourcing and globalization. Chaos abroad only added to the feeling that the country was sliding backward. Together, those factors drove a yearning to return to a simpler time when America was the world's undisputed superpower and middle-class wages were on the rise.  ""We have our fingers in too many baskets,"" said Joe Hudson, 49, an engineer and registered Republican from Virginia Beach, Virginia, who said he would be voting for Trump because ""we're not taking care of our own people.""  ""We're trying to be too involved in world politics. And our country is imploding from within,"" he said. ""We need a new direction, a new attitude, and people to stop arguing and letting the media affect how we feel."" Trump's vow was simple: He'd ""Make America Great Again."" His outsider status, coupled with his personal business success, lent credibility to a populist message that emphasized recapturing manufacturing jobs, restoring American strength abroad and curtailing legal and illegal immigration. Trump promised to immediately create new jobs, end conflicts abroad and -- in Trump's words, ""win again"" Trump, early on, painted his supporters as a ""movement"" larger than himself.  ""This isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country. And they're talking about it all over the world,"" he said at a rally in Miami last week during the race's furious final stretch.  ""There has never been a movement like this in the history of our country -- it's never happened. Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump, have said it's the single greatest phenomena they have ever seen."" But as he worked his base into a frenzy and locked down one primary win after the next, Trump was also repelling large swaths of the populace -- including women, college-educated whites and minorities -- with his deeply divisive rhetoric. Trump launched his campaign with a speech that accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals across the border. He later questioned 2008 Republican nominee and former POW John McCain's status as a war hero, saying he preferred people who hadn't been captured. He mocked a disabled reporter. And he called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"" -- a blanket religion test denounced by many as un-American. After securing his party's nomination, Trump questioned a federal judge's ability to treat him fairly because of the judge's Hispanic origin, repeatedly insulted a Muslim-American family whose son had been killed in Iraq, and got into an extended spat with a former beauty queen, at one point instructing his millions of Twitter followers to ""check out"" her non-existent sex tape. Again and again, Trump appeared poised to close the gap with Clinton, only to go off on a tangent that would send his poll numbers tumbling. Then came the release of shocking old video footage from an ""Access Hollywood"" bus in which Trump bragged about being able to grope women because he was famous. The video's release was followed by a string of allegations from women who said Trump sexually harassed or assaulted them. Trump denied the accusations, at one point threatening to sue the women. But one October surprise was overshadowed by another. Trump's numbers had already been rising with news of health care premium increases when the FBI director informed Congress that the bureau had found a new trove of emails potentially relevant to its investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server a secretary of state. While the FBI eventually announced that there was nothing in the emails to merit criminal prosecution, the damage appeared to have been done. On Tuesday, Trump won a commanding victory, buoyed by a new Trump coalition.  ""It's time to get together,"" he said. ___ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj.

Hillary Clinton's quest to make history as the first female president was thwarted by the Republican nominee's breathtaking performance at the polls. He was carried to victory by voters fed up with the political system and mistrustful of Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state. Trump, a 70-year-old celebrity businessman who had never before run for office, is poised to become the oldest president ever elected to a first term.  After running a divisive campaign, Trump sounded a magnanimous note of reconciliation as he claimed victory shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday.  [Live updates on the presidential race and other contests]      View Graphic      ""Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country,"" Trump said, minutes after Clinton called him to concede. ""I mean that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. We have to get together. To all Republicans, Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people."" He had portrayed his opponent as the embodiment of a rigged system that had failed the everyday American. Her credentials through a quarter-century on the national stage, which in another electoral climate would have been an asset, pegged her in his supporters' view as the ultimate establishment insider. Trump said that under his administration, ""America will no longer settle for anything less than the best."" And he promised foreign countries that ""while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone,"" adding: ""We will seek common ground, not hostility."" The real estate developer thanked his wife, Melania, and his children for their patience, saying: ""This was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough.""  [How Donald Trump pulled off an upset of cataclysmic, historic proportions]  With Trump's ascension to the White House, the nationalist wave that has swept capitals around the world -- including in Britain, which voted to break from the European Union this year -- came crashing onto U.S. shores. The prospect of an impulsive authoritarian in the Oval Office rattled investors around the world. On Wall Street, all three major stock index futures sank more than 3 percent. Japan's Nikkei index plunged 5.4 percent; Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell by more than 2 percent. The Mexican peso -- which had fallen when the Republican nominee rose in the polls during his campaign -- nosedived to an eight-year low, according to Bloomberg.         1 of 46       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What Election Night looks like      View Photos   Donald Trump, 70, will be the 45th president of the United States.

The general election, which riveted the nation and produced a record television audience for a presidential debate, turned on the question of national identity. While Clinton assembled a diverse coalition that she said reflected the nation's future, it was no match for the powerful and impassioned movement built by fanning resentments over gender, race and religion. Trump's promise to ""Make America Great Again"" inspired millions of Americans alienated by the forces of globalization and multiculturalism and deeply frustrated with the inability of Washington to address their needs. Voters anxious about the economy, convinced that the system was stacked against them, fearful of terrorism and angry about the rising gap between rich and poor, gravitated toward Trump. In him, they saw a fearless champion who would re-create what they recalled as an America unchallenged in the world, unthreatened at home and unfettered by the elitist forces of ""political correctness."" ""It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will,"" Trump said in his victory speech.  He vowed: ""Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer."" The presumption held by both campaigns, right up to the hours when polls began closing, was that Trump had a far narrower path to victory than Clinton. But he capitalized on nearly every opportunity across the electoral map. One by one on Tuesday night, electoral prizes that for hours had been too close to call deep into the night fell into Trump's win column. First, Florida and Ohio. Then North Carolina. And then Pennsylvania and, at 2:30 a.m., Wisconsin. A few minutes after 2 a.m., Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, told stunned supporters who had gathered in anticipation of celebrating her victory to go home because there would be no further statement as outstanding votes were counted. ""We can wait a little longer, can't we?"" Podesta said.  Clinton claimed Colorado and Virginia as she thought she would, but she underperformed expectations in the traditionally Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states where Trump campaigned aggressively in the final weeks. Clinton had so taken for granted a region thought of as her ""blue wall"" that she did not hold a single event in Wisconsin during the general-election camapign. Control of Congress was on the line as well, with Republicans poised to maintain their majority in the House and a string of hotly competitive Senate contests going their way as well.   [Republicans keep control of Congress after decisive Senate wins]   Trump's feuds with Republican leaders created deep fissures in his party, and his victory has set the GOP on a new path. Whether he can achieve any of his grandiose ideas could hinge on his relationship with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who had all but abandoned Trump in the campaign's final weeks. In an early sign of detente, Ryan's office let it be known that the speaker had placed a congratulatory call to Trump. President Obama campaigned vigorously for his former secretary of state -- going so far as to label her opponent temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief -- but his resurgent popularity did not rub off on his legatee. Trump had pledged to dismantle Obama's achievements, starting with his signature law, the Affordable Care Act that became known as Obamacare. He also will be in position to fill the current vacancy on the Supreme Court.  A Trump presidency is certain to produce significant geopolitical repercussions. He has promised to transform U.S. foreign policy and take it in a more unilateralist direction.  He also has promised to build a wall on the border with Mexico and deport immigrants who are in this country illegally. Trump said he would ""bomb the s---"" out of the Islamic State and says he has a secret plan to annihilate the terrorist organization. He has also expressed admiration for strongmen such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom he has promised to forge a closer relationship based on mutual respect. Never one to let go of a grudge, Trump has vowed to send Clinton to prison. At his victory party early Wednesday, his supporters chanted, ""Lock her up!"" Trump, a flashy real estate developer who extended his brand with reality television, would be the first person to become president without having previously held elected office or served in the U.S. military. Trump's vice president will be Michael Pence, 57, the governor of Indiana and previously a longtime member of the House. Until polls closed on Tuesday, confidence in the Clinton campaign had been high that she would topple a barrier that has stood for nearly a century after women in the United States got the right to vote and be elected president. For her election-night party, she chose a utilitarian convention center in midtown Manhattan notable for one architectural feature: a glass ceiling.   [A traumatic campaign produces a shocking ending, with Trump victorious]   But Clinton's historic quest hit head winds early in the evening as key states she had expected to carry easily, such as Virginia, remained in doubt. Though she prevailed there, the contest proved significantly closer than the pre-election polls would have indicated. Inside the Javits Center, the jovial atmosphere quickly grew dark as the night wore on. Senior Clinton aides, who had been circulating among the press risers, had long since disappeared and stopped answering their phones. The only Clinton staff in evidence as the 11 o'clock hour approached were fairly junior aides, looking nervous and uncertain. By midnight, supporters were streaming out the exits. Many of those who remained were in tears. ""I'm actually speechless right now,"" said a dejected Julia Beatty, 38, who left the Javits Center with her Clinton sticker peeling off her leather jacket. ""I just want to make it safely uptown so I can sob into a glass of wine."" Clinton faced the additional burden of running for what would be the third consecutive term for one party in the White House -- something that has happened only once since the middle of the 20th century.  After nearly a quarter-century in the nation's consciousness, Clinton had become a walking paradox, a Rorschach test of what defines character and values. Trump nicknamed her ""Crooked Hillary."" And for more than a year, she was hobbled by her use of a personal email server as secretary of state, which flouted protocol and became the subject of an FBI investigation. FBI Director James B. Comey roiled the campaign 11 days before the election by announcing that a fresh trove of emails had been discovered on the computer of Clinton aide Huma Abedin's estranged husband, former New York congressman Anthony Weiner. On Sunday, Comey said the investigation found no cause for the FBI to reverse its earlier decision against an indictment. Still, the developments took Clinton off her stride in the home stretch and contributed to a tightening of the polls. Clinton got an early warning of trouble ahead, even before the general election. To win the Democratic nomination that had once been presumed to be a coronation, she had to fend off an unexpectedly potent primary challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), a self-identified democratic socialist who sparred with her until the final primaries in June. Trump proved resilient against an onslaught of negative advertising from Clinton's campaign and her allied super PAC, Priorities USA, which portrayed him as racist, misogynist and unhinged. Nearly a quarter-billion dollars was spent on ads supporting Clinton, while just $153 million went into spots backing Trump.   [Considering what America's choice of Donald Trump really means]   Clinton's sprawling and supposedly superior data-driven organization -- which mobilized a broad coalition of Latino, African American, women and young voters -- did not deliver the knockout blows it had hoped in critical contests. It appeared that Trump was following through on his promise to remake the political map by igniting a populist rage across among working-class whites in huge swaths of the country. A razor-thin margin in Florida, which had decided the 2000 presidential election, was a microcosm of the story in many contested states. Clinton and her allies had helped spur record turnout among Democrats and Latino voters in early voting, but Trump rapidly made up ground on Tuesday with record turnout in exurban communities and GOP-leaning counties.  Meanwhile, Trump's unexpectedly strong performance rippled down the ballot. His army of supporters helped power several endangered Republican senators to reelection, including Marco Rubio in Florida, Rob Portman in Ohio and Richard Burr in North Carolina. And in Indiana, Republican Todd Young defeated former Democratic senator Evan Bayh in a closely watched race for an open seat. Rarely in modern electoral history had the two parties offered such a stark choice for voters at the top of the ballot. Trump and Clinton also registered the highest and second-highest personal negative ratings, respectively, of any two major-party nominees in the history of polling.  Initially dismissed by the GOP elders and the mainstream media as a mere showman, Trump vanquished a highly credentialed field of 16 other contenders -- including governors and senators -- in the nominating contest. Indeed, the last Republican president, George W. Bush, and the party's last nominee, Mitt Romney, refused to support Trump. When they voted Tuesday, Bush and his wife, Laura, did not select either Trump or Clinton, according to their spokesman. Trump resisted building a traditional national political infrastructure, shunning the kind of data analytics that have become the norm in campaigns in favor for mega rallies and an omnipresence on cable news.  It fell to the Republican National Committee to pull together a ground-level operation on Trump's behalf, which it did by following an example that Obama had set in 2008 and 2012. The party built a field operation that refocused on voter contact and early balloting.  In New Hampshire alone, party officials said, GOP volunteers and organizers had knocked on 1.5 million doors by the weekend before the election -- three times as many as Romney's campaign had in 2012. Trump's unorthodox campaign also severed the Republican Party from its philosophical roots. His populist stance against free trade diverged with the GOP's long-held position, while his harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration flew in the face of the strategy party leaders presented in the wake of Romney's defeat, of championing immigration reform as a means of broadening the GOP's appeal to Latino voters. Clinton, meanwhile, focused on building a diverse coalition that rejected Trump's brand of divisiveness. Hers was a call for inclusion and tolerance -- and for a recognition of how far the country has progressed beyond its founding as a society where power was vested almost exclusively in white men. Ironically, it was not the first female major-party nominee who brought discussions of sexism and misogyny to the forefront of debate this year, but her opponent. Trump unapologetically made frequent boorish references to the physical appearance and intelligence of women. A leaked video from 2005 revealed him bragging of groping and kissing women without permission.  Subsequently, more than a dozen women came forward to accuse Trump of various incidents of sexual assault, all of which he denied. It set off a national conversation, involving not just women, but their husbands and sons and brothers.  Having lived much of his adult life within range of a microphone, Trump provided decades of fodder for his critics. And once he rode a Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy in June 2015, he said things, again and again, that would have been disqualifying had a more conventional politician said them.  He characterized Mexicans who immigrated illegally as rapists and murderers, mocked a disabled New York Times reporter, insulted Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for his time as a prisoner of war, suggested that a female debate moderator had been tough on him because she was having her menstrual period, and tangled with the Muslim parents of a U.S. soldier who was killed in the Iraq War. With her singular credentials and experience, Clinton set out to forge a path to the nation's highest office that no one had ever walked. At the same time, her public choices and personal ordeals became the emblem of a generation of striving women who had come of age with a feminist movement that promised they could ""have it all.""  Clinton struggled throughout the campaign to articulate a simple, pithy reason for running. Her strategists considered 85 possibilities for a general election campaign slogan before settling on ""Stronger Together,"" according to an email stolen from campaign chairman John Podesta and published by WikiLeaks. None of those matched the simple power of Trump's pledge to ""Make America Great Again.""  Gearan reported from New York. Abby Phillip in New York and Robert Costa, David A.
