But the day after Election Day, Molly Spence Sahebjami tried to do just that. The Seattle mother started a Facebook group called ""Dear President Trump: Letters from Kids About Kindness."" The idea? To have children write letters to President-elect Donald Trump ""about the importance of being kind to other people, even if they're different than you are,"" according to a description on the group's Facebook page. Sahebjami, who lives in a state where voters overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton, said she knew many who disapproved of Trump's vulgar language. Children ""don't know anything about the issues, like manufacturing jobs,"" she said in a phone interview with The Washington Post. ""But they know -- at least where I live, it's really prevalent [for kids] to say, 'Oh, he's the mean one.' "" The idea started with her own son, a kindergarten student who said he was concerned about things Trump had said about Muslims, because the family has relatives of Iranian descent. ""So I said to him, 'Well maybe we should write a letter to him and we can show him,' "" Sahebjami said. "" 'Why don't you talk to him about why it's important to be kind?' "" She added: ""It was very simplistic, at a 5-year-old level, where I started.""   [Deep in Trump country, this Clinton voter found renewed faith in her neighbors and America]   Her son's letter, which he dictated to Sahebjami, read: ""Dear President-elect Trump, please be a good president. Be kind to all people. Some people in my family are a special religion and they are not bad guys.""      A Facebook group was created encouraging children to write letters to President-elect Donald Trump ""about the importance of being kind to other people, even if they're different than you are."" Here are some of the messages children had for Trump. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)   Spurred by this, Sahebjami consulted with friends who have children about posting such letters in a private, online group. ""This is an opportunity to seize and teach our children how to be articulate, productive communicators,"" Sahebjami said. However, she emphasized that she wanted the Facebook group to be a ""multi-partisan, global grass-roots campaign"" that offers parents a chance to turn a divisive election into a ""teachable moment."" The rules were simple: Letters must be written by children under 18. They should be positive, nonpartisan and kind in tone. ""It's great if kids can tell their own story, and how this issue is important to them personally,"" Sahebjami wrote on Facebook. ""... Consider this as your opportunity to persuade."" She encouraged parents to take pictures of their children's letters and share them on social media using the hashtag #kidsletterstotrump. ""The power of this movement comes from the kindness and unity we can teach our children,"" Sahebjami wrote. ""This isn't about policies -- it's about high standards of basic human kindness that ALL parents can get behind.""   My 4yo: ""lf Trump sees us all being nice to each other, maybe he'll be nice and stop saying bad words."" #Hope #Idealism #KidsLettersToTrump -- Barbara Meskin (@barbarajmeskin) November 10, 2016        Very proud parent. #kidsletterstotrump #nohate A photo posted by Beth Bernstein (@sqnevents) on Nov 10, 2016 at 2:31pm PST    Sahebjami launched the Facebook group by inviting about 200 friends, who have many different political leanings. Within days, hundreds more people had joined. A week after the election, the group had nearly 9,000 members -- and counting.   [This election has divided the country. Getting Clinton and Trump voters talking is one way to heal.]   Sahebjami said the Facebook group is a closed one, to maintain a positive environment. But it has grown quickly in part because any member can add a new member. ""We chose to make it a closed group so that our children would be protected to some extent,"" she said. ""I have denied two neo-Nazis so far. Where obviously there's going to be hate, that's not welcome here on this site. But people of all parties who have articulate, compelling things to say are welcome."" Gradually, the letters from children trickled in. Some messages were only a few words. ""DEAR MR TRUMP Be kind please FROM A Littel Boy TOMMY,"" read one, underneath a drawing of a rainbow.   #kidsletterstotrump pic.twitter.com/RF8Pwq1KZ9 -- Alison McManus (@McManusAlison) November 13, 2016   One young girl offered to serve as an adviser to Trump. ""Dear Mr. President, be nice to things. Do not say mean things. This helps me calm down: meditation, reading and resting,"" wrote 6-year-old Szaba. ""Good luck with your new job! Let me know if I can help."" Her mother, Angela Hylland, thanked Sahebjami for organizing the group, saying it was an ideal outlet for their family. ""My daughter (6) has been buzzing with eagerness to get more involved in her community since the election, and this was a fun, positive way for her to get started,"" Hylland wrote on Facebook. ""She took it very seriously ... down to making the outside of the letter colorful, so President-Elect Trump would be intrigued to open it."" That girl was not the only child to offer Trump advice. Seven-year-old Kela drew up a 12-point checklist titled ""How to be nice!"" To Mr Trump, How to be nice! 1. Say kind things like well done 2. Don't blame other people when it is you doing the bad thing 3. Don't lie 4. Don't scream at people 5. Behave 6. Don't tell people what to do 7. Have nice manners like say thank you and no thank you 8. Listen to other people 9. Don't talk meanly 10. Don't hurt people 11. Help people 12. Being different is COOL!!! Warm regards, From Kela (in the UK) Age 7 Still others referenced promises Trump had made during his campaign, such as deporting undocumented immigrants and getting Mexico to pay for a border wall. ""Dear Mr. Trump, Kids in my class are very scared. Please don't kick them out. In my school we get sent to the wall when we're in trouble. My friends did not do anything wrong. Don't send them to the wall. Love, Abby age 6."" ""Dear Mr. Trump I won an award at school for kindness and respect. I think you should be kind and do not!! build a wall between Mexico and America. Because we have friends there. Please be kind. Sincerely Henry."" Repeatedly, Sahebjami reminded people to keep it positive -- and to mail their letters to Trump Tower so that the president-elect and his wife, Melania, might read them. Sahebjami said she is hopeful that the letters from children would resonate with Trump, who is a father to 10-year-old Barron. The president-elect is also a grandfather. ""If he got bags and bags of letters from kids, he would see that those are everyday Americans who want to hold him to high standards of basic human kindness,"" Sahebjami told ABC affiliate KATU. ""I would hope that he would be affected by that.""

Taylor finds balance	"   Hiss Golden Messenger's M.C. Taylor is feeling good about his life choices. (Andy Tenille)  Depending on how you listen to it, Hiss Golden Messenger's new album, ""Heart Like a Levee,"" is either founder M.C. Taylor's darkest record yet, or his brightest. ""I feel like this record is acting as a really interesting reflecting pool for a lot of people's emotions,"" Taylor says. ""They're seeing certain things in this music that I didn't anticipate."" The album, Hiss Golden Messenger's sixth, sometimes finds Taylor at his bleakest, lyrically, but the words are couched in the sunny, rootsy folk rock of his ever-evolving band (which includes Phil Cook, who will open Thursday's Rock and Roll Hotel show solo and then play with Taylor). Taylor began writing ""Heart Like a Levee"" at a D.C. hotel in January 2015. Hiss Golden Messenger was coming off a show at the 9:30 Club, but a snowstorm had left the band stranded and its next gig, in Boston, was canceled. Taylor had recently quit his job as a folklorist in North Carolina, and his anxieties were at an all-time high.    ""I think I had reached a fork in the road,"" Taylor says. ""At that point, I was really watching every penny because I just did not quite understand how my making a living in music was actually going to work, and then that show got canceled and I was kind of freaking out."" Taylor questioned whether he'd made the right decision about his job. ""I think the subtext of it was, when things unexpected happen with this life, I'm not going to be able to make it,"" he says. A married father of two, Taylor expresses his doubts and fears about his future throughout the record, his most direct batch of songs yet. ""Go easy on me, I'm not doing too well,"" he sings in the title track. ""Do you hate me, honey/ As much as I hate myself?"" The chorus of the breezy single ""Biloxi"" is even more direct: ""It's hard, lord/ Lord, it's hard."" Nearly two years removed from that snowy night, Taylor is confident in his decision. ""Things feel really good,"" he says. ""Even from that time when I was starting to write, I knew I wanted to make a record that felt inclusive to people, including people that had no context for my music, and I wanted it to feel like a hopeful record. For whatever darkness is on 'Heart Like a Levee,' I wanted it to feel like a net positive.""    The album represents the first time in Taylor's 20 years of making music when he didn't have another job and could concentrate solely on his craft. That extra focus led to a bonus batch of eight intimate songs that make up ""Vestapol,"" a companion record released with the deluxe version of ""Heart Like a Levee."" Taylor didn't love the idea of using ""Vestapol"" as a way to get people to buy his music, but he wanted fans to hear those songs. ""I learned a long time ago that if I love making music, the rewards really come from the inside,"" he says. ""I am lucky enough to have a language that I can use to articulate my emotions and that's something that not a lot of other people have. I feel like that's my daily mantra: I'm doing this because it's beautiful for me to do it -- not because I'm trying to make a lot of money. And that's something that people can feel. People can watch someone play onstage and feel what their intentions are. I'm totally convinced of that."" Rock and Roll Hotel, 1353 H St. NE; Thu., 8 p.m., $15.

(Molly Riley/AP)  Congress is not, to put it mildly, the most popular institution in the United States. Its approval ratings are low. It has developed a reputation for mindless obstructionism. And when Donald Trump promises to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, he seems to be talking in large part about the legislature. Congress may also be the last, best hope of those who fear substantial parts of Trump's announced agenda. Our national legislature has a reputation for fecklessness in disputes with the White House. After all, legislation nearly always requires the president's signature, so how can lawmakers hope to rein him in? But this standard view is too myopic -- Congress does a lot of things other than pass legislation, and most of them do not require presidential assent. Moreover, many of them can form effective tools with which to push back against the president's agenda. Yes, Republicans will control both the House and the Senate in January, just as they do now. But if Democrats vote as a bloc, it wouldn't take that many GOP defections to check Trump. And there are already early indications that at least some Republican lawmakers might want to do just that.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Nov. 10 said he had a ""first-class meeting"" with President-elect Donald Trump. (The Washington Post)   Consider what I call the congressional ""personnel power,"" one key part of which is the requirement of Senate advice and consent for judicial appointments and numerous executive appointments, ranging from Cabinet posts on down. Assuming that Republican John N. Kennedy wins the Louisiana Senate runoff next month (as seems likely), Republicans will have only a 52-48 edge in the upper chamber, which means that just three Republican defections, alongside a unified Democratic caucus, could defeat a nomination. Obviously, most Republicans will not oppose Trump at every turn. But there are plenty who might be inclined to oppose him at least occasionally. Sens. Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jeff Flake and John McCain (Ariz.), Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) either opposed or withdrew support from Trump in the general election. Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) is a libertarian who recently told The Washington Post's David Weigel that he was disinclined to support Trump's reported favorites Rudolph W. Giuliani or John Bolton for secretary of state; Paul might be inclined to oppose other hawkish national security nominees, as well. It should be possible to assemble at least three from that group of eight (and perhaps other Trump-skeptical Republicans) to defeat extreme nominees.   [Reasonable Republicans can't save the GOP from Trump]   Across the Capitol, party discipline is generally stronger in the House, and partisan gerrymandering means that many members will worry more about drawing primary challengers for opposing Trump than about alienating moderates by supporting him. But if relations sour between the White House and Congress, even the GOP-controlled House might consider using its powers of investigation and contempt to keep close tabs on the administration. These powers have been used to significant effect in recent years, first by Democrats overseeing the George W. Bush administration and then by Republicans overseeing the Obama administration. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has a notoriously on-again-off-again marriage of convenience with Trump, and Rep. Jason Chaffetz (Utah), who chairs the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has expressed some Trump-skeptical views at points. They might be inclined to hold hearings about controversial policies and ask tough questions of members of the administration, especially if Trump's popularity sinks lower once he's in office. Both chambers might also use their power of the purse, simply refusing to fund agencies or activities that they find odious. (Surely, at any rate, if Trump's campaign promises are to be believed, no money need be appropriated to finance the construction of a wall on our southern border.) In pushing back against a president of their own party, Republicans would hardly be doing something unprecedented, even in the current age of heightened partisan polarization. George W. Bush's attempt to nominate Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court fell to bipartisan opposition, as did President Obama's nominations of Goodwin Liu to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Dawn Johnsen to the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and Debo Adegbile as head of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. And actual failed nominations undoubtedly underestimate the influence of intraparty pushback: Obama nominated Janet L. Yellen to chair the Federal Reserve after a number of Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), made clear that they would oppose Lawrence Summers for the post. Unsurprisingly, presidents tend to face the most intraparty pushback when their standing with the public is lowest. Trump will enter office having lost the popular vote, with very low favorability ratings and in the face of massive protests. This will free some Republicans with strong ideological commitments to oppose him (Paul on the national security state comes to mind). Other Republicans will see an opportunity to begin staking their claim to the future of the party by putting some distance between themselves and Trump (Sasse and Ryan may well fall into this camp). Still others represent districts or states that may be close enough to make a ""centrist maverick"" reputation valuable (Flake and Portman, maybe).   [How the government could resist President Trump's orders]   None of these motivations is likely to lead to opposition on all, or even most, matters. Party loyalty, even if not absolute, is still strong. But for any given issue or appointment, a relatively small number of House members or (especially) senators -- whether motivated by ideology, status-seeking within the party, constituency placation, some combination of the above or something else entirely -- could join with Democrats to block some of the Trump administration's most extreme actions. Democrats in both houses would therefore be wise to consider ways of reaching across the aisle to never-Trump and Trump-skeptical Republicans, in an effort to make shared use of these congressional tools of opposition. This will stick in many Democrats' craw, and with good reason: Republicans did not do much reaching across the aisle over the last eight years. But Republicans will soon control all three branches of the federal government. Republicans will set policy for (at a very minimum) the next two years. Democrats would be wise to work with them where they can find common ground against Trump's worst policies. If the bipartisan will to use them can be found, Congress has the tools with which to push back."

The divorced 27-year-old Clarendon resident also isn't shy about offering opinions. He calls himself stable, a ""large personality"" and a planner.

Amy: We got two types of steak and these sides that had anchovies, artichokes and curry. He was a little hesitant, so I was like, ""I'm going to push you outside your boundary.""

Can you explain how this is even possible given his comments on minorities and the claims of sexual assault? Will he really seek to jail his vanquished opponent? These are the kinds of questions that many Americans living abroad have faced in the wake of Trump's shock victory. ""The undercurrent to conversations goes like this: 'What the hell is your country thinking?' and 'Can you speak for your country?' "" said Mena Mark Hanna, a 32-year-old academic who moved to Berlin two years ago. It is estimated that more than 8 million Americans live abroad, and, like many of them, Hanna is no fan of the 45th president-elect. But that hasn't stopped him from being pelted with questions about how his fellow Americans could vote for Trump. Hanna doesn't always know how to answer the questions. ""I can't speak for this man, Trump, or the political results of this election. It's not the America I know or recognize,"" he said, noting that Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton, won the popular vote.         1 of 26       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                           Skip Ad   x           How the world is reacting to results of the U.S. election      View Photos   People around the globe watched as Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States.

[Islamist extremists celebrate Trump's election win]   Trump's victory sent shock waves around the world, and reactions from global leaders have ranged from Russian President Vladimir Putin's optimistic note of congratulations to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's very cautious welcome. But there is an intense curiosity and eagerness on the ground to understand how the nation that elected Barack Obama could, just a few years later, choose Trump, or as the comedy writer Rob Fee tweeted: ""How do we go from our first black president to a president endorsed by the KKK? How?"" Foreigners are curious, too, and ears perk up when they hear an American accent with its distinctive ""r's."" ""As expats, we are expected to be able to explain the actions of the president,"" said Lucia Lucas, a 36-year-old from Sacramento who moved to Germany in 2009. Sometimes strangers overhear her on the train, recognize her accent and launch into questions about U.S. politics. ""People who don't know us feel like we owe them an explanation,"" she said. She hasn't resorted to sewing a maple leaf on her backpack or -- as some of her American friends have done -- telling people that her accent is a Canadian one.

(Jack Taylor/Getty Images)    [Vigils and protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory]   This sensation is new. When Obama first assumed power eight years ago, the world was enamored with the United States for electing its first black president, and there was enough stardust around to be sprinkled on U.S. expats. It was a strange feeling for many Americans who lived overseas during the George W. Bush era, when anti-Americanism was rife. ""Obama has this rock star status, and you felt like, as an American over here, you were a roadie in his rock star entourage, just because you were an American,"" said John Scardino, a 56-year-old high school teacher who moved to Britain in 2000. Now, he says, his British friends and colleagues are flabbergasted. ""When I walk into school, a lot of my teaching colleagues will say, 'What is going on?' Something Trump has proposed or said will be in the news, and people at work will say, 'Is this for real?' ""   [Angela Merkel congratulates Donald Trump -- kind of]   Some expats find it easier than others to explain the appeal of Trump. ""I think Brexit and Trumpism are a necessary corrective to excesses of globalization,"" said Alex Sundstrom, a 37-year-old from Boston and a board member of the British branch of Republicans Overseas. On Tuesday night, Sundstrom was at a watch party at the U.S. Embassy in London, where he estimated that of the 1,500 guests, about ""99 to 99.5 percent were pro-Hillary."" But he also said that just as there are ""shy Tories"" in Britain, there are ""shy Trump supporters,"" too. At the embassy party, Sundstrom's ""Make America Great Again"" pin easily identified him as pro-Trump, and he described the experience of walking into a room filled with journalists as ""going into a pen with starving lions and wrapping yourself with raw meat."" Part of the global interest in the results of the election stem from how Trump defied the expectations of almost every pollster and pundit. Albert Frantz, 41, an American entrepreneur who lives in Vienna, was ""pre-celebrating"" with friends on Tuesday evening. But as it became clear that Trump had won, the proud American went from feeling jubilant to feeling ""ashamed"" of his homeland. ""I was shocked and horrified. We just clicked the undo button for all of the advances that Western societies have made in the last century,"" he said. ""I never thought this could be a reality."" "

The agency released a statement late Wednesday imploring Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners to voluntarily stop work in the area where protests against the $3.8 billion pipeline have resulted in more than 400 arrests. The Corps made a similar plea last week, but was also rebuffed.  ""Their absence will help reduce these tensions,"" wrote Col. John Henderson, commander of the Corps district covering the region. ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado told The Associated Press in an email Thursday that the company was still mobilizing equipment in preparation for tunneling under Lake Oahe. The reservoir is at the center of the Standing Rock Sioux's fight against the pipeline, which the tribe and its supporters fear could harm cultural sites and drinking water sources at the tribe's nearby reservation.  ""We have always said (safety) is our top priority: The safety of our workers and our assets, the safety of those who live and work in the area and the safety of the environment,"" Granado said. Granado said construction won't start until the company gets permission to work on Corps-owned land near the reservoir in a permitting process that has been stalled for months. The nearly 1,200-mile pipeline is slated to carry oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux is fighting the project through a federal lawsuit, and the tribe's chairman, Dave Archambault, called on President Barack Obama on Wednesday to stop the project before he leaves office. Obama has said his administration is monitoring the situation.  ""As long as that pipe isn't under the lake, I have hope,"" Archambault told the AP. Corp officials didn't respond to email and phone messages sent by the AP outside of supplying Henderson's statement. The Corps has given no timetable for a decision on allowing ETP to work on the land near Lake Oahe. In the meantime, ETP has continued construction on private land nearby. The company has said all of the equipment needed to tunnel under the reservoir will be in place in two weeks, and it's confident the matter of Corps permission will be resolved without causing significant delays. Experts said the Corps has few options outside of asking ETP to voluntary stop work on private property.  ""If they're lawfully on private land, they can essentially do whatever they want there,"" said Brian Jorde, an attorney with Nebraska-based Domina Law Group who has represented hundreds of landowners against pipeline companies.  ""It's kind of a sneaky way to do the preparation, to do it on land essentially that the Corps doesn't have jurisdiction on. (But) when it comes to private land, I don't see what recourse the Corps would have,"" he said Thursday. Mark Barteau, director of the University of Michigan Energy Institute, concurred, but added that ""obviously the company is working at its own risk that the (federal permit) case could be reopened. Any realistic threat to do so might change their risk calculus."" Corp officials last week met with leaders from several tribes in the Missouri River Basin in an attempt to ease tension between protesters and law officers, according to Henderson, the Corps district commander. The company didn't mince words in response to the Corps' initial request to halt work, releasing a statement Tuesday saying: ""To be clear, Dakota Access Pipeline has not voluntarily agreed to halt construction of the pipeline in North Dakota."" Henderson said stopping work would help ""defuse tensions surrounding their operations near Corps-managed federal land until we have a clear path forward."" ___ Follow Blake Nicholson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/NicholsonBlake Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Do you know what to do? Hint: it does not include inviting them in for tea & cookies pic.twitter.com/MHB5NnX2jr -- Alia Salem (@aliarsalem) November 6, 2016   A civil rights organization for American Muslims says the FBI questioned Muslims in at least eight states over the weekend seeking information about a possible threat from al-Qaeda to carry out pre-election terrorist attacks. The individuals were asked eight questions, including several specific to al-Qaeda, said Hassan Shibly, a lawyer and the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Florida. He said his clients were asked whether they knew the al-Qaeda leaders killed in U.S. military airstrikes last month, who U.S. officials believe were connected to the alleged plot, and whether they knew of anyone who wished to cause harm to Americans at home or abroad. Among those questioned, according to Shibly, were a youth group leader and several wealthy doctors. Shibly said he was not aware of anything that connected the targeted individuals to each other or to the alleged threat, aside from their religion and ethnicity. It appeared only Muslims of Afghani and Pakistani descent were questioned, he said. ""The FBI actions . . . to conduct a sweep of American Muslim leaders the weekend before the election is completely outrageous and . . . borderline unconstitutional,"" Shibly told The Post. ""That's the equivalent of the FBI visiting churchgoing Christians because someone overseas was threatening to blow up an abortion clinic. It's that preposterous and outrageous."" The nature of the threat was vague, and officials said its credibility remained under investigation. Officials said law enforcement in New York, Texas and Virginia had been notified of the possible danger. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued statements that said they were ""vigilant and well-postured"" to defend against terrorist attacks in the United States and were working daily with law enforcement and intelligence partners ""to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety.""   [Federal authorities investigating threat of pre-election attacks]   Muslim Americans in at least eight states told the Council on American-Islamic Relations that FBI agents came to their homes during the weekend seeking information about the terrorism threat. Several of the states -- including Florida and Pennsylvania -- are viewed as crucial swing states heading into the presidential election Tuesday. The Florida CAIR director, a civil rights attorney, fielded three calls from Floridians on Saturday and three others outside of Florida. The FBI agents gave business cards with contact information to the Muslim Americans they questioned, which they later passed on to Shibly.      In an election that has put American Muslims under the spotlight, three voters from different parts of the country reflect on how the political rhetoric has affected them. (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Leaming,Alice Li/The Washington Post)   He contacted the agents individually, he told The Post, to inquire about what he called a ""sweep."" Shibly said the agents told him the names and questions came directly from the FBI national headquarters. The people who were questioned, Shibly said, were not suspected of terrorist activity or under investigation by the FBI. ""When FBI agents show up at your door, people are terrified,"" Shibly said. ""It does more damage."" The North Texas branch of CAIR told the Dallas Morning News that it had confirmed three interviews took place during the weekend. The office received five additional reports, the newspaper reported. CAIR Oklahoma received at least four reports of FBI agents visiting Muslims there, executive director Adam Soltani wrote on Facebook. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post. A representative in the FBI's Dallas field office declined to comment to the Morning News. States that received reports from American Muslims included California, Washington, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and Florida, Shibly said. ""Muslims, along with fellow Americans, are committed to doing their job in helping to make our community safer,"" North Texas CAIR director Alia Salem told the Morning News. ""That includes reporting suspicious activity. But for the Muslim community to be targeted as if we are guilty is inappropriate. If [law enforcement] wants to communicate with specific individuals, there should be no hindrance in doing that with an attorney."" CAIR offices across the country issued warnings via social media to the Muslim American community, instructing anyone who comes in contact with law enforcement to politely decline to talk until a lawyer is present.  ""For me, this is no different than the FBI discussing the Hillary investigation eight or nine days before the election,"" Shibly said, referencing the FBI director's decision to announce developments in the investigation regarding Clinton's private email server that roused suspicion a week before the election but ultimately yielded no new information. ""There could arguably be a legitimate reason,"" Shibly said, ""but it could have an impact of intimidating an entire community.""   [Police say he made death threats to Muslims. His defense: America's 'toxic national discourse.']   Shibly worries this ""sweep,"" just days before the election, could reinforce the anti-Muslim rhetoric that the Republican candidate for president has often used in his political stump speeches. ""Unfortunately we're dealing with an environment that's not very friendly to American Muslims,"" he said. ""The environment is very hostile to the American Muslim community.""
