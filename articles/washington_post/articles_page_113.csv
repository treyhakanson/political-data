The rally in an industrial area along the Rhine River brought together pro-Kurdish demonstrators and members of the Alevi religious minority protesting Erdogan's crackdown after a failed coup attempt in Turkey this summer. A group of about 200 to 300 Kurdish youth broke away from the main protest and several were taken into custody after throwing stones and bottles at police, authorities said. One police officer was slightly injured. Police say many of the youth were wearing masks, and some were displaying banned symbols of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Erdogan's government recently ordered the arrest of nine lawmakers of the pro-Kurdish HDP party, which it accuses of acting as the political wing of the outlawed PKK -- an allegation the HDP rejects. The PKK has waged a three-decades-long insurgency against the state, and Erdogan has blamed countries in Europe for supporting and arming the group. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Vice Public Security Minister Meng Hongwei is the first Chinese to hold the post. The Lyon, France-based International Criminal Police Organization has 190 member nations and has the power to issue ""red notices."" It is the closest instrument to an international arrest warrant in use today. Interpol circulates those notices to member countries listing people who are wanted for extradition. While Interpol's charter officially bars it from undertaking ""any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character,"" critics say some governments, primarily Russia and Iran, have abused the system to harass and detain opponents. Interpol says it has a special vetting process to prevent that from happening.     Interpol's president is a largely symbolic but still influential figure who heads its executive committee. Jurgen Stock is the organization's secretary general.  Meng, who takes over from Mireille Ballestrazzi of France for a four-year term, will assume his new duties immediately. His election comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping is seeking to give new momentum to his four-year-old campaign against corruption, including a push to seek the return of former officials and other suspects who had fled abroad. China filed a list of 100 of its most-wanted suspects with Interpol in April 2014, about one-third of whom have since been repatriated to face justice at home.     China's police and judicial systems have been routinely criticized for abuses, including confessions under torture, arbitrary travel bans and the disappearance and detention without charges of political dissidents and their family members. That has prompted reluctance among many Western nations to sign extradition treaties with China or return suspects wanted for nonviolent crimes. China also stands accused of abducting independent book sellers who published tomes on sensitive political topics from Hong Kong and Thailand.  Given those circumstances, Meng's election is an ""alarming prospect,"" said Maya Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher with Human Rights Watch. ""While we think it's important to fight corruption, the campaign has been politicized and undermines judicial independence,"" Wang said. Meng's election ""will probably embolden and encourage abuses in the system,"" she said.     Interpol member countries nominate officials for the post of president. Presidents are elected in a vote by members on a one-country, one-vote basis.      "

The stunning presidential outcome revealed an America more deeply divided and hostile to government-as-usual than many inside the Beltway could have ever imagined. Although there is a way forward from the turmoil, the answer most likely won't come from Washington.  Instead, look south of the Potomac. Amid the tumultuous national primaries, you could be forgiven for missing one of Virginia's most important political developments in 2016. In January, a three-judge panel in Richmond issued a ruling that altered the state's political terrain significantly. The decision redrew Virginia's 3rd and 4th Congressional Districts, acting on a judgment that legislators in 2012 diluted African American influence by crowding these voters into a single majority-minority district. The move came as a number of other states, including North Carolina, Wisconsin and Florida, faced their own legal challenges to allegations of gerrymandering. Virginia's Republican congressional delegation challenged the timing of the decision and lost. With the 2016 election behind us, both parties must consider the long-term health of our democracy and point to this new map as an opportunity.  First, because redistricting breeds competitive elections, it's undeniably good for voters. Experiences from Democratic inner cities and Republican rural towns show that one-party dominance can be a marvelous recipe for corruption and complacency. Research from the University of Oxford's Petra Schleiter and Alisa Voznaya bolsters the point: In a study of 70 democracies, they find that meaningful party competition is crucial for limiting the scope of governmental corruption. Second, one of Virginia's two major parties is in dire need of a reset. The 2013 gubernatorial election saw Republicans get shut out of the three major statewide offices for the first time in nearly 25 years. With Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton carrying the commonwealth this week, no Republican has won a statewide race in the Old Dominion since 2009.  There is a glimmer of hope. Subtle yet powerful changes in how and where the parties compete for control of Congress could produce an enduring new landscape all their own. Evidence that such a geographic realignment could spark a political one is already emerging. Consider what happened this cycle in Virginia's 7th District, where popular Henrico County Sheriff Mike Wade was planning to challenge Rep. Dave Brat in a Republican primary. Instead, Wade ran for an open seat in the newly configured 4th District, transforming what was destined to be yet another intra-party squabble into a far more intriguing general election contest. The two districts look little alike. The 7th is the very definition of a Republican stronghold, last electing a Democrat to Congress in 1968. The new 4th District, on the other hand, is 41 percent black and was carried by President Obama with 61 percent of the vote in 2012.  Wade's record, emphasizing issues Republicans rarely touch in a congressional race, such as criminal-justice reform, was a good fit for this diverse district. For most of election night, he looked strong, trading leads with his Democratic opponent, state Sen. A. Donald McEachin, until the last 20 percent of precincts began reporting. McEachin prevailed, confirming the steep hill that Republicans had to climb.  A single congressional campaign, no matter how well fought, is rarely enough to turn the tide on decades of history. Good political habits must be formed from trial and error, and a lack of competition at the House level has stymied each party's ability to communicate beyond its demographic niche.  No matter the result, Wade's campaign is a model for what Republicans and Democrats must do across the country: Embrace new, supposedly hostile districts. Study them carefully. Learn from these voters while competing hard for their support. Elections will be lost, as meaningful realignments don't happen overnight. But if the parties can come together on anything, let it be competitive redistricting to help save the two-party system from itself. Given the factious legacy of the 2016 race, this path forward is more urgently needed than ever before.   Read more about this issue:   Julian E.

Johnson said Thursday in the Serbian capital of Belgrade that ""people should focus on the opportunities ... and not the problems."" Johnson added that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump had a ""very, very good conversation"" Prime Minister Theresa May earlier in the day. He says Trump has spoken of a ""spectacular relationship"" with the U.K. and ""wants to sign a free trade deal."" Johnson says Trump's election ""is a great opportunity for us in the U.K. to build a better relationship with America that is of fundamental economic importance for us, but also of great importance for the stability and prosperity of the world."" ___ 9:30 p.m. Zimbabwe's state-owned Herald newspaper is rejoicing in Donald Trump's defeat of ""the warmonger"" Hillary Clinton. In an editorial published Thursday, the newspaper attacked the United States as a ""blundering global bully"" for backing sanctions against Zimbabwe's longtime President Robert Mugabe and his allies. The editorial says: ""We hope Trump, who was considered an outsider and who was attacked no end for all of 18 months by the U.S. and Western media that sought to cast him as an unstable, unelectable ogre, will -- with the benefit of experience -- understand the Western characterization of Zimbabwe."" ___ 6:00 p.m. Germany's foreign minister says it's urgent for the incoming U.S. administration to set out its positions quickly since ""very many questions are open"" on its foreign policy. Frank-Walter Steinmeier told German weekly Der Spiegel in comments published Thursday that he's spoken several times with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger about what President-elect Donald Trump's foreign policies might look like. Steinmeier says even Kissinger had no insights to offer. He said: ""Many have already tried to read a foreign policy doctrine, or at least clear and coherent positions, out of Donald Trump's comments. Without much success."" Steinmeier says he can't predict whether there will more or less U.S. military activity, or additional or fewer commitments in crises such as the ones in Syria and Yemen. ___ 3:25 p.m. Argentina's president says he's hopeful that his nation's accords with the United States will remain in place under Republican President-elect Donald Trump. President Mauricio Macri says he hopes Argentina will continue the ""constructive, mature"" relationship with the U.S. that was built under President Barack Obama. He spoke Thursday after inaugurating infrastructure projects in Buenos Aires. Obama, a Democrat, visited Argentina in March and brokered several trade and investment deals with Macri. The meeting was seen as a fence-mending mission after years of tensions between the two countries under former President Cristina Fernandez. Macri openly supported Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election and has been forced to shift gears after Trump's victory. ___ 1:50 p.m. The left-leaning contender in Austria's presidential election runoff says he hopes Donald Trump's victory in the United States will motivate people to support him against a right-wing rival. Alexander Van der Bellen faces Norbert Hofer of the anti-establishment and anti-immigration Freedom Party in a Dec. 4 rerun of the runoff. Van der Bellen narrowly beat Hofer in May, but a court ordered a rerun after the Freedom Party successfully argued that irregularities had marred the results. Van der Bellen said at a news conference Thursday that he hopes Trump's victory will be ""seen as extra motivation to go vote, and vote for (Van der Bellen),"" according to the Austria Press Agency. He said: ""I don't want Austria to be the first western European country in which right-wing demagogues take power."" Austria's president has mostly ceremonial responsibilities, but a Hofer win would likely be viewed as a boost for other nationalist parties in Europe. ___ 1:25 p.m. Silvio Berlusconi is congratulating his fellow billionaire businessman-turned-politician, saying he is convinced President-elect Donald Trump will guarantee U.S. leadership in the free world ""with authority and equilibrium."" Berlusconi's parallels to Trump are well known: A showman with a reputation as a womanizer who charmed Italians by speaking his mind, Berlusconi had a Trump-like improbable rise from cruise ship crooner to media mogul to three-time premier. He calls Vladimir Putin a friend. A tax fraud conviction knocked Berlusconi out of parliament in 2013 and seriously hobbled his Forza Italia party. But Berlusconi, 80 and recovering from heart surgery, is still a political force in Italy and sent his ""best wishes"" to the president-elect in a Facebook message.  ""I have always been and will always be the most loyal ally of the United States in Europe, recognizing the country that guaranteed our freedom for the 20th century,"" he wrote. ""I'm convinced that the president chosen by the American people will, with authority and eqilibrium, guarantee the difficult role of the United States as the leader of the free world in today's complex and delicate global balance."" ___ 1 p.m. U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, Britain's most prominent ally of Donald Trump, has claimed he is the ""catalyst"" for the president-elect's success. In a radio interview, Farage also called President Barack Obama ""loathsome"" and joked about sexual assault allegations against Trump. Farage, who was key in pushing Britain to vote to leave the European Union, claimed credit in Wednesday's Talk Radio interview for the rise of Trump and populist movements that are sweeping Europe. The right-wing politician said ""that Obama creature"" was a ""loathsome individual"" who disliked Britain, while Trump, whose mother was Scottish, was friendly to the U.K. Asked about Trump potentially meeting Prime Minister Theresa May, Farage said: ""Come and schmooze Theresa -- don't touch her, for goodness sake,"" before offering to attend ""as the responsible adult role, to make sure everything's OK."" Several women have accused Trump of sexual assaults, which he denies. ___ 12:55 p.m. A top U.N. humanitarian aid official for Syria says he expects continued U.S. help in efforts to support beleaguered Syrian civilians under Donald Trump's presidency. Jan Egeland also cited reports Thursday from Syria that ""the last food rations are being distributed as we speak"" in besieged eastern parts of the city of Aleppo. Speaking to reporters in Geneva, Egeland said the U.N. needs ""continued, uninterrupted U.S. help and engagement in the coming months,"" and noted that progress is made only when the United States and Russia, a backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad, are leading the diplomatic efforts. Egeland, the aid chief in U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura's office, said he could not speculate about whether the prospect of improved U.S.-Russia relations under Trump would have an impact. ___ 12:50 p.m. France's president says European nations need strong, clear strategies on security and the economy as Donald Trump takes over the U.S. presidency, amid concerns that his victory will fortify populists who want to dismantle the EU. Francois Hollande said Thursday that Trump's election ""obliges Europeans to be clear and lucid and capable of facing the challenges that concern them."" Hollande, who had endorsed Hillary Clinton, also suggested European countries should be ready to stand up to Trump if necessary. ""Europe wishes to be together with the U.S. but has to be in a position to decide for itself, too."" A leading contender in France's presidential elections in April and May is far right leader Marine Le Pen, who wants to quit the EU and who hailed Trump's victory, saying it ""buried the old order."" Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen, after meeting Hollande in Paris, urged a more decisive European Union following Britain's decision to leave. He called for clearer policies on security and migration, amid criticism that Europe is too lax on both, saying ""this is where the European Union needs to deliver."" ___ 11:45 a.m. An Israeli Cabinet minister has called for a renewed wave of settlement construction now that President-elect Donald Trump is signaling an end to longstanding White House opposition to the settlements. Science Minister Ofir Akunis told Army Radio Thursday that, ""We need to think how we move forward now when the administration in Washington, the Trump administration and his advisers, are saying that there is no place for a Palestinian state."" Earlier, Jason Greenblatt, one of Trump's advisers on Israel, told Army Radio that Trump doesn't believe settlement activity should be condemned and doesn't view the settlements as an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians. Multiple U.S. administrations have condemned any construction on land captured by Israel in the 1967 war -- land that Palestinians want for a future state. ___ 11:40 a.m. About two dozen Filipino left-wing students have burned a portrait of President-elect Donald Trump along with a mock American flag at the U.S. Embassy in Manila, warning of worse times under his upcoming leadership. Left-wing protests by students, labor and human rights groups are a common sight at the heavily-fortified embassy, often staged to oppose the presence of visiting U.S. forces in the former American colony. But activists say they are bracing for more intense rallies against Trump. Protest leader JP Rosos says: ""We are not expecting that it (U.S.) will remove its control on the Philippines and in the Asia Pacific."" He says under Trump, ""we expect it to worsen with his anti-Muslim, anti-black and anti-immigrants declarations."" More than 100 riot police kept watch, but the small group of protesters dispersed without any incidents or arrests. ___ 11:20 a.m. Hungary's prime minister says Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election will allow Western civilization to return to ""true democracy and straight, honest talk"" as it is freed from the ""paralyzing constraint of political correctness."" Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who said in July that Trump's migration policies made him the better choice for Europe, said Thursday that the results of the U.S. elections also meant that the West had rid itself of ""liberal non-democracy,"" which had held it in ""ideological captivity"" for the past 20 years. Orban said the world is living in ""great times"" thanks to Trump's victory and the British decision to leave the European Union, which he described as ""not a tragedy"" but an attempt by Britain to find its own road to success. Orban met with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday in London. ___ 10 a.m. Iran's semi-official Fars news agency is reporting that the armed forces chief of staff has criticized Donald Trump for his past harsh words about confronting Iranian boats in the Persian Gulf. The report quotes Gen. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri as saying, ""The person who has recently achieved power, has talked off the top of his head! Threatening Iran in the Persian Gulf is just a joke."" He said American presidential candidates during their campaigns ""eat too much sugar,"" a reference to a Farsi proverb about those who talk nonsense. In September, Trump said Iranian ships trying to provoke the U.S. ""will be shot out of the water."" In January, Iran took 10 American sailors prisoner ship veered off course into Iranian waters; they were released a day later. ___ 9:30 a.m. A top adviser to President-elect Donald Trump says his boss doesn't think Israeli settlements should be condemned and they don't pose an ""obstacle to peace."" Jason Greenblatt's comments to Israel's Army Radio Thursday would mark a stark departure from the long-time American stance that Israeli construction in areas captured in the 1967 war makes it more difficult to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians. Greenblatt is the chief legal officer and executive vice president at the Trump Organization. He has been tapped by Trump as his top adviser on Israel. Israel and the U.S. are close allies but relations were often tense between President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, mainly over Israel's policies toward the Palestinians. Netanyahu and Trump are friendly and ties are expected to improve. ___ 8:55 a.m. Pakistani foreign affairs adviser Sartaj Aziz says his country would like to work with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on the common interest of combatting terrorism. In an interview with Pakistan's Geo News channel Thursday, he says that helping negotiate a political settlement in Afghanistan is another area where the two countries could work together. The U.S. president-elect has publicly criticized Pakistan in the past for battling some Islamic militant groups while tolerating others. Aziz acknowledged that perception, but said such policies were ""in the past."" Local and al-Qaida linked Islamic militants who have had long used Pakistan's lawless tribal regions along the Afghan border as safe havens. The Afghan government frequently accuses Islamabad of sheltering the senior leadership of the Taliban. ___ 8:20 a.m. South Korea says President-elect Donald Trump has promised to maintain the countries' strong alliance to guard against what he describes as ""the instability in North Korea."" President Park Geun-hye's office says Trump made the comments while saying he believes North Korea is very unstable during a 10-minute telephone conversation with Park on Thursday. Park's office quotes Trump as saying the United States ""will be steadfast and strong with respect to working with (South Korea) to protect against the instability in North Korea."" A statement from Park's office says Trump told Park ""we are going to be with you 100 percent"" when Park proposed strengthening the alliance to make the North Korean leadership change its way of thinking. There have been worries in South Korea that a Trump presidency could bring a major shift in U.S. economic and diplomatic ties with Seoul. Trump has questioned the value of the U.S.-South Korea security alliance. ___ 6:30 a.m. A Japanese official says Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will meet with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump next week. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Thursday that Abe and Trump had talked by telephone and confirmed the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance and their commitment for cooperation. Their meeting ""marks a very good start for building trust,"" Suga said. Their talks are being arranged for Nov. 17 in New York. Officials said Abe and Trump also confirmed their resolve to cooperate in ensuring peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, but did not discuss the trans-Pacific trade pact and other contentious issues such as the cost of American troops in Japan. Kyodo News agency additionally reported that Trump praised the Japanese premier's ""Abenomics"" economic measures. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Politicians of all stripes gathered in Georgetown for the time-honored tradition of Return Day, where they will settle their partisan differences, if only for the moment. Winners and losers of Tuesday's election rode together in horse-drawn carriages around the town circle, a symbolic gesture indicating that any hard feelings are left behind. After a town crier in tuxedo and top hat announced the Sussex County tallies in statewide and local contests from a courthouse balcony, local party leaders joined ceremoniously bury a hatchet in a box of sand.

""It is no secret that the president-elect and I have had some pretty significant differences,"" Obama said about Trump in a Rose Garden address. ""One thing you realize in this job is that the presidency and the vice presidency is bigger than any of us."" Obama likened the presidency to a relay race, telling the hundreds of exhausted and emotionally shaken White House staffers who packed the Rose Garden that they were leaving the country in a better position than it was eight years ago. But for Obama, the election of Trump and the Republicans' control of Congress puts at risk many of his signature policies over the past eight years. At the core of Trump's campaign was a promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to scrap Obama's executive actions on immigration and climate change. Trump also has promised to undo the president's deal to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, the biggest foreign policy achievement of Obama's second term.  [Obamacare's future in critical condition with Trump's victory]      These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump View Graphic     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump  The president said he spoke with Trump about 3:30 a.m. Wednesday and invited him to come to the White House on Thursday to begin planning the transition to the next administration. Obama praised Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, for a hard-fought campaign and her decades of public service. ""I could not be prouder of her,"" Obama said. The president's calls for the nation to come together carried a clear hint of his disgust with the way Trump ran his campaign. After the long, bitter election, Obama called for a ""sense of unity, a sense of inclusion, and a respect for institutions, our way of life, rule of law and a respect for each other."" ""I hope he maintains that spirit through this transition,"" Obama said of Trump, ""and I hope that is how his presidency will begin.""  [Live updates from 2016 election fallout]  Many of the changes to Obama's signature programs could happen quickly. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Agreement to curb greenhouse gases and has promised to cancel an Environmental Protection Agency power-plant rule that is intended to cut emissions by 32 percent over the next nine years, compared with 2005 levels. On immigration, Trump vowed to overturn Obama's executive actions to grant work permits to millions of undocumented immigrants, including more than 700,000 younger immigrants already benefiting from the program. A Trump administration could also drop the government's defense of legal challenges to his executive actions on immigration.

Trump has vowed to renegotiate other existing deals that are already in place.  [Complete transcript: President Obama's remarks on Trump's election]  Throughout his presidency, Obama was forced to pass legislation on party-line votes or to rely on executive actions after efforts to compromise with congressional Republicans failed. This approach has now left much of his agenda vulnerable, and in many cases, it exacerbates the country's political divide. Obama's top aides have spoken repeatedly of the need for a third term of Democratic control to cement the president's policies. On issues such as same-sex marriage, climate change and trade, they argued, he helped bring the country to a more progressive place and rejected the notion that Trump's election was a repudiation of those policies. ""An election is a comparison between two people and two candidates on the ballot. It's not an evaluation of who we are as a society,"" Jen Psaki, the White House communications director, in an interview earlier this week. Other administration officials insisted that the main force driving voter dissatisfaction was not economic dislocation but political gridlock and a broader revulsion with obstruction.  [Trump's victory has enormous consequences for the Supreme Court]  ""Washington doesn't work. But you know he's tried,"" said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the results before the election results came in. Some of the political advisers who have served the president and Clinton over the past decade expressed frustration with the election's outcome. David Plouffe, who had served as Obama's 2008 campaign manager and helped guide Clinton's campaign, had predicted in late September that the Democratic nominee had a ""100 percent chance of winning"" the election. ""I'm sorry everyone,"" he tweeted about 1 a.m. Wednesday. ""Had to talk to my kids. Wrong, and remarkably so. But the idea of our country has always been stronger than an election."" Obama in his remarks did his best to characterize the election returns as a normal event, even as it put his key initiatives over the past eight years in danger. ""The path that this country's taken has never been a straight line,"" he said. ""We zig and zag, and that's okay. . . . This incredible journey that we've been on, as Americans, will go on.""

You know nothing of politics. Your basketball players that's it & get paid millions. I almost wish hillary got elected so she could do NOTHING for blacks in the inner cities just like every single democratic president we've ever had including our first black president Obama."" Some comments, like these, merely extended the conversation. ""You said EXACTLY what I'm thinking. I have 2 girls (7 and 10). It's rough. Plus they studied the election at school and we're excited about Hillary. Even voted for her in the school's mock election. American white men didn't want a woman, especially after taking direction from a black man for 8yrs."" ""I mean sure he earns millions but imagine how he feels playing for so called 'fans' that probably voted for trump and only like him when he does good but as soon as he does bad in a game everyone hates him. Put yourself in his shoes. Doesn't matter if he's a basketball player or not He can say what he wants and I support him."" There were, though, some positive responses: ""Tell that sweet girl that she can still be our first female president!"" ""Tell her to reach for the sky's and be your own boss."" ""Tell her she can be whatever she can be whatever she wants to be, qualifications no longer matter to get the job/career you want. Precedents have been set, and it's up to us a people to use them to OUR advantage. We need to unify and then conquer."" ""A lot of you people are so ignorant it's ridiculous. any father in their right mind would be having the same concerns for their daughters best interest. Real men real fathers real leaders and male role models feel this way."" The NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers are scheduled to visit President Barack Obama at the White House on Thursday."

McAuliffe, how was Election Day? Not bad, in fact.	"  RICHMOND -- Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe had a surprisingly good night Tuesday if you set aside one crushing personal loss: His longtime friend and political ally, Hillary Clinton, is not going to the White House. For one thing, McAuliffe (D) delivered Virginia for Clinton. The former secretary of state won the swing state by 4.8 points -- a margin smaller than Barack Obama's in 2008 (6.3 points) but bigger than his in 2012 (four points). A ballot measure that McAuliffe opposed, which would have enshrined the state's right-to-work laws in the state constitution, was defeated. The governor said he supports the existing law banning mandatory union membership as a condition of employment, but he saw no need to put that into the constitution. He had recorded a robo-call against the measure. And McAuliffe protege Levar Stoney came out on top in the race for Richmond mayor. McAuliffe's former secretary of the commonwealth, Stoney had been dismissed as the Jeb Bush of that race, with hefty financial backing thanks to McAuliffe connections but little support in polls. Stoney had been widely expected not only to lose but to lose to a disgraced former state delegate, Joe Morrissey, who less than two years ago served jail time on charges related to his relationship with his 17-year-old receptionist. As it turned out, Morrissey came in third in a crowded field. Stoney could still face a runoff with businessman Jack Berry, who finished second. In all, those wins are perhaps small comfort to a man with deep personal and professional ties to a Democratic dynasty upended by Republican President-elect Donald Trump.  [Clinton squeaks by Trump in Virginia]  Had Clinton won, McAuliffe would have gotten to fill the U.S. Senate seat occupied by her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). And surely he would have played some role in the new administration, even if he stayed in Richmond, as promised, through the end of his term in January 2018. Commerce secretary? Cushy ambassadorship? At the very least, he would have reprised his role as ""first friend,"" enjoying uncommon access to the leader of the free world. As Virginia went blue Tuesday, McAuliffe addressed cheering Clinton supporters at what was supposed to have been a victory party in Northern Virginia. He had planned to hop on a chartered plane to Clinton's New York party later that night. But as returns from other states started going Trump's way, he decided to stay put, spending the night at his house in McLean. ""The Governor's top priorities going into last night were turning Virginia's presidential electors blue, helping Levar Stoney get elected Mayor and defeating the attempt to write Virginia's right-to-work law into the constitution,"" McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy said by email Wednesday. ""While he is obviously disappointed in the outcome of the presidential election nationwide, he is proud of the statement Virginians made yesterday and looks forward to working with leaders on both sides of the aisle, including President-elect Trump, to build on the progress we are making here in the Commonwealth.""

(Eric Gay/AP)  ""People are going to know if you voted or not,"" comedian Amy Schumer warns in a video urging people to vote. ""Your voting history is public record."" Anyone can look up whether you cast a ballot, Schumer cautions. ""Even our parents."" Add to that list: Your Tinder dates. On this blog, we've published several essays where a date's political allegiance has been a deal-breaker. But for some singles, sitting out an election is the bigger deal-breaker. According to a 2016 Match survey of more than 5,500 unmarried Americans, 27 percent of singles would not date someone who didn't vote. This is a larger share than those who said that they wouldn't date someone of a different political party; 79 percent of singles don't have a problem dating across the aisle. And women are 79 percent more likely not to date someone who didn't vote, the survey found. Overall, singles seem to respect their dates' privacy over whom they're supporting. In the Match study, 77 percent said they do not expect their date to divulge whom they voted for. The survey also found that, when you're just getting to know someone, talking about politics is not as taboo as you might think: 80 percent of singles would talk about religion, gun control, immigration and marriage equality on the first date. And if that political banter is good, it increases your chances -- by 91 percent -- of getting a second date.

Three employees of Strategic Allied Consulting, a firm owned by conservative operative Nathan Sproul, pleaded guilty in Florida four years ago to felony charges related to altering and destroying scores of voter registration forms. There were no formal actions against the firm. Yet recent federal campaign finance reports reviewed by The Associated Press show Sproul is now back on the RNC's payroll, this time with a firm named Lincoln Strategy Group. That's a renamed version of his former firm Sproul & Associates, an Arizona-based company that was investigated for alleged voter registration misconduct in Nevada and Oregon. Although Sproul was never charged in the 2012 Florida case, GOP officials and Mitt Romney's presidential campaign considered the charges against his employees alone serious enough to fire his company in 2012. The chairman of the RNC said this week he didn't know Sproul's firm has been rehired. Neither the Republican Party nor the Trump campaign would discuss the specifics of the work Sproul or the firm is doing and in what states.  ""We have zero tolerance for any threat to the integrity of elections,"" Sean Spicer, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, told the AP in September 2012. ""When we were informed of an alleged incident, we immediately cut all ties to the company."" The RNC paid Sproul's company a total of $1.2 million in October for get-out-the-vote efforts. Records show Donald J. Trump For President Inc. paid another $600,000 to Lincoln Strategy on Oct. 27. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said he didn't know his organization was still doing business with Sproul. RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to provide specific details about Sproul's current work for the party. In past years, the RNC's full spending with Sproul's firms wasn't disclosed in campaign finance reports until after the election.  ""This is a coordinated expenditure with the campaign,"" Walters said, referring to the practice of political parties working with campaigns to raise and spend money. ""Similar to 2012, coordinated expenditure decisions are joint decisions, the RNC does not have sole decision authority."" Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said: ""This is a firm that we work with to execute door knocking."" Sproul, 44, said in a statement Friday that his companies had been ""cleared of any and all wrongdoing,"" and that any past accusations against his firms had been ""utterly discredited.""  ""Lincoln Strategy upholds the strictest anti-fraud standards,"" Sproul said. ""Because of our strict standards, our company immediately refers people to law enforcement and election officials when there is any indication of improper activity."" In the 2012 Florida case, three people identified by authorities as employees of Strategic Allied Consulting pleaded guilty to forging voter registrations, saying their supervisors had demanded it. But after a two-year investigation, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it found no evidence that Sproul's firm specifically directed its employees to turn in the faked forms. Strategic Allied Consulting reportedly employed about 2,000 people in Florida for the 2012 election. On Sunday, Sproul sought to clarify that those registering voters for his firm were contract workers, rather than his direct employees.  ""They were all employees of a staffing firm that Strategic contracted with,"" Sproul said, though he told AP he could not recall the name of the other company involved. Sproul also claimed his firm reported the suspect workers to law enforcement, though Florida authorities said at the time their investigation was triggered when the fraudulent registrations were flagged by suspicious elections officials in Palm Beach County. A search of online help-wanted ads shows Lincoln Strategy Group is now hiring in North Carolina, Colorado, Missouri and other swing states, offering ""Great Pay!"" to those available to go door-to-door to canvass voters for conservative causes.  ""Make America Great Again $20/HR Canvassing,"" reads a recent ad posted on Craigslist in Raleigh, North Carolina, offering full-time and part-time jobs through Election Day. A veteran Republican operative from Arizona, Sproul has worked closely with dozens of state and national GOP campaigns, specializing in organizing voter registration drives and outreach efforts targeting evangelical Christians and social conservatives. He told AP his companies have employed more than 10,000 grassroots campaign workers over the last decade. Operating under numerous corporate names, Sproul's firms also have a history of allegations of voter registration fraud. In a 2012 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Sproul acknowledged he set up multiple companies at the RNC's request, because the Republican Party wanted to obscure its ties with his firms. ___ Associated Press writer Steve Peoples in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP writers Michael Biesecker at www.Twitter.com/mbieseck and Jeff Horwitz at www.Twitter.com/jeffhorwitz Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
