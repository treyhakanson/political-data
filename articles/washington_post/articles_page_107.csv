Stephen Rapp, a former ambassador at large for war crimes issues in the Obama administration told The Associated Press he considers it ""highly, highly unlikely"" an American will be prosecuted at the world's first international court with global reach, based in The Hague, Netherlands. Rapp's comments came a day after the ICC's chief prosecutor said in a report that U.S. forces in Afghanistan may have committed the war crime of torture when interrogating detainees, opening the possibility of Americans being prosecuted even though their country is not a member of the court.  ""Members of US armed forces appear to have subjected at least 61 detained persons to torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity on the territory of Afghanistan between 1 May 2003 and 31 December 2014,"" according to the report issued late Monday by Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's office. Bensouda didn't comment on the report Tuesday. The report added that CIA operatives may have subjected at least 27 detainees in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania to ""torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity and/or rape"" between December 2002 and March 2008. Prosecutors said they will decide ""imminently"" whether to seek authorization to open a full-scale investigation in Afghanistan that could lead to war crimes charges. The report also highlighted that Afghan military, security and police forces likely committed war crimes by mistreating detainees, and that the Taliban killed thousands of civilians and committed many other atrocities. A key hurdle that ICC prosecutors would have to cross if they target Americans for investigation is a legal doctrine known as complementarity. The ICC is a court of last resort that steps in to take cases that nations are unwilling or unable to prosecute. That means that if American authorities have conducted serious investigations, the complementarity doctrine would block ICC jurisdiction.  ""The U.S. can prevent ICC prosecutions by undertaking a good-faith investigation and prosecution in its own military or civilian courts,"" said Prof. Michael Scharf, dean of the Case Western Reserve University School of Law. The ICC report acknowledged that U.S. authorities have conducted dozens of investigations and court-martial cases and says ICC prosecutors are seeking further clarifications on their scope before deciding whether any American cases would be admissible at the ICC.  ""The ICC would have to conclude that these have been incomplete and insufficient before it can commence formal proceedings,"" Scharf said. In a reaction Monday, State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the U.S. doesn't believe an ICC investigation is ""warranted or appropriate.""  ""The United States is deeply committed to complying with the law of war, and we have a robust national system of investigation and accountability that more than meets international standards,"" Trudeau said. ICC prosecutors also say investigations are reportedly underway in Poland, Romania and Lithuania -- all signatories to the Rome Statute -- into possible crimes at CIA detention facilities in those countries. Rapp said that based on the large number of investigations and other probes in the U.S., ""there is, I think, a strong argument to be made that there was sufficient process."" Rapp, who left the State Department last year and is now a distinguished fellow at The Hague Institute for Global Justice think tank, said that even if judges do authorize an investigation, its early focus would likely be on Taliban crimes, which are far more widespread and deadly. Scharf, meanwhile, said that another potential barrier is the relatively small number of victims of the alleged U.S. torture.  ""The ICC's jurisdiction is limited to widespread and systematic acts of torture and other crimes against humanity,"" he said. ""As an international court, the ICC is designed to focus only on the greatest cases of atrocity in the world."" Established in 2002, the International Criminal Court is the world's first permanent court set up to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. More than 120 countries around the world are members, but superpowers including the United States, Russia and China have not signed up. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Rome treaty that established the court on Dec. 31, 2000, but President George W. Bush renounced the signature, citing fears that Americans would be unfairly prosecuted for political reasons. Even though the United States is not a member of the court, Americans could still face prosecution at its headquarters in The Hague if they commit crimes within its jurisdiction in a country that is a member, such as Afghanistan, and are not prosecuted at home. Param-Preet Singh, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, welcomed the possibility of the court delivering justice to a troubled nation where it is rare.  ""The ICC prosecutor's report highlights some of the worst abuses committed by government forces and the Taliban in Afghanistan, where impunity remains the norm,"" she said. ""The link to possible war crimes by the Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. military shows that the ICC is prepared to investigate cases involving those who may otherwise seem beyond the reach of justice."" ____ AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee and AP National Security Writer Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report.

Here are your options.	   (Karen Bleier/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  Kristin Surak is an American professor who teaches politics at the University of London and is writing a book about investor citizenship. Donald Trump's move to the White House has left many Americans considering a move of another sort: out of their homeland. According to a Morning Consult/Vox poll, more than 25 percent of the populace thought of retreating to more attractive ground in the event of a Trump win. Fortunately for them, there are some options. For a long-term exit plan, ancestry is the easiest and cheapest route. Direct descendants of an Italian male citizen (or female if born after 1948) can apply for Italian citizenship -- no language or cultural tests required. It's even possible to register and collect the documents at an embassy or consulate abroad before traveling there. Irish grandparents or Polish great-grandparents may supply another route available to many Americans, if you have the right paperwork. And if Nazis stripped your Jewish ancestors of German citizenship, Germany and the rest of the European Union may be open to you as well. Indeed, with a E.U. passport in hand, you are free to live in any of the member states, including the United Kingdom (at least for the moment). For the elderly, Trump's promise to end Obamacare is of particular concern. Where can one go that's far enough away, yet close enough to home? Canada, unfortunately, protects its publicly funded medical system with strict laws that limit an influx of the aging. Mexico, however, is more generous. Retirees with an average bank balance of $25,000 and at least $1,500 in post-tax income every month can easily apply for a residence permit. In Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela and Chile, the hurdle is even lower -- $1,000 to $1,200 in monthly income. Island lovers might cast their gaze toward the Caribbean, where a number of countries boast citizenship-by-investment programs. Dominica is the cheapest option for a single applicant; anyone can become a citizen by donating $100,000 to the government, and the new passport brings with it the right to live in any of the 20 countries comprising the Caribbean Community. Those thinking of leaving Trump's America might also wonder about housing. Indeed, this can be the ticket to securing residence rights. Buy a home in Greece worth at $275,000, and you qualify for a residence permit. The same holds true in Spain and Portugal for slightly more. Purchase a sizable holiday villa in Antigua, Saint Kitts, Saint Lucia or Grenada, and a passport is yours. Those willing to up the ante might consider Malta or Cyprus, which offer citizenship in exchange for a real estate investment and economic contributions. But the price tag for these E.U. countries is much higher: $1.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively. You might do better finding a male Italian ancestor. A world of possibilities lies open to those looking further afield. There is residence in Tonga for a verified annual income of about $4,600, retirement in Thailand if you can prove a monthly revenue stream of $1,800, or in South Africa for $2,600. Those hoping for a return on their money can secure papers by investing $75,000 in the Philippines -- or just $30,000 in Peru and $12,000 in Gambia. Identity politics can structure options as well. Some environmentalists might worry about Trump's promise to end U.S. support to United Nations programs to combat global warming. For them, there is Panama, which grants a residence permit in exchange for the purchase of five hectares (roughly 12 acres) of land in a government reforestation project. Muslim Americans, concerned about personal safety, might consider Indonesia, where residence is available to applicants with a minimal monthly income and an Indonesian housekeeper in their employ. Leaving the United States, however, doesn't mean giving up U.S. citizenship, which is a lengthy and costly process. The basic fee runs more than $2,000, and the wealthiest of those who choose this route face an even heftier bill, one equivalent to the taxes they would pay if their global assets were sold on the spot. And even if Trump prefers to avoid the IRS, Americans abroad still must file and pay tax on earnings over $100,000. But maybe it will be worth it -- at least for those who have the possibility of leaving. Not everyone has the ancestry or the funds to seal an escape. The unequal access to exit options is perhaps a fitting reflection of the United States today. The schisms that underwrote the vehemence of the election -- inequalities in birthright and bank accounts -- aren't really all that different.

The rejection, apparently based on lack of consultation, came in a motion Tuesday moved by Senate leader Ali Ndume and seconded by minority leader Godswill Akpabio. The senate received more than 250 petitions against the proposed political appointees. Nigeria has been without ambassadors in places like Washington, London, Beijing and Brussels for more than a year. Tuesday's move comes after the Senate refused Buhari's request to pursue $30 billion in foreign loans -- a surprising rejection from a legislature controlled by the president's party. It highlights fractures in the coalition which, in the 2015 elections, brought Buhari to become the first Nigerian to defeat a sitting president. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Stalwart allies of the United States in Europe and Asia reeled with shock and aversion, even as populists and dictators cheered and U.S. adversaries gloated. To judge from foreign assessments, the United States is about to place itself at the head of a global, populist, quasi-authoritarian movement that will have better relations with Russia than with liberal leaders of the European Union. We hope that turns out to be unfounded. Mr. Trump has offered some early reassurance in phone calls to key U.S. allies: He reportedly reaffirmed the U.S. defense commitments to Japan and South Korea, and, according to Downing Street, he told British Prime Minister Theresa May that the ""special relationship"" between Washington and London ""would go from strength to strength."" Mr. Trump's pledge to South Korean President Park Geun-hye to be ""steadfast and strong"" in protecting against the threat from North Korea, as reported by Ms. Park's office, was particularly constructive, given Mr. Trump's campaign rhetoric about withdrawing U.S. support and encouraging South Korea and Japan to develop their own nuclear weapons. In light of this outreach, some of the initial reactions from U.S. allies in Europe looked impolitic. Germany's deputy chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, declared that ""Trump is the trailblazer of a new authoritarian and chauvinist international movement. . . . They want a rollback to the bad old times in which women belonged by the stove or in bed, gays in jail and unions at best at the side table."" Mr. Gabriel was referring in part to populist nationalists in Europe, including in Germany, who hope the U.S. election will lend momentum to their movements. Yet such rhetoric could only make such a political alignment more likely, by souring Mr. Trump on mainstream European leaders such as Mr. Gabriel.  That's not to say that U.S. allies should seek to excuse or appease Mr. Trump; principled engagement with this U.S. president will be essential. That's why we were heartened to see the statement by Mr. Gabriel's superior, Chancellor Angela Merkel, which reaffirmed that ""partnership with the United States is and will remain a keystone of German foreign policy"" -- and then carefully set out some conditions. ""Germany and America are bound by common values -- democracy, freedom, as well as respect for the rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin color, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views,"" Ms. Merkel's statement said. ""It is based on these values that I wish to offer close cooperation.""  There is encouragement in that for Mr. Trump to build a partnership with Europe's strongest nation, in spite of some sparring between him and Ms. Merkel during the campaign. But there is also an implicit warning that Germany's leader will call Mr. Trump out if he violates liberal democratic norms. It would be well if the president-elect heard that respectful but firm message from more of the West's leaders as he prepares to take office. The United States has long worked to press other countries to respect human rights. Its closest friends should now be prepared, if necessary, to give it a dose of its own medicine.

Zhao Liping, 64, fatally shot his 28-year-old mistress, identified only by her surname Li, and then burned her body, according to a statement from the Intermediate People's Court in the northern city of Taiyuan. The court didn't mention a motive for the March 2015 murder, but media reports said Zhao had suspected Li was planning to report him for taking bribes. Zhao was also convicted of possessing firearms and explosives, both of which are strictly regulated in China. Zhao presided over police affairs for the sprawling Inner Mongolia region from 2005 to 2012 and was a vice chairman of its ceremonial political advisory body before his retirement. Zhao used his position in the sparsely populated but resource rich region from 2008 to 2010 to ""seek benefits"" when promoting people and illegally received 24 million yuan ($3.5 million), the court statement said. Death sentences in China are automatically reviewed by the nation's highest court. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  With Donald Trump on the verge of securing 270 electoral votes and winning the presidency, it's not too soon to consider how so many political observers, so many polls and so many politicians got the 2016 presidential race so wrong. As for the polling, if it makes every professional pollster feel better, the Trump team confesses that its own numbers showed Trump losing. The Hill reports a Trump senior campaign source revealed the campaign's own internal polls, just as the exit polls did, had Trump down and out. While the popular vote count eventually may come within the margin of error for public polling, critical state polling was far enough off in multiple states to make a very big difference. The polling industry in the United States and elsewhere (Colombia's peace referendum, Brexit) looks a lot like that dumpster fire we have been using to describe the election. Pollsters missed the intensity Trump was able to instill in his voters and Hillary Clinton's failure to do the same. The Post reported: The composition of the 2016 electorate was similar to that of the 2012 voting population, according to preliminary exit poll data. But Trump was performing exceptionally well among white voters, while Clinton was doing less well among nonwhite voters than fellow Democrat President Obama did four years ago. In general, a pattern appeared to be taking hold across a number of key battleground states late Tuesday: In places where Obama won, Clinton appeared to be winning as well -- but often by significantly less. Where Romney won, Trump won, too -- but his margins were much bigger. We will spend weeks and months on an array of questions, including:  Did voters embrace Trump because of his racist, xenophobic rhetoric or despite it? Did FBI Director James B. Comey's bizarrely vague and precedent-breaking letter remind voters just in the nick of time of Clinton's propensity to bend rules and avoid candor? Have voters lost the capacity to differentiate between fact or fiction, or do they no longer care, assuming all politicians are liars? How could President Obama, whose popularity is extraordinarily high, fail to convince voters in an improving economy to stay the course? Was the 2016 election a reaction to Democratic excesses, cultural snobbery or some of both?  Republicans will conclude that it is their populist message, not a revulsion against the specific opposing nominee, that accounts for their success. How Republicans govern and whether, as they kept assuring us they would, they act with restraint, will determine whether 2016 is a blip or a political realignment. It will, alas, only bolster their determination to pursue exclusionary policies and flaunt their biases. Democrats will be in for a good deal of soul-searching. The left-wing of the party will decry nominating a centrist and a Wall Street favorite, perhaps looking to more radical candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for leadership. It's now the Democrats who may have to decide how to oppose an agenda so many of their constituent groups find offensive and dangerous. After eight years decrying the opposition party's refusal to look for common ground, they will devise a strategy to preserve as much of the Obama ""legacy"" as possible. And what of that legacy? Obama's two signature accomplishments -- the Iran deal and Obamacare -- are now at risk. For nearly half the country, this is a stunning, disorienting experience. Their assumptions about political decorum, public civility and American civic values have been shredded. Many will face a country they hardly recognize. They fear Trump is serious about his assorted reactionary ideas. They worry about a future of heightened divisiveness, anger and intolerance. We are in uncharted territory. For those of us who are dumbfounded by the result, humility should be the order of the day. We know far less about the country than we thought."

At several points this year, Democratic leaders predicted that Donald Trump's presidential nomination would prompt an anti-Republican wave that would sweep 20 or more Democrats into the House. Instead, the wave went against Democrats. They will be lucky to net more than a half-dozen seats. Democrats seized four redrawn, GOP-held districts in Florida and Virginia and ousted incumbents in a few more. But they could not unseat Republicans in key districts across the country, including suburban seats that they thought they could win easily with Trump on the ticket. In the Northern Virginia suburbs, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) fended off a strong challenge that generated $6 million in television spending in the past week alone. Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R) handily won a Miami-area district that Democrats targeted for months. And Rep. Mike Coffman (R) was able to separate himself from Trump in a diverse pocket of the Denver suburbs.     Democrats appear to have an outside chance of taking back the House, which they lost after the 2010 election. View Graphic     Democrats appear to have an outside chance of taking back the House, which they lost after the 2010 election.  Democrats edged out victories in a few districts. Reps. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.) and Bob Dold (R-Ill.) lost, and Democrats claimed a pair of GOP-held seats in Nevada. In New Hampshire's first district, Democrat Carol Shea-Porter defeated Republican incumbent Frank Guinta. But they struck out in many more districts, including six Republican-held seats in New York and two in suburban Minneapolis. Top Democrats have sought in recent days to temper expectations that a double-digit presidential win by Hillary Clinton might translate into House gains of 20 or more seats, taking a major portion out of their current 30-seat deficit. Several Democrats blamed FBI Director James B. Comey's decision late last month to disclose in a letter to Congress new evidence in the agency's investigation of Clinton's email practices for swinging close races toward Republicans. Clinton's lead in published polls dipped after the revelation; House results tend to be closely correlated to the presidential results.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters Tuesday that Comey ""became the leading Republican political operative in the country, wittingly or unwittingly,"" by intervening less than two weeks before Election Day. ""This is like a molotov cocktail thrown into a very explosive arena,"" she said at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. David Wasserman, House editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said there is evidence that Republicans benefited from Comey's intervention.     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted View Graphic     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted  ""Republican voters may have come home anyway, even without that letter, but it could help save Republicans five to 10 House seats,"" he said. But by midnight, with Trump appearing to claim an advantage in the presidential race, the talk of Comey's role suddenly rang hollow. Republicans said Democrats were scrambling for explanations after several missteps and faulty assumptions. ""I just think that's starting to sound like an excuse,"" Rep. Steve Stivers (Ohio), a deputy chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said. Stivers pointed to a number of Democratic recruiting missteps, strong campaigns of GOP incumbents and, perhaps most crucially, a competitive presidential race. ""In the places where it needed to be close . . . it got close and stayed close,"" he said. Stivers pointed to a closely contested seat in eastern Iowa, where Rep. Rod Blum (R) hung on to a traditionally Democratic seat with the help of the NRCC and national Republican super PACs. He also pointed to the Omaha-area seat of Rep. Brad Ashford, one of several Democrats whom Republicans think they have a chance to unseat. Ashford trailed slightly in late returns Wednesday morning. And the Democratic-held Florida seat vacated by Rep. Patrick Murphy -- who lost his bid for the Senate on Tuesday night to Sen. Marco Rubio (R) -- was claimed by Republican Brian Mast. Early Wednesday, Republicans still had opportunities to flip two Democratic seats in rural Minnesota. Democrats also targeted four GOP incumbents in California, including Rep. Darrell Issa, who occupied a high-profile role as chairman of the Oversight Committee during the early years of the Obama administration. Issa held a small lead in early West Coast returns, and other California Republicans appeared headed for victory. The limited GOP losses could be a major boon for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), who has come under intense pressure from fellow Republicans because of his careful handling of Trump's candidacy. Ryan has crisscrossed the country on behalf of embattled incumbents, raising roughly $50 million to preserve Republicans' majority. A single-digit paring of his majority could give him better standing within his conference to fend off a revolt from the party's populist wing. Republicans' biggest obstacle turned out to be a pair of court-ordered redistrictings. In Florida, former governor Charlie Crist (D) unseated Rep. David Jolly (R) in a St. Petersburg-area district, and former Orlando police chief Val Demings (D) won in another redrawn district that now favors Democrats. In another Orlando district, GOP Rep. John L. Mica, a 24-year incumbent, lost to Democratic newcomer Stephanie Murphy.  In Virginia, state Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D) won his bid to become the second African American in the state's congressional delegation, joining Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott (D).  Rep. Steve Israel (N.Y.), a former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman, said that Democrats will be unlikely to seriously contend for the House majority until the next national redistricting -- ahead of the 2022 elections. After Republicans won sweeping gains in 2010, they used their new advantages in statehouses to draw congressional lines in the GOP's favor. ""They seized control of the maps, and in this climate, they fortified themselves against catastrophic losses,"" Israel said. In 2012, Democratic House candidates garnered 1.4 million more votes than Republican candidates did, but the GOP won 33 more seats. The Cook Political Report's Wasserman said that partisan redistricting explains only some of the Democrats' poor showing, but the party has only one immediate paths to the majority otherwise. ""If they can't get 218 [seats] this year, it's going to be almost impossible to get 218 in 2018 if Hillary Clinton prevails,"" he said. ""Democrats' best shot at a House majority in 2018 involves Donald Trump winning today.""  "

There, the emerging crop of Republican presidential candidates jockeyed to impress the millionaires and billionaires who make up the Koch political network. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas jetted in from a forum in Iowa, joined by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. The Koch meeting was the beginning of a busy circuit of donor retreats held in exclusive locales such as Palm Beach, Fla., and Sea Island, Ga., that defined the early months of 2015 -- an indicator of the new dominance the super-rich would have in the presidential contest. In the end, there would be plenty of big checks to go around. And rich benefactors, it turned out, would have a limited ability to keep their chosen candidates aloft. But the all-consuming pursuit of mega-donors had a deeper, more fundamental effect on the 2016 presidential race. The magnet of six- and seven-figure contributions tugged at the early White House front-runners in both parties, reshaping their political strategies and their early priorities. It drew them away from the campaign trail, leaving them vulnerable to the fiercely populist mood gripping voters -- and to a candidate on the GOP side, Donald Trump, uniquely positioned to harness that anger.   Supporters cheer outside as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses a campaign rally early Nov. 7 in Leesburg, Va. (Molly Riley/AFP/Getty Images)  ""It sent the message to the public, much more so than usual, that there was a wealth primary and that the candidates were being selected by a handful of wealthy kingmakers,"" said Trevor Potter, president of the Campaign Legal Center, which seeks to limit money flowing into elections. ""And it affected the candidates, in the sense that that became what they were focused on."" The lure of huge dollars set off an early fundraising stampede, led by former Florida governor Jeb Bush. He helped raise more than $100 million for an allied super PAC in 2015, all while maintaining that he had not yet decided whether to run. ""Maybe one of the worst things to happen to Jeb was his campaign's amazing ability to raise big money early,"" said GOP strategist Ana Navarro, who worked in Bush's gubernatorial administration and opposes Trump. ""In some ways, it worked against him. It reinforced all the establishment stereotypes."" Bush's mammoth money operation prompted rivals such as Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton to jump-start their efforts to secure major donors. In doing so, they seized on the new legal pathways that allow huge sums to flow into super PACs and political parties. In any other year, a robust war chest would have been seen as a sign of a candidate's strength. But Trump on the right and Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) on the left quickly turned their rivals' financial assets against them, tapping into a restive electorate disgusted with the powerful elite.  [Voters are mad about mega-donors, and it's helping Trump and Sanders]  Trump made his independence from wealthy donors a centerpiece of his bid, deriding his opponents as ""puppets"" of patrons such as industrialist Charles Koch and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.   Democratic U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debate in New York on April 14. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)  ""Should I take the money?"" he asked fans at a rally in suburban Atlanta in October 2015. The crowd responded with a loud, ""Noooooo!"" ""No? No?"" Trump repeated. ""No!"" came back the booming reply. It was a warning: This is going to be a different kind of election.  Trump had the luxury to exploit his rivals' dependence on big donors. The billionaire developer was sustained by not only his personal financial resources but also the many hours of free media airtime his provocative candidacy commanded. ""This cycle was a good illustration that money is one tool that impacts public opinion, but the media have a larger megaphone than any campaign is able to buy -- and candidates and the dynamics of the field matter,"" said Charlie Spies, a Republican campaign finance lawyer who served as counsel for Bush's super PAC. When the 2016 race kicked off, it initially seemed that one of the most valuable weapons would be an outside group stocked with big money. For the first time, personalized super PACs  became the norm in a presidential campaign , run by the candidates' close advisers.  There were supposed to be barriers, of course. Candidates could ask donors to contribute only up to $5,000 to a super PAC. And a campaign could not direct the paid-advertising strategy of a big-money group.  But with little threat of enforcement from the divided Federal Election Commission, candidates  edged closer than ever  to their outside allies.  Long-shot contenders such as then-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina and former Texas governor Rick Perry relied on super PACs to effectively subsidize their efforts on the ground, helping draw out their campaigns. Bush set the pace as an aggressive pioneer, blessing the creation of two PACs in January 2015. He immediately set off on a fundraising tear across the country for the groups, headlining events that cost as much as $100,000 a person. The money was piling up so quickly that, at one point, his team asked supporters to hold off giving more than $1 million. By June, when Bush finally announced that he was running, he had amassed more than $114 million to bolster his candidacy. He shrugged off questions about whether he should have spent so much time fundraising. ""You might as well front-load it if you can,"" the former governor said at the Koch summer donor seminar. But his unprecedented haul papered over a fundamental weakness: Bush did not have a broad base of support. His allied super PAC, Right to Rise USA, had raised $103 million of the total. Meanwhile, small donors ponied up just $368,020 to his campaign.  Brad Deutsch, a campaign finance lawyer who served as lead counsel to Sanders's campaign, said the 2016 election has exposed how super PACs can serve as ""a trap for candidates who aren't popular to begin with."" ""They can make up for it by having a few people give them money that will propel them,"" he said. ""But at the end of the day, they haven't been forced to figure out how to connect with the people they need to connect with."" Still, the GOP super-PAC embrace rattled Clinton, who decided to speed up her fundraising schedule out of fear that the Federal Election Commission would not rein in Bush and other Republicans, according to hacked emails and memos posted by WikiLeaks. ""Use this to scare our people into giving bigger sums,"" campaign chairman John Podesta suggested to Clinton and other top advisers in May 2015. Several weeks later, campaign vice chairman Huma Abedin noted that ""we are looking to add more fundraisers in the last 2 weeks in June to get her to a higher number for this quarter,"" adding, ""It is doable, albeit a little crazy."" The Clinton campaign also urged donors to contribute to two allied super PACs, including one that coordinated directly with the campaign. And later that year, officials set up a joint fundraising committee with dozens of state parties that accepted six-figure checks. The tactics helped bring in $1.3 billion to support Clinton's bid. But they also exposed one of her biggest vulnerabilities: her long, deep ties to a network of rich supporters.   [How mega-donors helped raise $1 billion for Hillary Clinton]  It was easy ammunition for Sanders, who was powered by an unprecedented online fundraising operation that vacuumed up millions in small donations. ""I am very proud I do not have a super PAC,"" he jabbed at Clinton during a Democratic debate in January. ""I do not want Wall Street's money. I'll rely on the middle class and working families.""  In the general election, Trump picked up that critique, repeatedly accusing Clinton of being corrupt and taking orders from her contributors. He neglected to mention his own billionaire backers -- which by then included Adelson -- or the array of super PACs that cropped up to support him. ""Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors,"" he tweeted in August. ""#ImWithYou."" Ultimately, the 2016 candidates who lasted the longest -- Trump, Cruz, Clinton and Sanders -- were sustained by robust small-donor bases. And all that big money that dazzled the White House hopefuls at the beginning of the race? Alone, it just wasn't enough. ""Voters want more than just ads. They want to talk to you,"" Walker said in a radio interview in June 2015 as he was preparing to jump into the race. ""You can have all the money in the world, but if your message isn't connecting, I think at some point, large sums of money become a disadvantage."" Three months later, the Wisconsin governor had dropped out. His allied super PAC still had more than $18 million in the bank.  "

State by state, district by district, neighborhood by neighborhood, candidates and campaigners are making their last pitch for Congress, state legislatures, governor's offices, ballot questions, judgeships, city councils and lots more. A nationwide look at important, interesting and occasionally odd matters that go before voters on Tuesday: ALABAMA Alabama voters must decide on 14 statewide constitutional amendments affecting everything from funding for state parks and the age of public officeholders to beer. Yes, beer. The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board wants to require brewers to report the name, address, age and phone number from anyone who purchases beer at one of the state's craft breweries for off-premises consumption. Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is expected to easily win a sixth term. ___ ALASKA Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski is up for re-election, and the race has drawn not one but three foes: Democrat Ray Metcalfe, independent Margaret Stock, and Joe Miller, who upset Murkowski in the 2010 GOP primary only to then lose the general election in a historic write-in campaign. This time Miller is running as a Libertarian. ___ ARIZONA Eight years after losing his bid for president, Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain is running for re-election. McCain has publicly struggled with whether to support GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who called McCain a loser and criticized him for being captured during the Vietnam War. Marijuana is on the ballot; voters could legalize the drug for recreational use by adults. Minimum wage could rise to $12 an hour by 2020 under a separate ballot measure. Metro Phoenix Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America, is fighting for his job after a criminal indictment stemming from his immigration patrols. ___ ARKANSAS Arkansas could become the first Southern state to legalize medical marijuana, although a similar proposal lost by less than 30,000 votes a year ago, out of 1.3 million votes cast. Republicans are expected to hold all four of Arkansas' U.S. House seats. Democrats are fielding a candidate in only one district. ___ CALIFORNIA Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer's retirement creates a rare open seat, and for the first time in the modern era, no Republican will be on the ballot. Thanks to California's unusual primary system, in which the two top finishers from the June primary advance to the general election, voters will decide between two Democrats -- state Attorney General Kamala Harris and U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez. The statewide ballot has a whopping 17 propositions, the most on a single ballot since March 2000. There's a measure to legalize recreational marijuana and one requiring porn actors to wear condoms. Voters will weigh in twice on the death penalty. One measure would repeal capital punishment while another seeks to speed up the process. ___ COLORADO Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is running for re-election against a tea party-aligned opponent, conservative Darryl Glenn, who has struggled to raise funds after national party leaders refused to endorse his candidacy. In a hotly contested House race, Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman is facing a challenge from Democratic state Sen. Morgan Carroll in suburban Denver. The chief ballot questions would allow medical aid in dying and create a universal health care system within the state. ___ CONNECTICUT The five Democrats who make up the state's U.S. House delegation face re-election, including Rosa DeLauro, the longest serving member in the group who is seeking a 14th term. Dr. William Petit, whose wife and two daughters were murdered in a 2007 home invasion, is running as a Republican for the Legislature against state Rep. Betty Boukus, an 11-term Democrat who heads the powerful House bonding subcommittee. ___ DELAWARE Voters will elect a new congressional representative and a new governor, while Republicans are hoping to end years of Democratic rule in the General Assembly by regaining control of the state Senate. Democratic U.S. Rep. John Carney Jr. is making a second run for governor against Republican state Sen. Colin Bonini. Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester and Republican Hans Reigle are vying for the state's lone U.S. House seat. ___ DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Voters in the nation's capital will decide whether they want their city to become the 51st state. The measure, backed by Mayor Muriel Bowser, should pass easily, but that's probably as far as it goes. Congress would need to approve any such change and Republicans are unlikely to go along with it. With registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans by 12-1 in the city, statehood would tip the balance in the U.S. Senate with two more Democrats. ___ FLORIDA Florida voters will decide whether Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio gets a second term. They'll also pick at least eight new U.S. House members after districts were redrawn to comply with the state constitution, and will cast ballots on legalizing medical marijuana. Rubio faces Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, while ex-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist hopes to revive his political career -- now as a Democrat -- in a race against Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly in a St. Petersburg-area district. ___ GEORGIA Democrat Jim Barksdale and Libertarian Allen Buckley are challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, who seeks a third term. Barksdale, who owns an Atlanta investment firm, gave $3.5 million toward his first political campaign, but has struggled to get momentum against the well-known Isakson. Georgia voters also will decide on a constitutional amendment allowing the state to take over low-performing schools. ___ HAWAII Voters in Honolulu must make two separate choices after U.S. Rep. Mark Takai died in office: Someone to fill his seat for the remaining two months of his term, and someone to represent the district for the next two years. Voter confusion could lead to two different people winning the same seat, to serve two different terms. In heavily Democratic Hawaii, the only state Senate seat held by a Republican, Sam Slom, could flip. That would make Hawaii the first state in the nation to have a one-party legislative body since 1980. ___ IDAHO Republicans will dominate at the top of the ticket, leaving an open seat on Idaho's Supreme Court as the most competitive race. Twin Falls attorney Robyn Brody and Republican state Sen. Curt McKenzie are in a tight, nonpartisan race. ___ ILLINOIS Illinois is home to one of the most closely watched U.S. Senate races in the country, with Republican incumbent Mark Kirk and Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth. Kirk, a first-term senator, is considered one of the more vulnerable Republicans, and polls have indeed shown Duckworth with a comfortable lead. Wealthy Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has spent record amounts on down-ballot races in hopes of tilting the Democrat-leaning Legislature toward the GOP so he can press his own policy agenda in second half of his term. ___ INDIANA With Republican Gov. Mike Pence on the national ticket as Trump's running mate, the governor's office is up for grabs. And this is another state with a U.S. Senate race that will be crucial to determining party control. A former governor and U.S. senator, Democrat Evan Bayh, wants to return to the Senate and faces Republican U.S. Rep. Todd Young. Democrats are hoping to gain enough seats in the General Assembly to break the current Republican stranglehold. ___ IOWA Republican Charles Grassley is seeking a seventh U.S. Senate term and trying to retain a seat his party has held since 1957. Democrats are optimistic that their candidate, Patty Judge, can break that winning streak, given her previous elections to statewide office as agriculture secretary and lieutenant governor. Two of Iowa's four U.S. House races are expected to be especially competitive. ___ KANSAS Democrats are seeking to cut into Republican majorities in both houses of the Legislature and oust more allies of term-limited GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. Conservatives and abortion opponents are seeking to remove four Kansas Supreme Court justices in hopes of giving Brownback a chance to remake the court ahead of major abortion and school funding rulings. ___ KENTUCKY Voters will decide whether to send Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, who made an early run for the presidency, back to Washington for a second term. His Democratic opponent is Lexington Mayor Jim Gray. Voters also will determine whether the only legislative chamber in the South still controlled by Democrats remains so. Republicans need to pick up four seats to win a majority in the Kentucky House for the first time since 1920. ___ LOUISIANA Two dozen -- that's right, two dozen -- candidates are vying for an open seat in the U.S. Senate after incumbent David Vitter decided not to seek re-election. One of them is white supremacist David Duke, who is not among the top-tier candidates in polling. Because no candidate is likely to get the 50-percent-plus-one majority needed to win outright, the top vote-getters will head to a Dec. 10 runoff that could end up determining which party gains control of the U.S. Senate for the next two years. ___ MAINE Mainers will decide whether to make marijuana legal for everyone over age 21. Maine is one of nine states considering ballot questions on pot legalization for recreational or medicinal use. Another initiative would require background checks before the sale or transfer of firearms between people who aren't licensed dealers. And one would boost the hourly minimum wage from $7.50 to $12 by 2020. ___ MARYLAND Voters will pick a replacement for the popular Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring after 30 years in the U.S. Senate. U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a seven-term Democrat, is running against Kathy Szeliga, minority whip in the state House of Delegates. She has sought to portray Van Hollen as an insider of dysfunctional Washington. Baltimore will choose a new mayor. ___ MASSACHUSETTS Massachusetts voters will also vote on marijuana legalization, as well as a proposed expansion of charter schools. There are a handful of congressional contests, with Democratic U.S. Reps. Richard Neal, Niki Tsongas, Joe Kennedy, Stephen Lynch and William Keating all facing challengers. ___ MICHIGAN It's the Democrats' last shot to disrupt the GOP's agenda or Republicans will lead the Legislature all eight years of GOP Gov. Rick Snyder's tenure. At least a dozen GOP-held House districts -- half with incumbents, half open due to term limits -- will determine which party secures the minimum 56 seats needed. Democrats have targeted two GOP-held U.S. House districts, while two spots on the Michigan Supreme Court represent the most significant statewide races. ___ MINNESOTA A trio of competitive congressional races takes top billing in Minnesota. Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan will try to fend off a rematch challenge from Republican Stewart Mills to hang on to a northeastern Minnesota district that has been a liberal stronghold for decades. The result has been one of the most expensive House elections in the country. Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen will be defending his suburban Minneapolis seat, while the two parties jostle over another suburban district that opened with a top Republican's retirement. All 201 state House and Senate seats are on the ballot in an election to determine legislative majorities. Voters will also decide whether to hand off legislators' power to set their own pay to an independent council. ___ MISSISSIPPI All four of Mississippi's U.S. House members -- three Republicans and one Democrat -- are up for re-election. All are likely to prevail. Four of the nine state Supreme Court seats will also be filled, as will four of 10 seats on the state Court of Appeals. ___ MISSOURI Missouri voters will decide whether to send U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt to a second term, or choose Democratic challenger Jason Kander instead. It's a race that will help decide party control of the Senate, and polls have indicated a toss-up for months. Meanwhile, Missouri's contentious campaign for governor has been the nation's most expensive. Republican newcomer Eric Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, has campaigned largely on his military record, while Attorney General Chris Koster has endorsements from the Missouri Farm Bureau and National Rifle Association, which typically support Republicans. ___ MONTANA Popular Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock is up for a second term in the conservative-leaning state against software entrepreneur Greg Gianforte, who spent more than $5.6 million of his own money on his campaign. Incumbent U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking to hold off a determined challenge from Democrat Denise Juneau to maintain a two-decade Republican lock on Montana's sole House seat. Pot is also on the ballot, with a measure that would loosen many of the restrictions imposed on the state's medical marijuana program with a 2011 state law that limited marijuana providers to three patients each. ___ NEBRASKA Nebraska voters have the opportunity to reinstate the death penalty and reverse last year's decision by the Legislature. The citizen-led ballot measure has triggered millions in campaign spending. In one of the country's most competitive congressional races, Republicans are looking to defeat first-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, who promotes himself as a champion of bipartisanship. His opponent, Don Bacon, is a retired Air Force brigadier general who is running as a Washington outsider. ___ NEVADA Nevada is home to one of the most expensive U.S. Senate races in the country, featuring lots of TV ads about the seat being vacated by Democratic leader Harry Reid. The race is between U.S. Rep. Joe Heck, a Republican, and Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general trying to become the first Latina U.S. senator. Recreational marijuana is also on the ballot, raising the possibility of pot shops springing up near the Las Vegas Strip. ___ NEW HAMPSHIRE New Hampshire is a presidential swing state, and home to a tight U.S. Senate contest between Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. It's one of a half-dozen races that could help determine which party controls the Senate. Two members of the U.S. House, Republican Chris Sununu and Democrat Colin Van Ostern, are vying to replace Hassan as governor. __ NEW JERSEY One of the nastiest U.S. House races in the country this year has pitted a Republican incumbent, Rep. Scott Garrett, against Democrat Josh Gottheimer. In a district that stretches from wealthy New York City suburbs to the state's rural northwestern corner, the two candidates have called each other liars and engaged in a war of words and accusations to rival the presidential candidates. New Jersey voters will also decide on a proposed expansion of casino gambling. ___ NEW MEXICO There's little suspense at the top of the ticket, with all three U.S. House incumbents expected to be re-elected, so Republicans are focused on defending their narrow majority in the state House. The party took over in 2014, ending 60 years of Democratic control. The criminal conviction and resignation of former Secretary of State Dianna Duran in 2015, for embezzlement and money laundering related to her gambling addiction, has opened that office. The race is between Democrat Maggie Toulouse Oliver and Republican state lawmaker Nora Espinoza. ___ NEW YORK Voters will decide whether the Republican Party maintains control of the state Senate or Democrats secure total control of state government. The outcome is likely to come down to a handful of competitive races on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley. ___ NORTH CAROLINA As a focal point in battles over transgender rights and voter ID laws, North Carolina may be the state where social and ideological divisions are the most defining this election year. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory is in a tight race against Democrat Roy Cooper, the state's attorney general. Former state Rep. Deborah Ross is presenting a strong challenge to incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr in one of the most closely watched Senate races. ___ NORTH DAKOTA As this state's energy- and agriculture-dependent economy falters, voters will choose a new governor to lead it through increasingly troubled financial times. But with Republican Doug Burgum a heavy favorite in this reliably red state, five ballot measures may be of most interest. Among the most-watched will be a measure that would make it legal to possess up to 3 ounces of marijuana for medical purposes. ___ OHIO Early on, former Gov. Ted Strickland looked like one of the Democrats' best bets to flip a U.S. Senate seat in his party's favor. He's running again Republican incumbent Sen. Rob Portman. Then outside groups spent more than $50 million to beat Strickland, who also lost key union endorsements and was up against a formidable voter outreach and turnout effort by Portman. Now the seat looks pretty safe for the GOP. ___ OKLAHOMA Oklahoma voters will be watching a ballot issue that targets the state's chronically low teacher salaries and one that would enshrine the death penalty in the state constitution, even as executions remain on hold after mistakes in two recent lethal injections. ___ OREGON A Republican is threatening to win statewide office for the first time in many years, in a battle for secretary of state that is the hottest in Oregon. Democrat Brad Avakian is running ads saying his GOP rival is ""extreme like Trump."" Republican Dennis Richardson has racked up endorsements from numerous newspapers and even from two prominent members of Avakian's own party. ___ PENNSYLVANIA Since 1948, no Democrat has won the White House without winning Pennsylvania. There's also a hot U.S. Senate race between Democratic challenger Katie McGinty and Republican incumbent Pat Toomey, who is among the most vulnerable Republicans as the GOP struggles to retain its majority. Spending on that campaign is on track to hit $140 million. ___ RHODE ISLAND Voters in Rhode Island, a state that has seen its share of political corruption, will decide whether to expand the authority of the state's ethics commission. They'll also be asked whether to allow a new casino. ___ SOUTH CAROLINA: Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Scott , the South's first black senator since Reconstruction, is running for his first full term. He was appointed to the seat in 2013 following the resignation of Sen. Jim DeMint, then won election to the final two years of that term. Democrat Thomas Dixon, a community activist and pastor, is challenging him. Then there's Democrat Dimitri Cherny, whose platform includes colonizing the moon and Mars in case the Earth becomes uninhabitable. He's challenging Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, the ex-governor whom voters sent back to Congress in 2013. ___ SOUTH DAKOTA The main suspense is likely to be the fate of 10 ballot questions on topics ranging from public campaign funding to payday loan interest rates. ___ TENNESSEE Democrats are hoping to chip away at vast Republican majorities in the state Legislature by focusing on urban areas, while the GOP is seeking to stamp out the last vestiges of Democratic support in rural parts of the state. ___ TEXAS Texas' only competitive congressional race looks to be the rematch between Republican U.S. Rep. Will Hurd and former Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego in a district that sprawls from San Antonio to suburban El Paso, including 800-plus miles of U.S.-Mexico borderlands. Hurd unseated Gallego in 2014. The entire Texas House also is up for election, along with 16 of the state Senate's 31 seats. Regardless of the outcomes, both chambers will remain Republican-controlled. ___ UTAH The independent campaign of Evan McMullin has made Utah suddenly relevant in presidential politics. If the former CIA operative, a Mormon, can win the state and claim its six electoral votes, it could upend Donald Trump's chances for the White House end five decades of reliably voting for the Republican nominee. __ VERMONT This state, considered among the most liberal in the country, may well elect a Republican governor. That race pits Lt. Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, against former state Transportation Secretary Sue Minter, a Democrat. ___ VIRGINIA Barbara Comstock, a first term GOP congresswoman, is trying to fend off a serious challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett. Trump's unpopularity in northern Virginia has loomed large in the race, with Bennett trying to tie Comstock to the presidential nominee. In the crowded race for mayor of Richmond, the front-runner is Joe Morrissey, a former state lawmaker who went to jail for having sex with his then-17-year-old receptionist, who is now his wife. ___ WEST VIRGINIA Republicans are hoping to ride on the coattails of an expected strong showing for Trump, who has promised to put coal miners back to work. In the governor's race, Democrat Jim Justice, a billionaire coal and agriculture magnate, faces Bill Cole, the state Senate president. In the state auditor's race, Democrat Mary Ann Claytor is vying to become the first African-American statewide officeholder in West Virginia history. ___ WASHINGTON Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee is seeking a second term. He faces Republican Bill Bryant, a former Seattle port commissioner who says Inslee has mismanaged the state's mental health system and failed to fund K-12 education as mandated by the state Supreme Court. Six initiatives are on the statewide ballot, including raising the minimum wage to $13.50 an hour by 2020 and imposing a carbon emission tax on certain fossil fuels. ___ WISCONSIN It's 2010 all over again in Wisconsin's U.S. Senate race. This time, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is the incumbent and former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold is the challenger. Johnson argues that having been fired once by voters, Feingold does not deserve to be sent back. But Feingold says Johnson has not led on the issues Wisconsin voters care about and should not be given a second term. ___ WYOMING Republican Liz Cheney is heavily favored to win Wyoming's only seat in the U.S. House, which was formerly held by her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her opponent, Democrat Ryan Greene, works for an oilfield services company. Wyoming voters also will decide whether to allow the state to invest potentially billions more in the stock market, changing a state law that limits investments. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
