The Richmond Times-Dispatch (http://bit.ly/2g20fZE) reports that Deputy Michael Whitt posted a statement on Twitter saying he regrets sending what he called an ""offensive message"" to Bailey Biggs, who was quoted in a Times-Dispatch article about the protests. Whitt had written to Biggs, ""Get the fu#$ over yourself!!! Life goes on and it is what it is!!! Get a life!!!"" Biggs says he has never met Whitt and that the message was unsolicited. In his tweet, Whitt denied knowing that Biggs is transgender. Richmond Sheriff C.T. Woody Jr. criticized Whitt's actions and says he will undergo sensitivity training.

The Foxfire diamond is the largest uncut, gem-quality diamond ever mined in North America. It weighs 187 carats, or 1.3 ounces. The Foxfire diamond was found just last year at a diamond mine in Canada's Northwest Territories. Before it was discovered, only much smaller diamonds were believed to exist in the area. Such a large stone might easily have been crushed by mining equipment, but it survived because of its unusually flattened shape. The diamond was purchased at auction by investor Deepak Sheth in June, and went on public display for the first time Thursday, alongside the famous Hope diamond. It will remain at the museum through Feb. 16. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

But they weren't as generous when it comes to maintaining the Scarecrow costume from the beloved movie. A Kickstarter campaign for the slippers and the costume ended at midnight Wednesday, with donors pledging $349,000. The original goal was $300,000, and that total will go to the slippers. The National Museum of American History sought another $85,000 to preserve the Scarecrow costume, but that goal fell short. Museum spokeswoman Laura Duff says the Scarecrow costume will still be preserved. She says some donors gave directly to the museum instead of pledging to Kickstarter, and the museum is ""committed to raising the additional funds necessary to complete the conservation.""

Abe meets with Trump in New York, where the incoming president is working on setting up an administration after his surprise election victory last week that has injected new uncertainty into old U.S. alliances. Trump's campaign rhetoric caused consternation in many world capitals, including Tokyo. Trump has said he would demand that allies such as Japan and South Korea contribute more to the cost of basing U.S. troops in their countries. Such comments have worried Japan at a time when the threat from North Korea is rising, and China is challenging the U.S.-led security status quo in the Pacific. The State Department has said it had yet to hear from Trump's transition team, raising the prospect of the Republican holding the meeting with Abe without any input from career diplomats with deep experience dealing with Japan. Both Japan and South Korea already pay considerable sums to support the U.S. bases, and note that it's also in America's strategic interest to deploy troops in the region. Trump has suggested that Japan and South Korea could obtain their own nuclear weapons, rather than rely on U.S. deterrence, which risks a triggering an atomic arms races in Northeast Asia. South Korea currently pays more than $800 million a year -- about 50 percent of non-personnel costs of the U.S. military deployment on its soil -- and is paying $9.7 billion more for relocating U.S. military bases, according to the Congressional Research Service. Japan pays about $2 billion a year, about half of the cost of the stationing U.S. forces. The Japanese leader may also try to sway Trump on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country trade agreement that the president-elect opposes. The pact was championed by President Barack Obama, and Trump's victory has all but erased hopes of its early ratification by the U.S. Congress. The pact is expected to be discussed in a side meeting at the annual summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Community in Peru, where Abe heads after New York. Obama will also be at APEC. Abe is Japan's most powerful leader in a decade, and he has invested political capital in overcoming strong domestic opposition to the TPP. He has also sought to increase the international role played by Japan's military, which is constrained by a pacifist constitution. That could jibe with Trump's desire to see U.S. partners shoulder more of the burden for their defense. ___ Associated Press writer Mathew Pennington contributed to this report from Washington Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Aamir Qureshi/AFP via Getty Images)  More than 100 Turkish schoolteachers and their families have been told that they have less than three days to leave Pakistan, where many of them have lived and worked for a decade or longer. The sudden expulsion comes as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is visiting the country and appears to be an appeasement of his demands that schools linked to Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish cleric and major political rival, be closed. Erdogan accuses Gulen of orchestrating a coup attempt in July and refers to the cleric as a terrorist. ""We will eliminate this terrorist organization before it harms Pakistan,"" he told the Pakistani Parliament on Thursday, referring to Gulen's movement. Since the coup attempt, Turkey has arrested tens of thousands of people on suspicion of having ties to Gulen, and more than 100,000 civil servants have been removed from their posts. Erdogan has successfully pressured other nations to aid him in the crackdown, though the United States, where Gulen lives in exile, has refused repeated requests for the cleric's extradition. Gulen-inspired organizations run schools all around the world, including in the United States. Turkey alleges that they are used to propagate an anti-Turkey mind-set. Education officials in dozens of countries have reported coming under pressure from Turkey to eliminate alleged Gulen sympathizers from the schools, though only Somalia, Azerbaijan and now Pakistan appear to have caved in.   [Fethullah Gulen: The Islamic scholar Turkey blames for the failed coup]   A petition by the head of the PakTurk Educational Foundation, which runs the affected schools in Pakistan, is being considered by a high court in Islamabad. The petition says that more than 11,000 students receive education in the 28 schools, which employed 130 Turkish teachers and more than 1,000 Pakistanis. It also denies that PakTurk is affiliated with any political organization.    Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan meets with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Islamabad. (Kayhan Ozer/Presidential Palace via Reuters)  More than 100 of the schools' students in Lahore staged protests over the expulsions on Thursday, expressing solidarity with the teachers, who they said had dedicated their lives to the cause of education. ""My children have been studying here for eight years. I find it astonishing that the Turkish government is alleging that the schools are involved in supporting Fethullah Gulen's ideology,"" Hafiz Arafat, a lawyer, told the newspaper Dawn. ""We have never witnessed anything irregular at these schools."" Many of the teachers have apparently been in Pakistan for well over a decade and are struggling to pack up their lives by Sunday, the deadline for them to leave the country. One teacher told Dawn that he'd been warned that he would be arrested if he didn't leave by then and that he and his colleagues were worried that they might be arrested on arrival in Turkey anyway. Another unnamed teacher told the Express Tribune that he or she had worked in Pakistan for 16 years and had four children born in the country. In all, more than 400 Turkish citizens will have to leave Pakistan. At a joint news conference with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Erdogan thanked him for the expulsions and reassured PakTurk students, saying they would not suffer.

We often have rice as a side dish or mixed vegetables. He uses a spoon to eat it! Not to push onto a fork (as is etiquette), but to eat from the spoon like a shovel! He is teaching my 4-year-old to do the same thing. I maintain the spoon or knife can be used to push the food onto the fork but may not be eaten directly from the spoon. Which is the right protocol?  Are you sure it's not the 4-year-old who is teaching him? Or perhaps, depending on how old your husband is, he is remembering a time before the widespread use of the fork, when most people ate with spoons. That was in the early 19th century, after which the spoon was banished from the main course. In any case, both of them are now old enough to eat with a fork.  Dear Miss Manners: A friend keeps calling to sleep over because she works part time on call, lives about an hour away, and if she stays at our house, she will get to work in 10 minutes. I have a 5-year-old and am married, and I let her stay one time thus far. I care about her, but she tends to have a habit to always overstay her welcome -- it's a pattern. How do I say no without hurting her feelings?  It would be convenient if moochers did not have feelings, but Miss Manners has noticed that this is seldom the case. Too many appear to hoard their emotions, being doubly sensitive regarding their own comfort while ignoring yours. You may have to choose between saying ""no'' and hurting your friend's feelings, but you do not have to choose between saying ""no'' and being rude. The trick is to avoid both specifics and generalities. Tell your friend that the night she has asked about is not possible for you. Do not explain why. And do not tell her that she will hear this answer every time she calls. She will eventually get the idea.  Dear Miss Manners: During a lecture in my college class, somebody will sneeze. I know that the polite thing to do is to say ""Bless you,'' but is it polite to disrupt the entire lecture by yelling it across the room? I have several classmates who will loudly say ""Bless you'' at every sneeze. The ""blessings'' are more disruptive then the sneeze! They even do this during exam time. The ones bestowing the blessing are polite and very nice people, but the blessings are a little too much.  While philosophers may spend their time debating the sound made by the proverbial tree falling in the proverbial forest, etiquette has less free time. She, in the person of Miss Manners, does not require acknowledgment of things unseen, or in this case unheard. No one is required to say ""hello'' to someone spotted a block away. And in the interest of practicality, she also asserts that beyond a certain distance -- arm's length, in this case -- no one is expected to have heard, and no response is necessary.

(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's former campaign manager, said it is incumbent upon Hillary Clinton, President Obama and other Democratic leaders to calm their supporters and encourage a peaceful transition of power amid anti-Trump demonstrations that have swept U.S. cities since Election Day. Trump is ""there for them. And he is going to be a president that listens and takes the counsel of many different people, including those from the other side of the aisle,"" Conway told Chuck Todd on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. "" . . . It's time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters, 'This man is our president.'"" Both Clinton and Obama made speeches urging exactly that last week. In her concession speech to Trump, Clinton said, ""We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" In a similar vein, Obama met with Trump at the White House on Thursday and has said that his priority is to ensure a smooth transition so that Trump's presidency is successful. Conway on Sunday also accused Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) of ""acting like some garden-variety political pundit"" and ""egging people on"" to protest Trump's coming presidency.   [Demonstrators square off against opponents and police as Anti-Trump protests spread]   Speaking to host Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Conway also suggested that professional, paid protesters were behind the anti-Trump demonstrations across the country.      Nationwide protests have gripped many cities for days following the presidential election as thousands march against Donald Trump's victory. Trump tweeted to condemn ""professional protesters, incited by the media."" (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   Wallace had asked Conway what Trump would do to reach out to those scared of what his presidency would bring, then read a portion of a statement Reid issued Friday charging Trump with assuaging the fears that he said the Republican's campaign had stoked. ""If this is going to be a time of healing, we must first put the responsibility for healing where it belongs: at the feet of Donald Trump, a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate,"" Reid's statement read in part. ""Winning the electoral college does not absolve Trump of the grave sins he committed against millions of Americans. Donald Trump may not possess the capacity to assuage those fears, but he owes it to this nation to try."" Conway cited Trump's victory speech as evidence that he was ""off to a great start"" in unifying the country, then turned her anger on Reid. ""Talk about not wanting my children to listen to somebody,"" Conway said. ""I'm calling for responsibility and maturity and decency. I hope President Obama calls Harry M. Reid today and says, 'Cut it out.'""   If Trump wants to roll back the tide of hate he unleashed, he has a tremendous amount of work to do and he must begin immediately. -- Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) November 11, 2016   Conway also told Wallace that the Trump administration still would be one ""for the forgotten man and the forgotten woman"" -- despite his transition-team picks being filled with Washington insiders. Throughout his campaign, Trump played up his lack of political experience as a positive trait, saying he was an outsider who would ""drain the swamp"" of D.C. politics. His transition team now includes former federal bureaucrats, think-tank academics, corporate lawyers and special-interest lobbyists. ""These are people who are talented and who have done this before,"" Conway told host Chris Wallace, defending Trump's transition-team choices. ""You can't just appoint novices. You have to have people who know what they're doing."" Conway had previously said Trump's pick for White House chief of staff was ""imminent."" It is widely expected that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign chief executive Steve Bannon are on the shortlist for that position, and Trump's choice could signal the direction of his presidency. Conway told Wallace that both men would have ""very important roles"" in the administration. ""We couldn't have done it without Preibus or Bannon,"" she said, referring to winning the election.   .@KellyannePolls on #FNS: We can't just appoint novices. This is an administration that is going to be run very differently. -- FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) November 13, 2016   On the issue of Obamacare, Conway said that she didn't know whether Trump would amend portions of the health-care law or repeal and replace it completely but that Trump would act quickly, perhaps even convening a special session right after the January inauguration to address the law. ""As you know, the House and Senate under Republican control have repealed Obamacare dozens of times, but they've never had a Republican president go to the next step,"" Conway said. "" . . . that excuse has been removed, and I think you're going to see some significant action."" A full repeal of the Affordable Care Act had been central to Trump's campaign. Over the past week, however, Trump said he would be open to keeping portions of the law, such as ensuring that people with preexisting conditions are covered and allowing children to stay on their parents' health plans through age 26. When Wallace asked whether Obama had changed Trump's mind about a full repeal, Conway brushed it off as Trump being polite. ""I wouldn't take it that far,"" she said. ""I believe that President-elect Trump is being properly respectful to President Obama. This is obviously his signature domestic legislative achievement, to hear Obama say it.""          1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flare up from opponents of the president-elect.

With as many as 1 million people on the streets of Seoul, it was South Korea's largest demonstration in more than a decade -- no small feat in a country with a vibrant protest culture -- and it increased the pressure on Park over a widening corruption and influence-peddling controversy. Most analysts, however, do not expect her to heed calls to quit, especially as neither the opposition nor the ruling party -- nor Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. secretary general and potential South Korean presidential candidate -- are ready for a snap election. Still, the message from Saturday's candlelight protest was clear. ""I want her to step down. I want an end to her administration and for an entirely new one to come in,"" said Lee Yu-jin, who had traveled for an hour to Seoul with her husband and 8-year-old daughter. ""If the wrong leader is elected, this kind of thing can happen. I want my daughter to know that we can take action.""     South Korea's president is engulfed in a political scandal with plotlines straight out of a soap opera: rumors of secret advisers, nepotism and ill-gotten gains. (Anna Fifield, Yoonjung Seo, Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)    [South Korean president offers to withdraw her prime minister nominee to quell scandal]  The Park administration has been plunged into the worst crisis of its turbulent tenure after news emerged that Park had been taking advice on topics as diverse as North Korea and her wardrobe from a lifelong friend with no policy experience and links to a questionable cult. The woman, Choi Soon-sil, has also been accused of using her relationship with Park to solicit $70 million in donations for foundations from big businesses such as Samsung, which she is accused of embezzling instead. Choi has been arrested and is being questioned by prosecutors, as are several of Park's close aides. Although South Korea is no stranger to corruption scandals, this one has infuriated people who think that democracy has been circumvented and wonder whether the country was being run by a ""shadow president"" with no experience. They are also angry that the institutions of government -- from the prosecutor's office to the presidential Blue House itself -- not only did not intervene, but seemed to have helped Choi. Many opposition lawmakers, and even some in the ruling Saenuri Party, are calling for Park to resign, triggering an election within 60 days. She has defied calls to step down, apparently wanting to stay until her term ends in February 2018. But her efforts to quell the public fury through apologies and reshuffles have not worked. Her approval rating remains at 5 percent, Gallup Korea said Friday, a record low for any president.

Organizers said there were 1 million people at the protest, which had the atmosphere of a carnival. Police put the number at 260,000. Either way, it far surpassed the official estimate of 43,000 people who took part in the previous week's protest, and also the 80,000 people who took to the streets in 2008 to protest the imports of U.S. beef during an outbreak of mad cow disease. Tens of thousands of people had arrived by bus from the southern cities of Busan and Ulsan, and about 1,000 people from the southern island of Jeju flew into Seoul on 30 flights. Student and women's groups, together with labor and farmers unions, had organized rallies in the lead-up to the main demonstration, which featured singers and speeches but none of the violence that has plagued past protests. There were families with children, including babies in strollers, and people using wheelchairs. Some people sat on mats on the street, waving candles and eating snacks, while others marched toward the Blue House singing a specially written song with the lyrics ""Park Geun-hye must step down."" ""This incident has made us reflect on how we haven't cared enough about politics and have not been keeping close enough watch on how the government is run,"" said Kim Wan-kyu, a 34-year-old office worker who joined the demonstration with two friends.  [Here is everything you need to know about South Korea's extraordinary presidential scandal]  Jo Sung-eun, 31, joined the protests for the first time Saturday. ""I came out in solidarity and in the hope Park will step down as soon as possible,"" Jo said. ""She's not the president for the people; she's been the president for one person,"" she said, referring to Choi. Daniel Pinkston, a professor at Troy University's campus in Seoul, said the Choi scandal had become a focal point for other grievances that were simmering in South Korea. ""The Choi Soon-sil case is like the last straw,"" he said. ""It has energized people to come out with all these wider grievances with labor relations, school fees, unemployment, economic inequality and insecurity."" The president's office was taking the protests seriously and listening to the public's concerns, a spokesman said.

But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)   On Friday, under the new logo of his presidential transition team, Donald Trump released the names of the people who would lead his efforts to cobble together his administration's executive leadership team. He's got until Jan. 20, when Barack Obama hands over the keys to the White House and lights out for the territories -- so the group below has 70 days to figure out what it's going to do. Who are these people and why were they picked? What can we learn about where the government is likely to head? In short, Trump's transition team is heavy on staunch conservatives who demonstrated early loyalty to his candidacy. It's often been noted that Trump values loyalty; that's reflected in his picks. They are: Stephen K. Bannon Campaign CEO, head of Breitbart News Bannon officially joined Team Trump in August, shortly before campaign chairman Paul Manafort was resign/fired. But Bannon had been on Team Trump for months before that as the power behind Breitbart News, the Web network whose unabashed advocacy for Trump (and disparagement of Trump's allies) helped reinforce Trump's campaign messaging through the spring and summer. On the campaign, he's credited with helping to refine Trump's message and, to some extent, get the candidate to stick to it. Bannon's inclusion in the campaign was fairly stunning simply by virtue of his background. Breitbart's casual interest in accuracy and embrace of the nationalist, anti-immigrant and often racist ""alt-right"" provided fodder for Hillary Clinton's campaign for months (not that it did a lot of good). Bannon is being mentioned as a possible chief of staff in a Trump White House. Lou Barletta U.S. representative for Pennsylvania's 11th district (east-central part of the state) Like many of the elected officials on Trump's transition team, Barletta came out for Trump fairly early in the process. Barletta made his bones in politics while the mayor of Hazleton, Pa., implementing a sweeping anti-immigration rule that sought to uproot immigrants in the country illegally. The law included removing undocumented immigrants from rental properties and cracking down on employment. Marsha Blackburn U.S. representative for Tennessee's 7th district (west-central Tennessee) Blackburn is a staunchly conservative legislator who is best known for her positions on social issues, such as her opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion. In July, she insisted that global warming was a hoax and that, actually, the world was cooling. Pam Bondi Attorney general of Florida Bondi came to national attention this year when questions were raised about how timing of a contribution Trump made to Bondi overlapped with her decision not to investigate Trump University for fraud. There was more smoke than fire, but Trump was fined since the donation came from his nonprofit foundation and not from Trump personally. Chris Collins U.S. representative for New York's 27th district (western New York) Collins was the first member of Congress to endorse Trump, which came as something of a shock given his fairly moderate politics. Collins is also the representative for Carl Paladino, a big donor in the state and fervent Trump backer, who Collins at one point said had been pushing Republicans to endorse the presidential candidate. Jared Kushner Owner of the New York Observer, Ivanka Trump's husband Kushner has emerged as Trump's Svengali, according to numerous reports. The Observer -- a small publication notable mostly these days for its owner -- endorsed Trump in the primaries, and Kushner has been frequently mentioned as the guiding hand for many key decisions within the campaign. Tom Marino U.S. representative for Pennsylvania's 10th district (northeastern Pennsylvania) Marino also endorsed Trump early. He advocates a hard-line position on immigration, saying in 2014 that he was ""enraged"" by President Obama's executive actions on the topic. Rebekah Mercer Director of the Mercer Family Foundation Mercer and her father, Robert, have spent millions of dollars to build and bankroll the conservative infrastructure that powered Trump's rise -- including Breitbart News. The Mercers backed Ted Cruz in the Republican primary, hiring Kellyanne Conway to run a super PAC supporting the Texas senator. It was they who, in August, convinced Trump to upend his leadership for the second time and give Bannon and Conway the reins. Our Matea Gold profiled Mercer earlier this year. Steven Mnuchin Wall Street executive Once Trump decided to start actively raising money for the general election, he asked Mnuchin to lead the effort. A veteran of Goldman Sachs, Mnuchin supported Mitt Romney in 2012 and has supported Hillary Clinton in past campaigns. (""I wouldn't in any way say I distanced myself from Wall Street. I have very good friends on Wall Street,"" he told the New York Times earlier this year.) Devin Nunes U.S. representative for California's 22nd district (California's Central Valley) Nunes represents rural Tulare County in California and serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He's staked out a position in firm opposition to Obama's foreign policy and his state's powerful liberal politics, including environmental interests. Reince Priebus Chairman of the Republican National Committee Priebus's relationship with Trump had been rocky for some time, thanks largely to how Trump's candidacy was deepening the rift between the GOP's establishment wing and its upstarts. Priebus stuck with the nominee and the long bet paid off -- fairly amazingly, given that Priebus also helped develop the post-2012 guideline for reforming the party so that it could retake the White House. Trump did the opposite of what the so-called ""autopsy"" recommended, and Priebus helped him leverage that strategy to success. Anthony Scaramucci Wall Street executive In 2012, Scaramucci co-chaired Romney's fundraising efforts. His entree into Trump politics was by excoriating the eventual Republican nominee. He backed Scott Walker and then Jeb Bush before backing Trump. Last year, he sat down for an interview with Gawker during which he acknowledged that Trump's rhetoric on hedge fund managers (of which he was one) was just political talk. Peter Thiel Financier Speaking of Gawker! Thiel is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who gained infamy this year when it was revealed that he was bankrolling various lawsuits aimed at crippling the gossip website. (Thiel was mad about a 2007 article in which it was revealed that he was gay, something widely known by his colleagues at the time.) Against all odds, Thiel's lawsuit was successful, resulting in a sort of alternate-universe reflection of Trump's campaign: A guy sets out to upend a hated establishment and suddenly discovers that he has. For those who believe in such things as the First Amendment, Thiel's victory -- leveraging the power of the pocketbook and an unusual jury trial in Florida -- is not an entirely welcome one. (Trump has pledged to levy punishments against oppositional media in his own way.) The Trump kids: Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. Trump's three oldest children will play an active role in the transition team, according to the day's announcement. They have also been tapped to run Trump's business interests while he's serving in the White House. We therefore recommend that you go read this look at how stark a conflict that could end up being."

She is writing a biography of J. Edgar Hoover.   Two unexpected events made Harry S. Truman president of the United States. The first was Franklin Roosevelt's sudden death by cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945, less than three months into Truman's term as vice president. The second was Truman's election in his own right in November 1948, a race that almost nobody in the punditocracy predicted he would win. That race bore certain similarities to our present one. As the awkward successor to a charismatic Democratic president, Truman found it hard to gin up enthusiasm among ordinary voters. Two offshoot anti-establishment candidacies added to his troubles: Henry Wallace's Progressive Party and Strom Thurmond's States' Rights Democratic (or Dixiecrat) Party both drew votes from Truman's base.  Under those circumstances, the arch-reactionary Chicago Tribune felt so confident about the prospects of Truman's Republican rival, Thomas Dewey, that editors went ahead and declared victory before the votes were counted out West -- thus producing the famous photograph of a gleeful Truman holding a Tribune declaring ""Dewey Defeats Truman."" In the end, Truman pulled off a comfortable victory, with more than 49 percent of the popular vote to Dewey's 45.1 percent. Not long after this, as historian H.W. Brands notes in his engaging new book, ""The General vs. the President,"" Truman began to have second thoughts about whether the whole presidency thing was such a good idea after all. One of the country's most prolific political historians, Brands has made a name for himself recounting the high drama of national politics, from ""The Heartbreak of Aaron Burr"" through Ronald Reagan's unlikely ascendancy as president.  Though Truman rarely sought out such political drama, it had a way of finding him. In 1949, the first year of his second term, the Russians exploded their first atom bomb and the West ""lost"" China to the communists. The following year, accused Soviet spy Alger Hiss went to jail on perjury charges, Sen. Joseph McCarthy burst on the political scene, and North Korea invaded South Korea -- and that was just the first six months. Of all these second-term events, though, none loomed larger in Washington than Truman's showdown with Gen. Douglas MacArthur, supreme allied commander in Asia and one of the most decorated soldiers in U.S. history. In textbook accounts, their clash usually boils down to a single moment: In April 1951, Truman fired MacArthur for insubordination, thus restoring the primacy of civilian control over the military. Brands takes the long view of this incident, showing the slow escalation of a personal as well as strategic conflict in a rapidly shifting postwar environment where, frankly, nobody knew quite what to do.  His opening chapters offer portraits of two men hurtling through the world along different paths, one military and one civilian, one brimming with self-confidence, the other less sure he belonged in his position of power. At 70 years old, the ""old soldier"" MacArthur, who had defeated and then reconstructed Japan, felt sure he had all the answers. Truman, by contrast, often seemed out of his element, an accidental president besieged on all sides. Truman knew that MacArthur harbored presidential ambitions; the general had even floated the idea of running for the Republican nomination in 1948. Concluding that his post in Tokyo did not make an ideal base for a U.S. presidential campaign, MacArthur never fully entered the race, but the possibility that he might, or felt that he should, still rankled. Then came Korea. In the annals of modern U.S. warfare, Korea is often the neglected middle child, caught between the glories of World War II and debacle of Vietnam. Brands's book reminds us what a terrifying -- and unexpected -- conflict it actually was. Sharing borders with the Soviet Union and China, Korea was no mere regional outpost or proxy battleground. It had the potential to erupt into a global nuclear conflict and to set off a war for the fate of the world. Both Truman and MacArthur recognized this danger, but as Brands shows, they viewed the challenge in profoundly different ways. MacArthur sought a crushing military victory, modeling his actions on his recent total-war triumphs in the Pacific. Truman, by contrast, viewed the prevention of another catastrophic global war as his highest order of business. Other men in other circumstances might have been able to mediate such a difference of opinion, but in 1951 neither Truman nor MacArthur saw much room for compromise.  Brands's book follows this tragic arc, describing the two figures as their conflict widens and deepens and then, inexorably, erupts. Along the way he visits secondary players such as Secretary of State Dean Acheson, who ""oozed arrogance"" toward nearly everyone in Washington, and Marguerite Higgins, the New York Herald Tribune's pioneering female war correspondent in Korea. To tell these stories, Brands relies heavily on long quotes from official memos and newspaper reports; many chapters consist of little else. At its best, this technique gives ""The General vs. the President"" a you-are-there quality, showing how historical characters wrestled with difficult and uncertain situations. At its worst, it abdicates the role of the historian to interpret the available sources -- to tell us not only what was said but what it all meant. MacArthur and Truman themselves never read the same documents in the same way, and each man delivered his discontent with the other through the subtle messaging of Washington power politics. When the Veterans of Foreign Wars asked MacArthur for a statement about Korea, he happily obliged but neglected to consult with the president. When Truman wanted to meet MacArthur in person, the general insisted that the president fly to Wake Island -- a 7,000-mile journey for Truman but only a 2,000-mile trip for the Tokyo-based MacArthur. Truman did his best to indulge his brilliant but cantankerous general, absorbing the slights without lashing back, at least in public. It was only when MacArthur declared his intent to widen the Korean conflict into China -- in direct violation of both U.N. and White House directives -- that Truman finally took drastic action and fired his famous subordinate. Though he maintains an admirable even-handedness, Brands seems to side with the long-suffering Truman, who ultimately had no choice but to put the aggressive, pipe-smoking general in his place. But as Brands shows, in 1951 this was an act fraught with political peril. MacArthur's return to the United States started as one long celebrity pageant, with millions of Americans lining the streets for his motorcade in San Francisco, and millions more gazing toward the sky as his plane flew over the Midwest toward Washington. When MacArthur finally landed in the capital, he was whisked before Congress to testify about Korea and -- to nobody's surprise -- implicitly to denounce the president. Truman's reputation was saved not by his own actions but by the somber rebuttal of Gen. George Marshall, who informed Congress in no uncertain terms that MacArthur did not know what he was talking about. The president who fired a general, in short, also had to be saved by one. Truman's approach arguably paid off over the long term: Despite tens of thousands of U.S. casualties, the Korean War did not escalate into World War III. Yet his actions also set the stage for future conflicts. Truman never asked Congress for a declaration of war in Korea, preferring to describe the conflict as a ""police action"" carried out under the auspices of the United Nations. Presidents ever since have followed his lead, dispatching U.S. troops around the world without congressional consent. Though many Americans in his own day viewed Truman as a weak president, he did as much as any modern executive to strengthen the powers of the White House and to change the character of modern war. American presidents -- and generals -- have been living with those consequences ever since.  The General vs. the President MacArthur and Truman at the Brink of Nuclear War By H.W.
