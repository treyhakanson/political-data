New York housing police Chief James Secreto says the officers -- one male, the other female -- encountered the man Saturday afternoon on the ninth floor of the Van Dyke Houses in the Brownsville neighborhood. The New York Police Department housing officers were responding to a 911 call reporting a suspicious person. When they asked for ID, a scuffle ensued, and Secreto says the man grabbed one officer's metal baton and struck both in the head. They then fired. One suffered a gash, the second contusions. They were in stable condition. Authorities identified the dead man as Erickson Brito. The officers' names were not released. Police are continuing an investigation.

(Carl de Souza/Getty/AFP)  There is a curious connection between sickness and social change. Studies suggest that communities suffering from more infectious diseases are more likely to be collectivist -- ethnocentric, conformist, highly protective of their own group's members and antagonistic toward anyone from outside. From an evolutionary standpoint, this makes sense, says social psychologist Michael Varnum: ""Pathogens evoke a whole suite of responses that likely are or were adaptive in some way, that get people to reduce their chance of infection."" Suspicion of strangers is a good way to ward off unfamiliar germs to which you may not have immunity. Emphasis on traditional ways of doing things -- cooking, cleaning, child rearing and burial practices -- could discourage new, unsafe behaviors. Putting off education, exploration or political engagement in favor of settling down and starting a family could be a means of ensuring your genes are passed on before you die of an illness. But once the specter of infectious disease is lifted, the outlook shifts. It's safe to become more individualistic, to embrace difference, to celebrate innovation. People gaze into the unknown and see opportunity, not peril. And that's when change starts to happen. Case in point: the United States. Varnum and a colleague, Igor Grossmann, reported Monday in the journal Nature Human Behavior, that a decrease in the prevalence of this country's nine biggest infectious diseases over the past 70 years has been accompanied by a dramatic upswing in gender equality. ""It's one of the strongest relationships I've ever observed in my work,"" said Varnum, an assistant professor at Arizona State University. He compares the statistical correlation between low pathogen loads and gender equality to the link between smoking and lung cancer.    [Mice quarantine themselves when sick -- a lesson for us all]   The notion that behavior is influenced by disease rates, termed ""parasite stress theory,"" has its roots in biology. Numerous studies have shown that animals have evolved to behave in ways that limit their exposure to pathogens. Wild mice quarantine themselves when they are sick. Infected ants leave their nests to die. Some primates ostracize ailing members of their group to prevent disease from spreading. In 2012, researchers Corey Fincher and Randy Thornhill published a paper in the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences arguing that the theory explains broad cultural changes in human societies. They found stronger family ties and heightened religiosity in societies with greater parasite loads, because, as they put it, sticking to one's own group ""is more important for the avoidance of infection from novel parasites and for the management of infection in regions with high levels of parasite stress."" That idea is still contentious, and sociologists have argued that the relationship between pathogen prevalence and human behavior is more nuanced, or even inverted. A 2013 study of U.S. data suggested that only STDs, rather than all infectious diseases, affected behavior like interpersonal violence, child maltreatment and religious adherence. The study also found that the effect vanished when the researchers controlled for rapid life histories (biology jargon for how rapidly creatures grow up, mate and reproduce) -- suggesting that the pivotal factor is the age at which people are marrying and having children, not how many germs they're carrying. Varnum and Grossmann note that their study doesn't prove lower parasite load directly increases gender equality. It only demonstrates that there is a very strong correlation. The pair looked at four environmental factors -- resource scarcity, warfare, climatic stress and infectious disease -- that could affect women's rights. Varnum explained that anxiety about poverty, violence or severe weather potentially causing an early death could also prompt people to marry and reproduce earlier, which tends to disadvantage women.   [Deadly diseases can jump from animals to humans. These maps show where that might happen next.]   They then quantified each of those factors and compared the numbers with an index of gender equality, which was calculated based on the size of the wage gap, female representation in Congress, references to female pronouns in news reports and literature, and attitudes about women's rights as measured by Gallup polls. Statistical analysis revealed that declining infectious disease rates had by far the strongest correlation with women's advancement, even when the researchers controlled for influences such as overall collectivism and conservatism. Factoring in lower teen birthrates somewhat weakened the correlation, suggesting that slower life-history strategies independently boost equality. What's more, the decline in disease rates appeared to predict an increase in women's rights: ""The links are stronger for pathogens at a particular time predicting gender equality in the future, rather than the other way around,"" Varnum said. The researchers tested their model by comparing pathogen prevalence and gender equality in Britain. The correlation there held strong. ""Ideally we'd love to get data from a number of other societies around the world,"" Varnum said, noting that this will be difficult in places with less comprehensive public health and political data. ""I would be interested to see how this relationship looks across the globe over time.""

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  The nation's top health official made an appeal Monday morning for the preservation of the Affordable Care Act, insisting that the sprawling health-care law that President-elect Donald Trump is vowing to eliminate is ""now woven into the fabric of our nation."" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell delivered the most extensive remarks of any Obama administration official since last week's election about the future of the law, suggesting that large numbers of Americans signing up now for ACA health plans will make it more difficult for Trump and congressional Republicans to take away that insurance or the federal subsidies that help pay for it. Burwell's remarks transformed what would have been a routine enrollment-period briefing -- for people who assist consumers in signing up for coverage and sympathetic bloggers in target markets -- into a plea for the salvation of President Obama's signature domestic achievement. Speaking in an auditorium of the White House's Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the HHS secretary called last week ""tough for many of us."" And in a moment of sentimentality rare for her public remarks, she noted, ""History has taken place in these halls -- major treaties have been negotiated, budget deals have been hammered out, and the future of our nation has been shaped by men and women working here."" She pointed out that Obama signed the ACA ""not far from here -- in the East Room -- about six years and eight months ago."" Burwell ticked off her customary list of the benefits she often says the health-care law has conferred on consumers and on the rate of cost increases in the U.S. health-care system. She noted that 20 million people now have insurance through ACA health plans or an expansion of Medicaid in 31 states and the District. Insurers are now forbidden to charge higher prices to women, place yearly or lifetime limits on coverage, or refuse to cover people who have pre-existing medical problems. In an atypical moment, she quoted Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a veteran of the nation's civil rights struggles. When a polarized Congress passed the ACA early in spring 2010, Burwell recalled Lewis as saying, ""We may not have chosen the time, but the time has chosen us."" ""The time may be running out on this administration,"" Burwell told the enrollment navigators and other supporters in front of her, ""but it has chosen all of you to carry on this legacy -- to build healthier communities and a stronger nation."" She said that the extent to which Americans value the law is evident from the enrollment surge the day after the election, when 105,000 people signed up for ACA coverage. That is the only statistic HHS has provided since this fourth-year enrollment period began Nov. 1. The sign-up window will remain open through January, though people who want coverage starting New Year's Day need to buy a health plan by Dec. 15. Officials have projected that an estimated 11.4 million people, on average, will have coverage through the law's insurance exchanges during the coming year.

(Yves Herman/Reuters)  German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier looks likely to take over his country's presidency next year after garnering the backing of Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Party, the Christian Social Union and his own Social Democrats. With the support of all three major government coalition partners, it seems unlikely that Steinmeier will face a serious rival for the president's office -- a largely ceremonial head-of-state role, entrusted largely with maintaining German unity and representing the nation in formal foreign affairs. But Steinmeier's appointment would be especially notable in light of last week's U.S. presidential election. As foreign minister, Steinmeier was one of President-elect Donald Trump's most vocal critics on the world stage. In August, Steinmeier suggested that Trump was a ""hate preacher,"" saying the Republican candidate and anti-immigration parties in Europe ""make politics with fear,"" according to Deutsche Welle. He had previously criticized Trump's ""America first"" policy, suggesting that the U.S. election campaign season may ""lack the perception of reality."" The foreign minister's candid comments stood in contrast to the approach taken by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who mostly kept a relatively neutral position throughout the U.S. election. Spokeswoman Sawsan Chebli acknowledged this in August, saying at a news conference that Steinmeier was ""indeed not neutral on this question, because he thinks that if you follow what Trump is saying, then you need to be really scared about what could become of this world . . . if [Trump] does in fact become president."" After Trump was elected, Steinmeier suggested that the results were an ""earthquake"" and that people had to struggle to find any ""clear and coherent"" foreign policy positions from Trump's statement. Trump isn't the only subject on which the German foreign minister is known to speak his mind. Steinmeier also has been a vocal critic of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, calling it ""a sad day for Europe and Britain"" -- and later adding that he was ""not particularly amused"" by Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, who had backed Brexit. Steinmeier also caused some controversy within European political circles this summer by warning NATO about ""saber-rattling"" against Moscow. Steinmeier is popular at home -- in one recent poll, 67 percent of Germans said they felt he should play an important role in the future of Germany, four percentage points higher than Merkel. His comments about Trump may have helped his reputation: Just 6 percent of Germans have confidence in Trump when it comes to world affairs, according to the Pew Research Center. If Steinmeier becomes president, it would be a promotion. However, it would also remove a prominent critic of the populism engulfing the world stage. It remains unclear who would succeed him as foreign minister, although Martin Schulz -- president of the European Parliament, who has taken a more pragmatic stance on Trump -- has been mentioned in the German press. Merkel's party is known to have initially favored putting forward its own candidate for president but after struggling to find anyone suitable decided that it was best to show a unified front ahead of next year's federal elections -- especially considering the gains Germany's own anti-establishment movement, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has made in recent regional elections. The president is not directly elected but is chosen by members of the Bundestag and delegates from state parliaments. The current president, Joachim Gauck, is due to retire and be replaced in February. More on WorldViews:  61 not-very-positive things foreign leaders have said about Donald Trump  "

(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   If you head to Google to learn the final results of the presidential election, the search engine helpfully walks through the final electoral vote tallies and number of seats won by each party in the House and Senate. Under that, Google lists some related news articles. At the top this morning, with an accompanying photo: a story arguing that Donald Trump won both the popular and electoral votes.     That's not true. The Daily Show's Dan Amira noticed that numbers were being spread on social media that linked back to the ""70 News"" site. The 70 News article cites its source as this tweet.   Final #Election2016 Results By Numbers:-  #PopularVote #electoralvotes pic.twitter.com/uKZevQvPfK -- Michael (@Koxinga8) November 12, 2016   That tweet cites as its source USASupreme.com, another random website which doesn't actually include the numbers themselves. It does, however, argue that Hillary Clinton is ""probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast."" That distinction is ... not really clear, except that the author, ""Alex,"" seems to believe that absentee ballots are only counted if the tally could make the difference in the election. That's not true, either. In light gray text above the link to 70 News, Google relays the actual current tally of counted votes: Clinton has a lead of about 700,000. That lead has grown since Election Day and will almost certainly continue to grow, since millions of the votes being counted are from California, and the plurality of those votes are from very-Clinton-friendly Los Angeles County. The source behind the ""USA Supreme"" website isn't clear. It looks an awful lot like Prntly, a made-up news website we looked at earlier this year. Founded by a former convict named Alex Portelli, Prntly is part of the broad diaspora of websites that takes news about American politics, frames it in a pro-Trump way (often at the expense of accuracy) and then peppers the page with ads. In an email, Portelli denied involvement in USA Supreme, suggesting that it was the work of a group of young people in Macedonia first reported by BuzzFeed. These sites leverage the inability of Facebook and other social media sites to weed out nonsense in order to get clicks and make money from advertising -- a remarkably lucrative endeavor, particularly in a country where the U.S. dollar stretches a lot further. Why Google includes 70 News as a news source isn't clear. Among the main categories of news stories the site lists in its header is ""Hillary's Health,"" which links to a number of rumors about the health of the Democratic nominee. Under ""Politics"" is a story that, among other things, links the Council on American-Islamic Relations to Al Qaeda. Another story suggests that protestors against Trump in California were being paid to do so. 70 News has added a header to its post about the election results. Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump - finally they did, with Arizona finally declared two days ago - Trump now has the 309. Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media - which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory. If I'm wrong, I won't hesitate to change the numbers. It's the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it's out there already. None of that is true, either. The ""establishment media"" has regularly updated election results, showing Clinton with a wide popular vote lead. The reason that Michigan hasn't been called is that Trump's lead is 12,000 votes, and the results haven't been finalized. New Hampshire also hasn't been called for Clinton; her lead there is under 3,000 votes. ""Alex"" is wrong; he's hesitating to change the numbers. If you're interested in tracking the final vote tallies in the presidential race, here's The Post's page articulating them. Or you can simply search Google and keep an eye out for the small print under the electoral college totals. If you also see an article from a random site you've never heard of? I might recommend you take its numbers with a grain of salt."
5	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/14/this-is-why-senate-republicans-might-not-go-nuclear/	This is why Senate Republicans might (not) go nuclear	"   President-elect Donald Trump with wife Melania Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), right, after a Nov. 10 meeting in the Capitol. (Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto Agency)  Last week's elections placed the filibuster in the crosshairs of Senate Republicans. Many believe that unified Republican control of Congress and the White House come January will encourage Senate Democrats to filibuster the GOP agenda -- leading Republicans to curtail the minority's right to block Senate action.   [Wait, why do we even have an electoral college?]   We can't know today, of course, if Republicans will ""go nuclear,"" a controversial parliamentary move that would empower a simple majority of the Senate to limit or eliminate the filibuster altogether. But let's understand the political dynamics that might give rise to such an explosive move. Some recent background on the Senate filibuster When Senate Democrats went nuclear in 2013 to reinterpret the filibuster rule, they targeted the Senate's Rule 22. The ""cloture"" rule requires 60 votes to cut off Senate debate (or 67, for motions to debate changes to the rules). Once debate is ended by invoking ""cloture,"" 30 hours of post-cloture debate must elapse -- unless all 100 senators agree to waive it. Only then does the Senate take a simple-majority vote on the measure or motion. After cloture, remaining amendments must be narrowly related to the underlying bill.   [Hillary Clinton will keep gaining votes after election night. Here's why.]   In 2013, Democrats changed this for executive and judicial branch nominations (except the Supreme Court). They reduced the number of votes required to break debate to a simple majority -- and essentially banned nomination filibusters. Except for those nominations and some measures that are protected by law from filibusters (such as the congressional budget resolution), Senate rules still require 60 votes to cut off debate before the Senate votes. With an incoming majority of 52 senators (if a Republican wins Louisiana's runoff election next month), Republicans will typically need eight Democrats to join them to kill a filibuster. That could be hard if Democrats unite to halt Trump's and Republicans' efforts, as Republicans have done to Obama. How likely are Senate Republicans to go nuclear (and end the filibuster)?  To find out, ask the following questions, starting in January. First, how aggressively and often will Senate Democrats filibuster? One political science theory suggests that threats to go nuclear should tame the minority -- encouraging Democrats to filibuster less frequently lest Republicans react by eliminating it. If true, we would expect Democrats to judiciously oppose parts of the GOP agenda. That said, Democrats' threat to go nuclear failed to tame Republicans in 2013 -- persuading Democrats to ban nomination filibusters.   [How rural resentment helps explain Donald Trump's surprising victory]   Will Democrats adopt the GOP's strategy of obstruction, putting the filibuster at risk? We won't know until we see how the Trump White House and congressional GOP leaders craft the new administration's agenda. Some Trump priorities (perhaps an infrastructure proposal) might secure Democratic support. Elections are always around the corner. In 2018, 25 Democratic senators (including the chamber's two independents) and seven from the GOP face reelection. As shown below, 10 Democrats are running in states that Trump won with an average vote of 55 percent -- indistinguishable from Trump support in GOP states. (In contrast, just one Republican, Dean Heller of Nevada, faces voters in a state won by Clinton.) With an eye on 2018, these Democrats who won in 2012 -- sharing a ballot with President Obama -- will probably look for opportunities to appeal beyond their Democratic base to Trump voters. If Democrats selectively filibuster or fail to hold their caucus together, Republicans could forgo curtailing the filibuster.    Second, is a majority-rule Senate an unalloyed good for the GOP majority? Certainly, banning the filibuster makes more sense during unified party control of government than when it's divided. Removing an obstacle to passage makes it more likely that the majority party can secure its priorities.   [Hate Trump if you want. But democracy requires respecting the winner's legitimacy.]   But some Republican senators also benefit from lax Senate rules -- for example, allowing them to take measures hostage with a threat to filibuster. Small majorities tend to be more cohesive. But this slim GOP majority's hold on the agenda could be tenuous if one or two of the party's senators uses the rules to advance their own agenda. The filibuster has persisted for over two centuries in part because senators, regardless of party status, benefit from lax parliamentary rules. Third, will Republicans be able to secure 51 GOP votes to reinterpret Senate rules? I suspect that some of the longer-serving senators, who remember serving in the minority, might be loathe to jettison their future right to filibuster. Moreover, as Greg Koger reminds us, Republicans themselves might benefit from the filibuster: It allows the GOP to blame the Democrats for blocking parts of the Trump agenda, especially measures GOP senators might oppose. Moreover, requiring 60 votes for cloture would allow Republicans to pursue controversial votes that force electorally cross-pressured Democrats to take costly positions. It's not clear that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will have the votes to ban the filibuster.   [This book helps you understand the rise of Donald Trump]   As Steve Smith points out, McConnell could go nuclear incrementally -- first ending Supreme Court filibusters if Democrats delay confirmation of Trump's first nominee and then moving to ban the filibuster of appropriations bills, key legislative vehicles for moving GOP priorities. Republicans could also target filibusters of the motion to call up a bill. In fact, Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) probably excluded Supreme Court nominees in 2013 to secure his nuclear majority. McConnell could face similar pressures within his slim conference to more narrowly tailor a filibuster ban should Democrats provoke the GOP to act. We'll have to wait and see.  Of course, Republicans may be more Machiavellian than I've credited them. With unified Republican control, partisanship might lead the GOP to punish Democrats with a more extensive filibuster ban, regardless of how Democrats calibrate their use of the filibuster. When Republicans regained control of the Senate in 2015, they opted to keep the ban on nomination filibusters. Republicans internalized the new parliamentary regime quickly. As Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) argued, ""I think it's well within the traditions of the Senate for a majority to decide nominations and a supermajority to decide legislation."" Will Republicans still distinguish between nominations and legislation? Democrats' behavior will shape a GOP decision about going nuclear, as will Republican calculations about their own electoral interests, party goals and the potential burden of carrying legislative water for President Trump. Killing off filibusters to secure the Trump agenda is not a done deal."

Emboldened Republican lawmakers are already considering ways to test Iran's resolve to live up to the deal. As a candidate, Trump issued a variety of statements about last year's pact. He called it ""stupid,"" a ""lopsided disgrace"" and the ""worst deal ever negotiated,"" railing against its time-limited restrictions on Iran's enrichment of uranium and other nuclear activity, and exaggerating the scale of U.S. concessions. Trump said that he doesn't want to simply tear up the agreement. Instead, he spoke of reopening the diplomacy and declared that unlike President Barack Obama's diplomats, he would have been prepared to walk away from talks. Trump's exact plans are vague, however, and a renegotiation would be difficult. Iran has little incentive to open talks over a deal it is satisfied with. And none of the other countries in the seven-nation accord has expressed interest in picking apart an understanding that took more than a decade of stop-and-go diplomacy and almost two full years of negotiation to complete. As Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said: If the U.S. tears up the agreement, ""we will light it on fire."" President Hassan Rouhani said this week no country could simply change what was agreed, pointing to a U.N. Security Council resolution that endorsed the package. The deal, which went into effect in January, forced Iran to pull back from the brink of nuclear weapons capacity in exchange for an end to many of the U.S. and European sanctions that devastated Iran's economy. It has been largely respected despite undiminished U.S.-Iranian tensions throughout the Middle East, including their support for rival sides in Syria and Yemen's civil wars. Each side has leverage: Iran doesn't want a new onslaught of U.S.-led economic pressure and America would be alarmed by any Iranian escalation of its nuclear program. But the accord rests on fragile ground, with powerful constituencies in Washington and Tehran vehemently opposed and looking for any excuse to break it apart. In such a climate, it's unclear what Trump's demands for a renegotiation might mean.  ""The agreement is valid only as long as all parties uphold it,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged Wednesday in the agency's first briefing since Trump's stunning election victory over Hillary Clinton to become the 45th president. Last summer, Walid Phares, a Trump adviser on the Middle East, said Trump wouldn't pull out of an agreement with America's ""institutional signature,"" but rather revise elements through one-on-one negotiations with Iran or with a larger grouping of allies. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the pro-deal Arms Control Association, said that re-litigating the deal would unsettle American allies, with no clear picture of what Trump would be trying to accomplish. Trump could also send the deal to Congress, whose Republican majority has opposed it. GOP lawmakers are examining a slew of possible actions. Among the likeliest pieces of legislation is one targeting sectors of Iran's economy supporting ballistic missile work, including those specifically exempted from sanctions under the nuclear deal. Another goes after Iran's Revolutionary Guard for its military activity in Syria and support of terrorism. Iran could use either as an excuse to push past the limits of the nuclear deal, which may partly explain Republican motivations. Trump has largely avoided talk of killing the agreement, but has said he would police the deal ""so tough they don't have a chance."" The U.N. nuclear agency has confirmed minor Iranian violations, specifically on its stockpiling of heavy water that can be used in plutonium production. It has faced no punishment. Iran also has repeatedly breached a ballistic missile ban that was extended for eight years under the nuclear deal, prompting some limited sanctions from Washington. The Obama administration has been hamstrung. Determined to protect the president's foreign policy legacy, it has gone above and beyond the agreement's stipulation that no new nuclear-related sanctions be introduced. When Yemen's Iran-backed Shiite rebels fired missiles at U.S. Navy vessels, the retaliatory action didn't extend to Tehran. Nor has Iran faced repercussions for joining Syria and Russia's offensive in Aleppo, which has drawn U.S. charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. And whenever top Iranian officials have complained about the speed and scope of their post-deal economic recovery, top Obama officials like Secretary of State John Kerry have served as pitchmen to international banks and companies hesitant about investing in Iran.  ""It is a whole new reality,"" said Mark Dubowitz, an Iran sanctions proponent at the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies. What does he expect from Trump? ""No more free lunches for the Iranians, no more unilateral concessions, no more excuses."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hernandez said in remarks at his residence in the capital that it was a ""transcendental and complex"" decision, one of the toughest decisions he had ever made. He added that his party asked him to run. Opposition leaders quickly rejected Hernandez's announcement. They dispute the validity of the ruling, arguing the court did not have the authority to modify the constitution. Salvador Nasralla, leader of the Anti-corruption Party, accused Hernandez of violating the constitution.  ""According to our fundamental rules, he is disqualified from aspiring to office again,"" Nasralla said. The issue of presidential re-election is politically charged in Honduras. In 2009, President Manuel Zelaya was deposed by the military for allegedly wanting to end the ban on second terms so he could run again.  ""Hernandez wants to be re-elected just on a whim, and we will defeat him at the polls,"" Zelaya said. Dozens of students, most of them wearing masks or bandannas to hide their faces, protested Hernandez's decision outside the National Autonomous University in eastern Tegucigalpa. Police repeatedly used tear gas to break up the demonstration, but the students regrouped to throw rocks and sticks, burn tires and block streets. Retired Gen. Romeo Vazquez, who led the coup against Zelaya, called Hernandez a ""traitor to the country."" Honduras' general election is scheduled for November 2017. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

President Barack Obama pledged a smooth transition of power.  ""We are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country,"" the president said of the president-elect, the man who spent years questioning Obama's birthplace and challenging the legitimacy of his presidency. Obama, who had declared Trump unfit for the presidency, invited him to the White House Thursday. Trump was uncharacteristically quiet in the aftermath of his triumph and made no public appearances Wednesday. He huddled with jubilant, sleep-deprived advisers at his eponymous skyscraper in Manhattan, beginning the daunting task of setting up an administration that will take power in just over two months. He also met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and took calls from supporters, family and friends, according to spokeswoman Hope Hicks. In Washington, Trump's scant transition team sprang into action, culling through personnel lists for top jobs and working through handover plans for government agencies. A person familiar with the transition operations said the personnel process was still in its early stages, but Trump's team was putting a premium on quickly filling key national security posts. According to an organizational chart for the transition obtained by The Associated Press, Trump was relying on experienced hands to help form his administration. National security planning was being led by former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who previously worked for the FBI. Domestic issues were being handled by Ken Blackwell, a former Cincinnati mayor and Ohio secretary of state. Trump was expected to consider several loyal supporters for top jobs, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani for attorney general or national security adviser and campaign finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker were also expected to be under consideration for foreign policy posts. After struggling for months with Trump's takeover of their party, Republican leaders embraced the businessman in victory. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was lukewarm in his support throughout the campaign, praised him for pulling off ""the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime.""  ""He just earned a mandate,"" Ryan declared. Indeed, Trump will take office in January with Congress fully in his party's control, giving him strength to try to pass his agenda and turn the Supreme Court in a conservative direction. Even Republicans were stunned by the scope of their electoral success, including many who had been privately predicting Trump's defeat. Clinton's emotions were raw as she addressed a crowd of supporters, eyes wet with tears, who gathered in a New York ballroom. She said the crushing loss was ""painful and it will be for a long time"" and acknowledged that the nation was ""more divided than we thought."" Still, Clinton was gracious in defeat, declaring that ""Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" With several million votes still to be counted, Clinton held a narrow lead in the nationwide popular vote. Most of the outstanding votes appeared to be in Democratic-leaning states, with the biggest chunk in California, a state Clinton overwhelmingly won. With almost 125 million votes counted, The Associated Press tally had Clinton with 47.7 percent and Trump with 47.5 percent. Trump's sweep of the battleground states that decided the election was commanding. He carried Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, three of the election's biggest prizes, and snatched reliably Democratic Pennsylvania and Wisconsin away from Clinton. Trump's support skewed older, male and overwhelmingly white. His supporters said they were deeply dissatisfied with the federal government and eager for change, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks. If Trump makes good on his campaign promises, the nation stands on the brink of sweeping change in domestic and foreign policy. He's pledged to repeal Obama's signature health care law and pull out of the landmark nuclear accord with Iran. He's vowed to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and temporarily ban immigration from nations with terror ties. It's unclear whether Trump, a highly unusual candidate, will embrace many of the traditions of the presidency. He'll enter the White House owning his own private jet as well as a hotel just blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue. He never allowed journalists to fly on his plane during the campaign, as is customary for White House nominees. Issues of transparency bubbled up right from the start. On Wednesday evening, Trump aides said they would not bring the press corps to Washington with the president-elect for his meeting with Obama, breaking long-standing protocol. Global stock markets and U.S. stock futures plunged early Wednesday on word of Trump's election, but later recovered. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.4 percent for the day in trading in New York. World leaders congratulated Trump on his victory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had a contentious relationship with Obama, called the Republican a ""true friend of Israel."" British Prime Minister Theresa May said the U.S. and United Kingdom would remain ""strong and close partners on trade, security and defense."" Russian President Vladimir Putin was among the first to reach out to the incoming American leader. Trump praised Putin throughout the campaign and advocated a closer relationship with Russia, despite Moscow's provocations in Ukraine and elsewhere. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of hacking Democratic organizations during the campaign, actions Clinton's team saw as an indication that Putin was trying to meddle in the election. Trump notably did not accept the conclusions of intelligence officials. ___ Associated Press writers Bradley Klapper, Catherine Lucey, Jonathan Lemire, Lisa Lerer and Jill Colvin contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Lawyers standing by in case outcome is muddled.	"   Judge Charles Burton, chairman of the Palm Beach County canvassing board, holds up the last ballot the board was able to consider in the manual recount of ballots at the Palm Beach County Emergency Operations Center on Nov. 26, 2000. (Charles Rex Arbogast/AP)    This extraordinary, anxiety-inducing election will finally and mercifully be over in just a matter of hours -- unless, infernally, it's not. There are scenarios, unlikely but not impossible, that could create a muddled outcome, possibly involving voter intimidation, recounts, disputed ballots, faithless electors and (let's just put it out there) a full constitutional crisis. The electoral college typically exaggerates rather than overturns the outcome of the popular vote in a presidential election, but not always. The presidential race could potentially hinge on one, or just a few, state outcomes. Control of the Senate could  plausibly come down to a single race. ""We're all going to go on vacation in another 36 hours. I hope vacation,"" Theodore Olson, the prominent Republican attorney who represented George W. Bush before the U.S. Supreme Court during the 2000 Florida recount battle, said Monday afternoon. ""If you really want to make your head spin, think about two close states. That's just nuts. That's Florida squared,"" said Mike Carvin, who argued Bush's case before the Florida Supreme Court. Olson and Carvin were among the partisan lawyers who converged on Tallahassee, the state capital, as soon as everyone realized that Bush and Vice President Al Gore were virtually tied, with Bush holding an initial lead of fewer than 1,800 votes, even as reports of voting and ballot anomalies abounded and Florida's electoral votes served as the difference between victory and defeat for either candidate.   [State officials prepare for an unusually chaotic Election Day]   Heather Gerken, a professor of law at Yale Law School, said a recount is more likely in the Senate races than in the presidential race. If there is a disputed outcome in the presidential race, the Democrats would have a clear advantage simply in terms of lawyers standing by, ready to be deployed, she said. ""The Democrats have a standing army,"" she said. ""It's a highly professional system. The Trump people, as far as I can tell, don't have that. If you want a recount, you have to have good evidence, you have to have good lawyers, and you have to be prepared in advance."" The Florida recount lasted five weeks and ended only when the U.S. Supreme Court ordered vote-counting stopped by a 5-to-4 margin and effectively awarded the presidency to Bush. That kind of recount battle is one of the many ways the presidential election could have an uncertain outcome. For example, Clinton and Trump could be tied at 269 in electoral votes. That would throw the election to the House of Representatives, where each state delegation has one vote. ""Wyoming gets one vote and California gets one vote, and if you do the math, that would be a very good scenario for Trump,"" Carvin said. The most confounding scenario involves the electoral college and ""faithless electors."" The Constitution created the electoral college as an intermediate step in the election of a president; when people vote for a candidate, they are really voting for electors who are pledged to support that candidate. The Constitution does not mandate that these electors abide by their pledges, though some states have passed laws trying to prevent the breaking of the pledge. Faithless electors have been extremely rare and have never overturned the voters' choice, but election-law experts warn that this issue has never been fully litigated and could lead to a disputed outcome. A presidential election, though nationally consequential, falls under the ""All Politics Is Local"" rule. Under the Constitution, a president is chosen through 51 separate elections among the states and the District of Columbia. These elections are typically run by county election boards and often lightly trained volunteers in precincts. The voting machines and the laws governing elections vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. ""It's a point in time where tens of millions of people, all on the same day, are showing up to vote. The bureaucratic infrastructure you need to mount an election is massive,"" said Michael Morley, an expert in election law at Barry University School of Law in Orlando. ""These are people who are taking time out of their lives, who undergo some training, they're sometimes put in a high-pressure situation, and mistakes are made."" Olson echoed that, saying of the U.S. election system: ""I think it's vastly, overwhelmingly clean and fair and decent and honest. But there are people involved in the process, so you can have innocent errors, and you can also have capricious errors."" Jonathan Turley, a professor of constitutional law at George Washington University, said changes in election procedures and the widespread adoption of electronic voting machines makes it unlikely that we'll see a repeat of Florida's 2000 fiasco, in which there was furious debate over ""hanging chads"" and ""pregnant chads"" -- partially perforated or dimpled paper ballots. But Turley said the electronic machines introduce their own set of issues. ""With the hanging chads, there was a physical paper to observe and debate as to its meaning. With these electronic systems, you simply don't have that, so questions about hacking and other types of malfeasance tend to be magnified in the views of many voters,"" Turley said. ""With all the talk about rigged elections, the new electronic systems are likely to fuel rather than reduce those concerns."""
