The ruling against Yahia Qalash, the head of Egypt's press union, and board members Khaled el-Balshy and Gamal Abdel-Rahem, comes after a seven-month trial. The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the conviction, saying the ruling is a ""punishment"" and called upon authorities to ensure that journalists work without ""fear of reprisal."" The case goes back to April when the security forces raided the syndicate to arrest two journalists, who were wanted over protests against the president's decision to transfer Egyptian sovereignty of two strategic Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. The move infuriated journalists. They staged protests and demanded the interior minister's resignation, as well as a presidential apology. Instead, Qalash and two others were detained and charged for harboring the wanted men inside the press syndicate building. Following the verdict, heavy security forces were deployed to the headquarters of the syndicate in downtown Cairo, amid calls for protests. Later in the day, dozens of journalists staged a sit-in outside the syndicate and chanted slogans, such as: ""Are we in a state or a jungle?"" Courts have since struck down and annulled el-Sissi's decision to transfer the islands to Saudi Arabia. Also on Saturday, a Giza Court sentenced in absentia three TV presenters to three years in prison each, on charges of spreading false news, disturbing public safety, and inciting sectarian tension. The three TV hosts, Mohammed Nasser, Moatz Matar, and Hisham Abdullah, are vocal el-Sissi critics and believed to be pro-Islamist. Their TV shows appear on el-Sharq network, which is said to be financed by Qatar and aired from Turkey. Turkey and Qatar are rivals of Egypt's el-Sissi, giving refuge to leaders and members of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood group, from which ousted President Morsi hails. Defendants tried in absentia in Egypt typically receive maximum penalties, but receive an automatic retrial usually ending with lighter sentences if they turn themselves in. The crackdown on press and speech freedoms intensified under Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the military ouster of the Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Many journalists and TV hosts were banned from appearing on TV, deported, or had their shows canceled. Reporters and photographers were arrested, detained, and tried over alleged links to Islamists. El-Sissi has been intolerant of criticism in the press and repeatedly said that stability and national security were a prerequisite for democracy. The tight security grip might have proven effective in preventing large-scale violence from reaching central Cairo, however smaller, low-level attacks have persisted. Elsewhere, a six-year-old child was killed Saturday and a second injured when a home-made bomb exploded in the child's apartment in Cairo's slum district of Menshiyat Nasr, where the city's garbage collectors work. The Interior Ministry identified the child as Abanoub Milad, and said he found the ""ball-shaped improvised bomb"" while playing with his friend and brought it back to the apartment. It wasn't immediately clear where the bomb came from or who manufactured it. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at a rally in Durham, N.H., as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton listens on Sept. 28. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  In the wreckage of Hillary Clinton's unexpected loss, liberal lawmakers and advocacy groups have started plotting a major overhaul of the Democratic National Committee, with the aim of using the staid organization to reconnect the party with working-class voters it lost to President-elect Donald Trump. Much of the talk since Tuesday's election has focused on selecting a new chairman, with the most frequently mentioned successor being Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who backed the primary bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). On Thursday afternoon, former Vermont governor Howard Dean (D) offered his service for a second tenure as DNC chairman, saying on Twitter: ""The dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.""  The dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again. -- Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) November 10, 2016  In an interview, Sanders said he is lobbying for Ellison and argued that the DNC needs to be reoriented so that it becomes less of an insiders' club ""preoccupied"" with raising money and more of an advocate for the concerns of the working class.   [Democrats face a power outage in Washington -- and an identity crisis]   ""You can't tell working people you're on their side while at the same time you're raising money from Wall Street and the billionaire class,"" Sanders said. ""The Democratic Party has to be focused on grass-roots America and not wealthy people attending cocktail parties."" Sanders acknowledged the need for the party to continue its function as a fundraising vehicle but suggested a model akin to his presidential campaign, which raised much of its money from small-dollar donors. ""Millions of people are willing to put in 20 bucks, 30 bucks, 50 bucks if there's a party to believe in,"" Sanders said. With Clinton's loss, the DNC chairman is certain to become a more visible face of the Democratic Party, and the contest to replace interim chairwoman Donna Brazile could become a wide-open affair. Had Clinton won, she would have nominated a successor, and it was expected to be someone close to her.   [Trump's victory exposes Obama's inability to connect with white working class]   In a conference call Thursday night with members of the liberal grass-roots group Democracy for Action, Ellison said he would make an announcement Monday about whether he will be a candidate for DNC chairman. He said he was eager to help the party organize going forward. ""My shoelaces are tied up tight, and I'm ready to get out on that court,"" Ellison said. Leaders of several progressive groups, who had been courting Clinton as a potential ally on many of their causes, have expressed anger in the aftermath of the election, arguing that the result was a repudiation of a campaign driven by the Democratic establishment. ""The Democratic establishment had their chance with this election,"" said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ""It's time for new leadership of the Democratic Party -- younger, more diverse and more ideological -- that is hungry to do things differently, like leading a movement instead of dragging people to the polls."" Taylor said her organization would be supportive of a DNC chairmanship of Ellison, whose choice, others suggested, would convey an important symbolic message during the presidency of Trump, who has proposed temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country. Ellison is a Muslim. Neil Sroka, a spokesman for the liberal group Democracy for America, said Ellison would be ""a potentially phenomenal choice"" as DNC chairman, but said the organization was open to other choices, provided they weren't part of the party establishment. ""I think Tuesday night was a tremendous loss that must sit at the feet of the political establishment of a Democratic Party that preordained the primary process from the very beginning,"" said Sroka, whose group backed Sanders in the primaries. ""The folks that enabled the loss need to step back and let the grass roots lead it."" In a sign of tension at the DNC, a staff meeting there was interrupted Thursday by a staff member who stood up and blamed Trump's win on Brazile, the Huffington Post reported. ""Why should we trust you as chair to lead us through this?"" asked the staffer, identified only as Zach, according to the report. Sanders said the reasons for Clinton's loss were ""fairly obvious"" and cited two factors: lower turnout by the Democratic base and the Republican nominee's far greater appeal to white, working-class voters, which Sanders dubbed ""a humiliation for the Democratic Party."" ""White working-class people are deserting the party in droves,"" Sanders said. Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who with Ellison co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, gave a similar diagnosis, saying Clinton's loss was ""a function of not understanding the electorate."" He argued that the DNC now needs to become a voice for ""economic empowerment"" to start wooing back voters lost to Trump. ""I think you need to clean house at the DNC, no question about it,"" Grijalva said. ""You're going to need a DNC that is not just a money collector and employment agency for consultants and pollsters. They have to be advocates, and not just conduits. The DNC should be both an organizing tool and an advocacy tool."""

(Yuri Gripas/AFP/Getty Images)  Remember when America had that election and it got super weird, like a flesh-eating bacteria in the body politic, and it went on and on until we just wanted someone to club us over the head, repeatedly, until we were collectively comatose?  Enough with all that. Begone. Vaccinations for everyone, and let's bring in a shaman, and burn some sage, and down a whiskey shot, and bid this election goodbye. ""I didn't even cry at my wedding, but I just cried in there,"" said Aditi Gorur, emerging from her polling location at a D.C. elementary school. ""One, because this was my first vote as an American citizen. Two, because this election is finally over."" ""I am a Type 1 diabetic,"" said Gary Robinson, who came out a few minutes later. ""Do you have any idea what this election did to my [blood sugar] levels?"" Yes, half of you hate how the results turned out. Yes, the pollsters and political media screwed the pooch, and the election turned out differently than most expected it to. Yes, the country is barely Scotch-taped together and we have months of repairs ahead of us. But there is a bright side -- there are portions of this election that we never, ever have to go through again. Goodbye to debates. Goodbye to October surprises.  Goodbye to the people we became, the odd, shrieking, body-snatcher versions of ourselves who unfriended our kindergarten teachers and went on tirades about border walls, and were just so, so very tired and crabby. ""If you met me in person, you wouldn't recognize me as the person I've been presenting myself to be on social media,"" says Don Moynihan, a professor of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin. ""I wouldn't constantly be talking about politics. I wouldn't be sarcastic toward whatever the breaking news was of the day."" The low point of his personal election experience came when he found himself agitatedly firing up his laptop to live-tweet one of the presidential debates.  ""At the time it all seemed so normal,"" Moynihan says. (That, of course, was the most hideous part of all of this; it started to seem so normal to settle in every night and tune our default setting to ""rage."")  ""I think that some fever will break now,"" Moynihan says. ""And we'll come out of this as if from a dream."" Goodbye to all the worst things we assumed about each other, to all the fetid political rumors we passed on without vetting, to all the times we could have sought to understand an issue and instead chose to underestimate it, then mock it, then tell the people who believed in it that they were Hitler. We moaned and fretted that this election had turned us into terrible people; in fact it revealed the terribleness that has always been a part of this country, and of human nature itself. Fear, and disdain, and a misguided belief that one person couldn't be lifted up in this world unless another person was beaten down.       It's been a long election season, but there were some great moments; here are a few of our favorites. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Wouldn't it be nice if we could say goodbye to those impulses? Wouldn't it be nice, on the first day of a new American chapter, if we could at least pretend to try? We won't miss polling numbers, and we won't miss the new polling numbers telling us the old polling numbers were wrong. We won't miss the Trump signs that had been graffiti'd into ""Rump"" signs; we won't miss the Hillarys that became ""Killary.""

""I want to see people get back into some routines and patterns,"" says Dwight Bain, the director of a Florida mental-health agency who has written about election anxiety. ""This election does not have to destroy us. Practice daily, healthy rituals.""

""At the time it all seemed so normal,"" Moynihan says. (That, of course, was the most hideous part of all of this; it started to seem so normal to settle in every night and tune our default setting to ""rage."")  ""I think that some fever will break now,"" Moynihan says. ""And we'll come out of this as if from a dream."" Goodbye to all the worst things we assumed about each other, to all the fetid political rumors we passed on without vetting, to all the times we could have sought to understand an issue and instead chose to underestimate it, then mock it, then tell the people who believed in it that they were Hitler. We moaned and fretted that this election had turned us into terrible people; in fact it revealed the terribleness that has always been a part of this country, and of human nature itself. Fear, and disdain, and a misguided belief that one person couldn't be lifted up in this world unless another person was beaten down.       It's been a long election season, but there were some great moments; here are a few of our favorites. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   Wouldn't it be nice if we could say goodbye to those impulses? Wouldn't it be nice, on the first day of a new American chapter, if we could at least pretend to try? We won't miss polling numbers, and we won't miss the new polling numbers telling us the old polling numbers were wrong. We won't miss the Trump signs that had been graffiti'd into ""Rump"" signs; we won't miss the Hillarys that became ""Killary."" The past year has brought forth a hundred new terms and catchphrases, and initially we wondered which of them we should commit into the Smithsonian to help future generations understand 2016.  And then we realized: None of them. We don't want to keep a thing.  ""Surrogates."" Goodbye to that vaguely dystopian-sounding term referring to people who came onto news shows and parroted their candidates' positions.   ""Dumpster fire."" Goodbye to dumpster fire, which was never the right phrase anyway, because dumpster fires can be contained, whereas this election was a rampant forest fire of the soul. ""Pivot."" Goodbye. ""Bigly."" Goodbye.  ""Private email server."" Goodbye. (Hello again. Goodbye again. Oh, hi again.)  ""Deplorables."" ""Lock her up.""  ""Disavowing.""  ""Like, how big is something before you have to disavow it?"" asks Jean Stanula, a nonprofit worker in Chicago, about the word that appeared whenever a candidate was accused of doing something bad. ""Does it have to be particularly heinous? Otherwise can you just say you disapprove? Or you disagree? Disavow seems like a word Moses would have used, but it is definitely not a word I would ever use in my own life. If I screwed up in a relationship, I would never be like, 'Baby, I'm sorry, I disavow my behavior.' ""  Ministers have been worried about us, their collective flock. A website on topical sermons offers one called ""When the Election Is Over,"" and suggests reminding people that their true citizenship is in heaven -- Ephesians 2:19. Mental-health experts have been worried about us, their collective patients, and the toll the election has taken on our psyches.  ""I want to see people get back into some routines and patterns,"" says Dwight Bain, the director of a Florida mental-health agency who has written about election anxiety. ""This election does not have to destroy us. Practice daily, healthy rituals."" He is reminded of watching an old movie in which one character gives birth and the menfolk are instructed to boil water and rip up bedsheets.  ""I asked my wife, why are they doing that?"" he says. His wife speculated it was to give the characters something useful to do so they didn't panic.     Television crews fill parts of Lafayette Square Park, across the street from the White House, late on election day. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)   Go forth, America. Go forth and boil water. Use it to make a strong cup of tea and perhaps, with the bedsheets, a soothing poultice. We'll move on and adjust. We always do. ""I'm so looking forward to my Facebook page returning to normal,"" says Cheri Ziegra, a dollmaker from New Hampshire. ""As much as we used to say, 'Not another kitten video' -- I've missed the kittens. I've missed the babies and the toddlers. Show me what you're having for dinner. Those posts, like, 'I have an ugly mole growing on my foot and it's kind of black, what do you think it is?' Show me your foot! Let's talk about that. Let's talk about anything but the election."" Goodbye to the ulcers we gave ourselves, worrying about our insane relatives who would not see the truth. Goodbye to Jill Stein. ""Super predators."" ""I'm With Her."" ""Trump That Bitch."" Goodbye. Ziegra, a registered Democrat, is married to a lifelong Republican whom she persuaded to vote for Hillary Clinton, but not without moments of strife and difficult conversation. She is relieved to be done with that period of life.      ""I've really, really missed the kittens,"" she says.  "

""This is it!"" declared Vicki Slater on Tuesday, as the sun rose in this deeply conservative state with the country's worst record for electing women. ""We need a win today. We need a win!"" Slater spoke as she drove her red Chevy to Highland Chapel, the church where she was voting. She had eight Hillary Clinton campaign signs left to stick in the ground nearby. Her stomach growled, but she was too nervous to eat. When you are waiting for history, it's hard to sleep. She'd been up since 5 a.m. To help Clinton become the nation's first female president, the Democratic national committeewoman had sent thousands of emails, raised money for her and spoken to crowds on her behalf. On Monday, she even drove to downtown Jackson and prayed on the lawn of the state capitol. She knew it would be tough for Clinton to win her state. Never once has a woman been elected as governor or to Congress, making it the only state in the union with that distinction.   Slater, who ran for governor of Mississippi last year, looks at her old campaign signs stacked in the garage of her home. She lost to a man in the Democratic primary. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)  Women haven't done much better at the state level, either. They make up just 13.2 percent of the state legislature -- ranking Mississippi dead last in the nation, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.  [She was born the day women got the vote]  So last year Slater, a 60-year-old trial lawyer, decided to run for governor herself after years of trying to recruit other women to do it. She was widely seen as the favorite to win the Democratic Party's nomination. But she lost in the primary to a man, a long-haul truck driver who campaigned so little that his own mother didn't know he was running. Stunned party officials said several factors were at play, including Slater's gender. The Republican incumbent, Phil Bryant, easily won reelection. ""I am the woman from Mississippi who lost to the truck driver!"" Slater told Clinton when she met her at a fundraiser in the spring. ""Don't give up. Do not ever give up,"" Clinton told her. Maybe, Slater thought, if the country elected a woman to the White House, it would make it easier for female candidates in Mississippi, too.   From left, Vicki Slater, Will Godfrey and Bobby Moak watch returns come in at a Democratic watch party on Election Night in Jackson, Miss. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)  ""All right, Hillary, here we go!"" she said after her phone bleeped with yet another text. It was her daughter reporting that the voting line wrapped twice around the building -- despite a light rain. ""Here there are 10 times the normal amount of cars!"" Slater responded. ""I think that's good. I hope it's good!"" One woman driving by honked her approval as Slater, wearing a blue shirt with ""HILLARY"" on the back, used her pink running shoes to stomp the last of her 1,000 Clinton signs into the rain-soaked ground. Although she could have walked into the church to cast her vote, she decided to go home to change clothes. It was a historic day. She was going to vote for a woman for president. She wanted to be dressed for it. ""In unity with Hillary and Pantsuit Nation, I am wearing a pantsuit,"" she vowed as she drove home. She emerged from her bedroom not just in a black pantsuit but wearing a string of pearls as a nod to Michelle Obama. She put a tiny ring that belonged to her mother on her pinkie and wore the black pumps she twice re-heeled as she campaigned all over the state during her gubernatorial run. Madison, like the rest of the state, usually votes Republican. And Mississippi hadn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Still, Slater said she knew some Republican women were going to vote for Clinton. ""They're just doing it secretly,"" she explained, because of the strong anti-Clinton sentiment in their church and golf circles. None of them, she said, have forgotten listening to Trump boast on an ""Access Hollywood"" video that he could kiss, grope and grab women because he is a star. Suddenly, she teared up, talking haltingly about what a man tried to do to her when she was 16. He forced her into a house, she said, but she managed to get away from him.  [Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005]  ""Trump has brought up a lot of trauma for women,"" said Slater, who has three children, three stepchildren and seven grandchildren. But she wasn't just appalled by Trump. ""A woman in the White House will change the way people see women, the potential for women, the potential for their daughters,"" she said. ""This is bigger than politics."" People have told her a man should talk to the jury, not her. ""They say, 'We need a man in here to land a big verdict,' "" she said. Back at her polling place, she showed her driver's license and stood behind 29 people, holding her voting card. Her hand was shaking slightly. She touched the screen that said Clinton and an ""x"" appeared beside her name. She smiled and cast the rest of her votes. ""I just voted! It felt so good,"" she told her friend Cindy Mitchell, who called as she left the polls. ""But I saw the look on the construction worker voting next to me. There are more white men voting than I have ever seen."" Her phone kept ringing. Other women were reporting technical difficulties at one polling place on the coast. Not enough ballots in another. She called her 78-year-old mother. ""Mama, I will be there at 2 p.m.!"" she said. But first, she needed to lie down. She was already emotionally drained. When she arrived at her mother's assisted-living facility, she found Nancy Robinson sitting in a leather rocking chair. ""Remember Daddy didn't like it because Hillary Clinton kept her maiden name?"" Slater asked her mom. She imitated what she often hears from Clinton's critics: "" 'There is something about her I just don't like.' Well, that's just code for 'She is a woman.' "" ""Mama, do you think she might win?"" ""I just don't know,"" said her mother, turning down the volume on the local TV station and studying her daughter's exhausted face. As the polls closed at 7 p.m., Slater walked into Hal and Mal's in Jackson -- the same restaurant where she'd waited for the returns in her gubernatorial race. Democratic activists watched the returns and grew increasingly nervous.  ""What in the hell is going on in Florida?"" one demanded loudly.  Then more bad news for Clinton in Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa.  ""The FBI agents need to be tried for treason,"" Slater said, still upset about the FBI's decision to reopen its investigation into Clinton's emails, then close it again.  As the unease grew, Slater decided to head home. On the way out, a friend told her to take the life-size cutout of Clinton at the door. Slater tucked it under her arm. Back home, she flipped on the TV. Florida was called for Trump.  ""Aaaargh!"" Slater cried out, slamming her fist on an armchair. After midnight, it was too painful to watch any longer.  ""I am so disappointed,"" she said. ""I thought I was living in one country, and now I realize it is another. America changed tonight.""    "
