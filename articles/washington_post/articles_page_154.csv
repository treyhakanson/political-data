Police say that Giorgos Germenis was sitting at a cafe in a northern Athens suburb when he was attacked on Saturday. He was given first aid at a nearby pharmacy and then went to a hospital to be examined. Germenis has released a video where he claims he resisted about 30 individuals and caused them to flee. In the video, his face appears slightly bruised, with no major injuries. Before he was elected, in 2012, Germenis was known as a bassist in a Greek-Norwegian black metal band.

A ceremony outside Montenegro's capital, Podgorica, included a memorial service for 64 German soldiers already buried at the cemetery. Hundreds more are expected to be laid to rest in the coming months.  ""We are standing by the freshly dug graves of 64 German soldiers who died in a war ... that ended more than 70 years ago,"" said Daniela Schily, from Germany's War Graves Commission. ""It ... illustrates the past never simply goes away."" About 2,000 German soldiers are believed to have been killed between 1941 and 1945 in Montenegro in clashes with Yugoslav communist partisans. About 500 have been unearthed so far, including 400 from a site excavated by construction workers in 2007 in a Podgorica suburb. The remaining soldiers are still considered missing. Their names are among those engraved on a crescent-shaped wall surrounding a massive cross at the cemetery in Golubovci. Wilhelm Sundermeier, 76, cried as he found the name of his father on the wall.  ""I still hope his remains will be found,"" he said. The idea of a German cemetery has been met with resistance from anti-fascist groups. About a dozen former Montenegrin partisans protested Saturday, carrying banners and chanting anti-fascist slogans. Schily said her commission was aware of the ""horrendous crimes"" committed against civilians in Montenegro during the German Nazi occupation. The German delegation laid a wreath earlier Saturday for more than 500 men, women and children killed by the Nazis in 1943 in Doli, northern Montenegro. Montenegrin government official Snezana Radovic said the opening of the cemetery was meant to deliver an anti-war message and serve as a reminder.  ""It also bears the message of reconciliation between people and strengthening of ties between the Montenegrin and German nations,"" she said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Organizers in Manhattan carried signs in English and Spanish saying things like ""Hate won't make us great,"" and chanted, ""We are here to stay."" More than 1,000 people joined the march that started mid-afternoon and extended into the evening. It was the latest in days of demonstrations across the country, and even throughout the world. Protests were held Sunday in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia and more cities. Several hundred protesters Sunday marched around Philadelphia's City Hall and then down Market Street to Independence Mall, carrying signs and chanting ""Donald Trump has got to go!"" and ""This is what democracy looks like."" In Los Angeles, a few hundred people gathered outside CNN's Los Angeles headquarters, and in San Francisco, hundreds of people, including many families with children, marched from Golden Gate Park to Ocean Beach chanting ""Love trumps hate!"" On Saturday, an estimated 8,000 marched through downtown. In Oregon, police said they arrested 71 people late Saturday and early Sunday during anti-Trump protests downtown. The Portland Police Bureau said most protesters were cited for disorderly conduct and failing to obey an officer. Demonstrations also took place internationally. On Saturday, a group of Mexicans at statue representing independence in Mexico City expressed their concerns about a possible wave of deportations. One school teacher said it would add to the ""unrest"" that's already in Mexico. About 300 people protested Trump's election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy near the landmark Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Mostly, the demonstrations were peaceful. However, in Portland, Oregon, a man was shot and wounded Saturday morning during a confrontation. Police arrested two teenagers in the shooting. ___ This story has been corrected to show Los Angeles police arrested five people downtown, not by the Walk of Fame.

Igor Dodon, who has promised to restore closer ties with Moscow and made comments in Russian immediately after the polls closed Sunday , had just over 54 percent of the votes, with more than 98 percent of the ballots tallied. His rival Maia Sandu, an ex-World Bank official who ran on an anti-corruption platform, had nearly 46 percent.  ""Everyone understands that I have won,"" he said later in Romanian just after midnight. He thanked Sandu for waging a ""tough but good fight"" and said he would be a president for all Moldovans. Dodon tapped into popular anger over corruption under the pro-European government that came to power in 2009, particularly over the approximately $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks before the 2014 parliamentary elections. As results came in, Dodon urged Moldovans to be calm.  ""We don't need destabilization and we don't need confrontation, which somebody is trying to do,"" he said, speaking in Russian after polls closed. ""We're all living in one country, in Moldova. The next president should find this balance."" Dodon has pledged to restore trade and political relations with Moscow which cooled after Moldova signed a trade association agreement with the European Union. Russia punished Moldova by placing an embargo on imports of Moldovan fruit, wine and vegetables. He was able to appeal to many older Moldovans who are nostalgic for the former Soviet Union. Sandu, a former education minister who heads the Action and Solidarity Party, said the former Soviet Republic would have a more prosperous future in the EU. She needed a high turnout to stand a chance of winning. The final turnout was 53.3 percent, more than 4 percentage points higher than in the first-round of the election, but a discouraging result for Sandu. Sandu called for the resignation of authorities organizing the vote and said the elections had been badly organized.  ""Hundreds of people were not able to vote. Hundreds of citizens that traveled a long journey, that waited in the cold and rain and were not able to vote,"" she said after polls closed. ""Moldovan authorities didn't respect the constitutional right of Moldovan citizens of Moldova to be able to vote."" She said she would speak further on Monday. In an unusual development, 9,000 people voted in the separatist pro-Russian region of Trans-Dniester, where residents usually do not vote in Moldovan elections. Moldovans lined up for hours to vote in Paris, Milan, Dublin and the London borough of Stratford, where about 700 Moldovans were unable to cast ballots. Election authorities said ballots had run out in Stratford, Bucharest, Moscow and Bologna, Italy. One electoral official in the Moldovan capital Chisinau, Sergiu Gurduza, apologized that some people had not been able to vote. Dodon, who nearly won the election outright in the first round two weeks ago, has also pledged to seek good relations with Moldova's neighbors, Romania and Ukraine. But he has been criticized in Ukraine for saying Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, is Russian territory. Many Moldovans believe they need the Russian market for their agricultural exports. About half of the 800,000 Moldovans working abroad live in Russia and send remittances home. Moldova also depends on Russian gas, although not as much as before. There are plans to extend a pipeline to transport Romanian gas to Chisinau. ___ Alison Mutler in Bucharest, Romania, contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

That's according to a spokesman for the former president and husband of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The spokesman says the former president congratulated Trump during the brief call on Thursday and wished him well. ___ 6:17 p.m. The White House says Vice President Joe Biden talked to Mike Pence Thursday about the key duties of vice president and well as specific policy portfolios he has worked on, including the NATO alliance, eastern Europe and expanding access to the middle class. The White House says in describing the meeting that the two men spoke in the vice president's office in the West Wing and that they reminisced about their friendship dating back to when they served in Congress. The White House says Biden offered his full support to the vice president-elect to ensure a seamless transition to power and that he invited the Pence family to join him and his wife for dinner on the grounds of the Naval Observatory, which is where the vice president traditionally resides. ___ 5:13 p.m. Donald Trump has picked a longtime friend and private equity executive to lead his inauguration efforts. Tom Barrack, who founded California-based firm Colony Capital, has been selected to serve as chairman of the President-elect's inaugural committee. That's according to two sources with direct knowledge of the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions. Barrack has been an aggressive public supporter of Trump throughout the campaign. He was among the primetime speakers at Trump's nominating convention this summer. The inaugural chairman is responsible for raising millions of dollars to fund the inauguration, which includes several major parties and an extensive entertainment program. Barrack's office declined a request for comment. He told CBS ""This Morning"" on Thursday that Trump was like an ultimate fighter during the campaign who used ""whatever tools necessary to convey a really disruptive message."" He said America would see ""a softer, kinder"" Trump now that he's won the presidency. -- By Steve Peoples and Julie Bykowicz ___ 5:12 p.m. The president of the United Auto Workers says the union's views on trade align with Donald Trump's, and he'd like a meeting with the president-elect to talk about it. Dennis Williams says he agrees with Trump's call for scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has sent auto jobs to Mexico. He also backs Trump's proposal for a 35 percent tariff on vehicles imported from Mexico. The UAW has historically supported Democratic candidates and endorsed Hillary Clinton this year. But Michigan, which has the most auto workers of any state, narrowly voted for Trump in unofficial results. Internal polling of union members prior to the election showed 28 percent going for Trump with 6 percent undecided. Williams says Trump's total may actually have been slightly higher than the 31 percent who voted for Mitt Romney and 33 percent who went for John McCain. ___ 5 p.m. As President-elect Donald Trump puts together his White House, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and top campaign aide Kellyanne Conway are emerging as possible picks for chief of staff. That's according to two people familiar with the transition planning. Conway, a prominent Republican pollster, served as Trump's third campaign chief of staff and developed a strong rapport with the candidate. Priebus embraced Trump after his nomination, despite concerns among other Republicans, and worked his way into his inner circle. A third person with knowledge of the transition process says conservative media executive Steve Bannon is also in the mix for chief of staff. However, others insist Bannon would not have a White House role. Those involved in the process insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly. A decision on chief of staff is expected in the coming days. -- By Julie Pace, Julie Bykowicz and Steve Peoples ___ 3:35 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump says his top three priorities are immigration, health care and jobs.  ""Big-league jobs,"" he says. Trump spoke briefly with reporters Thursday after meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol. Trump is wrapping up his first trip to Washington since winning Tuesday's election. He's been meeting with President Barack Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan. When a reporter asked if he would ask Congress to ban Muslims, Trump said ""Thank you everybody,"" and walked away. ___ 2:29 p.m. More than 100 protesters are holding a sit-in outside Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue as the president-elect meets with Republican leaders a few blocks away on Capitol Hill. The mostly student protesters are holding signs that say #stillwithher and Love Trumps Hate, a phrase that Hillary Clinton often used during her campaign against Trump. The demonstrators sat on the sidewalk outside Trump's new hotel, chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Stronger Together,"" a slogan of Clinton's campaign. Trump met earlier with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office near the hotel. ___ 2:15 p.m. House Speaker Paul Ryan says he and President-elect Donald Trump had a ""fantastic, productive meeting"" at the Capitol. Trump called the meeting ""an honor."" He added that, ""I think we're going to do some absolutely spectacular things for the American people."" Trump may have signaled early agenda items where the Republicans agree. He said: ""We can't get started fast enough, whether it's health care or immigration."" Ryan then took Trump, Melania Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence out onto his balcony overlooking the Mall. Ryan pointed to where the inaugural platform being is built. That's where Trump will be sworn in. Trump at one point gestured toward the tower of his new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol. ___ 2:10 p.m. First lady Michelle Obama and incoming first lady Melania Trump have spoken about the challenges of raising children in the White House. Mrs. Trump's 10-year-old son Barron Trump will become a teenager during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says that's ""a rather unique childhood."" He pointed out that Mrs. Obama and President Barack Obama also had the experience of raising children in the White House. Earnest said Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Trump spoke about the experience of being a good parent under those unique circumstances. He said the two women then walked to the Oval Office to visit with the president and the president-elect. ___ 2:05 p.m. Federal officials have imposed temporary flight restrictions over Vice President-elect Mike Pence's current home at the Indiana governor's residence. A Federal Aviation Administration notice dated Wednesday prohibits most aircraft from flying below 1,500 feet within a one-mile radius of the governor's residence in Indianapolis. It says military aircraft supporting the Secret Service are exempt, along with police and emergency aircraft. The FAA generally issues temporary restrictions when there's a special event or hazardous condition. Similar limits have been issued for around Trump Tower in New York City. The notice says the Indianapolis air space restrictions are needed because of ""VIP movement."" They expire Jan. 21, the day after Pence becomes vice president. ___ 1:50 p.m. Donald Trump's first wife, Ivana, says she voted for her ex. She says he'll ""make big changes"" in the United States. Ivana Trump offered the comment when reached by phone by her fourth husband, Rossano Rubicondi, while he appeared on an Italian TV talk show. Ivana Trump is the mother of the president-elect's three oldest children. She married Rubicondi in 2008 and legally separated from him later that year. According to a news release from the ""Maurizio Costanzo Show,"" Ivana Trump said: ""Naturally I voted for Donald. He's a businessman who will make big changes."" The show is scheduled to air Sunday. ___ 1:10 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has spoken with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, her former House colleague. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said that Pelosi congratulated Pence on his win in their conversation Thursday. Hammill said: ""The two agreed on the need to find common ground and that they would meet in person in the weeks ahead."" Pence served in the House of Representatives before becoming governor of Indiana. ___ 1 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump has left the White House after his first meeting with President Barack Obama. Trump says it was the first time the two had ever met. For almost 90 minutes, they discussed the coming changeover of government. Trump said they had planned to meet for a much shorter period of time. While in Washington, Trump also plans to meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. As Trump and Obama met in the Oval Office, first lady Michelle Obama welcomed Trump's wife, Melania, to the White House residence. ___ 12:50 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump says he's looking forward to benefiting from President Barack Obama's ""counsel"" in the future. Trump was speaking at the end of his meeting Thursday with Obama in the Oval Office. He's suggesting he may turn to Obama for advice on governing. Trump said he looks forward to being with Obama ""many, many more times."" He said they discussed a host of topics. Trump said that Obama explained ""some of the difficulties"" but also ""some of the really great things that have been achieved."" Trump is noting that the meeting was expected to be short, but lasted almost 90 minutes. He said as far as he's concerned, it could have gone on much longer. ___ 12:45 p.m. President-elect Donald Trump says he ""very much looks forward"" to dealing with President Barack Obama in the future. Trump was meeting with Obama Thursday in the Oval Office. He called the meeting a ""great honor."" Trump noted that he and Obama haven't met each other before.

U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken in Eugene denied motions by the federal government and trade groups representing big energy companies to dismiss the lawsuit. They had argued that lawmakers and federal agencies, not by the court, should determine climate change policy. The plaintiffs, including 21 youths and climate scientist James Hansen, allege the federal government has known for decades that carbon pollution causes climate change but has failed to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They argue that the federal government's actions violate their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, and the government has violated its obligation to hold certain natural resources in trust for future generations. Julia Olson, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, called the judge's ruling significant and said the young activists are preparing for trial. The federal case is among a series of similar lawsuits, including one in Seattle, filed by youth plaintiffs working with Our Children's Trust, a nonprofit environmental group based in Eugene.  ""This case is the most significant in terms of the defendants. It's the United States, which is most responsible for causing climate change and the country best positioned to lead the world away from fossil fuels,"" said Olson, who is the group's executive director. The U.S. government as well as the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute, which intervened in the case, asked that the case be thrown out. After U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Coffin denied their motions to dismiss, the government and trade groups filed objections. The case then went before Aiken, who on Thursday adopted Coffin's recommendations and findings, allowing the case to proceed. In her ruling, Aiken wrote that ""this action is of a different order than the typical environmental case"" and she also noted that ""a deep resistance to change runs through defendants' and intervenors' arguments for dismissal."" The plaintiffs are seeking a court order that requires the government to create a plan to dramatically slash greenhouse gas emissions released by the burning of fossil fuels. A message to the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., and lawyers representing the trade associations were not immediately returned. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Trump on Thursday refused to allow journalists to travel with him to Washington for his historic first meeting with President Barack Obama and congressional leaders. The Republican's top advisers rebuffed news organizations' requests for a small ""pool"" of journalists to trail Trump as he attended meetings Washington. The decision was part of an opaque pattern in Trump's first moves since his victory Tuesday. Trump was entirely out of sight on Wednesday. His aides said he was huddled with advisers at his offices in New York. His team has not put out a daily schedule, or offered any detailed updates on how he has spent his time. They have not acknowledged phone calls or other contact with world leaders. When Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a congratulatory telegram to Trump on Wednesday, Moscow spread the word. A phone call with British Prime Minster Theresa May was announced in London. The pattern was repeated for calls with leaders of Israel, Egypt, South Korea and Australia. The White House typically releases statements on the president's phone calls with foreign leaders, providing some details about the conversation. Past presidents-elect have had early briefings with journalists, even in confusing first hours after Election Day. But early signs suggest Trump is willing to break protocol when it comes to press access and transparency. As a candidate, Trump railed against the press as ""disgusting"" and ""dishonest."" He refused to allow a pool of campaign reporters and photographers fly on his plane to events, sometimes starting his rallies before his press corps arrived. The practice did not extend to his running mate, Mike Pence, who was followed by a traditional pool of journalists. News organizations had tried for weeks to coordinate a pool of journalists to travel with Trump immediately after Election Day if he won. The Associated Press is among those reaching out to Trump advisers about press access. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the president-elect's team expects ""to operate a traditional pool and look forward to implementing our plans in the near future."" The White House Correspondents' Association, which coordinates press pools and advocates for transparency at the White House, urged Trump to allow journalists to cover his meetings and other movements.  ""This decision could leave Americans blind about his whereabouts and well-being in the event of a national crisis,"" said Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for Reuters and the group's president. ""Not allowing a pool of journalists to travel with and cover the next president of the United States is unacceptable."" Trump's meeting with Obama in the Oval Office was recorded by the pool of White House reporters, photographers and TV journalists who cover the president. Every president and president-elect in recent memory has traveled with a pool of journalists when they leave the White House grounds. A pool of reporters and photographers were in the motorcade when President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas. The pool was just steps away from President Ronald Reagan when he was shot outside a hotel in the District of Columbia, and was stationed outside his hospital as he recovered. The pool also travels on vacation and foreign trips and at times captures personal, historic moments of the presidency. The practice makes journalists eyewitnesses to how the president conducts business, rather than relying on secondhand accounts. It often captures more intimate moments between the president and people he greets. The White House, meanwhile, depends on having journalists near at all times to relay the president's first comments on breaking news. News organizations take turns serving in the small group, paying their way and sharing the material collected in the pool with the larger press corps. The pool also covers official events at the White House when space doesn't allow for the full press corps. Because of safety concerns, presidents and presidents-elect travel in a bubble of security, with the exact timing of their travel kept secret and streets often blocked off around their events. That leaves news organizations dependent on the White House to facilitate the pool coverage by arranging security clearances and transportation. Obama also has looked for new ways to limit White House press access. On Thursday, photographers were not allowed to shoot a meeting between first lady Michelle Obama and Melania Trump, who joined her husband on the White House visit. The White House released a photo taken by a staff photographer and circulated it on social media. The Associated Press does not distribute such photos. White House photographers were allowed to shoot a similar meeting between Mrs. Obama and then-first lady Laura Bush eight years ago. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The request was sent to lawmakers for consideration during the lame-duck session that starts next week. It's evenly divided between the Pentagon and the State Department and foreign aid accounts related to battling IS.  ""In addition to enhancing our effort to defeat ISIL, this plan would fund the president's decision to adjust our troop levels to better support the Afghan government's strategy to secure its nation, and would help enhance Afghanistan's aviation capability,"" said Defense Secretary Ash Carter. ""Swift passage of this plan will help the Department of Defense and our partners in the U.S. government and around the world protect this nation."" The request's fate in the coming weeks is uncertain. It's not clear what Republicans controlling Congress want to do about a raft of unfinished spending bills now that Donald Trump has won the White House. While top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., want to clear away the unfinished budget work -- and avoid cluttering the Trump agenda with this year's leftovers -- many conservatives hope to win better outcomes next year with Trump in the White House. At the very least, however, Congress must pass a temporary spending bill to avert a government shutdown next month, which would give lawmakers and the new administration time to hash out a final accord on more than $1 trillion in unfinished bills to fund agency operating budgets. Before the election, Democrats promised they would try to play a strong hand against GOP moves to beef up the defense budget without comparable treatment for domestic programs. The White House and congressional Democrats insist that additional defense dollars be matched with increases for non-defense programs, and pairing the upcoming Pentagon request with non-defense items that would still fit under the umbrella of security costs could free up money for domestic programs elsewhere. The military portion includes $2.5 billion to maintain elevated U.S. troops levels of 8,400 in Afghanistan as announced over the summer. About $383 million would pay for air strikes against IS. The request would mean a total of $85 billion in war-related funding for the budget year that started in October. The $5.8 billion portion of the request for the State Department and the Agency for International Development would help stabilize areas of Iraq that have been reclaimed for the militants, remove unexploded bombs and increase aid for Somalia, among other purposes. The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said the request was not enough since it ""does not accommodate the increased pace of operations against ISIL and does nothing to begin addressing the readiness crisis.""

Once supported by Washington as a Cold War proxy, it was abandoned to civil conflict, then liberated from Islamist repression and, under the Obama administration, flooded with troops and remolded as a modern Muslim democracy. Perhaps it should not come as a surprise, then, that Afghans -- like Americans -- appear to be divided into two camps on the U.S. presidential election. Some are hoping for a continuation of Washington's political and military involvement, but others are eager for a radical change. In some ways, the American election seems remote in this war-weary capital that is rapidly succumbing to an early winter chill. The faces on political posters and billboards are those of Afghan warlord-politicians. The evening news is dominated by the latest Taliban suicide attack or government squabble. No national polls have been done to parse Afghans' views on the U.S. race.  But in office corners, tea shops and commuter buses, people are puzzling over the faraway brawl between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, wondering how serious Trump is about banning Muslims from the United States and whether Clinton will keep U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  While some Afghans said in interviews that they are fearful that a Trump presidency would be hostile to Muslims of all kinds, others dismissed his harsh comments as campaign rhetoric. Trump initially called for preventing Muslims from entering the United States but later said he wanted to limit immigration from countries experiencing terrorism. Some Afghans said they believed he would not be able to sharply limit the arrival of Muslims, given the broad diversity and freedoms of American society.  ""Maybe Trump is a racist, but he also seems like someone who can solve problems,"" said Noor Akhtar, 23, an engineering student at Kabul University. ""Islam is a religion with 1,400 years of history, and the terrorist phenomenon is only 20 years old,"" he added, noting that many Muslim immigrants live in the United States. ""There is no reason to blame one for the other."" Numerous people said that they thought Clinton would probably win and that she would presumably continue the foreign policies of the Obama administration. Some described those policies as open-minded and pro-democratic, but others said they had focused too much on defeating the Taliban and al-Qaeda, bringing years of war to Afghanistan that caused many civilian casualties and other problems.  ""We all thought the Americans would bring peace and stability to Afghanistan, but that hasn't happened. It gets worse every year,"" said Rustam Mobasher, 25, a medical student. ""Trump seems tougher than Hillary, and he can change those policies."" He dismissed Trump's anti-Muslim comments as a ploy to win voters, predicting that ""after the election, that will change."" Several Afghan politicians and analysts who have followed the campaign closely said they expected that Clinton would be elected and act as a reasonable world leader. But some said they were surprised and worried by the public anger and prejudice that has emerged.  ""A lot of people here think Hillary will win, but others see Trump as the real face of America, a different America,"" said Waheed Mojda, a political analyst. ""If he comes to power, it would be far worse, not just for Afghanistan but for the whole Muslim world.""  Several younger Afghans, who were applying for visas to study in the United States, said they were hurrying to make those plans in case the U.S. government suddenly changes its policies. Hundreds of thousands of Afghans have relatives who have immigrated to the United States, and some have expressed concern that they might be prevented from visiting them.  But several students said they thought Trump's business background might strengthen the U.S. economy and create job opportunities for ambitious young foreigners like themselves.   Najib Mahmoud, a professor of law and political science, said he was not worried about a Trump victory ""because the American people will not allow him to implement his election slogans."" ""They do not want to be criticized and mocked by the world while Russia and China gain strength globally,"" he said. Fauzia Koofi, a member of parliament and a rights activist, said that no matter which candidate wins the election, ""they will be representing a superpower that has a responsibility to represent and support democracy in the world.""   She noted that although neither candidate had focused much on Afghanistan, ""they will have to keep helping us, because we are still suffering from the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and now we have Daesh, too,"" the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State militant group. Although Trump's toughness clearly appeals to some Afghans, several observers said that Clinton has strong support here because she is a woman and Afghan women identify with her efforts to get ahead in a man's world. ""We Afghans really appreciate that for the first time in history, a woman could become the American president,"" said Moeen Manastial, a political party activist and consultant. ""She represents both continuity in American policy but also a fight for women's rights. I will be very happy if she wins.""   Sayed Salahuddin contributed to this report. "
