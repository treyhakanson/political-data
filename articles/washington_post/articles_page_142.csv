The Dalai Lama addressed followers at the Gandantegchenlin monastery on Saturday and spoke about materialism at the start of a four-day visit that Mongolia says is purely religious in nature and won't include meetings with officials. On Sunday, the Dalai Lama is scheduled to chant special sutras at a large sports facility built by Chinese companies through Chinese aid. The trip could have repercussions for land-locked Mongolia's relationship with China, which protested previous visits by the Dalai Lama by briefly closing its border in 2002 and temporarily canceling flights from Beijing in 2006. China's Foreign Ministry had demanded that the Dalai Lama's visit be canceled. Spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday that the Dalai Lama is a ""political exile who has long been engaging in splitting China activities in the name of religion with the aim of alienating Tibet from China."" Geng appealed to Mongolia to maintain ""the general picture of a sound and steady development of bilateral ties (and) earnestly stick to its commitment on Tibet-related issues."" The Dalai Lama has been based in India since fleeing Tibet during an abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. His visit comes as Mongolian leaders are seeking a $4.2 billion loan from Beijing to pull the country out of a deep recession. With commodity prices slumping, Mongolia is running out of hard currency to repay foreign debts and is seeking help from a neighbor that accounts for roughly 90 percent of its exports. Mongolian Buddhism is closely tied to Tibet's strain and many in the heavily Buddhist country revere the Dalai Lama, who made his first visit in 1979. Mongolian religious figures say the visit could be the last for the 81-year-old spiritual leader, and some of his followers traveled hundreds of miles to see him while braving the coldest November temperatures in a decade. Daritseren, an ethnic Mongolian from Russian Siberia, said she only heard on Friday that the Dalai Lama was visiting and traveled with 40 other people for 15 hours overnight to make it just in time for the sermon. Boldbaatar, a 75-year-old herder, said he rushed from 200 kilometers (125 miles) away.  ""I'm an old man,"" he said. ""Maybe I'm seeing His Holiness, the incarnation of Lord Buddha, for the last time."" Religious scholars said the Dalai Lama is expected to offer input on the search for the 10th reincarnation of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, a top-ranked lama in Buddhism.

They regrouped by halftime and now look forward to playing in December for a change. Stephen Johnson came off the bench to throw two second-quarter touchdown passes, Benny Snell and Jojo Kemp each ran for two scores and Kentucky rallied past Austin Peay 49-13 on Saturday to become bowl eligible for the first time since 2010.  ""It's a happy locker room,"" said Kentucky coach Mark Stoops, who added, ""they stayed the course, never flinched and it's never easy. We've just got to continue to push forward."" Drama preceded the Wildcats' postseason-clinching victory with the pregame announcement that little-used sophomore Luke Wright would start at quarterback instead of Johnson because of a left knee injury that wasn't previously disclosed. In-game anxiety followed as Kentucky trailed the FCS Governors 13-0 early in the second quarter and led to the ""emergency"" use of Johnson -- who looked healthy enough to guide his team into a 21-13 lead by halftime.  ""They just wanted me in emergency situations, and not to go out there and get hurt even more,"" Johnson said. Snell's 30-yard TD run got Kentucky (6-5) going before Johnson's scoring passes of 14 yards to C.J. Conrad and 40 to Garrett Johnson. The Wildcats broke it open as Boom Williams ran for a 25-yard TD, Snell scored from 48 and Kemp from 40 and 7 yards. Reaching six wins was huge for Kentucky after falling just short with back-to-back 5-7 finishes. The achievement looked even more elusive after a 0-2 start and a back injury to Drew Barker in the third game that propelled Johnson into the starter's role. Those struggles were forgotten on a cold, blustery evening before 48,948 that culminated in the goal that Stoops sought.  ""I might have been in middle school, so that goes to show how long ago it was (for Kentucky),"" said sophomore cornerback Chris Westry, who had one of the Wildcats' two interceptions. Snell carried 14 times for 152 yards to set a school single-season record for a freshman (1,006) and give Kentucky its first-ever 1,000-yard rushing duo with Williams (1,072). Kentel Williams' 17-yard TD run and Gunnar Scholato's 25-yard interception return of Wright for a score got Austin Peay (0-11) ahead. The Governors couldn't stop Johnson or Kentucky after that and finished with their 27th straight loss dating back to 2014. THE TAKEAWAY Austin Peay: The Governors controlled the initial tempo and drove 69 yards for their first TD. But quarterback Javaughn Craig threw two interceptions and they didn't cross midfield until the fourth quarter and were outgained 410-284.  ""The interception in the red zone, we can't have happen,"" coach Will Healy said. ""We still find ways to shoot ourselves in the foot with turnovers, but I though we went toe-to-toe. Kentucky: Interceptions by Westry and Mike Edwards -- the second of which led to the Wildcats' first TD -- offset early holding penalties that erased touchdowns. But Johnson's entry made the biggest difference in settling down an offense that struggled without him. Johnson completed 5 of 9 passes for 101 yards.  ""We just knew we had to settle down a little bit so we could do what we wanted to do as an offense,"" Johnson said. ""We just had to go out there and do it."" HERE TO HELP Kentucky's 1-2 punch of Snell and Williams were critical to its postseason push that pleased Snell more than breaking Moe Williams' previous freshman rushing record of 928 yards in 1993.  ""I'm glad I got to 1,000 yards,"" Snell said, ""but I'm happy won as a team, we got to six wins and get to go bowling. The seniors deserved that."" UP NEXT Austin Peay: Season over. Kentucky: The Wildcats visit third-ranked (for now) Louisville (No. 5 CFP) , aiming to end a five-game losing streak against their in-state rival and hand the Cardinals their second consecutive loss. ___ More AP college football: collegefootball.ap.org Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Richards/AFP via Getty Images)  I often hear people argue (often quite militantly) that the United States is a republic, not a democracy. But that's a false dichotomy. A common definition of ""republic"" is, to quote the American Heritage Dictionary, ""A political order in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who are entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them"" -- we are that. A common definition of ""democracy"" is, ""Government by the people, exercised either directly or through elected representatives"" -- we are that, too. The United States is not a direct democracy, in the sense of a country in which laws (and other government decisions) are made predominantly by majority vote. Some lawmaking is done this way, on the state and local levels, but it's only a tiny fraction of all lawmaking. But we are a representative democracy, which is a form of democracy. And the same two meanings of ""democracy"" (sometimes direct democracy, sometimes popular self-government more generally) existed at the founding of the republic as well. Some framing-era commentators made arguments that distinguished ""democracy"" and ""republic""; see, for instance, the Federalist (No. 10), as well as other numbers of the Federalist papers. But even in that era, ""representative democracy"" was understood as a form of democracy, alongside ""pure democracy"": John Adams used the term ""representative democracy"" in 1794; so did Noah Webster in 1785; so did St. George Tucker in his 1803 edition of Blackstone; so did Thomas Jefferson in 1815. Tucker's Blackstone likewise uses ""democracy"" to describe a representative democracy, even when the qualifier ""representative"" is omitted. Likewise, James Wilson, one of the main drafters of the Constitution and one of the first Supreme Court justices, defended the Constitution in 1787 by speaking of the three forms of government being the ""monarchical, aristocratical, and democratical,"" and said that in a democracy the sovereign power is ""inherent in the people, and is either exercised by themselves or by their representatives."" Chief Justice John Marshall -- who helped lead the fight in the 1788 Virginia Convention for ratifying the U.S. Constitution -- likewise defended the Constitution in that convention by describing it as implementing ""democracy"" (as opposed to ""despotism""), and without the need to even add the qualifier ""representative."" Sir William Blackstone, who was much read and admired by the framers, likewise used ""democracy"" to include republics: ""Baron Montesquieu lays it down, that luxury is necessary in monarchies, as in France; but ruinous to democracies, as in Holland. With regard therefore to England, whose government is compounded of both species, it may still be a dubious question, how far private luxury is a public evil ...."" Holland was of course a republic, and England was compounded of monarchy and government by elected representatives -- Blackstone was thus labeling such government by elected representatives as a form of ""democrac[y]."" And this is how ""democracy"" is like ""cash"" (and like lots of other words). If you pay cash in a store, what does that mean? It means that you're paying with bills and coins, rather than with a check or a credit card. But if you buy your house for cash, does that mean that you show up with a briefcase full of bills or coins? Unless you're in some peculiar lines of work, probably not. ""Cash,"" like so many words, draws its meaning from context, and from contrast -- what it is being distinguished from. Cash in some contexts means ""not checks."" Cash in other contexts means ""not borrowed money."" Likewise, when people in the framing era were discussing popular government as opposed to government in which the bulk of the people had no voice, they often used ""democracy"" (or ""democratic"" or ""democratical"") to mean ""not monarchy or despotism or aristocracy,"" with the ""demo-"" referring to popular control (what would become Lincoln's ""government of the people, for the people and by the people."" But when they were discussing representative government as opposed to direct government, they often used ""democracy"" or ""pure democracy"" to mean ""not representative government,"" with the ""demo-"" referring to popular decision-making. The same is so today. America is a democracy, in that it's not a monarchy or a dictatorship. (Some people claim it is too oligarchic, in which case they'd say America isn't democratic enough -- but again they'd be distinguishing democracy from oligarchy.) America is not a democracy in the sense of being a direct democracy. If you're asking whether to do something by direct ballot or by representative processes, you might ask whether we should be more democratic or more republican. If you're asking whether China would be better off giving more power to Chinese voters, you might ask whether it should be more democratic or less democratic, quite apart from whether you think the democracy should be direct or representative. To be sure, in addition to being a representative democracy, the United States is also a constitutional democracy, in which courts restrain in some measure the democratic will. And the United States is therefore also a constitutional republic. Indeed, the United States might be labeled a constitutional federal representative democracy. But where one word is used, with all the oversimplification that this necessary entails, ""democracy"" and ""republic"" both work. Indeed, since direct democracy -- again, a government in which all or most laws are made by direct popular vote -- would be impractical given the number and complexity of laws that pretty much any state or national government is expected to enact, it's unsurprising that the qualifier ""representative"" would often be omitted. Practically speaking, representative democracy is the only democracy that's around at any state or national level. (State and even national referenda are sometimes used, but only for a very small part of the state's or nation's lawmaking.) Democracy, then, has multiple meanings -- as do so many words -- and has long had multiple meanings. You might think the English language, or political discourse, would be better if democracy had just one meaning. But you can't arbitrarily select that meaning, and label contrary meanings as linguistically wrong, even if having such a single meaning would be more convenient. Nor should you invest so much significance, I think, into the particular word. Concepts are important; there is an important distinction between direct-democracy processes and representative-democracy processes, and among different degrees of directness or representativeness. But don't expect that the English language as actually used by a large array of English speakers -- from Adams, Jefferson, and Wilson on down -- will perfectly or even near-perfectly capture such distinctions. [This is an elaborated version of an earlier post, which I put up because I saw that (1) people were continuing to be interested in the subject, and (2) part of the confusion that I thought I saw had to do with the assumption that ""democracy"" had to mean just one thing -- hence the ""cash"" analogy.]"

British Prime Minister Theresa May wants to start divorce talks by March 31, but the High Court ruled that Parliament must get a vote on it first. The government is appealing the judgment to the Supreme Court, with hearings due next month. In the meantime, some pro-EU lawmakers are trying to build support for a blocking move. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said his party would vote against invoking Article 50 of the EU treaty, the trigger for exit talks, unless voters got to ""have their say in a referendum on the terms of the deal"" between Britain and the EU. Farron said that voters decided in June to leave the EU, but not on what form of relationship Britain should seek with the bloc. He said there must be ""a referendum at the end of this process so that nobody would have imposed upon them something they didn't vote for."" The Liberal Democrats have just eight seats in the 650-seat House of Commons, but some members of the main opposition Labour Party also say they will vote to block Brexit. The government says it will not hold a second referendum. Brexit Minister David Jones accused opposition lawmakers of ""attempting to thwart and reverse the decision that was taken on June 23.""

Saakashvili was appointed governor of the corruption-riddled Black Sea region last year by President Petro Poroshenko. But in his resignation announcement in Odessa earlier this week, Saakashvili said he felt ""cheated and tired,"" and accused Poroshenko of supporting the criminal clans in Odessa. Speaking at a news conference on Friday the former Georgian president said his goal is to push for ""early parliamentary elections as quickly as possible."" Poroshenko has made Ukraine's integration with the European Union a priority, but endemic corruption throughout the country impedes that policy. During Saakashvili's 2004-2013 tenure as Georgian president, one of his main achievements was a significant reduction in corruption as well as a crackdown on organized crime. He reformed the Georgian police force, ending its long history of bribe-taking. Hot-tempered and uncompromising, Saakashvili was a divisive figure. He left Georgia after his party lost the 2012 parliamentary election and was stripped of his Georgian citizenship after becoming Odessa governor. He said his political movement will now team up with other opposition forces to unseat the current authorities, including Poroshenko.  ""He had a chance to use me for genuine reforms in this country but it turned out that reforms and his well-being somehow contradict one another,"" Saakashvili said of the president.

Velitski said the woman, who was not named, has partly confessed, adding she fantasized about such plot, especially after the 2007 school shooting in Finland where eight people were killed. Velitski said the woman had practiced target shooting and had plotted the deadly rampage at her former school in Kokkola for at least two years. It was not clear when it was to take place.

Tim Kaine consoled a room full of heartbroken supporters on national television and introduced Hillary Clinton with a quote by William Faulkner. "" 'They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yit,' "" Kaine said, sending campaign loyalists into a frenzy of applause and tears.  Standing behind Clinton, he smiled, nodded and pumped his fist as if he hadn't just experienced the greatest loss of his life in public office.  There was a time when it looked as though Kaine's star would shoot from Virginia's capitol city straight to Number One Observatory Circle on a wave of dad jokes and harmonica riffs.  But less than four months after his journey around the country began, he is poised to return to a Republican- controlled Senate with national profile but scars from a devastating defeat.      While introducing Hillary Clinton at her concession speech on Nov. 9 in New York City, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) drew cheers and applause when he quoted William Faulkner's words, ""They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yit,"" as a way to encourage Democrats to move forward. (The Washington Post)   Virginians who have followed Kaine's rise from Richmond mayor say he's at his best when he can delve into big policy questions and leverage relationships, two important ingredients for success in the U.S. Senate.  But, first, he rests. After returning to Richmond from New York City on Wednesday, Kaine planned to spend a few quiet days with family before heading to the District for the start of session next week.  ""Senator Kaine looks forward to getting back to work for Virginians in the Senate next week on the issues and priorities he's been fighting for since he took office nearly four years ago,"" spokeswoman Amy Dudley said. That means he'll pick up where he left off advocating for war powers reform and a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force against ISIS as well as expanding career and technical education programs and combating campus sexual assault. He sits on Armed Services, Foreign Relations and Budget committees and the Special Committee on Aging.  Kaine's expertise on the constitutional powers of the presidency will be particularly valuable as Donald Trump assumes office, given Trump's campaign promises to upend the government. ""If Trump indeed, as many suspect, has little patience for separation of powers and limits on presidential authority, it is going to take leaders such as Kaine to be forceful counter- voices to the next president,"" said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. The role is a heartening consolation prize for Democrats stunned by their overnight loss of the White House.  Clinton salved those wounds with an optimistic concession speech in which she thanked Kaine and his wife, former Virginia education secretary Anne Holton.  ""It has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy, representing Virginia in the Senate,"" Clinton said.  But Rozell noted the ""Stronger Together"" campaign failed Kaine when advisers told him to play attack dog in the vice-presidential debate against Indiana Gov. Mike Pence -- a stance that deviated from Kaine's sunny disposition.  ""It looked like someone else occupied his body that night,"" Rozell said. ""It was almost disturbing. You don't try to be who you're not, because it comes across. It made him look a little bit like a jerk that night."" Still, the ever ebullient Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) put a positive spin on Kaine's future, saying the campaign showed the nation what Virginia already knew. ""No one works harder or cares more deeply about making life better for people from every walk of life than Senator Tim Kaine does,"" McAuliffe said in a statement. ""I was proud to advocate for his selection to join the Democratic ticket and look forward to the many ways Virginians and Americans will benefit from his continued leadership in the United States Senate.""  Although in the minority party, he could follow a path forged by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who rose to speaker after a failed bid for vice president on Mitt Romney's ticket, or Bob Dole, who twice served as Senate Majority Leader and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee after losing GOP presidential nominating contests. In the Senate, Kaine could have renewed influence on veterans and military issues -- an area in which Virginia's clout has been greatly diminished since the 2014 ouster of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and a string of retirements in the House.  ""I don't think there's any question that his profile's a little bit higher having just come off a national ticket."" said Mo Elleithee, a Democratic strategist who runs Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and says Kaine remains modest if better known now. ""Knowing him, I don't know that that changes his approach to anything. What they talked about on the campaign trail was what he was working on in the Senate."" Kaine made history as the first member of a presidential ticket to deliver a speech in fluent Spanish. During the divisive campaign, he talked about lessons learned at an African American church in Richmond where he has worshiped for decades. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) recalled an understated yet powerful ad from Kaine's 2001 campaign for lieutenant governor: the clasped hands of a white child and a black child filled the page.  Kaine was the first governor outside Illinois to endorse President Obama, who then asked him to chair the Democratic National Committee and later to run for Senate. Beyer said he had hoped as vice president, Kaine ""could really be a healer. He was liked and respected by almost everyone in the Senate. That would have been a great step forward. It was not to be."" In the aftermath of defeat Wednesday, Kaine drew on a lifetime of helping people face difficult situations. ""His speech was eloquent and erudite and spoke to the better angels of our nature,"" said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.). ""I think he definitely emerges as a potential phoenix from these ashes."" Kaine remains popular in the state; an Oct. 30 Washington Post poll showed that 51 percent of voters viewed him favorably, compared with 42 percent who saw him unfavorably. And despite the outcome of the election, Connolly noted that Clinton won Virginia by about five points, in part thanks to Kaine. It was the only Southern state that voted for the Democrat.  Virginia voters defied national trends with double-digits wins in fast-growing Loudoun, Prince William and Henrico counties -- all of which could help Democrats hold on to statewide office in the future. Kaine faces reelection in 2018.  "

But they're concerned about gridlock persisting even with a Republican president and Congress. Advocacy groups expect Trump to start working toward at least modifying President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, and undoing environmental regulations. They're generally upbeat that bipartisan support for small business issues like access to federal contracts will continue. But some question how campaign rhetoric will translate into concrete steps.  ""What we don't know is whether or not there is a sincere interest in supporting small and medium-size enterprises in this country -- rebuilding Main Street, rebuilding manufacturing,"" says David Levine, CEO of the American Sustainable Business Council. They're also wondering whether Senate Democrats will try to slow the GOP agenda.  ""Since you need 60 votes to do anything of any consequence there, it's hard to see how it will happen,"" says Todd McCracken, CEO of the National Small Business Association, referring to how it takes that many votes to end Senate debate on legislation. Here's what some groups expect on major topics: HEALTH CARE Trump has vowed to repeal the health care overhaul, something Republicans in Congress have failed to do so far. Whether Democrats in the Senate could block a repeal is unclear, as is what would replace it.  ""We don't think (a repeal) would be realistic. Many small businesses have gotten coverage they wouldn't have gotten otherwise,"" says John Arensmeyer, CEO of Small Business Majority, which has supported the law. McCracken believes changes to the health care law could be stymied if they're opposed by the health insurance industry, which has a powerful lobbying presence. REGULATIONS Trump has said he'll reverse some of Obama's executive orders, including one that eased deportation policies against minors who are in the U.S. illegally. He's also said he'd eliminate a rule that allows the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate bodies of water on private lands. And he has vowed to withdraw the United States from an international agreement on climate change. Many small business groups have voiced concern about the effect that federal, state and local requirements have on their companies and profits. TAXES Trump has advocated lowering the income tax on all companies to 15 percent. Business groups want to see benefits as well for sole proprietors, partners and corporate shareholders whose business income is reported on their personal returns. They can be taxed at rates up to nearly 40 percent under current law. Corporate tax rates range from 15 percent to 35 percent. The tax law can't be changed without Congress, which has had trouble agreeing on tax reform. But the National Federation of Independent Business believes that a Republican president and Congress will lower taxes for small companies.  ""I am now feeling like a comprehensive tax reform is alive and well again,"" CEO Juanita Duggan says. TRADE Trump campaigned on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, which governs trade among the U.S., Canada and Mexico, and wants other trade deals modified. He also wants the U.S. to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is awaiting approval from Congress. But he may face opposition from small business groups.  ""NAFTA has been a plus for small business trade. Free trade accords reduce expenses and expand opportunities for small businesses,"" says Raymond Keating, chief economist with the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. FEDERAL CONTRACTS Legislation making it easier for small businesses to win federal contracts has won bipartisan support in Congress in recent years even as political infighting stalled other bills. Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, hopes Democrats and Republicans on small business committees in both houses will keep working together. Trump hasn't talked about women business owners. Jane Campbell, president of Women Impacting Public Policy, says he may need to learn. While the law requires federal contracts to be awarded to disadvantaged business owners, there isn't a similar requirement for women-owned companies.  ""We have to do some education,"" Campbell says. MINIMUM WAGE The approval of minimum wage increases in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and the state of Washington will likely add momentum to campaigns in other parts of the country, says Holly Sklar, director of the advocacy group Business For a Fair Minimum Wage.  ""We expect to see more states through legislation and ballot campaigns to be moving forward in 2017,"" Sklar says. Some small business groups say a higher minimum wage hurts small companies; others say it helps them compete and gives consumers more money to spend at small businesses. Sklar believes Congress will be pressured to lift the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 since 2009. Even so, she doesn't expect it to reach some state levels of $15 by 2020. _____ Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Sen.-elect Chris Van Hollen spoke at a news conference with the senator he will replace in January -- Sen. Barbara Mikulski -- and Sen. Ben Cardin.  ""I do believe that Donald Trump ran an incredibly divisive campaign, and it's going to be essential that he reach out -- not just in word, but in deed,"" said Van Hollen, who has served seven terms in the U.S. House. Mikulski, the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress who is retiring after 30 years in the Senate, passed a baton with flashing lights to Van Hollen before the two hugged. Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton was especially tough for Mikulski, who has been one of Clinton's most staunch supporters, but she said Van Hollen's win over Republican Del. Kathy Szeliga was a bright spot in an otherwise dreary Election Day.  ""He is a worker,"" Mikulski said. ""He is someone who likes to dig into the issues, not for the issues' sake but to solve real problems that real people face."" Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, who did not support Trump's candidacy, said it was time to work with the new administration on behalf of all the state's residents.  ""As we move forward, I encourage both parties to leave behind the divisive politics that have marred this election season and our nation for far too long and focus on doing what is best for America,"" said Hogan, who wrote in his father, Lawrence Hogan, for president during early voting. Cardin, a Democrat, pledged a willingness to work with Republicans, but he also expressed wariness about positions taken by Trump during the long and contentious presidential campaign.  ""A lot of things were said in this campaign that give me great concern, but I can assure you that we will be working to make sure that the values that we hold so dear in our state and nation are carried out by our congressional representation in the United States Congress,"" Cardin said. The election also was noteworthy in Maryland because the state will be without a woman in the state's congressional delegation for the first time in more than 40 years. Mikulski, who is considered the dean of Senate women and a mentor to female lawmakers, said Van Hollen and Cardin have strong records of supporting women's rights.  ""I have a saying that says: 'Men of quality always support we women as we seek equality,'"" Mikulski said. ""These men have a fabulous voting record and life commitment to the advancement, empowerment, of women and girls and, also though, of others."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Petro Poroshenko said in Slovenia Tuesday the government could formally confirm Saakashvili's resignation on Wednesday.  ""I hope tomorrow the government will remove him from the position of the regional administration and give him an opportunity to provide political activity,"" he said. Saakashvili said Monday he is resigning in frustration at what he characterized as obstruction in efforts to root out corruption. Poroshenko appointed Saakashvili as governor of the corruption-riddled Black Sea region in May 2015. But in his resignation announcement, Saakashvili accused Poroshenko of supporting the criminal clans in Odessa. Saakashvili said in a video posted on his Facebook page that he felt ""cheated and tired."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
