State officials announced Thursday that certain purchases of medical cannabis are now exempt from sales taxes, under the law approved by voters this month that legalized recreational pot in California. Under the new law known as Proposition 64, a 15 percent excise tax will be imposed in January 2018 upon purchasers of all marijuana and marijuana products, including medical cannabis. A tax on cultivators will also be imposed. Until then, the tax holiday goes to people who make purchases with a medical marijuana identification card from the California Department of Public Health. That's a relatively small group in a state of 39 million people. According to government data, California issued about 6,700 of the identification cards in the year that ended in June. However, that number doesn't capture the entire universe of cardholders. The state has issued 2,200 cards since that time, but many could be renewals. The tax-collecting Board of Equalization said in a statement that buyers with a paper recommendation from a physician do not qualify for the tax break. The financial hit on the state was not immediately clear. Medical dispensaries currently pay 7.5 percent in state sales tax on sales, and local taxes typically add 1 percent to 2 percent. Gov. Jerry Brown's office did not immediately comment, while leaders in the state Assembly are monitoring the situation.  ""Given the nature of how medical marijuana is typically purchased in California, it's not clear whether the initiative's language on sales tax will actually prove to be a significant impact on state revenue,"" said Kevin Liao, a spokesman for Speaker Anthony Rendon.  ""It does, however, appear to be another indication that complex policies aren't necessarily best resolved through the initiative process,"" Liao added in a statement. Nate Bradley, executive director of California Cannabis Industry Association, said in an email that policy experts are not in agreement with the board's interpretation, since the law was intended to generate tax revenue. The California vote on Nov. 8 represented the legalization movement's biggest victory to date. In general, the state will treat cannabis similar to alcohol. Taking effect in 2018, the law allows people 21 and older to legally possess up to an ounce of pot and grow six marijuana plants at home. It also allows cities and counties to impose their own regulations and taxes on recreational marijuana. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Or perhaps it's the ideal time. In any case, I recently got married. And tomorrow my beautiful bride (and brilliant fellow journalist) Liliana Segura and I are headed overseas for our honeymoon. For the next three weeks, two excellent writers/journalists will keep you well-supplied with posts. Tana Ganeva is a deputy editor at the Influence, where she writes and edits stories about the drug war and drug war/criminal-justice policy. Most recently, she looked at incarcerated people and their families hoping to get a commutation from President Obama who fear their chances have all but evaporated with the election of Donald Trump. Before that, she was an editor at Alternet. You can read an archive of her terrific work at the Influence here. Also be sure to check out her thorough coverage of homelessness issues. Steven Hale is a terrific reporter with the Nashville Scene, my home town's alt weekly, where he covers politics and public policy, with an emphasis on criminal justice. A few of my recent favorites include his history of Tennessee's electric chair, an inspiring profile of a public defender who was formerly incarcerated, and this great post on two murders in Tennessee in which he explored who gets a shot at redemption and who doesn't. I'm off to Bangkok in the morning. I'll be back in three weeks, by which point I expect giant holograms of Trump's head to be hovering over Nashville and all other major American cities.

The decision was the second time in as many months the Bank of Mexico has raised the rate. In September, it raised the rate a half-point to 4.75 percent, seeking to shore up a weak peso. The volatile peso has depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar. Some analysts had been expecting a larger increase, given uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election of Donald Trump. Trump has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, deport millions of migrants and build a border wall. The peso's interbank exchange rate weakened from 20.34 to $1 to 20.41. Financial consulting firm Banco Base said Thursday it is unlikely that the peso stabilizes in coming days due to expected changes un U.S. monetary policy and uncertainty about the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump.

What do they have in common?	" Much of the world has been shocked and dismayed by Donald Trump's electoral success, but there are those who are delighted. ""This was a victory for the forces which oppose globalization, are fighting illegal migration and are in favor of clean ethnic states,"" declared a spokesperson for Golden Dawn, Greece's far-right party, which is sometimes characterized as neo-Nazi. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister who has said he wants to build an ""illiberal state"" in his country, hailed the results as ""great news."" The deputy leader of France's right-wing National Front Party, historically seen as ultra-nationalist and anti-Semitic, was exultant as well. ""Their world is collapsing. Ours is being built,"" he said. You cannot be judged by those who approve of your actions, but it's worth trying to understand what Trump's admirers are celebrating. In some cases, Trump's appeal is that he is against political correctness. Beppe Grillo, the former comedian who now leads Italy's Five Star Movement, noted that like Trump, his party had been labeled sexist and populist but that people didn't care. The Guardian, which has compiled many of the favorable responses, reported that Grillo applauded Trump supporters for filtering out the media and giving a big ""f--k you"" to the ""freemasons, major banks and Chinese groups.""  For others, it is the sense of kinship among strongmen who are unconcerned with human rights. Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad called Trump a ""natural ally."" Rodrigo Duterte, the authoritarian leader of the Philippines, said of him, ""We both like to swear . . . we're the same."" Duterte has been hostile to the United States because Washington has criticized the extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses that have marked his tenure. Robert Mugabe, who has clung to power in Zimbabwe for 36 years while destroying that nation's economy and liberties, has been similarly hopeful. A full-page editorial in a state-run paper there hailed the election of ""the mighty Trump,"" and the 92-year-old dictator has reportedly described Trump as a ""friend."" No doubt Duterte and Mugabe hope that a Trump administration will go easy on them. What unifies Trump's foreign admirers is the idea that the existing global order is rotten and should be torn down. Many of Trump's domestic supporters would agree. All of the European parties cheering Trump's victory seek the destruction of the European Union and, more generally, the tightly knit Western community centered upon shared values and interests. They are almost all strikingly pro-Russian because they see in Vladimir Putin's Russia a country that actively seeks to undermine the current international system. Many of these groups take covert and overt support from Russia and benefit from the Kremlin's cyberwarfare. ""We all need to use [Trump's election] together to reshape the transatlantic relationship, and to end the big conflicts in Ukraine and Syria together with Russia,"" said Frauke Petry, the leader of Germany's ultra-nationalist party Alternative fur Deutschland, according to the Guardian. But what is this globalism to which these people are so opposed? After 1945, after the Great Depression and two world wars, Western nations established an international system characterized by rules that honored national sovereignty, allowed for the flourishing of global commerce, and encouraged respect for human rights and liberties. This order resulted in the longest period of peace among the world's major powers, marked by broad-based economic growth that created large middle classes in the West, the revival of Europe, growth in poor countries that lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and the spread of freedom across the globe.     Around the globe, right-wing leaders reacted to the victory of Republican President-elect Donald Trump with joy, while some expats and politicians expressed dismay and anxiety for international relations. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   The U.S. role in all this was pivotal. It set the agenda and provided security, which was about more than just deterring the Soviet Union and other aggressive powers. Radek Sikorski, Poland's former foreign minister, said, ""America's influence and its commitments have been our security blanket. They have allowed Europe's national rivalries to stay dormant. If you take away those guarantees, Europe could get very unstable."" And remember, the European Union is the world's biggest market and the United States' largest trading partner.  For the United States, ""globalism"" has produced enormous advantages. With 5 percent of the world's population, the United States dominates the global economy, in technology, education, finance and clean energy. One in five U.S. jobs is a result of trade, and that number is growing fast. The United States maintains the world's reserve currency, giving it a huge economic advantage. The benefits of growth and globalization have not been shared equally, and the pace of change causes anxiety everywhere. But these are reasons to invest in people, upgrade their skills and better integrate communities. They are not reasons to destroy the most peaceful and productive international system ever devised in human history.

Bob Schmidt rubbed his eyes, straightened his camouflage hat and climbed into the driver's seat of his van. He was about to begin his daily drive through this politically deep-red region, picking up refugees and dropping them off at work. Blocks away was the auditorium where, during the summer, an anti-Islam activist warned the crowd that ""radicalism and hatred"" was ""rising throughout the world,"" including in Twin Falls. Nearby was the family restaurant where, one night earlier, a team of self-avowed defenders of freedom had reveled in Donald Trump's victory and talked about being on guard against sharia law. On the horizon were the county's farms and factories, where employers said they would be lost without the low-wage workforce from Iraq, Afghanistan and sub-Saharan Africa -- refugees whose best chance in the United States meant a seat in Schmidt's van and a shift that started at 6 a.m. ""So, is everybody ready?"" Schmidt said Tuesday morning, once his van was filled. ""Yeah,"" came a groan from the back.   Activist Vicky Davis is working to end refugee resettlement in Twin Falls. (Kim Raff for The Washington Post)  Twin Falls is now a testing ground for whether the bitter cultural divisions intensified by this year's presidential campaign can recede in favor of the co-dependency that marks many communities with large white and immigrant populations. In this southern Idaho city of 45,000, the question surrounds a growing Muslim population. Across the country, people in meatpacking towns and agricultural areas are wondering whether their communities will hold on to a supply of Hispanic workers and other foreign laborers crucial to those industries.  ""We need to take the time to understand one another,"" said Schmidt, 61, paid $8 an hour by a staffing company. ""The hate in our country has gotten worse.""  The rancor in Twin Falls began to surface only over the past year and a half as concerns about domestic terrorism awakened a fierce and sudden debate about whether the local Muslim population represented a point of pride or a potential danger -- an anxiety that Trump amplified during his campaign. For decades before, the refugee resettlement program run by a local community college had flourished with little opposition, with refugees filling open jobs on dairy farms and in cheese factories. Amid the debate, a crime allegedly committed by refugees thrust Twin Falls under the spotlight of hard-line right-wing websites, galvanizing anti-refugee activists and even drawing the attention of one of Trump's sons. Racially loaded and often false accounts about Twin Falls-based Muslim refugees on the website Breitbart reinforced many of Trump's warnings about the threats from immigrants.  ""There is not going to be any reconciliation,"" said Vicky Davis, 65, a local retired computer systems analyst who opposes the refugee program. ""I will never, never give in to people that walk around in burqas.""  Opinions about the refugee program in the Magic Valley, as this region is called, do not neatly align with party affiliation or other typical dividing lines. The vast majority of Democrats and Republicans say the refugees deserve a chance in the United States. Trump earned 66 percent of votes in Twin Falls County, slightly less than prior Republican presidential candidates, and local donations to the refugee center have increased in the days since his victory. Still, according to residents and officials, an increasingly vocal minority has been emboldened by Trump's rise, rallied by his message about strict immigration controls to guard against ""radical Islamic terror.""  The fervor in Twin Falls isn't easily explained by other factors. The city has an unemployment rate of 3.1 percent, compared with 4.9 percent nationally, and has recently attracted several new factories, including one run by the Clif Bar snack company. Yet the character of Twin Falls is changing. Its pro-refugee mayor has reported threats to the FBI made against him. Newly hostile city council meetings were guarded for the first time by armed police. A local Fox radio morning host says refugees, rather than helping fill the labor force, are at the grocery store ""spending the food stamps that you paid for.""    Newly resettled students take notes during an English-language class at the College of Southern Idaho Refugee Center in Twin Falls. (Kim Raff for The Washington Post)  ""This is the $24 question,"" said Chris Talkington, a city council member in favor of the refugee program. ""Does our economic vitality get put up on the shooting gallery for the sake of folks who'd like to ship [refugees and immigrants] away? They are fomenting dissent, and I do not expect them to go away."" Crime energizes movement In the week after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, 15 members of a group called ""We the People Magic Valley,"" formed this year, gathered for their monthly meeting in the wood-paneled back room of Idaho Joe's restaurant. One member made a presentation about government overreach, and then local resident Adrian Arp, an agronomist, stood up.  ""I don't know how you feel,"" Arp said to applause, ""but it was a miracle that Trump won."" In the room were young mothers, grandmothers in sweaters, professionals. A few had been laid off. One woman said she hadn't been able to buy a new car in 16 years. Davis, the retiree, said she had once earned $125,000 in the computer industry in Manhattan and lost her job because of outsourcing and a visa program that paved the way for foreigners.  ""I think God is giving us another chance,"" Arp said. ""I mean, seriously. You looked at all the odds. The Republican establishment. The crooked media. Despite it all, he was able to pull it off. And now we've got to hold his feet to the fire."" The anti-immigration sentiment in Twin Falls began to take off in April 2015, when the College of Southern Idaho Refugee Center's director erroneously said Twin Falls was set to receive Syrians, setting off sharp opposition. Opponents of the program proposed local ballot measures calling for a ban on refugee centers, but they didn't gain traction. Then this June, something seemed to galvanize the movement: A sexual assault took place in a local apartment complex, and rumors spread that the suspects were Syrian teens. ""Syrian Refugees Rape Little Girl at Knifepoint in Idaho,"" read a headline on the Drudge Report.  The case was sealed because it involved juveniles, including the victim, a 5-year-old girl. Still, Twin Falls police corrected a few facts, saying the suspects were from Sudan and Iraq. It hardly mattered. (The case is now in court, and all suspects have been charged, Twin Falls Prosecuting Attorney Grant Loebs said.) A surge of Twin Falls residents appeared at council meetings, castigating city officials and accusing them of endangering the town. Right-wing commentators descended. Breitbart published at least 20 stories from Twin Falls, most of which generated thousands of comments. (Among the headlines: ""How Muslim Migrants Devastate a Community."" ""Twin Falls Refugee Rape Special Report: Why Are The Refugees Moving In?"") Eventually, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted out an article written by Michelle Malkin, a right-wing commentator.  ""Where's the outrage for this 5 year old girl???"" Trump Jr. wrote.  ""It became this stirring of facts blended in with opinion,"" Twin Falls Mayor Shawn Barigar said. ""In this Breitbart phenomena, I'd get an email with a link. I'd see the article. I'd end up in the comments. You'd have 2,000 comments from across the country -- vile, nasty comments about Muslims. I ended up down the rabbit hole to the point where I had to stop reading this stuff."" (Breitbart's former president, Stephen K. Bannon, recently was named as White House chief strategist under Trump.) Nobody in Twin Falls is sure whether Trump will follow through with his campaign pledge to curb or end Muslim entry into the United States.  But at Idaho Joe's, the group brainstormed smaller ways to change minds. They could closely monitor and raise awareness about what they called ""unpatriotic activity."" They could update the group's website to highlight the ways in which sharia law opposed the Constitution. They could recruit more millennials. They could collaborate with a Breitbart reporter that some in the group know. They could hold a potluck -- one that served food Muslims wouldn't eat -- to build camaraderie.  Stefany Clark, sitting in the corner, said her neighborhood was ""20 to 22 percent Muslim"" and suggested she could host.  ""A pig roast,"" she said. Defending the refugees About 300 refugees arrive in Twin Falls each year, and although they are free to resettle elsewhere in the county, many choose to stay. In nearly all cases, Refugee Center Director Zeze Rwasama said, refugees find jobs within two or three months. Some end up working at Chobani, a yogurt company founded by a Turkish immigrant. Others take jobs at Everton Mattress Factory or Jerome Cheese.  ""I'm tired all the time,"" said Mohammed Osman, 21, a Sudanese worker who pulls a 12-hour overnight shift at the cheese plant. He said he is fearful of Trump and his influence. ""We were hoping for a different direction."" As criticism about the refugees bubbled up, an Idaho Dairymen's Association representative defended the program in front of the city council. At one dairy farm, 60 of 250 workers are refugees. ""The one thing we hear repeatedly from different employers, they're continually short on employees,"" said Rick Naerebout, the group's director of operations. ""Everybody is always looking to fill holes. We're in a situation where we've got this workforce coming to us."" Schmidt, the driver, found himself in the middle of the debate almost by accident. He had been laid off during the depths of the financial crisis by Glanbia, a cheesemaker with a plant in Gooding, Idaho. He went to the area's unemployment office and got linked up with a staffing company. Soon, he was driving a van marked with the CSI refugee program's logo, rows of foreign faces in the back. On the streets of Twin Falls, a few glared at Schmidt at red lights, he said. One person doused his windshield with a milkshake.  ""It's that old Civil War attitude,"" Schmidt said.  Schmidt had served in the 82nd Airborne Division, stationed in Fort Bragg, N.C., 772 jumps under his belt, with the hip and lower back pain to prove it. He had $160,000 in medical debt and no insurance. He'd all but abandoned his retirement plans to buy an RV and tour the country because he had $1 in his bank account and no clear way to save more. But he liked his job, and he said he identified a bit with the people he drove. They worked hard. They scraped by.  ""How many people do you know that would get up every day, on time, for a job where a cow might take a s--t on them?"" Schmidt said as he drove to the dairy. ""And then do it again day after day. Never a complaint.""  Schmidt had avoided some of the online conversations about the refugees -- he is dyslexic and does almost no reading.  But Schmidt said one thing bugged him and gave him a window into what was happening all around him in Twin Falls: His brother opposed the refugee program. Schmidt had tried to convince him that it wasn't a danger. He said that all Americans had come here from somewhere else and that if Trump tightened the United States' borders for refugees, his own job might be on the line.  It didn't matter.  ""No, I didn't convince him,"" Schmidt said. ""I guess I don't understand a lot of Americans. In many ways it reminds me of a plow horse. Just running with blinders on.""    "

The Seattle Seahawks quarterback talked at length Thursday about joining Chris Hansen in the attempt to get a new arena constructed in Seattle's stadium district. He spoke for nearly 10 minutes before addressing a single football-related question as his involvement in the project has drawn nearly as much interest as his production on the field.  ""It's one of those things that we need to make it happen, just because it's a special thing. It will be for years and years to come,"" Wilson said. ""I want my kids to have that opportunity. Nothing better than going to an NBA basketball game and being able to see basketball players -- NHL game, there's so many great athletes. There's so many other great things you can do in the new facility, too, as well. I think that will be really special."" Wilson announced he was joining Hansen's investment group on Monday. He said he's known Hansen for a couple of years and the timing was right for Wilson to formally join. It certainly doesn't hurt that Wilson signed a contract extension worth up to $87 million before the 2015 season, giving him the financial clout to be an investor. And his name gives an instant and significant public relations boost to a project that has faced road blocks from political figures.  ""I've been really authentic about wanting to own a team one day and being a part of something really special and doing that and even though I'm young and that I definitely have a business mindset and I want to be able to help people and give back and help change this community, continue to change this community for the better,"" Wilson said.  Hansen last month announced his intention to privately finance the proposed project in exchange for tax breaks. The offer would erase the public investment that was part of the original 2012 memorandum of understanding between Hansen and the city. The city has acknowledged Hansen's intent while also opening a request for proposals for a possible renovation of KeyArena, the former home of the SuperSonics. The proposals are due in 2017. Wilson said the important task now is getting city approval to close down a street near where the proposed arena would be constructed. Wilson said he would lobby city officials if asked to try to build support for the project. He acknowledged the investment in the arena is the first step to someday having an ownership stake in a franchise.  ""Those guys knew that I really wanted to be a part of owning a team one day. And obviously I can't own a team until we have a team. I can't be a part of that,"" Wilson said. ""So like I said, the first step was the arena part. And that's our focus right now. And then once we have an arena, then the goal is to obviously own a basketball team as part of it and have great people, great individuals, a great organization that helps change people's lives, do great things in the community and hopefully win a lot of championships, too."" ___ For more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

It's complain, complain. Except the callers to ""Radio Tomorrow"" are in the Islamic State-controlled city of Mosul, and they don't want to yak about traffic or sports. They want to unload on suicide bombers and errant airstrikes, on the lack of food and medicine. They have questions about when to wave white flags and what to do with bodies in the rubble. ""Shrapnel hit the tanks on the rooftop,"" a caller named Hasan told FM-95.5 the other day. ""We have lost all water we have saved."" On calls made from the front lines in Mosul, Radio Alghad listeners can hear artillery rounds falling as the government battles to retake the city. They can hear windows rattling, bursts of gunfire, children crying in a backroom. ""There is a difference between hearing about the crimes and seeing them with your eyes,"" another caller told one of the station's hosts.   The radio station Alghad beams music, news and talk shows into the ISIS-controlled city of Mosul, now the scene of pitched battles between Iraqi security forces and Islamic State militants. ( William Booth/The Washington Post)  She begged Iraqi forces to hurry to recapture the city. Many of her neighbors still support the Islamic State, she said. ""So it's hard to tell who is a friend and who is an enemy."" The callers often speak in rushed whispers. A cellphone, even a SIM card found hidden in a pocket or purse, can mean a death sentence in Mosul, where Islamic State militants have ordered ""collaborators and spies"" to be summarily executed. The station's founder is a 30-something tech entrepreneur who calls himself ""Mohammad of Mosul"" in interviews because he does not want to be targeted by the Islamic State or its supporters. He also insists on keeping the location of his station and most of the names of its hosts secret. He is concerned about car bombs. He will allow a reporter to say only that the operation is in the Kurdish area of Iraq.  [One man's escape from an Islamic State mass execution]  On a recent evening, during one of four call-in shows hosted each day, a dozen people from Mosul and surrounding towns and villages telephoned the station and went live on-air. Callers are told to use aliases. But instead of ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" the callers identify themselves with monikers such as ""Tear of an Oppressed,"" ""Prisoner of Memories"" and others such as ""Mother of Ali"" or ""Son of Mosul."" The guests are also warned not to mention their exact locations, for their own protection and to foil intelligence-gathering by Islamic State militants, who monitor the radio station. The first call of the evening went like this: CALLER: As-salamu alaykum!  HOST: Peace to you, Son of Mosul! Where are you calling from? CALLER: From the left side [what Iraqis call the east side of the Tigris River in Mosul], from the liberated areas. HOST: Inshallah, the whole of Mosul gets liberated. We want to hear soon that Mosul has completely been liberated. CALLER: It will be liberated by the help of God. What is left for Daesh [the Arabic acronym used for the Islamic State]? Only to hide behind women? They protect themselves by women! HOST: Inshallah, God will give revenge for you, Son of Mosul, and for all the oppressed people in Mosul. Go ahead, tell me about the situation on the left side. CALLER: I only want to say one thing, do you know what? In Hay al-Samah [neighborhood], the people are still under the destroyed houses; the houses have collapsed on top of them. Radio Alghad went on the air in March 2015. Mohammad said that after watching how the Islamic State operated, he decided that Mosul needed an alternative radio station. ""Their social-media skills are high. Their psychologists are impressive,"" he said. ""They get a lot of hits."" Islamic State videos -- such as the infamous ""Clash of Swords"" series -- instilled fear among Iraqi defenders and diminished their will to fight. In 2014, the Islamic State took Mosul, then a city of about 2 million, in a couple of days as Iraqi security forces retreated. ""Then I realized this is a media war,"" the Alghad director said. The Islamic State has its own radio station operating in Mosul, Radio al-Bayan 92.5 FM. ""They use their transmitters to jam us -- and we now use our transmitters to jam them,"" Mohammad said. ""We're both on each other's frequencies all the time."" In the frequency wars, the anti-Islamic State station now operates seven transmitters.  [Iraqis find evidence of torture by Islamic State in mass grave near Mosul]  Before the government's offensive to recapture Mosul began in early October, hot topics on the call-in shows were the Islamic State's bans on smoking, cellphones and satellite dishes. Men complained about being forced to grow beards, and women about being required to wear full-face veils. They also complained about taxes, arrests and street executions. Now Radio Alghad includes public-service messages, warning listeners to shelter inside interior rooms during bombardments and to open windows to relieve the pressure so that glass does not implode. On a normal day, about 80 callers go live on-air, most of them from Mosul. In recent days, many callers have said they are being pounded both by Islamic State mortars and shelling from Iraqi forces. They are pleading for the Iraqi army to be more mindful of civilians during its offensive against the city. A caller, ""Mother of Ali,"" said: ""Honestly, we can't stand the bombings anymore, but we have no choice but to thank God and be more patient."" Another caller complained that ""Daesh launches one or two rockets, but the Iraqi army bombing is very intense. The area is full of civilian families and they get hurt, so through your station I would like to ask them to decrease the bombings and to be more accurate."" The host thanks his callers -- but when they begin to criticize the Iraqi army more than the Islamic State, he brings the conversation to a polite close. On occasion, Radio Alghad has allowed suspected Islamic State supporters to speak on the air. They complain of distortions and lies. Mohammad, the station director, recalled that one Islamic State fan said, "" The people can leave Mosul at any time,"" and the host said, ""Okay, let them go.

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)  When Donald Trump is inaugurated as the 45th president in January, Harry Reid won't be around to lead the opposition. The longtime Senate Democratic leader is retiring after three decades in Congress. And while he will no longer be at the tip of Democrats' spear -- or perhaps because he won't -- he is in no mood to join the chorus of conciliatory well-wishers hoping and praying for Trump's success. In a long statement issued Friday morning, Reid said the onus is on Trump to repair the breach in America's civic fabric that opened during the long presidential campaign, one that ""emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry."" He called the president-elect ""a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate"" and warned the media against ""normalizing"" him as he steps toward the presidency. Reid attacked and mocked Trump for months during the campaign, frequently from the Senate floor, accusing him of trafficking in lies and bullying minorities.   [Trump meets with Obama at the White House as whirlwind transition starts]   ""We as a nation must find a way to move forward without consigning those who Trump has threatened to the shadows,"" Reid said in his statement. ""Their fear is entirely rational, because Donald Trump has talked openly about doing terrible things to them. Every news piece that breathlessly obsesses over inauguration preparations compounds their fear by normalizing a man who has threatened to tear families apart, who has bragged about sexually assaulting women and who has directed crowds of thousands to intimidate reporters and assault African Americans. Their fear is legitimate and we must refuse to let it fall through the cracks between the fluff pieces."" ""Winning the electoral college does not absolve Trump of the grave sins he committed against millions of Americans,"" he continued. ""Donald Trump may not possess the capacity to assuage those fears, but he owes it to this nation to try. If Trump wants to roll back tide of hate he unleashed, he has a tremendous amount of work to do and he must begin immediately."" Reid is one of very few Democrats who could boast of his electoral performance on Tuesday. Voters in Nevada, where Reid is the dominant figure in Democratic politics, favored Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, elected Democrat Catherine Cortez-Masto to succeed Reid and gave Democrats majorities in both houses of the state legislature. Reid's statement in full: I have personally been on the ballot in Nevada for 26 elections and I have never seen anything like the reaction to the election completed last Tuesday. The election of Donald Trump has emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America. White nationalists, Vladimir Putin and ISIS are celebrating Donald Trump's victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear - especially African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, LGBT Americans and Asian Americans. Watching white nationalists celebrate while innocent Americans cry tears of fear does not feel like America. I have heard more stories in the past 48 hours of Americans living in fear of their own government and their fellow Americans than I can remember hearing in five decades in politics. Hispanic Americans who fear their families will be torn apart, African Americans being heckled on the street, Muslim Americans afraid to wear a headscarf, gay and lesbian couples having slurs hurled at them and feeling afraid to walk down the street holding hands. American children waking up in the middle of the night crying, terrified that Trump will take their parents away. Young girls unable to understand why a man who brags about sexually assaulting women has been elected president. I have a large family. I have one daughter and twelve granddaughters. The texts, emails and phone calls I have received from them have been filled with fear - fear for themselves, fear for their Hispanic and African American friends, for their Muslim and Jewish friends, for their LBGT friends, for their Asian friends. I've felt their tears and I've felt their fear. We as a nation must find a way to move forward without consigning those who Trump has threatened to the shadows. Their fear is entirely rational, because Donald Trump has talked openly about doing terrible things to them. Every news piece that breathlessly obsesses over inauguration preparations compounds their fear by normalizing a man who has threatened to tear families apart, who has bragged about sexually assaulting women and who has directed crowds of thousands to intimidate reporters and assault African Americans. Their fear is legitimate and we must refuse to let it fall through the cracks between the fluff pieces. If this is going to be a time of healing, we must first put the responsibility for healing where it belongs: at the feet of Donald Trump, a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate. Winning the electoral college does not absolve Trump of the grave sins he committed against millions of Americans. Donald Trump may not possess the capacity to assuage those fears, but he owes it to this nation to try. If Trump wants to roll back tide of hate he unleashed, he has a tremendous amount of work to do and he must begin immediately."

Charles Barkley said that, while he didn't vote for Donald Trump, ""we have to give him a chance."" Kenny Smith decried Trump's divisive campaign rhetoric, saying he ""crossed a moral line."" Shaquille O'Neal mostly agreed with Barkley. The most thoughtful remarks came from host Ernie Johnson, who seemed to be on the verge of tears as he described his conflicted emotions following Tuesday's vote.   Ernie Johnson's thoughts on the presidential election. https://t.co/mONk8ZCcBY -- NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) November 11, 2016   For the video-challenged among you, a transcription: When this campaign season started, I felt like I'd been dealt a bad hand. Had these couple of choices. And there were trust issues with Hillary Clinton that I couldn't get past. And there was the inflammatory rhetoric from Donald Trump, which to me was incomprehensible and indefensible. I couldn't vote for either one. For the first time in going to the polls for 42 years, I hit the write-in button and I voted for John Kasich. And I left knowing that John Kasich wasn't gonna win, but I left with a clear conscience because I hadn't settled. Number two, I'm hopeful. I watched the video today on CNN, what was going on in the White House with Donald Trump and President Obama. I was hopeful and I was encouraged that there will be a difference between the President Trump and the campaigning Trump. And I'm with these guys: We have to give him a chance. But here's the deal: I just hope that he's all in, in fixing the wounds in this country and the divides that separate this country. And I want to be part of that, too. And for me to be part of it, I have to look in the mirror and I have to say: 'How am I gonna be a better man? How am I gonna be a better neighbor? How am I gonna be a better citizen? How am I gonna be a better American? How can I be a fountain and not a drain?' And number three, I know you're not supposed to talk about politics and religion but we're already talking about politics so I'm gonna go the 'R' direction, too: I never know from one election to the next who's gonna be in the Oval Office, but I always know who's on the throne. And I'm on this earth because God created me, and that's who I answer to. I'm a Christian. I follow a guy named Jesus, you might have heard of him. And the greatest commandment he gave me was to love others. And scripture also tells us to pray for our leaders, and that's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna pray for Donald Trump, I'm gonna pray for all those people right now who feel like they're on the outside looking in, who are afraid at this point. I'll pray for them, too. In short, I'm praying for America, and I'm praying that one day we're gonna look back and we're gonna say: 'You know what? That Donald Trump presidency? That was all right.' But I'm praying. Ernie Johnson clearly doesn't feel like sticking to sports right now, and that's fine.

Clinton closed her campaign with an energetic rally in Raleigh, accompanied by former president Bill Clinton and their daughter Chelsea. Singer Lady Gaga performed for an audience that nearly to a person raised hands when asked how many had voted early. North Carolina's results are expected to be extremely close, and the surprise addition of Hillary Clinton's midnight rally suggested a degree of worry for Democrats. After the election ends, she told voters around 1 a.m., ""I want you to understand, our work together will be just beginning.""  Meanwhile, Trump took the stage at his final pre-election rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday morning -- capping a five-state final push that started in Florida on Monday morning and weaved though North Carolina, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. ""Today is our independence day. Today the American working class is going to strike back,"" he told the late-night audience that gathered at a convention center to hear him speak.      Where early voters have already cast their ballots View Graphic     Where early voters have already cast their ballots  Well before Trump was done speaking, a substantial portion of Trump's crowd started making its way toward the exits. In his remarks, the Republican nominee said it was ""almost hard to believe"" that Election Day had arrived, as he reflected back to the beginning of the Republican primary and the many candidates he faced and eventually defeated.  ""Now we have one flawed candidate left to beat,"" he said. Before finishing, he told voters: ""Go to bed. Go to bed right now, get up and vote."" Clinton ended her presidential bid with a tableau of Democratic stars, warning more than 33,000 supporters who gathered in Philadelphia on Monday that ""every issue that you care about is at stake."" Joined there by President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, the Democratic nominee pivoted away from the email controversy that dogged much of her campaign and cast the election as a choice ""between division and unity."" ""We choose to believe in a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America,"" she said. Her message was echoed by Obama, who told the massive crowd, ""I'm betting that tomorrow you will reject fear and you will choose hope.""     View Graphic      Michelle Obama, widely regarded as Clinton's most effective surrogate, spoke emotionally about the prospect of electing the first woman president.  ""Speaking here tonight is the last and most important thing I can do for my country as first lady,"" she said. Warning that the presidential campaigns are ""breathtakingly close,"" Michelle Obama declared that the election ""is in our hands."" ""If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win,"" she said. ""But if we stay home or we play around with a protest vote, then Hillary's opponent will win. Period, end of story.""  Around the same time, Trump took the stage to a flashy laser light show in a crowded arena in Manchester, N.H., that seats roughly 11,000. ""Tomorrow, the American working class will strike back!"" he declared. ""Do you want America to be ruled by the corrupt political class, or do you want America to be ruled again by the people?"" asked the GOP nominee to loud cheers, adding: ""Hillary Clinton's only allegiance is to herself, her donors and her special interests.""  ""Lock her up!"" the crowd began chanting moments later. Earlier Monday, a rowdy crowd in Scranton, Pa., shouted, ""She's a witch!"" and ""She's a demon!""as Trump berated Clinton. When he began to lambast the news media as dishonest, the audience erupted into a thunderous chant of ""CNN sucks!""  The Republican nominee said that the fact that the FBI had already completed its examination of newly discovered emails connected to Clinton proved that the judicial system was ""rigged."" He urged voters to ""deliver justice at the ballot box."" FBI Director James B. Comey said Sunday that the FBI had found nothing to alter its months-old decision not to seek charges against the former secretary of state for her use of a private email server. While Clinton's final rallies were headlined by singers Jon Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga, Trump was joined in Manchester by his children and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.  ""I had my family, I had the best surrogates,"" Trump said before asking his startled daughter Ivanka to speak on behalf of the family. ""I was not planning on speaking tonight, but I did want to be here on this last night, prior to Election Day, to support my father,"" she said. ""I am so incredibly proud of him ... and I know tomorrow will be another great day.""  [For FBI, email investigation yields little but criticism]  As election day drew near, Clinton appeared narrowly ahead in most polls, and her campaign officials pointed to heavy turnout among Hispanics and Asians in crucial swing states, such as Florida and North Carolina, as evidence that the race was moving in their direction.  More than 6.4 million voters in Florida have voted early, up nearly 35 percent from 2012, according to the Clinton campaign, with big early surges in majority Hispanic Miami Dade county. More broadly, the Clinton campaign said that early voter turnout was breaking records -- with more than 41 million Americans casting ballots before Election Day ""We are on the path to see more Americans vote than we have ever seen in our history,"" Clinton said in Pittsburgh. ""If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait.""  The Justice Department said Monday that it would deploy more than 500 poll-watchers from its Civil Rights Division to monitor voting in 67 jurisdictions in 28 states, including at least three in each of the swing states. Many of the jurisdictions have large Native American, black, Latino and Muslim populations The department said its lawyers would be working to enforce federal voting rights laws ""to ensure that every eligible person that wants to do so is able to cast a ballot."" It also has a hotline (toll free at 1-800-253-3931 or 202-307-3931) to register complaints.  In the last few days of the campaign, Trump has invested time and resources in blue-leaning states, including Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Most recent opinion polls show Clinton leading in all three, but Trump is hoping for a surge among white voters who lack college degrees. The real estate developer told crowd after crowd Monday that he was on track to victory, urging his supporters to ignore the ""phony stuff"" in the media. Trump continued to erroneously assert that he had given ""over $100 million"" of his personal funds to finance his campaign. (In fact, he donated a little more than $66 million, according to Federal Election Commission reports.) ""If we don't win, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy ... and money,"" Trump said in Raleigh, adding, ""If we don't win, honestly, we've all wasted our time."" Both Trump and Clinton scrambled across the country Monday, appearing within hours of each other in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Raleigh.   Clinton held four rallies in three states: North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan. The appearances reflect an electoral map that seemed to shift in the wake of Comey's announcement of the new emails nine days earlier. Clinton, who had been trying to expand the electoral map by focusing on red states that included Georgia and Arizona, has turned back to defend blue turf such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.  In an election eve push to seal Virginia for the Democrats, vice-presidential hopeful Sen. Tim Kaine urged a home state crowd in Fairfax to make history by helping to elect the first woman president. He was joined by Vice President Biden, who extended an olive branch to Trump and his supporters. ""I've been tough on Donald Trump, as tough as anyone. But when this election is over, we have got to let it go,"" Biden said. ""God willing, we are going to win this, but there are a lot of people who are going to vote for Donald Trump, we have to figure out why, what's eating at them,"" he added.  For his part, Obama appeared in Michigan several hours ahead of Clinton and used his remarks to praise the Democratic nominee and tout his work in the first term to bolster the country's then-sputtering auto industry.  ""I think I've earned some credibility here,"" Obama said of his efforts to shore up the auto industry. When it comes to voting for Clinton on Tuesday, he continued, ""I am asking you to trust me on this one.""   [Clinton holds edge in swing state Virginia]  Later in the day, in Durham, N.H., Obama grew reflective, noting that it was his final solo rally as president. He recounted the story of Edith Childs, the Greenwood, S.C., city councilwoman who coined the 2008 Obama campaign slogan ""Fired Up! Ready to Go!"" -- the same story he told at his last rally on the eve of his first election. ""It's not often you have a chance to shape history. The world is watching us,"" the president told thousands of cheering supporters who filled an arena at the University of New Hampshire. ""This is one of those moments,"" Obama added. ""Don't let it slip away.""  Gearan reported from Pittsburgh and Grand Rapids, Mich.; Sullivan from Raleigh, Sarasota, Fla., and Manchester, N.H.; and Gold from Washington.
