Mayor Muriel E. Bowser emerged from a community meeting in Mount Pleasant to a throng of angry activists. ""I don't feel safe."" ""I'm undocumented."" ""We're facing a fascist maniac."" Amid their shouts, demonstrators said they wanted Bowser to denounce Trump's immigration policies in the strong terms used by leaders of other large U.S. cities. ""I appreciate the anxiety people feel, but your anger should not be addressed to your mayor,"" said Bowser, a Democrat and Hillary Clinton supporter during the presidential election. ""Because your mayor has stood up in every case for this community, period. I have asserted firmly that we are a sanctuary city, and our policies are clear."" The crowd, which one protester said was about 100 strong, began chanting, ""Not enough.""  [ Watch the exchange between Bowser and protesters]  The extraordinary encounter was captured on video Tuesday night at Mount Pleasant Neighborhood Library, in the heart of neighborhoods that for decades have absorbed waves of Central American immigrants. It was a gauge of tensions that have gripped the District since Nov. 8, when Trump claimed the presidency over the opposition of more than 9 in 10 voters in his new city. A liberal and ethnically diverse capital that has basked for eight years in the aura of the first African American family to occupy the White House -- a family whose taste in restaurants, gyms and farmers markets became a source of local gossip and pride -- will have as its most famous occupant a man who decried the criminality of immigrants and railed against the conditions of inner cities. With the departure of President Obama, the District will also lose its most powerful defender against the whims of a Republican-dominated Congress, which will find itself newly empowered to assert control over the city's budget and legislation in a way it has seldom been able to do over the past decade. And with two months remaining before Trump assumes office, D.C. elected officials are struggling to calibrate their stance toward this new reality. The debate mirrors those discussions across the country among Trump opponents who are divided over whether conciliation or defiance is best. D.C. Council member David Grosso (I-At Large) said the District is probably in for a rough ride under Trump, no matter what public posture it adopts toward the White House. ""We already are a target,"" he said. ""That's the challenge. The District of Columbia is right here."" In no subject has the city's anxieties been more vividly displayed than on immigration. In a much-publicized plan for his first 100 days in office, Trump promises to strip all federal funding from ""sanctuary cities,"" where political leaders have decided that local law enforcement will not collaborate with federal officials to deport illegal immigrants.  [Sanctuary cities prepare for battle with Trump]  Such a punishment would be severely felt in Washington, which relies on direct federal funding for 25 percent of its budget. In New York, by contrast, the figure is 9 percent. Cities other than the District also receive a certain amount of indirect federal funding that is funneled through their states. The District ""is very dependent on the federal government for large parts of its budget and its ability to govern itself,"" said Luis Fraga, a political-science professor and co-director of the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame. ""What may be a symbolic issue in some communities is much more serious in Washington."" A sense of that risk has been evident in D.C. elected officials' measured tone when discussing the potential effects of a Trump administration. The mayors of other ""sanctuary cities"" have called news conferences in the wake of the election to reassure undocumented residents, with Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York vowing that ""we're not going to take anything lying down."" Bowser, however, issued a three-sentence statement Monday night reaffirming the District's ""sanctuary city"" status in language that some activists say was tepid. ""We were like, 'This is very lukewarm. We need more,' "" said Claudia Barragan, describing the reaction among her fellow immigration activists.  ""Our frustration came from the fact that she hadn't come out vocally in affirming D.C. was a sanctuary city,"" said Barragan, who was among the protesters at the library Tuesday night and who filmed the confrontation with Bowser. ""Meanwhile, we've been hearing in the news from Rahm Emanuel in Chicago, from the mayors in New York and Seattle."" Not all Latino community leaders agree. Jaime Contreras, head of the Capital Area District of 32BJ Service Employees International Union -- which represents janitors, security guards and other building-maintenance workers -- said the mayor's statement had reassured his members, many of whom have undocumented friends or relatives. ""I don't know how much more clear she can make it,"" Contreras said. He acknowledged, however, that ""a press conference would have been great."" On Saturday, Bowser convened a conference call to allay D.C. residents' persistent concerns about the election outcome. Organizers said the call had about 5,000 participants. ""We will stand in opposition, strong opposition, to any policies that threaten our values,"" Bowser said, adding that in her interactions with the Trump administration she would also ""continue to seek common ground on the things that would be helpful to our city, like creating more jobs, more pathways to the middle class and investments in our infrastructure."" Bowser said her staff was evaluating the potential effects of Trump's stated policies -- including his threat to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities -- but that the task was challenging because Trump has not released detailed proposals. Bowser said she intended to request a meeting with the president-elect ""at the appropriate time"" to discuss District priorities. She said she wanted to discuss statehood, the importance of preserving the Affordable Care Act and improving the Metro transit system, in addition to discussing residents' other concerns. Immigration is not the sole issue that has prompted debate among D.C. officials about how to approach Trump. At a Tuesday breakfast meeting, council members argued over whether the city should spend the customary amount on a viewing stand in front of city hall for Trump's inaugural parade.  [D.C. Council debates the $350,000 inaugural viewing stand]  Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) said he supported cutting wasteful spending on the parade bleachers but that city officials should tread carefully. It was, he said, ""not in the city's interest to just kind of give the middle finger to the president-elect."" D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the District's long-serving congressional representative, acknowledged residents' fears but said it was too early to predict what the 45th president would mean for the city. ""I regard Trump as basically a blank policy slate,"" she said. ""I'm not expecting anything."" "

Despite the change in ambition, Alain Juppe -- the leading conservative contender for the French presidency -- has maintained something of a prelate's sober discipline. If some find his solid reserve boring, others insist that his bland demeanor is precisely what makes him the ideal candidate for a France in the throes of economic malaise and reeling from a recent wave of terrorist violence. At 71, the Bordeaux mayor, calm and bourgeois, is often seen as a stern grandfather who can whip things into shape. But for many -- on the right and the left -- Juppe's main appeal in the era of Brexit and Donald Trump is that he appears the safest bet to defeat the resurgent National Front, France's far-right populist faction, in the 2017 election. French media have long treated him as if his victory is inevitable, but Trump's astonishing upset has made Juppe's supporters increasingly anxious that their candidate may prove to be a French Hillary Clinton, stunned by a defeat no one saw coming. Going into Sunday's first round of primary elections, polls still place Juppe ahead. But as countless commentators here have pointed out since Trump's victory, polls said exactly the same about Clinton right up to Election Day. And little by little, Juppe's main challengers -- France's former president Nicolas Sarkozy and former prime minister Francois Fillon -- are cutting into his lead. Whether he wins, experts say, will depend mostly on voter participation, typically low in France. Alain Juppe and Hillary Clinton are different political animals from different political systems, but there are striking parallels between the two: age, the impression of competence and a perceived lack of empathy. Like Clinton, Juppe has been at the highest levels of public life for decades, a fixture of the establishment who has known his share of unpopularity and even scandal in his long career. Like Clinton, he launched an unlikely comeback and is seeking his country's top job later in life. Like Clinton, his campaign appeals to many voters merely because the alternative seems unacceptable.   Supporters at the rally. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters)  ""It's not what he says that matters,"" said Dominique Moisi, a longtime friend of Juppe's and a co-founder of Paris's French Institute for International Relations. ""It's the perception of what he is -- a statesman, a man of gravitas and experience."" ""After the victory of Trump, he is perceived as the best bulwark against Marine Le Pen, the last defender of the bastion, so to speak,"" Moisi added. ""Because he would do the best against Marine Le Pen."" By the same token, Marine Le Pen has much in common with Donald Trump: She has no experience governing, and she has continued the National Front's evolution into a fiercely anti-establishment party of economic protectionism and anti-immigrant fervor, especially Islamophobia. Analysts still say a National Front victory in 2017 is unlikely but that Le Pen could prevail if Juppe loses to Sarkozy in the conservative primary contest. The latter has adopted the same anti-immigrant hard line Le Pen has, experts say, alienating the center left and center right voters he would need to stop her. As France's Socialist Party is in shambles following the tumultuous tenure of Francois Hollande -- the most unpopular French president in modern history and whose various responses to recent terrorist violence have alienated even his own political allies -- the traditional left has begun to settle for the centrist Juppe as the best way forward in 2017. If he is pro-business, Juppe is also staunchly pro-European, and he has run on the inclusive concept of a ""happy identity"" for all citizens in a bitterly divided society. Also appealing to the left is that Juppe's vision of France -- in marked contrast to the nationalism espoused by Sarkozy and Le Pen -- rests on an inclusive, albeit vague, conception of national identity. Notably, his vision is welcoming to Muslims, France's largest minority group and a community with which he worked extensively as mayor of Bordeaux. ""Of course I can see that France is suffering,"" he has said in response to his critics on the right. ""But what should I tell the French people? That they're going to suffer even more? My message is a message of hope, and that's what the 'happy identity' is about.""   Alain Juppe, the current mayor of Bordeaux, France, is a member of the conservative political party Les Republicains and a candidate in the party's presidential primary. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters)  ""The left will not win the next election, thanks to these bad years of Hollande,"" said Patrick Weil, France's preeminent historian of immigration and a sharp critic of Hollande's failed and controversial proposal this year to denationalize convicted terrorists who hold French citizenship. ""People want to save the republic with a decent right-wing person. They don't want to risk Marine Le Pen. They don't want a Hollande-Le Pen scenario or a Sarkozy-Le Pen scenario. So the only way not to risk the republic is to have Juppe,"" Weil said. Juppe was France's prime minister under President Jacques Chirac in the mid-1990s, when his proposed cuts to pension benefits drew thousands of protesters into the streets and ignited weeks of strikes. This was the source of his public image as cold technocrat, an image he has struggled to combat throughout his campaign. Then, in 2004, Juppe was given a suspended jail sentence after a court ruled that under his leadership, France's center-right party had illegally employed staffers from Paris's city hall. His supporters are quick to say that his conviction reflected a system that was corrupt long before he was ever in charge, and that, regardless, most voters have forgotten the unfortunate episode. But Marine Le Pen certainly has not. As she told France's L'Opinion newspaper in June: ""[Juppe] is so much the symbol of the system that we're fighting that his candidacy could actually accelerate the process of reconstructing political life that I aspire to."" Juppe spent two years in Quebec after his sentence, reinventing himself as Bordeaux's mayor upon his return to France in 2006. At this, he has been largely successful, boosting the local economy and raising the city's profile as a tourist attraction, notably with an 81 million euro ($86 million) wine museum that opened this year on the banks of the Garonne River. But these recent successes may not be enough to win him the primary or the presidency, and the same fate that befell a fellow career politician in the U.S. election could await Alain Juppe. ""The primary is becoming much more complex,"" said Moisi, referring to the rising popularity of Juppe challengers. ""And the advantage of Juppe has been diminishing by the day.""

In strident speeches and public comments, including a fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has aggressively argued that Islamic State militants pose a threat on a global scale and demanded a far more aggressive U.S. military campaign against the group. In a June interview with CNN, Flynn complained the U.S. needs to ""discredit"" radical Islam, but that ""we're not allowed to do that right now."" But his comments about Islam, a religion practiced by more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, have at times gone beyond condemning radicals inside the faith. In Flynn's book, ""The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and its Allies,"" he condemned U.S. leaders who have called Islam a religion of peace. ""This insistence on denying the existence of jihad led President Obama to the absurd claim that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam,"" Flynn wrote. In August, he spoke at an event in Dallas hosted by the anti-Islamist group Act for America, calling Islam a ""cancer"" and a ""political ideology"" that ""definitely hides behind being a religion."" Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group based in California, said in a statement that Flynn's appointment ""signals support for anti-Muslim policies and sentiment that will undermine our nation's security and exacerbate an already unsafe climate for Muslims and all Americans."" The role of national security adviser has varied by administration, but usually centers on coordinating the policy positions of the secretaries of state, defense, justice and other members of a president's national security team. It is an especially powerful position because of the national security adviser's access to the president in the West Wing of the White House. The adviser acts as a gatekeeper on a wide range of issues, including matters of war and peace as well as diplomacy and intelligence. Flynn, who turns 58 in December, served for more than three decades in the Army following his commissioning in 1981 as a second lieutenant in military intelligence. His career included a stint as director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and intelligence chief for the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. It ended, however, when he was forced to resign from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 after two turbulent years leading the Pentagon's top spy agency. Flynn traveled last year to Moscow, where he joined Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials in a celebration of the RT network, a Russian government-controlled television channel. Flynn later explained that he had been paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort. Flynn has became a harsh critic of the Obama administration's prosecution of the fight against the Islamic State group and emerged as one of Trump's most vocal backers. Throughout the campaign, Flynn championed many of Trump's foreign policy provisions, including renegotiating a seven-country agreement with Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions. Yet while Flynn has publicly issued dark warnings about the risks of Islamic violence, his private consulting firm has lobbied for a company headed by a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey's authoritarian, Islamist-leaning government, which cracked down on dissent and jailed thousands of opponents after a failed coup in July against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press on Friday that he had no relationship with Erdogan's government, even though he is member of a Turkish foreign economic relations board managed by the country's Economic Ministry. In an op-ed for the Washington newspaper The Hill just before the election, Flynn wrote that Turkey needs support and echoed Erdogan's warnings that a ""shady"" Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. Erdogan has accused the cleric, Fethullah Gullen, of orchestrating the July coup attempt and called for his extradition. The Obama administration has not complied. Alptekin said Friday that Flynn's editorial supporting Erdogan was not connected to his company's lobbying or the Turkish government. ""The Turkish government did not order that,"" he said. The Flynn Intel Group also lobbied Congress even as Flynn joined Trump in a presidential intelligence briefing in August -- a possible security misstep, according to several ethics law experts.  ""If the general was receiving classified information that could affect his business interests, that would be an obvious concern,"" said Joe Sandler, a campaign ethics lawyer and expert on the law that requires lobbyists for foreign governments to register their activities. Sandler and others also questioned why Flynn's firm registered as lobbyists with Congress instead of the Justice Department's stricter Foreign Agent unit, which requires more detailed reporting of activities under the federal Foreign Agent Registration Act.  ""If a foreign entity is lobbying Congress with the aim of influencing U.S policy, they're required to file under the foreign agent act,"" said Lydia Bennett, an expert in foreign agent work with the non-partisan Project on Government Oversight in Washington. Flynn's consulting group registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September for Inovo BV, a company Alptekin set up in the Netherlands in 2005. Alptekin said the lobbying project was designed to support an energy firm that he declined to identify. Kelley and Flynn Intel Group did not respond to calls and emails from the AP, and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Flynn said in a statement Kelley provided to Yahoo News that if he returns to the government, ""my relationship with my company will be severed."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The three parties' leaderships agreed Saturday to form a coalition of the Center Party, the left-leaning Social Democrats and the conservative IRL. Center Party leader Juri Ratas is expected to become prime minister. However, he needs to be formally appointed by President Kersti Kaljulaid, which is expected next week. The 101-seat Parliament will later this month approve the government, which controls a comfortable majority of 56 seats. On Nov. 9, Taavi Roivas, the Reform Party prime minister, was forced to resign after months of disputes with coalition partners -- the Social Democrats and the IRL Party.

Protesters marched in downtown Kuala Lumpur and later moved to the Petronas Twin Towers after failing to enter Independent Square, the city's main protest venue, which was locked down by police with water-cannon trucks on standby. Some chanted ""Save Democracy"" and ""Bersih, Bersih"" -- the name of the electoral reform group that organized the rally. The name means ""clean"" in the Malay language. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has been spearheading calls for Najib's resignation, joined the rally, adding momentum to the demonstration.  ""Everybody feels concerned about the kind of government we have now,"" said Mahathir, wearing a yellow Bersih shirt. ""We no longer live under democracy, but a kleptocracy -- a nation ruled by thieves."" The rally ended peacefully after a downpour. Najib, who is attending an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru, has kept an iron grip since corruption allegations emerged two years ago involving the indebted 1MDB state fund that he founded. 1MDB is at the center of investigations in the U.S. and several other countries. The prime minister, who has denied any wrongdoing, has called Bersih ""deceitful"" and said the group has become a tool for opposition parties to unseat a democratically elected government.  ""We want to see Malaysia more developed and not robbed of billions of ringgit,"" singer Wan Aishah Wan Ariffin, an opposition supporter, said at the rally. The protest was the fifth organized by Bersih, which also held similar demonstrations Saturday in two Malaysian cities on Borneo island. Police estimated the Bersih crowd at 15,500. The turnout was less than the 50,000 who attended the last Bersih rally, in August 2015, which also demanded that Najib quit. Online news portal Malaysiakini put the crowd Saturday at more than 40,000. Police on Friday raided the Bersih office and detained the group's chairwoman, Maria Chin, for investigation into ""activities detrimental to parliamentary democracy."" Another 19 people, mostly politicians and activists, were also detained on Friday and Saturday to prevent rioting, police said. Those detained included ruling party politician Jamal Mohamad Yunos, whose supporters, numbering about 2,500, trooped to downtown to counter the Bersih rally. Police banned the rallies by Bersih's yellow-shirt supporters and Jamal's red-shirt group. Lawyer Eric Paulsen tweeted that Chin was formally detained Saturday under a security law meant to be used against terrorists and can be held for a further 28 days. The other activists were remanded for several days in police custody. Amnesty International slammed the crackdown and called for the immediate release of the Bersih activists, describing them as prisoners of conscience. ""These arrests are the latest in a series of crude and heavy-handed attempts to intimidate Malaysian civil society activists and other human rights defenders,"" Amnesty said in a statement. The investigations into 1MDB fund are centered on allegations of a global embezzlement and money-laundering scheme. Najib started the fund shortly after taking office in 2009 to promote economic development projects, but the fund accumulated billions in debt over the years. The U.S. Justice Department said that at least $3.5 billion had been stolen from 1MDB by people close to Najib and initiated action in July to seize $1.3 billion it said was taken from the fund to buy assets in the U.S. The U.S. government complaints also said that more than $700 million had landed in the accounts of ""Malaysian Official 1."" They did not name the official, but appear to be referring to Najib. Support for Najib's National Front has eroded in the last two general elections. It won in 2013, but lost the popular vote for the first time to an opposition alliance. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Koreans rally against Park	" SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea is seeing its biggest wave of street demonstrations in decades, but gone are the raised fists, flying rocks and police water cannons that had symbolized the intensity of the country's protest culture. For the tens of thousands of people who filled a major avenue in downtown Seoul for the fourth straight Saturday, demanding the resignation of scandal-ridden President Park Geun-hye has become a form of family entertainment. That means rock music, comedy, open mics and pinata bashing.  ""My kids are having fun ... they just love these plastic horns,"" said Hong Seon-ok, who sat on a mattress with her three daughters, the oldest of them 10. ""I definitely wanted to come out and show my daughters we can accomplish something by protesting."" Police said about 170,000 people turned out for the latest anti-Park protest in streets near City Hall and a boulevard fronting an old palace gate, where a week earlier, hundreds of thousands marched in what may have been the largest protest in the country since it freed itself from dictatorship three decades ago. Protest organizers sized Saturday's crowd at 600,000. Demonstrators also marched in streets near the presidential offices, carrying candles and illuminating cellphones, and shouting ""Park Geun-hye step down"" and ""Arrest Park Geun-hye."" The rally came as state prosecutors prepared to question Park over suspicions that she allowed a secretive confidante to manipulate power from the shadows and amass an illicit fortune, a scandal that critics say undermines the country's democracy. On Sunday, prosecutors plan to indict the confidante, Choi Soon-sil, and two presidential aides who allegedly helped her interfere with state affairs and bully companies into giving tens of millions of dollars to foundations she controlled. The protests continue to draw people from all ages and regions, including many families with children. People swayed to the music of the rock band Deulgukhwa, which played in front of a massive video screen on a temporary stage that has become the center of the rallies. Earlier Saturday, children threw bean bags at a Park pinata, which burst open to reveal a Choi pinata. Popping out from the smaller pinata was a Barbie doll on a stuffed horse, meant to be Choi's daughter, an equestrian athlete who allegedly got a virtual free pass into an elite university because of her family's presidential ties. Nearby, actors impersonating Choi and Park encouraged protesters to mock them.  ""Satire, not anger, is the strongest form of expression,"" said Lim Ok-sang, an artist who created the pinata. For teenagers stuck in South Korea's hyper-competitive school environment, the allegations surrounding Choi's daughter, Yoora Chung, 20, seemed to be their biggest source of anger. In South Korea, graduating from elite universities is seen as important in career and even marriage prospects.  ""We invest blood and sweat into our studies to get into a good school, and it's disheartening to see how everything was so easy for Chung,"" said Moon Jeong-ju, a high school student who took an eight-hour bus ride from the southern city of Suncheon to participate in the rally. On Friday, South Korea's Education Ministry said it demanded that Ewha Womans University cancel the admission of Chung after it found that the school had manipulated its admissions process to accept her. Emboldened by the huge protests in recent weeks, opposition parties have been stepping up pressure to force Park to quit. On Thursday, they used their parliamentary majority to pass a law that would allow for a special prosecutor to independently investigate the scandal and potentially expose the president's wrongdoings. There is a growing voice within the opposition that an impeachment attempt is inevitable because it's unlikely Park will resign and give up her immunity from prosecution.

Jeff Sessions for attorney general sets off jockeying for his seat in Alabama, leaving the state's embattled Republican governor -- who faced an impeachment push after affair allegations -- to choose a successor. The rush to fill Sessions' Senate term comes in a year that saw the state House speaker removed from office after being convicted of corruption. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore -- best known for his refusal to take down the Ten Commandments at the courthouse -- also got the boot for his defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage. The senator's replacement would be appointed by Gov. Robert Bentley, who denied having an affair with a top aide but admitted making inappropriate remarks to her.  ""Whoever I choose, there are certain criteria. No. 1 is whoever I choose has to support the agenda for the new president,"" Bentley said Friday. ""I want the next senator to be as conservative as Senator Sessions, to be very much like him."" Sessions, a former state attorney general, was elected to the Senate in 1996. His selection by President-elect Donald Trump was disclosed Friday by a senior Trump official who wasn't authorized to speak publicly about it. The official wouldn't say whether Sessions had accepted the job, leaving open the possibility that the appointment wasn't final. Two of the highest-ranking Republicans in state office -- Attorney General Luther Strange and Senate President Del Marsh -- are among those thought to be interested in the job. The state's congressional representatives, such as Rep. Mike Rogers and Rep. Robert Aderholt, and numerous legislators are also potential contenders. A potential wrinkle for Strange, though: His office called off a House committee investigating whether the governor should be impeached. Strange, in a letter this month to the committee chairman, said his office was doing ""related work"" but did not elaborate. Bentley said he will ask the Alabama Republican Party executive committee to submit suggestions to him for filling the seat. But guessing whom he might choose quickly became a favorite parlor game in the capital of Montgomery that some joked needed a flow chart because of the complex political relationships and potential reverberations for each pick. Bentley joked this week about his sudden influx of new friends.  ""You will have a crush of people talking to his office about multiple good candidates,"" Alabama Republican Party Chairwoman Terry Lathan said. Bill Stewart, a former chairman of the political science department at the University of Alabama, said Bentley is known for his unpredictability.  ""There may be somebody he would name that we are not even thinking about at this point,"" Stewart said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The announcement on Friday has stoked tensions ahead of next month's planned early elections, with the governing conservative party accusing the prosecutor's office of working for the opposition. The special prosecutor's office said in a statement that it also believes the illegal eavesdropping continued after the scandal broke in early 2015. The 10, including an unnamed former head of the intelligence service, are suspected of abuse of power and authority. Their names were not made public. The special prosecutor's office said any charges would be brought after the conclusion of an investigation into the case. The large-scale wiretapping scandal, whose 20,000 alleged victims included politicians, journalists, judges, police and religious leaders, was revealed last year by the country's leftist opposition leader, Zoran Zaev. He laid the blame on conservative former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski -- who governed from 2006 until earlier this year and is running for re-election next month -- and former intelligence chief Saso Mijalkov, who is Gruevski's cousin. The conservatives deny the charges -- fingering unnamed foreign spies -- and accused Zaev of plotting a coup. The ensuing political crisis, the deepest since Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, has resulted in early elections now scheduled for Dec. 11 after being twice postponed earlier this year. Campaigning starts Monday, and Gruevski's conservative party issued a press release accusing chief special prosecutor Katica Janeva's office of being Zaev's ""extended arm"" and interfering with the election campaign. Zaev had published dozens of allegedly illegally wire-taped conversations last year, claiming Gruevski and his aides were involved in multi-million corruption deals, fabricating election results and intimidating political opponents. Prosecutor Fatime Fetai told reporters in the capital Skopje Friday that the special prosecutor's office has evidence that the unlawful interception of communications continued into this year, albeit on a smaller scale, despite the revelations nearly two years ago. She also said two of the wiretapping systems used from 2008-2015 have since been destroyed.  ""That significantly delayed (efforts) to gather evidence,"" she said. The special prosecutor's office already has opened another investigation into the destruction of the systems. Five intelligence service officials have been designated as suspects in that case.

Woodward/the Washington Post)  In the weeks and months ahead, hundreds of political appointees will be chosen for important leadership jobs in the new administration, and if confirmed by the Senate, will face a wide array of political, policy and management challenges. During a panel discussion this fall at my organization, the Partnership for Public Service, two seasoned political appointees -- Scott Gould, the former deputy secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs in the Obama administration, and Sean O'Keefe, who was administrator of NASA in the George W. Bush administration -- offered insights into navigating the world of government leadership. Both are members of the Partnership's board of directors. While the two experienced bumps and bruises from their time in government and are realists, they have remained idealistic about the importance and responsibilities of public service. They also cautioned that these jobs cannot be about ego or oneself. ""A lot of people who get political appointments mistakenly believe that the job is a reward - a means to advance their careers. No. This is about the mission - it's a chance to serve,"" Gould said. O'Keefe agreed. ""A presidential appointment is not a reward. It is an assignment of public duty at the highest levels with the expressed confidence of the president - an often intimidating responsibility to uphold,"" he said. O'Keefe warned that the challenges will be enormous and the critics plentiful, including Congress, the press, the inspectors general, the Governmental Accountability Office and even the person who sits next to you in the airplane when you tell them that you work for the government. ""You're going to get lots of input. You've got to be aware of that. It should be expected, not resented. It's the nature of these jobs and it is your responsibility to work through it,"" he said. O'Keefe also pointed out that appointees must be aware that the start of the new administration will be chaotic. ""It's just an overwhelming array of decisions and issues that gets served up,"" he said, and unless you have a process in place for managing and for making decisions, that will ""basically leave you subjected to whatever is the latest and newest issue or whoever talks the loudest."" ""And that's hardly a recipe for coming up with any sort of prioritization,"" O'Keefe said. Gould said establishing and committing to a decision-making process at the start is crucial when it comes to managing day-to-day issues, long-term plans and the inevitable crises. ""These types of decisions are made differently and often with different players at the table,"" he said. ""Once the bullets start flying, you need to have a plan in place to know how to behave and react."" O'Keefe added that in crisis situations, you need to ""lay out a path with the recognition that there are limits of what you know."" ""You need to build in enough opportunities to be responsive in the immediate term and to adjust as more information becomes available,"" O'Keefe said. In addition, he said leaders should be as precise as possible regarding the appropriate remedies, be prepared for the critics and the unexpected way people will behave. In the broader context, both men emphasized the importance of building strong leadership teams that include both political appointees and career executives, and ensuring that there are diverse perspectives at the table. Gould said government departments and agencies are staff driven, with success depending on ""trusting and delegating to your career team, involving them and reaching deep into the organization to get the expertise to bring it forward, providing credit when credit is due."" ""Giving people a way to voice their concerns early and deep in the process will help you end up getting better quality decisions,"" Gould said. ""You need to bring warring parties in bureaucracy into the open, let them make their strongest arguments for and against, and then make the decision with all the facts in front of you."" O'Keefe said he too feels strongly that leaders must consider ""all of the various options, opposing views and the different approaches."" ""Once the decision is made, it is your responsibility as a leader to articulate the references, reservations and full understanding of the consequence of a decision,"" O'Keefe said. ""While there will continue to be concerns and objections going forward, at least you understand where they are coming from."" The issues cited by Gould and O'Keefe are just a few of the items that political appointees need to be aware of when coming into government. Other matters include dealing with Congress, interactions with the White House, common ethics violations, and understanding the intricacies of the federal hiring, technology and acquisition processes. While the policy and management challenges will be significant, the hours long and the monetary rewards small compared to the private sector, most former political appointees I have talked with look back at their government service as among their best professional experiences, and well worth the trials and tribulations.

The $1.5 billion effort, which helps struggling rice farmers in part by guaranteeing prices well above market rates, is ironic given its similarities to the larger subsidy program for which the junta has castigated ex-premier Yingluck Shinawatra. But the current government may have had little choice but to act. Global prices for the grain have plummeted to their lowest in nearly a decade, severely weakening an industry crucial to Thailand's economic well-being. Some analysts say the about-face is also intended to stave off potential unrest during the sensitive, year-long mourning period following the death last month of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and to win over some of the politically powerful farmers who make up 40 percent of the population. The rice-growing north is a traditional stronghold of Yingluck and her allies. The junta has begun to realize ""they simply cannot ignore the plight of the farmers anymore, especially (if) they wish to be in power for the long term,"" said Puangthong R. Pawakapan, an associate professor at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former army chief who spearheaded the coup two years ago, has vowed to restore civilian rule through elections in late 2017. There is speculation he could stay on as premier, and in any case, the nation's new constitution guarantees the military a strong hand in politics for years to come. The putsch was the culmination of a decade of political turmoil that boiled over after the army ousted Yingluck's brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, in a 2006 coup. The conflict, in broad terms, is part of a societal schism that pits the majority rural poor against an urban-based elite establishment supported by the army and staunch royalists who see Yingluck's family as a corrupt threat to the traditional structures of power. In 2011, Yingluck's Pheu Thai Party won elections in part by promising to pay farmers nearly double the price that rice then fetched on the world market, a move critics equated to vote-buying. The hope was that by stockpiling rice, the government could drive up world prices. But producers such as Vietnam took up the slack, bumping Thailand from its spot as the world's leading rice exporter. The government lost billions of dollars and about 8 million tons of the rice it purchased sits unsold in warehouses. Yingluck told The Associated Press that ""in principle, there is no difference"" between the junta's effort and that of her government, an assessment some analysts agree with. The junta's plan is similar to Yingluck's in that it is offering artificially high prices for rice, dispersing large sums to farmers and encouraging them to keep the grain off market in hopes of stimulating prices. But Jitti Mongkolnchaiarunya, dean of Thammasat University's School of Development Studies, said the latest plan is less risky because its scope is smaller, its price ceilings lower, and rice farmers -- not the government -- will be responsible for storage. Yingluck's administration, for example, offered 15,000 to 20,000 baht ($421 to $561) per ton of rice, compared to 10,500 to 13,000 ($294 to $365) offered by Prayuth's government. None of that, though, guarantees the effort will be a success, Jitti said, because global supply and demand cannot be controlled. Prayuth has said he wants to wean farmers off populist policies and has warned government aid is ""not limitless.""  ""The government must have ... the courage to deal with these issues,"" Jitti said, ""because it's all related to politics. Everything is politics."" Indeed, shortly after Prayuth's government announced its plans, Yingluck bought 10 tons of rice from farmers and made a public show of helping to sell it -- at cost -- outside a Bangkok mall. Last week, she did it again at another mall just southeast of Bangkok in Samut Prakan. It was a brazen move for Yingluck, who could be sentenced to 10 years in prison if convicted of criminal negligence charges related to her government's rice subsidy. But in a country where free speech is suppressed and bans on large political gatherings have almost completely silenced the opposition, helping farmers sell rice offered a rare means of speaking out.  ""I think she intended to challenge the junta,"" Puangthong said. Prayuth and his supporters have condemned such moves as publicity stunts, though Yingluck claims she was only doing it to help farmers. One person who showed up to buy rice in Samut Prakan, Samruey Thappan, said she was doing it not only ""to help farmers, but to help Yingluck because she's a good person who is being harassed."" Farmers say they need assistance, no matter who's offering it. Political fights ""have no relevance to us,"" said Weerachai Wongbut, a 59-year-old who traveled to Bangkok from the northern province of Uttaradit to sell rice at a market stall this month. ""We just need help."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "
