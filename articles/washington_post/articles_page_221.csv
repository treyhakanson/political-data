The ministry said Friday such settlements are contrary to ""Israeli and international law,"" and ""greatly undermine"" the possibility of a two-state solution. Israel's parliament this week gave preliminary approval to a contentious bill that would retroactively legalize hundreds of homes in West Bank settlements that sit on private Palestinian land. Sweden urged Israel not to adopt this legislation, adding ""it opens up for the legalization of a large number of settlements."" Stockholm's relations with Israel have been strained since the Social Democratic-led government in 2014 recognized Palestinian statehood, and Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom's comments on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have elicited angry responses from Israeli officials.

Mohammad Naser Mehri, spokesman for the provincial governor in Farah, says the attack happened around midnight on Thursday in the Bakwa district, when a police convoy came under attack. He says Taliban insurgents ambushed the convoy from different directions, killing the policemen. Mehri says the attack was repelled when reinforcement reached the scene. Taliban spokesman, Qari Yusouf Ahmadi claimed responsibility for the attack in Farah. Ahmadi says Taliban fighters seized much weapons and ammunitions from the convoy they attacked. The Taliban have intensified attacks on Afghan security forces in recent months by planting roadside bombs and staging suicide attacks or ambushes of security forces or civilian convoys across the country.

Wilson, decided Friday, Nov. 4: Thomas M. Wilson and the Campaign for Justice PAC (collectively, ""appellants"") challenge the issuance of a temporary restraining order (""TRO""), without bond, by Judge Paulette Irons ... in favor of Judge Regina Bartholomew-Woods ... at 11:00 p.m. on November 3, 2016, ""restraining, enjoining, and prohibiting ... [PAC] and all persons, firms or companies acting or claiming to act on their behalf, or in concert with them, from publishing, broadcasting, speaking, writing or making any other types of declarations or interest posts, public or private, indicating in any way that Regina Bartholomew Woods or her campaign was 'caught lying' or 'ordered by a judge to stop lying.'"" The order set no date for hearing of any preliminary writ of injunction, but did say that the TRO would expire on its own terms November 13, 2016. We take judicial notice that the election at issue is set for November 8, 2016, so, without a hearing date set, the TRO by its own terms operates as a quasi-final judgment. The appellants base their challenge on the fact that [Louisiana law] specifically prohibits the issuance of a TRO without first providing notice and an opportunity to be heard by the adverse party, and that the petition for TRO was not randomly allotted to a division of court. Because the appellants were not given an opportunity to oppose the entry of the TRO, we vacate the TRO. ... Judge Woods's petition contains a purported certificate of service indicating that a copy of the petition was served on November 3, 2016 on ""all known counsel"" and/or all know parties by facsimile, electronic mail and/or mailing the same by United States mail,"" but does not identify who was served, when service was attempted, and/or offers any indication that the request for the TRO would be presented to a judge at any particular time of day or place, or in this case, late at night. ... [O]ur Supreme Court has [also] made clear on multiple occasions that a TRO does not lie to enjoin speech and other forms of communications associated with an election, regardless of the content of that speech. That is to say, La. Const. Art. I, SS 7 [""No law shall curtail or restrain the freedom of speech or press. Every person may speak, write, and publish his sentiments on any subject, but is responsible for abuse of that freedom.""] grants a complete safeguard against any prior restraint on protected speech in a campaign. Thus, as a matter of law, the TRO was improperly requested by Judge Woods, and improperly entered by the trial court not only because inadequate notice to the appellants to give the appellants an opportunity to oppose the entry of the TRO, but also because the trial court did not order the posting of a bond and granted Judge Woods relief in a matter for which she states no cause of action for injunctive relief. Judge Woods's cause of action is solely for defamation as an ordinary, not summary, action and then after service, citation, and answer by the defendant, and trial on the merits. In sum, the appeal of the appellants is converted to an application for a writ application for supervisory review, the application for writ is granted, and judgment is rendered herein vacating, setting aside and nullifying the TRO entered in this case on November 3, 2016 in favor of Judge Woods and against the appellants. I think the appellate court was quite right to set aside the injunction, the judge who issued it (Judge Paulette Irons) was quite wrong to issue it, and Judge Regina Bartholomew-Woods was wrong to seek it, given its clear illegality (both substantive and procedural). Some states have indeed allowed injunctions against specific libelous statements, after a full trial on the merits in which the statements have been found libelous. But an injunction against speech that's entered not just before trial but without opportunity for the speaker to be heard -- and on top of that, in the midst of an election campaign -- is clearly impermissible."

That was true both for those backing Democrat Hillary Clinton and those supporting Republican Donald Trump, according to preliminary results of exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. After a long, hard-fought campaign, just 4 out of 10 voters strongly favored their candidate. That's a shift from 2012, when about two-thirds of voters said they were voting because they strongly favored their candidate. Other findings from the exit poll: ABOUT THAT WALL After all the talk during the campaign about immigration, it turned out to be a low priority for most voters: Just 1 in 10 voters said immigration was the most important issue facing the country. As for Trump's plan to build a ""big, beautiful"" wall, more than half of voters opposed the idea. Further, 7 in 10 Americans thought immigrants now in the country illegally should be allowed to stay, and just a quarter thought they should be deported. That despite Trump's tough talk about removing those who are in the country illegally. Immigration was the top issue for about a fifth of Trump voters and less than 1 in 10 Clinton voters. Twenty percent of Hispanics chose immigration as the top issue. Only about 10 percent of other voters picked it as the No. 1 issue. The economy was the top issue for both Trump and Clinton supporters. SPLIT VIEWS ON ACCURACY OF VOTE COUNT After all of Trump's talk about a ""rigged"" election, most Americans went to the polls with at least a moderate amount of confidence that their votes would be counted accurately. Those who cast ballots for Clinton were far more likely to feel very confident about the accuracy of the vote: About 7 in 10 Clinton voters felt very confident in the count, compared with about 3 in 10 Trump voters. Overall, about half of voters felt very confident in the vote count, and a third were somewhat confident. Less than 2 in 10 said they weren't very confident or were not at all confident in the vote count. In 2004 and 2008, voters were only slightly more certain about the accuracy of the vote count. About half of voters were very confident in the count, and 4 in 10 were somewhat confident. ___ The survey was conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research with 15,445 voters as they left their polling places at 350 randomly selected sites throughout the United States supplemented by 4,404 telephone interviews with mail, early and absentee voters. The results among all those voting have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. ___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac and Emily Swanson at http://twitter.com/EL_Swan Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Trump.  Amid scattered reports of technical problems, polling stations were inundated with voters who endured long lines to render their verdict in what has been the most bitterly contested presidential race in generations.  While Clinton expects resounding victories in Maryland and the District, both of which are heavily Democratic, she was hoping to hold off Trump in Virginia, a key swing state where she has led in polls. No matter their choice, many voters expressed anguish over an election defined by unyielding barbs and whiplash-inducing revelations.    Nelvia Diaz and her husband Leonel Diaz, who are originally from Guatemala and now live in Manassas, voted for Hillary Clinton and other Democrats because of Donald Trump's stance on immigrants. (Photo by Astrid Riecken For The Washington Post) (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)  ""I am so disillusioned in our political system,"" said Belinda Randle, 59, a D.C. resident who cast her ballot for Clinton. ""I am voting because it's my duty, but I don't expect any of them to do anything anymore.""  Others were more enthusiastic, whether crowing over the raw tone of Trump's campaign or the thrill of possibly electing the nation's first female president.  ""It's not because she's the lesser of two evils,"" said Monica Sukhatme, a 33-year-old resident of Chevy Chase, Md., explaining her vote for Clinton. ""It's because she deserves to win with the record she's had."" Turnout among Latino voters seemed especially robust in Northern Virginia, with immigrants such as Marie Vargas, 72, saying they had recently become citizens so they could vote for Clinton.  Vargas's granddaughter, Jesenia Gomez, 19, also chose Clinton as the recipient of her first vote after growing fed up with Trump's criticism of Latinos and promise to build a wall separating the United States from Mexico.  ""It's time for a change and I don't think separating people is what we need right now, "" Gomez said at a polling station in Woodbridge. Yet, Trump supporters were also discernable among the immigrants who voted.     Before polls opened at 6 a.m., voters in Northern Virginia were already in line to cast their vote at Langley High School on Election Day. (Photo: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP, Getty, Video/WUSA 9)   Polash Chowdhurry, 60, a Muslim who immigrated to the United States from Bangladesh in 1985, said he was voting for Trump because he would break up what he described as Washington's ""cartel.""  Referring to Trump's promise to ban Muslims from the United States, Chowdhurry said, ""He's not against Muslim people. He's against Muslim terrorists."" Voting proceeded smoothly in most places, though there were occasional reports of problems. By midday, voters at one Prince George's County polling station were waiting nearly two hours because only one ballot scanner was available for a precinct of 2,600 registered voters.   [The latest Election Day news]  At the Clearview Elementary School polling station in Herndon, voters expressed a wide spectrum of views about Clinton and Trump, their often clashing perspectives echoing divisions that have emerged nationally.  ""I looked at Trump and said, 'Oh hell, no,'"" said Tom Robinson, a systems analyst for the Defense Department. ""He has zero experience in government and has no idea what he's doing, and people in his own party can't stand him. He's a nasty, vindictive individual.""  Nancy Fish, 65, a retired teacher's assistant in special education, said she couldn't vote for Clinton ""because of the dishonesty factor."" ""Trump and the Republicans have the same policies that match my Christian convictions,"" she said.  In the suburban Richmond swing territory of Henrico County, one woman left her polling place in tears, her teen-age daughter at her side. ""I would love to go down in the history books as voting for the first woman ever,"" a woman said after voting in a suburb outside Richmond. But she said she found Clinton too objectionable. As for Trump, she said he was off the table ever since he made fun of a disabled reporter. ""I made a choice but don't feel good about it,"" she said, refusing to identify who got her vote. In Maryland, voters were choosing between Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D) and Republican Kathy Szeliga, a state delegate from Baltimore County, to succeed retiring Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D).  In Virginia, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) faced a robust challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett in the 10th Congressional District, which includes Loudoun and portions of Fairfax and Prince William counties. In Washington, voters in Ward 7 are expected to elect Vincent C. Gray to the D.C. Council, capping a political rebirth for the former mayor, who lost reelection in 2014 amid a campaign finance scandal.  [Tim Kaine casts his ballot in Virginia, ending Democratic campaign close to home]  Ballot initiatives in the region include a statehood referendum in the District that, if passed by voters, would require congressional approval. At the Hendley Elementary School in D.C.'s Ward 8, a low-income and heavily African-American neighborhood that so far has reaped few of the benefits of the gentrification, a number of voters said they were opposed to D.C. statehood. All agreed that the topic needed a fuller public airing. ""I prefer to remain a District. I don't know that being a state is going to do anything for me that being a District won't do for me,"" said Cynthia Purnell, 69, a registered Democrat.  ""I don't want D.C. to be a state,"" said Nikki Taylor, a 42-year-old registered Democrat, who said she worried that statehood would mean more taxes. In her neighborhood, few knew or cared about city elected officials' quest for statehood, Taylor said.  Even William Brown, 79 - who said he had voted yes on the statehood initiative - acknowledged he didn't understand statehood's potential consequences. ""To be frank with you, I don't know all of the details involved with it,"" he said. ""I've never really lived in a state. I've been living in the District since I was 16 or 17 years old.""  In Virginia, a ""right to work"" measure, if ratified, would incorporate into the state constitution a measure that weakens labor unions.  At the county level, voters in Fairfax will decide on a proposed meals tax to fund public education. In Prince George's, an initiative to expand the county council is on the ballot, while Montgomery voters will decide whether to enact term limits. ""I'm against term limits. It's up to the voters,"" said Bob Levin, 76, of Chevy Chase. ""They want to throw the bums out? Let them throw the bums out."" The region's most rollicking local race is in Richmond, where scandal-tarred independent Joe Morrissey, a former Democratic state delegate, is running for mayor against five opponents, including Levar Stoney, a protege to Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), and Jack Berry, who has vast support within the city's business community.  Morrissey spent three months in jail after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor for sleeping with a teenager. The woman is now married to Morrissey and the mother of his two children. But the day's main event was the White House race. Though Clinton has led in the commonwealth for months, Trump's campaign in the final three weeks said it was spending $2 million on television advertising in the state.  [Have you experienced problems voting? ]  Nathan Brinkman of Arlington County voted for Trump after having chosen Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during Virginia's GOP primary. ""I viewed him with no small amount of skepticism,"" Brinkman, 40, said of Trump. ""But he obviously tapped into something the more conventional candidates missed. He seems to have sparked a movement.""  Northern Virginia's growing immigrant population, however, may give Clinton an edge. After 31 years in the United States as legal permanent residents, Marco and Susana Tanchez finally became citizens earlier this year so they could vote for the Democrat. Melissa Sargent, a 32-year-old mother in Woodbridge, said it was her son who motivated her to vote for the first time in her life Tuesday. The 10-year-old boy labeled Nov. 8 on his calendar as the ""the day I am scared."" The family is part Mexican, and he worried that Trump would deport them. ""Our children should not feel scared,"" she said. ""They should feel happy and protected and good in their own country."" James Daly, 58, a former Air Force photo intelligence officer, declared his allegiance to Trump as he voted in Prince William County. ""She's a liar. A crook!"" he said of Clinton, his voice rising in anger. ""Trump speaks to how people feel, and he's going to help people get working again."" Democrats were taking nothing for granted. On Monday night, Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, campaigned with Vice President Biden at George Mason University. The popular former governor then finished the campaign with a rally near his home in Richmond.  Early Tuesday, Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, arrived at their local polling place, the Hermitage, a retirement community in Richmond.  After he voted, Kaine was greeted with applause by those waiting on line behind him.   [How to vote in each state]  ""Anne and I have been voting in this precinct for 24 years, and it's so nice to just be able to walk over from our house,"" Kaine told reporters. ""It's kind of like we've done all we can do, and now it's in the hands of voters."" In Virginia's 10th Congressional District, Comstock was fighting off a stiff challenge from Bennett, a business executive who is the ex-wife of former congressman James P. Moran Jr.  In a district rife with moderate voters, Comstock struggled for months to distance herself from Trump, even as she was wary of alienating Republicans. Comstock only renounced Trump last month, after a 2005 videotape emerged in which he had bragged about groping women.  Nelvia Diaz, a voter in Manassas, said that was a dealbreaker. When she learned that Comstock had not immediately renounced Trump, Diaz said, ""I stopped listening to her."" In Maryland's Senate race, Van Hollen, a popular Montgomery County-based congressman, led throughout the campaign against Szeliga. He is expected to take over a seat occupied for the last 30 years by Mikulski, the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate on her own.   Gray's return to the District's political stage seemed more than unlikely after he lost the 2014 Democratic primary to Muriel E. Bowser, who went on to become mayor. At the time, Gray was the target of a federal investigation into his 2010 mayoral campaign.  Gray was never charged with a crime and has remained infuriated by the duration of an investigation that he has blamed for his defeat, and that continues to sour some voters. ""Ever since that scandal he was involved in, I don't trust him,"" said Danielle Duncan, a 33-year-old registered Republican.  Robert Contee, 61, was in a more forgiving mood, saying he welcomed Gray's return. ""I say everybody deserves a second chance -- give him a second chance,"" Contee said. ""It's just like you would do from a parent to a child. The child might make an error, but you as a parent have to forgive the child."" Polls will be open until 7 p.m. in Virginia and until 8 p.m. in Maryland and the District.

Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortes said at a news conference Tuesday evening that among the ""isolated issues"" were long lines in Richmond, Chesapeake, Prince William, Spotsylvania and Staunton. He says elections officials are monitoring the lines and reminds voters that anyone in line by the time polls close at 7 p.m. will be able to vote. Cortes says several precincts in northern Virginia's Fairfax County didn't properly load their electronic poll book data, so some people who likely were registered weren't showing up. He says those people were given provisional ballots and the elections office will work quickly to process them. He says the department also got complaints from some voters who had registered at Department of Motor Vehicle offices but weren't on the rolls. Cortes says that happens every election and an audit process is in place to confirm who registered and process their provisional ballots. ___ 3:50 p.m. An election official in Virginia's most populous county says some poll workers were inappropriately asking voters for their driver's licenses instead of the other forms of identification they presented. Fairfax County General Registrar Cameron Sasnett says the poll workers were reminded that numerous forms of ID are accepted at Virginia polling places. He says no voters were turned away. Sasnett says the confusion arose in part because the county is using new devices that can scan driver's licenses and look up voters more quickly. He says he knows of at least two polling places where the problem occurred. ___ 1:45 p.m. Virginia elections officials say there have been scattered problems at polling places in the state, but nothing major. Virginia Department of Elections spokeswoman Dena Potter says police were called after two voters started yelling at each other in Chesterfield County. She says officers resolved the issue and no one was arrested. Potter says there was a display issue with electronic voting machines in Nottoway County. After voters made their choice for president, the selection was displayed under the header ""U.S. Senate."" She says the votes were still counted accurately despite the inaccurate display. Potter also says there have been long lines because of high turnout at some polling places, including in Richmond. ___ 8:15 a.m. Tim Kaine is not letting the biggest election of his life get in the way of his Tuesday routine. After voting at 6 a.m. and doing a round of national morning TV shows, Kaine met a group of friends for breakfast at the City Diner in Richmond. Kaine and his friends try to meet every Tuesday at the diner, a few miles from his home. The U.S. senator and former Virginia governor was greeted with cheers as he walked into the restaurant. ___ 6:15 a.m. Tim Kaine has cast his ballot for president in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia. The Democratic vice presidential nominee and his wife, Anne Holton, voted shortly after polls opened at 6 a.m. at a retirement community near their home. Kaine was cheered by supporters waiting in line. After voting, he spoke to reporters where he encouraged Americans to vote and said that if elected, he and running mate Hillary Clinton would try and bring the country together.  ""The sign of a vigorous democracy is one where a lot of people participate,"" Kaine said. ___ 5:30 a.m. Virginians are deciding whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump will win the swing state's 13 electoral votes, and voters also will weigh in on several crucial congressional and mayoral races. Leading to Tuesday, polls have shown Clinton leading Trump in Virginia, which is the home of her running mate Tim Kaine. Kaine represents Virginia in the U.S. Senate and previously served as mayor of Richmond and governor of Virginia. Other key races to watch include the battle for Virginia's 10th Congressional District, where freshman Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock is trying to fend off a serious challenge from Democrat LuAnn Bennett. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Its letter of endorsement makes clear that Trump's rhetoric about law enforcement -- police get no respect, crime is rising, Black Lives Matter is to blame for police deaths, etc. -- has been effective. ""Mr. Trump ... has seriously looked at the issues facing law enforcement today,"" the letter reads. ""He understands and supports our priorities and our members believe he will make America safe again."" Police unions often play a role in elections. The FBI doesn't. Following FBI director James B. Comey's letter to Congress last week in which he suggested that newly uncovered emails (found on the computer of Anthony Weiner) would reinvigorate the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server, a number of other leaks ensued, to a number of different media outlets. Among the most substantial was a leak that the FBI had pressed for an investigation into the Clinton Foundation that didn't come to fruition. The Wall Street Journal reported that the debate was symptomatic of a broader feud within the agency over the candidates for president. On Thursday, multiple outlets added more context, reporting that FBI agents sympathetic to Trump's candidacy were perhaps intentionally hoping to guide the outcome of the race. ThinkProgress reported that the agency was looking into why a long-dormant agency account had suddenly started tweeting Trump-sympathetic details of past investigations. Bloomberg's Eli Lake indicated that Comey's political moves meant that ""[t]hrough leaks and tweets, people in his bureau appear to be helping Donald Trump."" The Guardian's Spencer Ackerman spoke with a current agent who put it flatly: ""The FBI is Trumpland."" Others disputed the extent to which pro-Trump sentiment existed in the Bureau, suggesting that frustration with Clinton was often matched by frustration with Trump. What makes the moment unusual is that the agents are acting on their political beliefs. ""It certainly seems as though things are working a little bit differently this cycle than in previous cycles,"" Heath Brown, assistant professor of public policy at John Jay College, told me when we spoke by phone last month. Brown has written about the transition of power between presidents. He noted that things like the FOP's endorsement are typical, and usually about as far as law enforcement agencies will go, ""knowing that they are going to have to work with whoever wins the ultimate election."" ""There's this other dimension to it,"" he added, ""which is the difference between the political interests of law enforcement and the expectations of impartiality in their involvement in the enactment of the election. That's always been the expectation and always been the practice of law enforcement -- making sure that we have free and fair elections and upholding the law as it is written. I can't think of an occurrence in the past where the impartiality in the conduct of the election was ever questioned."" Brown and I were speaking about the conduct of the election itself, rather than any attempts to try to influence the outcome. He noted that the unusual nature of the 2016 election prompted a bit more unease. ""I think it's inevitable that when things are in flux, people don't quite know how to behave,"" he said. ""I think that when institutions start to stumble and what we know as common practice -- common rhetoric, common decency -- is in flux, there's all sorts of other things that change that we might not expect."" He noted the unusual nature of the presidential debates and the campaign broadly. ""What I think this cycle makes people worry about, myself included,"" he continued, ""is whether that institution -- which is the clear acceptance of electoral outcomes, the very safe and peaceful transfer of power from an outgoing administration to an incoming administration -- it feels as though that is much more in doubt this cycle. But that could be the feeling in the moment, the feeling of tension when things that we haven't seen in the past happen that ultimately won't dictate the outcome of the election, but might have other unrelated outcomes on the political culture."" Put another way, we're used to law enforcement playing a particular, often tangential role in politics both nationally and locally -- a role that may seem, seen through the lens of an unusual political year, to have shifted. Part of that is the candidate who's driving that change and receiving that support. As MSNBC's Chris Hayes put that concern on Twitter, ""History shows there's nothing dangerous about security forces and law enforcement falling in line behind authoritarian demagogues"" -- obviously referring to the rhetoric of Donald Trump. The broader context Brown offers is that unusual moments may feel more unusual in the moment than they turn out to be. But also that the norms of how we expect law enforcement to act may have shifted for good."
