It might be getting bigger. President Barack Obama is running out of time to fulfill his longstanding promise to shutter the prison at the U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Sixty inmates remain in the facility and only a third are cleared for release. If Obama can't close it, his successor likely won't. Donald Trump has not only pledged to keep Guantanamo open, in April he said that ""we're gonna load it up with some bad dudes, believe me. We're gonna load it up."" He told The Miami Herald in an interview that month that he would support trying U.S. citizens accused of terrorism at the base, though that would require Congress to change federal law and would likely face constitutional challenges. Opened in 2002 as a makeshift camp to hold men captured in the early fight against al-Qaida, Guantanamo has become a symbol of the strong-handed U.S. response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Its advocates say it keeps dangerous terrorists locked up. Opponents say it violates basic human rights, with prisoners held indefinitely without charges. Obama has said it feeds anti-U.S. sentiment worldwide and that the prisoners could be held for less money at facilities in the United States. Rights groups are determined to make one last push for Obama to close Guantanamo.  ""He knows what's at stake and he knows he can't leave the door to Guantanamo open for Donald Trump,"" said Naureen Shah, director of the security and human rights program at Amnesty International. It would take a bold and unlikely act of defiance, one that would face legal and political challenges, by Obama to shutter the prison before leaving office. The Obama administration has repatriated or resettled nearly 180 Guantanamo prisoners. But he can't close the detention center because Congress has blocked it, most crucially with a ban on transferring men to facilities in the United States. An interagency security review has cleared 20 of the 60 remaining prisoners for transfer. An administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information that has not yet been made public, said officials expect to complete a ""substantial number"" of those transfers before Obama leaves office on Jan. 20.  ""It is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us,"" Obama said at a news conference Monday. ""What is also true is we have greatly reduced the population. You now have significantly less than 100 people there. There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over next the two months."" Guantanamo had a peak of about 680 prisoners in July 2003 before dropping to nearly 240 when Obama took office in 2009. It still holds Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, who admitted to planning the Sept. 11 attacks. He faces trial by military tribunal with four other men, though proceedings have been bogged down largely due to issues related to treatment in CIA custody that is now widely viewed as torture. Few of the other prisoners could be charged for reasons that include a lack of evidence or because they could be tried only in a civilian court, which is prevented by the ban on transfers to the U.S. The attorneys general in Kansas, South Carolina and Colorado wrote Trump on Tuesday to reiterate their opposition to housing detainees on U.S. soil -- especially their three states, which that have been mentioned as possible transfer sites. Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican who opposes moving inmates, said last week that the Defense Department told him months ago that ""the Obama administration had neither the time nor the money to close Gitmo and move detainees to Fort Leavenworth,"" in Roberts' home state of Kansas. Guantanamo was not a major campaign issue and Trump has not discussed plans since winning the presidency last week. Robert Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, expects Trump to send some newly captured detainees, perhaps Islamic State fighters captured in Iraq or Syria, to Guantanamo.  ""We might end up with more detainees there,"" Chesney said, adding it probably wouldn't happen on a large scale. ""This isn't 2003, with relatively large numbers of terrorism suspects in places where we have a realistic opportunity to nab them."" Raha Wala, director of national security advocacy at Human Rights First, isn't giving up hope that Obama will close Guantanamo before leaving office.  ""He said he would do this, and we're going to make sure he does,"" Wala said. ___ Fox reported from Miami. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Within hours after the election was called, the ACLU unleashed feisty fundraising appeals, including one warning that if Trump implemented certain campaign promises, ""We'll see him in court."" The result, according to the ACLU, has been the largest surge of support in its 94-year history, including roughly 120,000 donations totaling more than $7.2 million.  ""We'll need to build up the most powerful legal organization mankind has ever known to fight for us over the next four years,"" wrote HIV/AIDS and gay-rights activist Peter Staley, who pledged on his Facebook page to become a monthly ACLU donor. The ACLU's executive director, Anthony Romero, said the infusion of new funds would help in addressing several urgent priorities, including resisting possible mass deportation efforts, protecting the civil rights of transgender Americans, and preventing ""stop-and-frisk"" police policies from being adopted nationwide. Among Trump's many promises is to halt federal funding for Planned Parenthood because of its role as the largest abortion provider in the U.S. Since the election, Planned Parenthood has reported an unprecedented outpouring of support, with more than 128,000 people making donations. The organization said at least 20,000 of the donations made reference to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who as a congressman and governor of Indiana has been an advocate of tough anti-abortion restrictions.  ""We will never back down, and we will never stop providing the care our patients need,"" said Planned Parenthood's president, Cecile Richards. Like the ACLU, the Sierra Club, a leading environmental organization, moved swiftly to feature Trump in its fundraising appeals. It depicted him as an ""outlier"" who denies the dangers of climate change and would dismantle environmental protection regulations. The Sierra Club said it had registered 9,000 new monthly donors since the election -- more than it had added from Jan. 1 until Election Day.  ""We don't feel helpless at all,"" said Debbie Sease, the organization's national campaigns director. Other organizations reporting major increases in support included the NAACP, the National Immigration Law Center, and major LGBT-rights organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign and Lambda Legal. Lambda Legal said it received support from more than 1,000 first-time donors in the four days following the election. The Anti-Defamation League, which combats anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, said donations surged 50-fold the day after the election, and some major donors made new, six-figure commitments. Spokesman Todd Gutnick said many of the donors urged the ADL to intensify efforts to combat online hate speech. Some advocacy groups on the conservative side of the political spectrum also reported a post-election boost in support. Californians for Population Stabilization, which seeks to curtail immigration, said online donations have increased fourfold since Trump's victory. The group's executive director, Jo Wideman, said in an email that supporters ""are very excited that someone finally gets the implications of over-immigration's effects on population growth."" The Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group which organized door-to-door canvassing on Trump's behalf, reported a similar response.  ""Our supporters are calling us to reserve tables at our annual fundraising gala,"" said spokeswoman Mallory Quigley. ""We've had a huge increase in the number of calls and emails simply expressing thanks and support."" Another beneficiary of the election results is ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit news organization that produces investigative public-interest journalism. Richard Tofel, ProPublica's president and founding general manager, said online donations increased sharply the day after the election, and then skyrocketed after John Oliver -- on Sunday's edition of his HBO show ""Last Week Tonight"" -- urged viewers to support ""actual journalism"" produced by ProPublica and other outlets. Tofel said it's too early to calculate the total amount of the new financial infusion, but he said more than $100,000 had been received since the election via credit-card holders donating online -- compared to $300,000 received in that fashion for the entire previous year.  ""There are a lot of people who, in response to the election, feel that they need to take some sort of civic action,"" Tofel said. ""One thing they can do is contribute to causes they think will advance their view of a healthy democracy."" ___ Follow David Crary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/CraryAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The FBI, CIA and National Security Agency have 60 days to comply with the order from Senior U.S. District Judge Berle M. Schiller. The order follows another right-to-know case that revealed the FBI was monitoring Occupy Wall Street activities in New York and spinoff efforts from Florida to Alaska. Civil rights lawyer Paul Hetznecker hopes to learn if the agencies surveilled demonstrators who encamped outside Philadelphia City Hall for seven weeks in 2011 to protest income inequality. The FBI has turned over seven redacted pages in response to his right-to-know lawsuit. The judge plans to review the unredacted FBI document and information from the CIA and NSA to determine if the material should be made public. Press investigations have shown that federal intelligence agencies have infiltrated Muslim groups, civil rights groups and other lawful organizations since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Hetznecker argued. A right-to-know request filed by the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund in 2012 led the FBI to disclose its efforts to monitor Occupy Wall Street activities. The documents released showed the FBI sharing information about Occupy's plans with banks, businesses and local police, even as it acknowledged the protesters' nonviolent mission.  ""The government should not be investigating its citizens simply because they've raised their voices in dissent, whether it's against government or corporate policy,"" Hetznecker said Tuesday. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia, which is defending the government, declined to comment on the pending case. The Philadelphia Inquirer first reported Tuesday on Schiller's order from late last week. The Occupy Wall Street movement began in New York and spread to cities across the country. The Philadelphia encampment outside City Hall ended when city officials evicted the group to begin a $50 million renovation of the public plaza in late November 2011. About 80 people arrested during the eviction and other key demonstrations were later acquitted, Hetznecker said. The city this year agreed to pay $200,000 to settle lawsuits filed by some of those arrested. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Police made at least four arrests and said one woman was slightly injured in the clashes, which took place far from Obama's meetings. The violence broke out as youths in motorcycle helmets and gas masks, armed with wooden clubs and petrol bombs, tried to break a police cordon in front of a barrier formed by police buses. Rioters pulled back to the Athens Polytechnic university complex, site of a 1973 student uprising, and engaged in running street fights with police, throwing dozens of petrol bombs. Left-wing and anarchist groups who organized the protest had planned to reach the U.S. embassy in Athens. But authorities banned demonstrations in a large swath of the city to ensure that protesters came nowhere near Obama, who was attending a dinner at the residence of Greek President Procopis Pavlopoulos. About 5,000 Communist party supporters took part in a separate, peaceful protest in central Athens and 1,000 people protested in Greece's second-largest city, Thessaloniki. Communist party leader Dimitris Koutsoumbas described Obama's visit as a provocation.  ""(The U.S.) is a state that causes military coups, interventions and imperialist wars from Ukraine to the eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East, North Africa, Asia and Latin America,"" he told supporters. Tuesday's violence placed Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' left-wing Syriza party in an uncomfortable position: Formerly a key participant in anti-American and anti-austerity protests, it is now using the same crowd control measures it used to strongly deplore. There's a strong anti-American tradition among Greek left-wingers, who still resent U.S. support for Greece's 1967-74 military dictatorship. Obama's visit comes just two days before the country's main annual anti-American demonstrations, which commemorate the bloody suppression, by military authorities, of the Polytechnic pro-democracy uprising. The small Popular Unity party, which took part in the main protest Tuesday, described Obama's visit as ""a provocation"" due to that timing. Party leader Panayiotis Lafazanis also blamed the U.S. for Greece's economic woes. The debt-crippled country depends on international bailout loans, and has been forced by creditors to implement deep income cuts, tax hikes, welfare cuts and economic reforms.  ""American imperialism has not changed,"" Lafazanis said Tuesday. ""The U.S. presidents and administrations have played -- and still play -- a leading part in the bailout-linked plundering of our country ... and their interventions are drowning our part of the world in blood and creating refugee waves."" The last visit to Greece by a U.S. president was by Bill Clinton in 1999, which was also marred by clashes between anarchists and riot police. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

It is only with effort that the leaders of Europe have managed to compose themselves after the U.S. election, torn between pure shock over the result and the necessity of preserving what can be preserved of the West and the Atlantic relationship. If you listen to what Donald Trump has been saying during and before his campaign, this is the end of the West as we know it. For more than half a century, this story of phenomenal success has been built on a commitment to freedom and democracy, free trade, solid alliances and reliable friendships. But all of this has been either attacked or questioned by Trump. And no part of the success of the West has been more important than the success of Europe under the protection of and in a strong relationship with the United States.      Nigel Farage, the longtime leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, arrived at Trump Tower on Nov. 12. (The Washington Post)   We should not forget that this has been profoundly in the interest of the United States as well. Twice in the past century it was dragged into wars as Europe plunged into acrimony and conflict. A peaceful, free and prosperous Europe has been a key strategic U.S. interest.   There has been a recognition that this aim is best furthered by the process of European integration centered on the European Union. A Europe that starts fracturing will be a less stable and, in the longer perspective, also a more dangerous Europe.  When Trump receives the jubilant British anti-Europe campaigner Nigel Farage before seeing other foreign politicians, he is sending the worst possible signal to Europe. By design or by default, he transmits a signal of support to those dark forces in various countries trying to undo what generations of U.S. and European statesmen have worked to achieve.  But the list of European concerns certainly doesn't end there. It also includes his talk of abrogating the Paris global climate agreement, undermining the Iran deal, questioning important free-trade agreements -- signature achievements and goals of the past few years that are suddenly up in the air. That there is deep apprehension around the capitals of Europe is hardly surprising.  Now the raw populism of the campaign will have to be turned into U.S. policy, and E.U. leaders will naturally be keen to see if this process will moderate some or all of these campaign promises. Appointments will be very closely watched. And then there must be direct talks.  In April 2009, a newly elected President Obama came to a NATO summit in Strasbourg, France, and a special E.U.-U.S. summit in Prague before proceeding to an important speech in Ankara, Turkey. It was a jubilant new start for transtlantic links.         1 of 10       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what president-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        Now there will be a new start of a very different sort. European Council President Donald Tusk has invited Trump to a special E.U.-U.S. summit; there is the G20 meeting in Germany in late spring, and an extra NATO summit looks to be necessary as well. But it is very much an open question whether the air will have cleared sufficiently on the core issues of concern before such a meeting..  Security issues are bound to loom large. While Trump seems to have a benevolent view of Russia, he simultaneously is a hawk on defense spending in Europe.  Defense spending is on the increase in key parts of Europe, with most countries in the north and east having reached or aiming at 2 percent of gross domestic product. But it is how these sums are actually spent that matters, and it is here that both NATO and the European Union must do better.  And when it is often said that the United States accounts for 70 percent of the defense spending of the NATO countries, we should not forget that U.S. spending is global, with the explicit aim to have 60 percent of its air and naval forces in the Asia-Pacific region.  According to Vladimir Putin, there is now an agreement with the president-elect to start ""active joint efforts"" to normalize relations with Russia. Well, Europe certainly has nothing against good relations with Russia, but they have to be based on rolling back aggression against Ukraine, ceasing silent cyber-operations and respecting the rules agreed upon between nations.  If the United States starts to waver on these issues and caves in on them to the Kremlin, it will undoubtedly encourage a process of destabilization that is most unlikely to be limited to Europe. There might well be other powers that would be tempted by the American president suddenly tolerating smash-and-grab raids of the sort Putin has been doing. There seems to be more geoeconomics than geopolitics in Trump's thinking. It's a question of making good business deals. If so, he should see the imperative of trade deals on the free-trade terms of the West, rather than allow a world dominated by the rules-free mercantilist approach of a China that will always give priority to its own gains. A transtlantic agreement would be of the utmost importance in this respect.  Henry Kissinger noted shortly before the election that ""for the first time since the end of the Second World War, the future relationship of America to the world is not fully settled.""

""I believe that she will win,"" the crowd chanted as Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, shook hands on an airport tarmac in bitter cold. Clinton did, too -- as her relaxed, confident posture throughout her final day on the trail Monday had revealed. She grinned as she and President Obama clasped hands. She smiled softly as her husband slung his arm around her on the campaign plane, before the champagne was popped. She danced and clapped as Bruce Springsteen sang at one rally and Lady Gaga at another. Yet for all the trappings of a winning campaign in view that day, atop all the polling and predictions favoring Clinton, there were signs of trouble in those final hours. She campaigned in Pennsylvania twice on that last day, adding a morning rally in Pittsburgh to a long-planned evening showstopper in Philadelphia alongside Obama and first lady Michelle Obama.      In a crucial Democratic stronghold, Trump surged. Clinton didn';t. View Graphic     In a crucial Democratic stronghold, Trump surged. Clinton didn';t.  That was a testament to the crucial importance of Pennsylvania, the biggest prize among the states in the Northeast and industrial Midwest where Republican Donald Trump had drawn closer in the polls as Election Day approached. She ended up losing Pennsylvania and both of the other states she visited on the final day -- Michigan and North Carolina. All were states where she had held seemingly durable leads two or three weeks before. The campaign appeared confident headed into the last week, despite the shifting ground; the last day's schedule was designed with feel-good events to juice up turnout. Although that rally at Independence Mall in Philadelphia was originally intended to close out the evening, the campaign at the last minute added a midnight rally in Raleigh, N.C. And Clinton found herself being asked by aides to do quickie radio interviews with black radio shows such as the ""Rise and Grind Morning Show"" on WUSL in Philadelphia, with hosts Mina Saywhat, Mikey Dredd and Muthaknows. At the outdoor get-out-the-vote rally in Pittsburgh on that sparkling fall afternoon, Clinton framed the election as a referendum on the future and the character of America. Much of the contest had been about the character of Clinton and her opponent. Clinton's attacks on Trump as unfit for the presidency, usually made by turning his own words against him, had largely supplanted regular acknowledgment of the economic and political anxieties that many Americans were feeling. That was true on the eve of the election, too. The campaign knew that voters were turning away in disgust. But her attempt to reframe a relentlessly negative contest in optimistic terms was still, ultimately, about Trump -- and it fell short.     How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea View Graphic     How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea  ""Our core values are being tested in this election, and I know that people are frustrated. A lot of people feel left out and left behind. There's fear, even anger in our country,"" she said. From the back of the crowd then came a shouted protest that sounded like ""Vote Trump!"" Clinton kept talking. ""But I've gotta say, anger is not a plan, my friends."" Next up was Grand Rapids, Mich., a majority-white city where the target audience was largely moderate women. Obama was dispatched on an emergency mission to rally young people in Ann Arbor, Mich. Clinton aides originally hoped to send Obama to Detroit to rally black voters, but they decided against it for fear of disrupting a police funeral that day. Clinton had spent little time in Michigan until the final week, when Trump had nearly tied her there. And the rescue mission came too late. In the end, although Clinton won Detroit's Wayne County in a landslide, she underperformed Obama there by 78,000 votes -- vastly more than her statewide losing margin of roughly 11,000. ""We are already great, but we can be greater, and we will be greater,"" Clinton said in Grand Rapids.  ""I love our country. I believe in the American people, and I know there is nothing we cannot do when we make up our minds,"" she said.  Trump was also in Grand Rapids on his final campaign day, reflecting the momentum he claimed -- rightly -- was swinging his way in states that had voted for Democrats for president for a generation. ""We're hours away from a once-in-a-lifetime change,"" Trump said then. The emotional heart of Clinton's last day was a stunning tableau of Americana laid out before Independence Hall in Philadelphia on a crisp, clear evening. A giddy crowd of 33,000 sang along as Springsteen opened with ""Thunder Road.""  He also played ""Long Walk Home,"" an elegy for hollowed-out small-town America, the kinds of places that always used to vote Democratic. Obama and Michelle Obama, whom the Clinton campaign considered their best weapon against Trump among women and young black voters, both delivered rousing tributes to Clinton. Bill Clinton kept his fond remarks short. It was clearly designed as the capstone to the long campaign, a celebration meant to urge Pennsylvania voters out to the polls the next morning with a smile.  So it was somewhat jarring when the campaign added a hastily arranged midnight rally in Raleigh to the schedule. The slapdash affair in a gymnasium at North Carolina State University was a happy occasion. Lady Gaga's acoustic performance was luminous, Clinton shimmied on stage and the screaming crowd was ecstatic. Trouble might have been in the air, though. Clinton badly needed black voters in North Carolina, and the crowd was overwhelmingly white. When Chelsea Clinton asked how many had already voted early, nearly everyone enthusiastically raised a hand -- meaning few in the crowd were left to energize. The event itself was held too late -- it was after 1 a.m. when Clinton spoke -- to get much media attention. ""I just can't wait to raise both my hands with all of you in a few hours,"" Chelsea Clinton said, grinning. It had been her job during the campaign to speak before college audiences on her mother's behalf. ""I think I'm the most excited person in my family, but my dad may be just as excited,"" she said. ""I am fiercely, fiercely, fiercely proud to be my mother's daughter, and I'm also really proud to be my father's daughter."" Her parents beamed. Finally, on the last flight aboard her blue and white ""Stronger Together"" campaign plane from Raleigh home to the small airport here near her home in Chappaqua, Clinton mingled and laughed with staffers in full view of reporters.  As reporters called out to Bill Clinton, urging him to come to the separate press cabin to talk, he jokingly cupped a hand to his ear, pretending not to hear. Hillary Clinton smiled happily and leaned into his shoulder. They were having a lovely time, at ease in the expectation that while the election would be close, she would win. Champagne was poured for all, to celebrate the final flight and the end of the campaign. On the spur of the moment, Clinton, her husband and a group of staffers filmed a ""mannequin challenge"" video on board. The videos of people in still-life poses are an Internet sensation, and Clinton gamely joined in alongside rock singer Jon Bon Jovi, who had hitched a ride on the plane after performing in Raleigh. ""Don't stand still. Go vote today,"" the campaign video urged. For Clinton, not enough people did.  "

Heading into Election Day, most national surveys overstated what will likely be a narrow popular vote advantage for Hillary Clinton and led many to believe she was a shoo-in to win the Electoral College.  ""The polls clearly got it wrong this time,"" the American Association for Public Opinion Research said Wednesday in a statement. The association traditionally assesses the state of public polling after each election cycle, and already has a committee in place to do so again this year.  ""I think it was an important polling miss. It would really be glossing over it to say that it was a typical year,"" said Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center. For now, it's impossible to know for certain what exactly went wrong for pollsters this year -- and, as votes are still being counted, exactly how far off they were. Some factors pollsters will examine: ___ HOW BIG A MISS? Although most polls throughout the 2016 campaign showed Clinton running ahead of Trump, in the final two weeks of the campaign her advantage narrowed in many national surveys, as well as in states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. Her apparent lead fell within many surveys' margins of sampling error. Kennedy said pollsters may ultimately not have had a historically large miss on the national popular vote, but thinks there was a systematic overrepresentation of Clinton's support and underrepresentation for Trump's. She says people sometimes expect too much of election polls, which ""are not designed to provide extremely accurate results."" Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, says that averages of publicly available polls sometimes give a false sense of certainty in a candidate's lead.  ""You're taking imprecise estimates and throwing them all together with the hope of eliminating error,"" he says.         1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump is doing on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

Trump's campaign frequently pointed to the possibility that public polls were missing some of his base of support, and some pollsters say that might have played a role in the polling miss.  ""One of the biggest problems that polls face nowadays is that people don't want to participate in them at all,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. He plans to use voter data to find out if certain types of people were less likely to participate in his surveys. At Pew, Kennedy said it appears that there was a segment of Trump's support base that was not responding to polls, which she called ""fundamentally a difficult challenge to fight."" But, she said, it's unlikely voters were lying about their support. ___ TURNOUT Harold Clarke, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas who regularly conducts polling, said one of the shortfalls in the presidential prediction was a problem that has plagued survey science for decades.  ""We've got to filter our surveys as we try to pick out those people that are really going to vote,"" he said. ""We all have the problem of not getting likely voters right."" Murray said pollsters are using likely voter models that might have worked in the past, but may no longer. He suggested that public pollsters should take a lesson from campaigns and consider putting out a range of numbers reflecting different turnout scenarios instead of a single number that suggests too much certainty in where the horse race stands. ___ TIGHTENING RACE Republican pollster Whit Ayres suggests that many observers -- himself included -- assumed that since Trump had never held a lead, he wouldn't get the benefit of the doubt from voters in the end. But he says that in races where an incumbent is stuck below 50 percent in the polls, late deciders often break toward the challenger.  ""There were a number of us who should have raised that possibility before the election,"" Ayres said. ""If you think about it, Hillary Clinton is about as close as you can get to an incumbent."" Nationally and in key states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Trump prevailed among voters who said they decided which candidate to support in the last week before voting, according to exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. In retrospect, Republican pollster Ed Goeas says that he saw a sign he now believes was a clue of Trump's advantage. In his national polling, he saw an 8 percentage point edge for Trump in voter intensity and enthusiasm among his supporters.  ""But the assumption on our part was that Clinton's ground game would overcome or neutralize that intensity,"" Goeas said. ""It just didn't."" ___ NOT ENOUGH POLLS? In several key states, including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, there were few polls conducted in the final week before the election.  ""In some of those unexpected states in the Rust Belt -- Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin -- you didn't see some of the more rigorous polls being conducted,"" said Kennedy. Goeas confesses to failing to see some late movements, in part because his polling ended four days before the election.  ""So basically we were looking at numbers thinking where he might end up,"" Goeas said of Trump's chances in Wisconsin, where he believed the Republican would benefit from Republican Sen. Ron Johnson's get-out-the-vote operation. ""Did we have any comfort he would do it? No.""  ""It would have been nice to have a couple more Michigan and Wisconsin polls to adjust that perception"" that Clinton was leading, Miringoff said. ""The campaigns don't stop because the pollsters do their final poll."" ___ Associated Press writer Matt Sedensky contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

With Donald Trump rousing opposition in many suburban and ethnically diverse districts, Democrats were hoping to gain a dozen seats or more. Chief targets included GOP incumbents in Virginia, New Jersey, Illinois, Florida, Nevada and California. But both sides anticipated that Democrats would fall short of the 30-seat pickup they'd need to take command of the House for the first time in six years. Democrats have gained that many seats in just five of the 35 elections since World War II, including only once -- in 2006 -- since the 1970s. One prized pelt would be eight-term Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who dogged President Barack Obama with probes into the 2012 killings of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, and IRS mistreatment of conservative groups. Another would be Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J., from New York City's suburbs, under fire for reports he'd objected to contributing money for gay GOP congressional candidates. Some Republicans are preparing ""to do everything they can to stop progress in Washington,"" Obama said in one late radio ad. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was touting his ""Better Way"" agenda on revamping the tax code and welfare programs and dismantling Obama's health care law for next year. In a final fundraising email, he called it ""our responsibility as conservatives"" to maintain GOP House control. Trump's impact on House races seemed spotty and in some districts was counter-balanced by GOP antipathy to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival for president. Republicans were aiming for Democratic-held seats north of Miami and in northern Minnesota and Omaha, Nebraska, and were strongly defending others that once seemed vulnerable in New York, Iowa and Wisconsin. The GOP's current 247-188 margin, which includes three vacancies, is a high-water mark for House Republicans since the 270 members they had in 1931. Only several dozen of the chamber's seats were considered competitive. Both parties' candidates and outside groups spent nearly $1.1 billion combined on House campaigns, shy of the $1.2 billion record in 2012, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. Republicans had only a slight financial edge. Since Ryan ascended to the top House job last fall, the chamber has approved measures addressing anti-drug programs, customs law enforcement, financial relief for Puerto Rico and the Zika virus. But even with the GOP's formidable advantage, work has stalled on spending bills after hitting objections from conservatives, including the roughly 40 members of the hard-right Freedom Caucus. With moderate GOP lawmakers likely among Tuesday's election losers, dissident Republicans' leverage will likely grow next year. That suggests tougher problems ahead for GOP leaders, with conservative objections likely over a fresh round of budget legislation plus the need to renew the government's borrowing authority or face an economy-jarring federal default. A thinner Republican majority could also strengthen conservatives demanding the impeachment of a newly elected President Clinton. Ryan has yet to address that issue directly. Even Ryan, who's said he wants to be speaker in the new Congress, is not immune to ire from the Freedom Caucus and other Republicans upset over his refusal to campaign for Trump. If the GOP margin is whittled significantly, just a handful of disgruntled conservatives could block Ryan from the 218 votes he'd need to retain his post. That could be an embarrassing setback for the GOP's 2012 vice presidential candidate, who may harbor future White House aspirations, and some Republicans say it might persuade the 46-year-old Ryan to leave Congress. The year began with Democrats rubbing their hands over the prospects that Trump atop the GOP ticket would produce widespread losses for House Republicans. But many Republicans distanced themselves from Trump and stressed their own issues, with some GOP ads explicitly disavowing him. Other spots linked Democratic hopefuls to Clinton or House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
