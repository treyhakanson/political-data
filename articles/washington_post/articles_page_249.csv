John Conyers (all times local): 1:15 p.m. Longtime U.S. Rep. John Conyers says his family has notified the FBI and is ""very worried"" about the disappearance of his 21-year-old son in Texas. The Detroit Democrat told The Detroit News (http://detne.ws/2fZEGIo ) on Thursday that his son, Carl Conyers, is ""a very stable young guy"" and that it's not like him to disappear. The University of Houston student was last seen Tuesday by his roommate. Houston police spokesman Kese Smith says the department is working with the FBI and Secret Service to find the missing student. Smith says the Secret Service is involved because Carl Conyers is the son of a congressman. John Conyers was first elected to Congress in 1964 and is its longest-serving member. ___ 12:45 p.m. Police in Houston say they're searching for the son of longtime U.S. Rep. John Conyers after he was reported missing this week. Twenty-one-year-old Carl Conyers, a student at the University of Houston, was last seen Tuesday by his roommate. His girlfriend, Daisha Lewis, told WWJ Newsradio 950 in Detroit that she was supposed to meet him on campus Wednesday, but that he never showed. When she and friends checked his apartment they found some clothes and other items missing. Houston police spokesman Victor Senties declined Thursday to say who reported Conyers missing, adding that police take every report of a missing person seriously. Rep. Conyers' communications director didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The Detroit Democrat was first elected to Congress in 1964 and is its longest-serving member.

The civilians were killed and 35 others were wounded when militants fired mortar rounds on government-controlled areas of eastern Mosul, said army medic Bashir Jabar, who is in charge of a field clinic run by the special forces. A soldier was killed and three were wounded when a car packed with explosives sped out from its hiding spot in a school complex in the eastern Tahrir neighborhood, ramming Iraqi troops' position and exploding into a ball of fire, according to two officers who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters. Another soldier was shot and killed by a sniper in the Bakir neighborhood. Clouds over Iraq's second-largest city obscured the visibility of drones and warplanes. The troops used the pause to secure areas they had seized, set up checkpoints and sweep for explosives, said Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil. The U.S. coalition providing air cover and reconnaissance for the advancing forces has been a key element in the month-old Mosul offensive, and fighting stalls when the air power cannot be used. Thursday's attacks came as civilians were fleeing or venturing into the streets to ask for food from troops and aid agencies, Jabar said. Two children were among the civilians killed, he said. A donkey-drawn cart carried the body of an 18-year-old boy, wrapped in a white plastic bag. Mohammed Ismael said his nephew was in the street to get kerosene when a mortar shell landed nearby, fatally wounding him. Residents of the nearby Samah neighborhood lined up for food and other aid from an Iraqi Red Crescent truck as special forces protected them and helped organize the distribution. Families had to show their official papers to receive aid.  ""I'm happy today because I got what I need,"" said Sabah Hassan, a 36-year-old father of four. ""Every day, I approach the army like a beggar to get bread and small bottles of water,"" Hassan said, adding that he had run out of supplies.  ""I don't know what we'll see in the coming days,"" he said. Since the long-awaited Mosul operation began Oct. 17, troops have only advanced into a few eastern districts. They have faced fierce resistance, with snipers, mortar fire and suicide bombers driving armor-plated vehicles packed with explosives. After swift initial advances into the outskirts, the offensive has slowed in more densely populated areas, where Iraqi troops cannot rely as much on airstrikes and shelling because of the risk to civilians, who have been told to stay in their homes. Mosul is the last major holdout for the militants in Iraq. Driving them out would deal a severe blow to the Islamic State's self-styled caliphate stretching into Syria. On the sidelines of a climate conference in Morocco, Iraqi officials said they are confident of victory. Iraqi President Fuad Masum told The Associated Press that IS will be ""wiped out"" in Mosul, but didn't say exactly when that would happen.  ""Specifying a timeline is difficult because there are always surprises in wars,"" he said.  ""I think that even if it takes another month or two, in the end, ISIS will be wiped out militarily,"" he added, using another acronym for the Islamic State group. Later Thursday, officials said a suicide car bomber struck a wedding near the western city of Fallujah, killing at last five people and wounding dozens. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to speak to the press. No one claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, but it bore the hallmarks of IS, which is trying to destabilize the government as it defends Mosul. It was the second incident in a week in Fallujah, with twin suicide bombers targeting security checkpoints on Monday, killing six people. Fallujah was the first Iraqi city to fall to IS, in January 2014. Iraqi forces declared it ""fully liberated"" in late June of this year, after more than a month of heavy fighting. ___ Associated Press writers Brian Rohan in Baghdad and Jeff Schaeffer in Marrakech, Morocco contributed.

The Associated Press has identified the man, Michael Karkoc, as a World War II commander of a unit in the SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion, which is accused of burning villages in Poland. The accusations are based on wartime documents, testimony from other members of the unit and Karkoc's own Ukrainian-language memoir. Following the AP story, Poland opened an investigation into the 97-year-old Karkoc, who denies that he fought in the war. Confirming his identity is key to an extradition being sought. Prosecutor Dariusz Antoniak said Thursday experts will confirm whether Karkoc is the same person as the Nazi commander by comparing facial features in photos of Karkoc with those in a 1940 photo of the commander, taken in Ukraine. A right-wing lawmaker wants to hasten the investigation, arguing that time is running out, considering Karkoc's age. Tomasz Rzymkowski, a lawyer with the Kukiz'15 party, is writing to the Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak this week to ask about the findings from the investigation. German prosecutors shelved their investigation of Karkoc in 2015, saying he's not fit for trial. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I showed it to my colleague and editor Glenn Kessler. He was surprised; people don't really call him that. Over the next 18 months or so, ""b----"" became one of the more pedestrian names I was called for doing my job. Facing intense criticism is just a part of being a fact-checker. Politics is personal, which means fact checks are, too, especially when our ratings or analyses challenge people's core political beliefs. Some of our loudest critics are our most dedicated readers, who hold us to a high standard and make sure we know when they think we failed to deliver. They send lengthy emails, laden with bullet points and citations, to explain why they disagreed with our rating or analysis. I expected the volume of criticism to swell throughout the campaign, and it did. But what surprised me was just how fiercely racist and sexist the comments became. The messages that landed in my inbox, Twitter mentions and even my newsroom mailbox became more vitriolic as November approached. Increasingly, it wasn't what I wrote that angered these readers; it was that I wrote it while being me. It felt like they read my byline, saw my photo, barely skimmed what I wrote, and decided I was incompetent because I'm a 28-year-old Asian woman. An email calling me the c-word was the first thing I read when I woke up one morning. One night after dinner, my phone buzzed with a Twitter mention from someone wishing I were sent to an internment camp (I'm not Japanese). Many emails began with, ""Ni hao"" (I'm not Chinese). I even learned a new slur word that I had to look up in the Urban Dictionary -- but will refrain from sharing here. ""Who knew that 'happy endings' at the local DC Chinese owned massage parlor could earn you a press pass and journalistic credential? ... Perhaps you are better suited for rolling egg rolls and making wonton soup. Get off your knees and go back to the kitchen."" ""So young and already such a great liar. Also stop with cheek injections. Ridiculous."" ""Michelle, the sex workers in Times Square have more integrity about their prostitution than you have about yours. You can prostitute yourself by letting people use your genius, just as you can prostitute yourself by letting them use your genitals."" ""Beautiful girl whose soul is blacker than Wesley Snipes' skin."" At first, I didn't respond to any of them. But when I started getting so many so often, I couldn't ignore them anymore. So I started asking questions. To the reader who wrote me and Glenn to say that ""the Asian c---"" was ""worse"" between the two of us, I asked: Is it my being Asian or being a woman that makes me, in your view, worse than white or male? I received no response. To the reader who made a snide Facebook comment about my being an Asian woman, I replied: What does my being Asian or a woman have to do with the quality of my work as a journalist? I received no response. In fact, most people didn't respond when I wrote them back. The few who did reply either doubled down on the insult or apologized, saying they were too emotional when they wrote me. I didn't travel on the campaign trail this election. I wasn't blacklisted. No one booed or yelled at me. But I was berated almost daily for doing my job, and so were many other reporters on and off the trail. I understand people feeling frustrated with the media. What I can't relate to is what, exactly, compels some people to describe in detail how I'm prostituting myself or how I will be raped by an illegal Mexican immigrant. (Many of the comments were in response to my fact checks of Donald Trump, but not all.) I hope such comments were a product of heightened emotions as Election Day approached -- not the new normal. And I have a good reason to be hopeful: The vast majority of Fact Checker readers I've communicated with are opinionated, thoughtful, respectful, brutally honest and passionate about the truth. I have hope, because of readers like one I emailed with recently, who wrote me a valid point-by-point critique that ended with this: ""I would like to thank you for writing me back. I am sorry that I wrote 'Do Better' in the subject line. I was hoping that someone would read it and did not figure it would actually go to you. I am now engaged in the sort of harsh discourse that I deplore. ... The fact that you wrote me back is awesome. I am honored. And it shows me that you do care about your journalism. For what it is worth, I think you have one of the most important jobs in the world. I mean that. If you doggedly truth checked stories, you could single-handedly impact our polity.""

But you’d barely know it.	"  BEIJING -- All around Liu Huizhen's makeshift house, clusters of men lurked and smoked on a recent day, suspiciously eyeing passersby. Dozens of uniformed police waited in reserve, ready in case of trouble, while a thuggish man stood in the middle of the road with arms defiantly folded, preventing cars from passing. Liu, a 45-year-old farmer's wife, appears to have the Communist Party worried, here in the village of Gaodiansan on the outskirts of Beijing.  She wants to exercise her constitutional right to stand in local elections due to be held in the capital on Nov. 15, and about a dozen supporters had arrived to help her begin her campaign. They were to be blocked by a decisive show of force. ""Some people think I am a troublemaker,"" she said. ""They think this is the government's decision and I won't win in the end. But I am not afraid. I have the right to participate in this election. I didn't do anything illegal."" Between August and December, China is holding staggered local elections across the country -- an exercise in ""grass-roots democracy"" on a daunting scale. The Communist Party says ""all power in China belongs to the people,"" and this is the people's every-five-year chance to express their wishes through the ballot box.  Yet reading China's closely controlled state media, you would barely know the elections were happening, with news confined to brief announcements of voting days in different counties and assurances that officials are ready. It is as far removed as one can imagine from the hoopla of the U.S. presidential race. ""Voters aren't enthusiastic, and it would be useless for state media to publicize it,"" said Fang Ning, an expert on political reforms at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.  About 2.5 million seats are up for grabs at the district, county and village levels for seats in local ""People's Congresses."" Almost all the candidates will be Communist Party members, but a few people have put forward their names to stand as independents.  Anyone without a criminal record is theoretically allowed to stand at the local level. In practice, independent candidates face police harassment and intimidation. Most will simply be blocked from running.  The Communist Party says the People's Congress system stands at the heart of the ""people's democratic dictatorship."" Liu and hundreds of other people are experiencing the hard way what that really means. On this day, she was kept under house arrest for most of the morning, allowed out briefly to meet her friends before being sent home again. The previous day, she slipped away from the two men who have been tailing her to meet reporters from The Washington Post.  The roots of her candidacy, she explained, lay in the bulldozing of her house in 2014 to make way for a commercial real estate development, and the eight months she subsequently spent in jail for protesting. ""I suffered a lot when I was protesting because I did not understand the law,"" she said. ""But now I learned some basic laws, and I want to help other people not to make the same mistakes I made."" Liu is one of 58 independent candidates in Beijing who have joined together to declare their intentions publicly. Most are what are known in China as ""petitioners,"" people who have suffered injustice at the hands of the state and spend much of their lives seeking redress.  ""When there are problems, you can't find your local representative -- they keep their office address and phone number secret,"" said organizer Ye Jinghuan, 64. ""So we want to become representatives ourselves. We want to do good things for citizens. For example, we want to solve traffic problems in Beijing."" They want to join the lowest, most local People's Congress. But even at this level of representation, the party clearly senses a threat: Interviews with a half-dozen candidates revealed that none had been allowed to organize meetings or to campaign.  Many had been barred even from collecting their nomination papers, and very few, if any, expect to meet the official selection committee's approval to get their names on the official list of candidates. Four were driven by police to the eastern city of Hangzhou so they could not file their papers. Another, a 72-year-old woman, said she was constantly followed by two men even while walking her dog. The vast majority of voters will not even have heard of them. Li Fan, the founder of the World and China Institute, a private think tank, says more established and politically connected independent candidates can sometimes get party approval to run.  ""Local government does not crack down on every independent candidate who has expressed interest,"" he said. ""But if you campaign with a high profile, with people voicing loud support for you online or on the street, then you cannot be elected, no matter what."" The idea of inviting candidates from outside the party to participate in local elections sprang up in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, the traumatic decade of violent mob rule unleashed by Mao Zedong. Chinese society had been ravaged, and there was a sense the country needed an injection of democracy, Hu Ping, who won a seat in 1980 as a graduate student at Peking University but now lives in New York, told the China Change website.   But the idea of democracy was beguiling, and it spread far and wide during the 1980s -- only to be violently crushed in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.  There were small glimmers of democratic life in the early 2000s: A young university lecturer named Xu Zhiyong was elected in 2001 and 2006 in Beijing's Haidian district, for example. In 2011, hundreds of independent candidates emerged from all walks of life, many using the exciting new tool of social media to advertise themselves.  Yet the glimmers were soon extinguished. Xu and most of the Internet-savvy candidates were simply banned from running in 2011. Three years later, Xu was sentenced to four years in jail for starting the grass-roots New Citizens Movement. In the northeastern city of Tianjin, factory worker Wang Zhongxiang has been trying to get on the ballot for a decade. But his social-media accounts were closed down by the authorities when he started to campaign in 2011. This year he was barred even from collecting his nomination papers and detained for trying to leave his house. ""They are waiting for me downstairs,"" he said by telephone, ""and I can't go outside."" Wang's aging parents are worried about him, but he insists they should be proud: He is, he claims, the only independent candidate in a city of 15 million people.

As you know, the United States is choosing a president along with members of Congress, and state and local officials. The presidential election is special not only because it determines the most powerful position in government but also because the process is different. And you might be surprised to learn that the person with the most votes isn't always the winner. College rules When voters choose a senator or a school board member, election officials count the votes and declare a winner -- usually within a day or so. That's called a popular vote. But when voters pick a president and vice president (they run together on what's called a ""ticket""), they do it through a process called the electoral college. The college is a group of 538 ""electors."" Each state has the same number of electors as they have members of Congress. So states with a lot of people have more (California has 55), while states with smaller populations have fewer (Maryland has 10). Before Election Day, each state's political parties pick potential electors who will support their candidate. When the voting ends, the ballots are tallied and the candidate who has the most votes in that state typically wins all the spots for electors. In Maine and Nebraska, however, they can give electoral spots to more than one party. Those electors then gather in December and send an official vote to Congress. (Electors have surprised their political party by voting for a different candidate, but that is rare.) In early January, Congress counts electoral votes from all the states and the District of Columbia. The candidate who has at least 270 electoral votes wins the election. So even though we may know who the next president will be by Wednesday, it won't be official for about two months. You might wonder why the Founding Fathers came up with the electoral college. It makes candidates care about voters in states with fewer people. Not many candidates would visit those states if they could win an election by focusing on a few states with a lot of voters. Close calls In four elections, the winner was not the candidate who won the popular vote. Most recently, in 2000, Democrat Al Gore received about 540,000 more votes than Republican George W. Bush. But the election hinged on the electoral votes from Florida, where the race was so close that the ballots had to be tallied twice. The results pointed to Bush as the winner. But when officials discovered problems with some machines counting the ballots, Gore wanted parts of Florida to count them a third time. The U.S. Supreme Court decided that wasn't fair and there would be no more counting. On December 13, Gore finally conceded that Bush had won -- more than a month after the election. And in 1824, the candidate who won the electoral vote didn't become president. Andrew Jackson won 99 electoral votes, and John Quincy Adams finished second with 84. But Jackson had only about 38 percent -- not a majority -- so the House of Representatives had to decide the race. Adams formed a political alliance with Speaker of the House Henry Clay, who had also been a presidential candidate that year. With Clay's help, Adams won. He then named Clay his secretary of state. Jackson and his supporters cried foul, calling the deal a ""corrupt bargain."" Many Americans agreed. They chose Jackson over Adams in the next election and liked him enough four years later to give him a second term.  Who can vote? Voting is an important part of a democracy, but it wasn't something the Founding Fathers included in the Constitution. They couldn't decide, so they left the matter to the states. That became confusing. Over the years, amendments to the Constitution and laws passed by Congress have addressed the issue. Here are several important years in voting-rights history:    1789: Mostly white men 21 and older who own property elect George Washington as the first president.  1870: The 15th Amendment is adopted. It says no state can stop a citizen from voting based on race or color or the fact that the person was once a slave. Many people, such as Native Americans and some immigrants, however, are not eligible to become citizens. And some states require that voters be able to read or understand the Constitution.  1920: The 19th Amendment gives women the right to vote.   1924: The Indian Citizenship Act declares that all noncitizen Native Americans born in the United States are citizens with the right to vote.  1964: The 24th Amendment says that people can't be prevented from voting because they can't pay a poll tax, or fee.  1965: The Voting Rights Act becomes law. It prohibits any election practice that denies the right to vote to citizens on the basis of race.  1971: The 26th Amendment lowers the voting age to 18 -- the same age at which men at the time were being drafted to fight in the Vietnam War.

The AP cited detailed ledgers from Melania Trump's modeling agency as well as a contract she signed with the firm, concluding that she was paid more than $20,000 for the work over seven weeks. The finding contradicts repeated statements from both Melania and Donald Trump, who have insisted that she scrupulously followed U.S. immigration law when she came to the United States as a striving model. It also creates a potential political embarrassment for the Republican nominee, who has based much of his campaign on a vow to crack down on illegal immigration -- including deporting people who have violated the terms of their immigration status. The Trump campaign has said that Melania Trump came to the United States in 1996 and then met and began dating Donald Trump in 1998. In 2001, she received a green card that allowed permanent residency, the campaign has said, and became a U.S. citizen in 2006, the year after she and Trump were married.     Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, was accused of copying a phrase from Marla Maples, Trump's second wife, during a speech on Nov. 3 in Berwyn, Pa. (The Washington Post)   ""I am pleased to enclose a letter from my immigration attorney which states that, with 100% certainty, I correctly went through the legal process when arriving in the USA,"" Melania Trump tweeted in September, when she released a lawyer's letter outlining the history. The campaign provided no documentation of the narrative at the time.  [Melania Trump shares more immigration information but no documentation]  The new information involves Melania Trump's activities in her first weeks after arriving in the United States. The Trump campaign has indicated that she arrived on Aug. 27, 1996, holding a B1/B2 visitor's visa. She then received a work permit on Oct. 18, 1996. It is illegal to perform work for money while holding a visitor's visa. However, the AP located records showing that she was paid for multiple jobs during the weeks that she held the visitor's permit, including for Fitness magazine and the Bergdorf Goodman department store. During that time, she also signed what appeared to be a standard management agreement with her agency, Metropolitan International Management, that appeared to have been executed on Sept. 4, 1996. Neither a Trump campaign spokesman nor Michael Wildes, the lawyer who wrote the letter outlining Trump's immigration history in September, responded Saturday to requests for comment. Wildes told the AP that ""these documents, which have not been verified, do not reflect our records including corresponding passport stamps,"" but he did not answer additional questions. In recent days, Melania Trump has reemerged on the campaign trail after a long absence following a speech she delivered at the Republican National Convention that borrowed language from Michelle Obama. Melania Trump held a rally on Thursday in Pennsylvania, where she issued a call for civility in politics. In a speech she delivered Thursday in a Philadelphia suburb, she again highlighted her legal immigration status. As she spoke of the years she spent getting her visas and green card, several Trump supporters in the audience shouted -- ""Yes! A legal immigrant!""  [Very different Trump speech: A call by Melania for no more 'mean words']  Experts say many immigrants to the United States perform work illegally while holding a visitor's visa, putting them ""out of status"" and potentially endangering their ability to later become U.S. citizens. It is one reason, they say, that there are so many people living in the country illegally. Trump has promised to deport people who have violated the terms of their visas. It is considered fraud to lie during the immigration process -- by entering the United States with a visitor's visa but intending to work and falsely a telling a border control officer otherwise, for example. If authorities can prove that a person has engaged in fraud, the consequences can be severe. Immigration authorities can retroactively seek to revoke citizenship of people found to have violated immigration law. But that process is very rare, generally used only in extreme cases, such as when a person is suspected of involvement with terrorism. Still, the new information ""shows a disregard for the rules,"" said Bruce Morrison, a former Democratic congressman and immigration expert. ""Technically, it could unravel her status, if it is true."" Paolo Zampolli, a former partner in modeling agency, confirmed to the AP that the documents appeared authentic but that he could not recall additional details. He has told The Washington Post that he paid for Melania to come to New York in 1996 and arranged for her H-1B work visa so she could work at his Metropolitan Models. She was 26 at the time, far older than the typical Eastern European recruit, usually 18 or 19.  Metropolitan was dragged into nasty contract disputes, and court documents related to them filed in New York detail many lavish parties its young models attended. Metropolitan, like many modeling agencies, often threw parties, and their guest list included rich and influential men. It was at one of the parties in 1998 that Zampolli said he introduced Melania to Trump. Immigration experts say questions remain about how Melania was able to obtain her green card in 2001, which allowed her to remain in the U.S. permanently. She has said she was granted the permit because of ""extraordinary ability,"" but experts say that visa category is generally reserved for people whose accomplishment is at the level of a Nobel Prize winner. It would be unusual, they say, for a model with no college degree to qualify. "

(Chris Gardner/AP)  Last week, Eric Trump visited one of the Yuengling Brewery's production facilities in East Norwegian Township, Pa., where Dick Yuengling, the fifth-generation owner of the family concern, endorsed Trump's father for president. ""Our guys are behind your father. We need him in there,"" Yuengling told the younger Trump, who returned the effusive praise: ""This is an amazing success story."" No denying that: Yuengling is the oldest working brewery in America, with a continuous lineage stretching back to 1829, the year Andrew Jackson stormed the White House after a campaign that ushered in the modern era of partisan politics. Yet Trump's remarks and Yuengling's endorsement spurred utterly predictable results. Within days, a couple of bars in Philadelphia stopped carrying the beer. Others threatened to do the same; heretofore faithful Yuengling tipplers vowed on social media never to drink the brand again. A Democratic state legislator in Philly, careful to note Dick Yuengling's constitutional right to endorse whomever he pleased, encouraged the boycott. As Donald Trump himself might tweet, ""#Sad."" Beer -- craft beer in particular -- unites. The industry, and its fans, should remember that its use as a political prop almost never ends well, even when things look fairly innocuous and don't involve an endorsement. In early 2015, at the start of the electoral madness that (hopefully) terminates next week, Smuttynose Brewing Co. on the New Hampshire coast hosted Hillary Clinton for a small-business roundtable. The brewery had hosted several other candidates of both parties over the years -- hard not to in a state that holds the first presidential primaries -- but Clinton's visit, which did not yield an endorsement from Smuttynose co-founder and owner Peter Egelston, prompted especially harsh criticism of the brewery and its brands from opponents of Clinton. Nothing much came of the Smuttynose brouhaha -- some boycott threats came from areas of the country where the beer wasn't even distributed. It's exceedingly unlikely that any Trump-related boycott of Yuengling's brands will hurt the Pennsylvania brewery. It's seen far more potent challenges anyway. When Dick Yuengling took over from his father in the mid-1980s, the brewery appeared headed for obsolescence, another regional producer ground underfoot by the brewing industry's consolidation. Before Prohibition in 1920, there were hundreds of breweries nationwide, many, if not most, producing beers for a local audience. In the decades after World War II, a handful of these breweries -- Anheuser-Busch, Miller, Pabst, Coors, etc. -- either edged out or bought up competitors. Pretty soon, the nation's biggest five breweries produced most of its beer. Analysts by the early 1980s predicted that there would be maybe one or two American breweries as the 21st century dawned.   [Why Budweiser is the last beer that should call itself 'America']   That did not happen, of course. A handful of smaller regional producers such as Yuengling hung on, and a whole crop of so-called craft or micro-breweries sprung up, making beer from more traditional ingredients in more traditional ways, the pair standing athwart Big Beer's takeover of the marketplace, yelling stop. Along the way, they made America perhaps the world's most enviable marketplace for the drink in terms of style and brand loyalty. For Dick Yuengling and his brewery, that meant modernizing operations in a way his familial predecessors had not and resurrecting at least one old recipe -- Yuengling Traditional Lager, in 1987 -- that became the company's best-seller. It also meant new advertising and marketing initiatives, and pushing into fresh marketplaces. Philadelphia, 100 or so miles to the southeast, was quite the get shortly after Dick Yuengling took over. His brewery now reaches 18 states plus Washington, D.C., and is the largest independently owned brewery in the United States. It's also the fourth-largest overall, behind Anheuser-Busch, MillerCoors and Pabst Brewing (and just ahead of fifth-largest Boston Beer Co., maker of Sam Adams). It remains, though, way, way behind the top trio. The corporate parent of A-B, for instance, earlier this month closed perhaps the biggest consumer-goods merger in history -- the $100 billion takeover of SABMiller -- and thus now accounts for nearly one out of every three beers sold worldwide. Scrappy histories and comparatively tiny sizes make Yuengling, Smuttynose and their brethren irresistible props for major-party candidates. They contain just the right mash of entrepreneurial moxie, manufacturing chops and strong brand loyalty to all but scream, ""Successful American small businesses!"" Plus, it's beer. There is no such thing as Joe Wine Bottle, but there is Joe Six-Pack. The term originated sometime in the 1970s to describe blue-collar workers (and voters) who preferred cans of Bud and Miller with their weekends and weeknights. Sarah Palin famously wedded ""hockey mom"" to Joe Six-Pack during the 2008 vice-presidential debate. But hockey mom hasn't really had the staying power. Because it's not beer. Beer is the nation's most popular alcoholic beverage by far -- 43 percent of Americans who drink alcohol choose beer, compared to 32 percent wine and 20 percent spirits, according to Gallup. There are now more breweries than at any time in the nation's history -- 4,200, give or take --with most smaller, more traditional breweries such as Yuengling and Smuttynose. The majority of Americans now live within 10 miles of a craft brewery, according to the Brewers Association trade group. In denser areas such as the D.C. metro area, it's probably more like two or three miles, plucky operations uniting citizens of myriad allegiances and tastes, stronger together as they make American beer great again. Let's keep politics out of it. Cheers. Read more: Trump wines are actually pretty good. But I can't put them on restaurant menus. Pabst Blue Ribbon is finally earning its hipster cred"
9	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/02/the-long-history-of-black-voter-suppression-in-american-politics/	The long history of black voter suppression in American politics	"In August 1922, the Topeka State Journal reported on an unusual voter suppression tactic. Members of the Ku Klux Klan reportedly flew over Oklahoma City, dropping cards into black neighborhoods, warning people to be cautious before heading to the polls.     The only thing that's really hard to believe about this is that the Klan used airplanes to deliver the message. It's not surprising that anti-black rhetoric manifested itself in Oklahoma. The year prior, white mobs burned down a flourishing black community in Tulsa, killing an estimated 300 people. It's not surprising that the Klan was so public. In the 1920s, membership in the group spiked, with such a robust presence that supporters marched down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, before a crowd of thousands, afterward retiring to Arlington for a cross-burning. The Klan marched through Queens, New York in 1927, sparking some fighting during which Donald Trump's father was arrested. It's also not surprising that the Klan was actively involved in politics. In the early part of the 20th century, the Klan was so public in its aims that it endorsed candidates for office. In 1924, black Republican voters -- loyal to the party since its abolitionist days -- demanded that Calvin Coolidge, then the incumbent president, take a strong stand against Klan-endorsed candidates from the party. And it's certainly not surprising that the Klan sought to use its position as an overt public organization and its interest in politics to keep nonwhite people from voting. The card-drop from the airplane was one thing. The Topeka State Journal also reported that Klansmen pledged to stake out polling places in Texas that year, with an aim to ""take careful note of the voting procedure."" (This news article and the airplane one are via the excellent Tweets of Old Twitter account.)     Intimidation of voters by the Klan goes back way further than 1922, though. In 1871, Congress passed the Second Enforcement Act, better known as the Ku Klux Klan Act. Among its provisions was an effort to curtail often-violent efforts to prevent black people from casting votes in elections. Fifty years later, the Klan was no less subtle in its intentions, even if the methodology was sometimes -- sometimes -- more nuanced. There are obvious parallels between those news articles and the current presidential election, even beyond that note in the Texas article about all of the women on the ballot. The menacing suggestion that voter fraud or voting irregularities necessitate keeping a close eye on things is born not of legitimate questions about the outcome of an election but of an attempt to create an excuse for keeping certain voters away from the polls. Politico reports that the Trump campaign has inspired white supremacists and members of the Klan to head to the polls once again, both in support of his candidacy and to keep an eye on things in the helpful way of those Texans in 1922. The Klan's support for Trump has long been an undercurrent to the campaign, but this week it became official, with the organization's official newspaper (""The Crusader"") formally endorsing.   ""The Crusader"" is the official newspaper of the KKK. #MAGA #DonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/mBTvLOFU9u -- Billy Gee (@billygee12) November 1, 2016   The Trump campaign strongly rejected the newspaper's stance. ""This publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday. That is unlikely to tamp down what the racists are doing. A representative from an ""alt-right"" website provided a statement to Politico's Ben Schreckinger about its efforts. ""We are organizing poll watchers in urban areas to cut down on the most traditional type of voter fraud,"" the statement read. ""We also will have stationary cameras hidden at polling locations in Philadelphia, to monitor anyone that comes in to vote and make sure that the same people are not voting at multiple locations."" It is easy to install those cameras, the person explained, because ""black schools are so disorderly that pretty much any official-looking white person with a clipboard can gain access to them."" Another prominent racist told Schreckinger that he was ""sending an army of Alt-Right nationalists to watch the polls."" A third -- the man who was slated to be a Trump delegate in California until people noticed -- has been running automated phone calls in Utah suggesting without evidence that independent candidate Evan McMullin is gay.    Klansmen march in Washington, 1925. (Library of Congress)  Most of this is probably just clumsy bravado from people more comfortable tweeting about racial hostility than actually trying to sneak into a public school. But political efforts to make it harder for black voters to get to the polls have been much more effective when passed legislatively. New laws approved since 2012 have trimmed early voting time in Ohio and North Carolina, contributing to lower turnout from black voters so far in those states. The through-line was obvious in North Carolina: cite voter fraud as a problem, link early voting to increased voter fraud, cut back on early voting, see lower black turnout -- and therefore Democratic turnout. A federal judge tossed North Carolina's law, saying it intended to ""target African Americans with almost surgical precision,"" but after the law was repealed, counties were able to implement early voting as they saw fit. In one county, the New York Times reports, the number of early voting locations dropped from 16 in 2012 to one this year. In a polarized era where ""black"" and ""Democrat"" are often considered interchangeable in a political context, the line between anti-black and anti-Democrat gets blurry. It's worth noting that an unnamed source told Bloomberg that the Trump campaign was explicitly hoping to suppress turnout among black voters this year. Efforts by pro-Trump forces to ""monitor"" polling places to root out ""fraud"" (which is essentially nonexistent as a factor in elections) have already been the subject of legal action. Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone's clumsy ""voter-watch"" effort has been cited in several legal complaints as violating regulations against voter suppression. This is tricky territory for the Republican Party, which is legally prohibited from similar activity under a consent decree enacted in response to efforts to disenfranchise black voters in 1981. If the party is found to be encouraging voter suppression based on race, those involved could be found in contempt of court. Among the statutes that are allegedly being violated, per those complaints? The provisions of the Ku Klux Klan Act.    "
