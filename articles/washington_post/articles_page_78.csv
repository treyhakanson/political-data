Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) leaves after the weekly Senate Democratic policy luncheon at the Capitol Nov. 16, 2016, in Washington, D.C. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)  Younger progressives might not remember this, but before the 2016 election changed everything, the 2004 election changed everything. John F. Kerry lost the presidency. Democrats lost seats in the House and Senate. Most humiliating, they lost the seat of their Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle -- a debacle that teed things up for a lesser-known Democrat named Harry M. Reid. On DailyKos, then (and maybe in the future) a clearinghouse for progressive activism, this was received as a very bad thing. ""So now the highest ranking Democrat in the country will not even stand up for a woman's right to choose,"" one blogger wrote. ""It's clear to me that the current Democrats in power are living by the same strategies they always have without stopping to learn anything,"" another wrote. ""We finally get rid of Daschle and now I get Daschle-light?"" yet another wrote. We know what happened next -- 12 years of bare-knuckled fights, led by Reid, and eight of them in the majority. To the surprise of many, the soft-spoken Mormon who had once sponsored an anti-""anchor baby"" bill brought progressives into the mix as no leader before him. And he mostly won. I bring this up because the day before Chuck Schumer finally claimed the title of majority leader, protesters occupied his office to demand that the liberal senator from a safely blue state be replaced . . . by a true progressive. They preferred Bernie Sanders, who Schumer quickly brought into the party's rapid response team, just as he was promoting Rep. Keith Ellison for Democratic National Committee chairman. The protesters probably agreed with the Intercept, which branded Schumer ""The Worst Possible Democratic Leader at the Worst Possible Time.""   [Democrats move to more aggressive stance against Trump]   What does any of this mean? First, and most basically, in the rubble of an election loss or the confetti of an election win -- really, anytime -- it's very hard to predict how a new party leader will perform. Tim Kaine, seen as a smart and safe choice for Barack Obama's first DNC chairman, presided over historic election losses. So did Ken Mehlman (well, not historic, but losses), after riding from the 2004 Bush campaign to the Republican National Committee. John A. Boehner, elected leader in a 2006 compromise, looked like a loser until his party won a majority. In 2002, Nancy Pelosi was widely seen as too liberal to lead the House Democrats to a national victory; four years later, she did so. Fine, ""pundits are wrong"" is a lesson we've overlearned in 2016. But why were some of these judgments wrong? In each case, they underestimated that our political system is very, very good to the opposition. In a parliamentary democracy, the losing party is in the wilderness until the next election. In our republic, the minority has a multitude of tricks for gumming up the majority party in Congress; every year, it has multiple chances to seize back states or legislative seats. The total opposition strategy deployed by Mitch McConnell in 2009, who commanded the smallest GOP caucus since the 1970s, ground down much of what President Obama wanted and helped sink the popularity of what passed, like the Affordable Care Act. In that case, and 12 years ago, the leadership thrived by listening to grass-roots activists and ideological pressure groups. (Are we not supposed to admit that?) In 2005, Reid shook up the Democratic minority (of 45 seats) by adding a war room. His staff then began working, almost immediately, with progressive activists who wanted Democrats to oppose a reelected George W. Bush. The president gave them something to oppose -- a hard drive for partial privatization of Social Security. Since the election, the more pointed worries on the left have not been about Schumer, but about the risk of Democrats finding compromise. Shell-shocked after the election, both Schumer and Pelosi suggested that Democrats could help Republicans pass an infrastructure bill. Jonathan Chait was blunt about the risk: ""Charles Schumer and Nancy Pelosi Have a Plan to Make President Trump Popular."" But Schumer's long history as a Democratic legislator/strategist suggests he was making a longer play. We're talking about the Democrat who warned, 14 months before the 2008 election, that George W. Bush would not get a chance to appoint a new Supreme Court nominee if a vacancy opened. We're talking about a Democrat who watched that quote boomerang into his forehead after Antonin Scalia died. We are talking about the same Democrat who has watched people execute understandable eye-rolls at his terrible summer advice for Hillary Clinton: ""For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia."" This Schumer, as the Intercept pointed out, is more comfortable with Wall Street than the base of the Democratic Party now feels comfortable with; he also voted, like Kerry and Reid, for the Iraq War. But our recent experience with party leaders suggests that the base, and the majority-enraging rules of Congress, matter more than the previous political life of the leader. With the exception of infrastructure, there are no ideas likely to emerge from a Paul D. Ryan/Donald Trump brain trust that Schumer will need to support. With the exception of energy policy, there are none that his more vulnerable members are likely to break ranks for. The lesson of Schumer's own career, and the career he has watched Republican leaders have, is that total opposition is the clearest path back to power."

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that manufacturing production improved 0.2 percent last month, matching the gain in September. The broader industrial production category, which includes mining and utilities, was flat as warmer weather reduced the demand for heating. Manufacturers have endured a brutal year that crimped sales and hiring. The relatively strong dollar made U.S. goods more expensive overseas, hurting exports, while low energy prices dried up demand for drilling equipment and pipelines. Businesses became cautious about investing in machinery. The seeds of a rebound in factory output began this summer as manufacturers adapted to these obstacles. Still, over the past 12 months, factory production has fallen 0.2 percent. Mining output rose 2.1 percent last month, though it has fallen 7 percent in the past year. Utility production tumbled 2.6 percent. Separate reports suggest that manufacturing is slowly progressing back to full capacity. The Institute for Supply Management says its manufacturing index came in at 51.9 in October. Anything above 50 signals growth. Production and export orders grew faster in October. A measure of factory employment rose last month after falling for three straight months. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Police said the injured student was from Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville and had joined hundreds of students who poured into the streets to speak out against President-elect Donald Trump and the divisiveness of his remarks during the presidential campaign.  [High school students in Montgomery County protest Trump's election]  About 10:30 a.m., as the students streamed up Maryland Avenue, a confrontation broke out between the student wearing the cap that had Trump's campaign slogan on it and another student, said Rockville Police Maj. Michael England.  Soon, four other students jumped in, and the student wearing the Trump hat was punched and kicked, England said.

The injured student had some scrapes, he said, and was disoriented. A parent who looked on as the students marched said she saw the Trump supporter belatedly join the marchers and begin to argue with them. She said she tried to defuse the situation and that the student argued with her, too. She said he told her, ""I have my right to free speech too,"" and that he looked at the crowd and said, ""Go home."" She did not see the later physical confrontation. The scuffle came after several hundred Richard Montgomery students left their classes about 10 a.m. Wednesday and joined in a march and protest that converged on the old Montgomery County District Courthouse. Montgomery school district officials estimated that 300 to 400 students protested.  The students chanted ""Not my president,"" and many carried signs that said ""Stronger Together"" and ""Love Trumps Hate,"" campaign slogans of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Many who heard about the scuffle with the Trump supporter voiced regret that it marred an otherwise peaceful protest. ""We're here to spread love and peace and support and justice for everyone,"" said Xochi Cartland, 17, a senior. Cartland said that while she did not dispute Trump's victory in the election, ""we don't want to allow all of this bigotry and hate in our country."" Richard Montgomery principal Damon Monteleone told the school community that it was unfortunate that a physical altercation between two students who had opposing political viewpoints occurred during the student gathering.  ""This is unacceptable and the perpetrator will receive appropriate consequences,"" Monteleone wrote in a letter Wednesday afternoon. ""Our nation has been through an election season that rises to historical proportions in terms of vitriolic rhetoric and has the potential to divide us. Our school is a microcosm of our nation, and both the wounds and the pride that our divided nation feel, are also felt by our community. . . . While we are all entitled to our own viewpoints and opinions, we must be respectful of opinions that differ from our own. . . . Hateful speech or acts, intimidating language, and bullying for any reason will not be tolerated.""     More than 2,000 D.C. middle school and high school students joined nationwide protests Tuesday after the election of Donald Trump. (Ashleigh Joplin/The Washington Post)   Many students said the protests are an important way to express their views because they are too young to cast votes. Several students said that if the election had been left to the country's youngest generation, the result would have been different.  ""We are feeling very left out of the process,"" said Michelle Dubovitsky, 17, a senior. ""We feel our political voice has not been heard, and we are the future of this country.""  Many passersby who stopped to watch the rally at the courthouse praised the activism. Students filled the front steps of the building and the sidewalks in front of it. They took turns speaking to the crowd. ""I think it's great that high school students are so interested in the future of this country,"" said Ana Gergely, a retiree who works in her son's law office. Students from six other Montgomery County high schools participated in protests of varying sizes Wednesday, but the Richard Montgomery walkout was the day's largest, school officials said. The walkouts came as students at high schools locally and nationally have taken to the streets in similar protests.  [D.C. students walk out of class to protest Trump]  In the Washington region, hundreds of students from Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring walked out Monday, their demonstration gaining strength as they were joined by students from Northwood and Albert Einstein high schools during a protest that lasted more than three hours.  In downtown Washington, a couple thousand middle school and high school students protested Tuesday, crowding streets and chanting until they arrived at the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue NW. Students from Woodrow Wilson High School in Northwest Washington organized the protest, which attracted their peers from schools throughout the city. They said they wanted to make their voices heard and to show Trump that, despite his campaign's divisive rhetoric, their diverse ranks would stand united. In Montgomery County, school officials have said students who missed class would be marked with unexcused absences unless their parents provide a note saying they approved the absence.  "

Francois Delattre strongly condemned renewed airstrikes targeting three hospitals in Syria since Monday and killing more than 30 people in Aleppo, including children. He told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York that the situation in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria is getting worse every day.  ""Make no mistake about it,"" Delattre said. ""Bombing Aleppo and its population is not fighting against terrorism, as the regime pretends. ...What the regime and its allies are doing in Aleppo is actually fueling terrorism, it's fueling radicalization."" He urged increased political pressure to send ""a clear message to the regime and its allies that they must stop their indiscriminate attacks against Syrian people and be accountable."" ___ 10 p.m. A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group says Syrian Kurdish forces are leaving the town of Manbij after training local fighters to defend it. Air Force Col. John Dorrian said Wednesday that the trainers were in the process of leaving after assisting the Manbij Military Council. Kurdish-led forces drove IS from the town earlier this year. Turkey, which sent troops into Syria this summer, had threatened to move into Manbij if the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces didn't leave. Turkey views the Kurdish forces as an extension of the insurgency raging in its southeast. A local Manbij commander, Shervan Darwish, said the last 100 elite fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Units left the town Tuesday. ___ 7:25 p.m. Syrian opposition activists say an airstrike in the northern Aleppo province has killed at least 18 people, including six women. Activists in Batbo village posted the names of the 18 online after Wednesday's airstrike. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says at least 19 were killed, including seven women and three children, many from the same families. Russia announced a major offensive in opposition-held areas on Tuesday, and Syrian President Bashar Assad's air force has been pounding Aleppo city. It was unclear who carried out the airstrike in Batbo. The Observatory, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, says the toll is likely to climb. Ibrahim al-Haj, a member of the Syrian Civil Defense, a group of volunteer first responders, says 22 were killed in the air raid, which struck mud houses in the village. Conflicting accounts of casualties are common in the chaotic aftermath of airstrikes. ___ 11:40 a.m. Turkey's president says Turkish-backed Syrian opposition forces are facing resistance from Islamic State fighters but are close to taking the Syrian town of al-Bab from the extremists. Recep Tayyip Erdogan also told reporters Wednesday that U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters -- which Turkey views as terrorists because of their affiliation to Kurdish rebels in Turkey -- would soon leave the town of Manbij, in keeping with a U.S. promise to Turkey. Erdogan said the opposition fighters were some 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from al-Bab.  ""The siege is going according to plan,"" Erdogan said. ""There is a resistance there at the moment but I don't think it will last long."" Ankara sent ground forces into northern Syria in August, vowing to clear the border area of both IS and Syrian Kurdish militias. ___ 11:15 a.m. Syrian President Bashar Assad says U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could be a ""natural ally"" to the Damascus government in its grinding civil war. In an interview published Tuesday with the Portuguese state TV channel, Assad said his government would need to see if the incoming administration is ""genuine"" about fighting ""terrorists"" in Syria. International observers say Syrian and allied Russian forces regularly strike hospitals, schools, and other civilian infrastructure in opposition-held areas, against international law. Assad maintains he is fighting terrorism. In the run-up to last week's presidential election, Trump said he was ready to work with Assad to fight against the Islamic State group in Syria. More than 300,000 people have been killed in the 5-1/2 year-long Syrian civil war. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Washington is rife with rumor, speculation and trepidation. The rest of the country is in the dark and divided. Trump always said he liked to be unpredictable, and so it is left to others right now to imagine how all the conflicts, contradictions and questions will be resolved. Two signs of the absence of clarity came Friday when Trump reshuffled the leadership of his transition team, jettisoning New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and some of his loyalists and installing Vice President-elect Mike Pence to run the show. At the same time came suggestions that Trump might back away from several key campaign pledges, raising once again the question of what his real convictions are. These might just be hiccups. If not, look out. One big question ahead is which Donald Trump will emerge after Inauguration Day. Will it be the bombastic Trump of the campaign, the one who insulted his rivals and offended one group of people after another? Or will it be the more temperate, subdued and inclusive-sounding Trump who has been on display since the electoral college vote turned stunningly and decisively in his favor early Wednesday morning? Republicans spent months encouraging Trump to ""pivot"" to a more presidential style. He resisted, believing that what got him the nomination and would get him the presidency was to knock his rivals as hard as possible and to be as provocative as he could at his campaign rallies. That was the role he adopted to win. No one has a clue as to how he envisions the role of president -- how he will address the American people, how he will interact with members of Congress, how he will deal with allies and adversaries. Trump ran as the outsider who would shake up the capital. By doing that, he became the tribune of the aggrieved, the left out, the people who have little regard for the views of Washington's elites. But he is a lifelong dealmaker, and Washington is the ultimate dealmaking town. But dealmaking connotes backrooms dominated by insiders making compromises. Do Trump's core followers want Washington to work better, or do they expect him to be more disruptive, a president who puts the establishment in its place?     The Post's Marc Fisher explains how some of President-elect Donald Trump's traits could inform his leadership style when he takes office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)    [Pence replaces Christie as Trump transition leader]  A third issue is playing out daily as the president-elect begins to populate the government he will take over in January. He promised in the closing weeks of the campaign to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington. That is the rallying cry for a populist movement -- Trump's movement. Inevitably, well-connected political insiders -- lobbyists, lawyers, think-tank experts and members of the foreign policy establishment -- will populate his transition. Who really will control a Trump government, the 45th president or those who could surround and smother him? Still another question is Trump's relationship to the Republican Party. Republicans now have what they've dreamed about for years: control of the presidency, Congress and, assuming Trump gets his way, eventually the Supreme Court. They also control most of the governorships and state legislatures. Republicans have lost the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections, but their grip on power is pervasive. Republican congressional leaders are salivating over the prospect of having a free hand to enact a conservative agenda. But is their agenda the Trump agenda? House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has an agenda ready to go, but how much will Trump go along? They differ on trade and entitlements, among other things. Trump wants to spend big on roads, bridges, schools, hospitals and airports, and put millions of people to work doing so. If that isn't a big-government, Democratic initiative, what is? Trump presumably will want to put his stamp on things. If he regarded those congressional leaders as a corner of the swamp he wants to drain, as he suggested by his occasional tweets during the campaign, how does he avoid capitulating to the pressure now to act like a generic conservative Republican? Congressional leaders might see Trump as someone happy to delegate the substantive agenda to others. Trump knows the importance of developing and keeping his brand. When Bill Clinton was newly elected in the fall of 1992, he held a summit with congressional leaders and, in essence, ceded power to them to set the legislative agenda. Campaign proposals to clean up Washington -- symbolic or otherwise -- were pushed to the back burner in deference to entrenched powers. His signature proposal to reform the welfare system, the centerpiece of his effort to redraw the image of his own party, took a back seat to other initiatives in part because there was no appetite to confront the party's liberal base. Clinton later came to regret his decision to defer to Democratic congressional leaders. The analogy is imperfect but nonetheless holds lessons for Trump. The more he turns over the direction and priorities of his administration to congressional leaders, the more his anti-establishment message will fade to the background. Perhaps he doesn't care, but the people who supported him so passionately should.   People look at a home in Youngstown, Pa., that features a huge cutout of President-elect Donald Trump. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)   [Trump advisers hedge on key campaign promises]  Trump has had little to say publicly since his victory. That has allowed the speculation machine to go into overdrive about his plans and the direction he intends to set. Because his operation speaks with many voices, because of the many factions now vying for attention and power, few people really know what Trump is thinking. One early indicator of that thinking will be the selection of a White House chief of staff. From various reports, the competitors include Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, a true insider and the favorite of GOP congressional leaders, and Steve Bannon, the architect of Breitbart News, a keeper of the alt-right flame and one of the key strategists for Trump in the final few months of the campaign. At this point eight years ago, then-President-elect Barack Obama had held his first news conference and had named his chief of staff. The identities of other top White House officials were well known. Trump has promised to move swiftly on top Cabinet positions and key White House jobs. Everyone knows that Trump prizes loyalty and has a long memory for slights and disparagements. What his governing principles and policy touchstones, particularly on foreign policy, amount to will be revealed in the choices he begins to make. Trump won the election by riding a populist revolt driven by people angry, as Dan McGinn and Peter Hart wrote in the Wall Street Journal, at the failure of elected officials, at the absence of secure borders, at the arrogance of the affluent and well educated, at the media and the smugness of many journalists, at their place in the new economy and about ""being mocked and vilified as rubes, racists and 'deplorables.' "" They are likely to cut Trump considerable slack as president, but they did not vote for him to succumb and become part of the swamp. One more thing. In the campaign between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, one side or the other was destined to come out of the election desperately unhappy and discouraged. These first days since Trump won have put people in leadership positions on their best behavior, despite the shocks to the political system and in particular to Clinton and her devastated team and Obama and his team, who now see the potential of his legacy unraveling. Clinton was gracious in her concession speech. The president said his priority is to ensure a smooth transition. Trump was respectful and appeared sobered by his 90-minute meeting in the Oval Office. But the street protests remind everyone of the toll the campaign has taken and of the divisions that remain. It will take more than a smooth transition to overcome all that. "

""Be secret and take defeat."" Which is not really an option for a columnist. After so many harsh words for Donald Trump, I can't pretend that his victory is anything less than a disaster for the country. A hurricane has power. It clears away the sticks and bricks of an old order. But anything it might construct defies entropy in miraculous ways. Hurricane Trump was a defeat of elite expectations so complete and unexpected that it might be called an act of God. An assessment that Trump himself might share. The most immediate concern should be to reassure men, women and children -- particularly Muslim Americans and migrants -- who feel uncertain of their place in the new order. Trump should go out of his way to signal tolerance. Whatever he does, all of us should go out of our way, in the small circles of our daily lives, to tell the newly vulnerable that millions of Americans will oppose bullying and threats of any kind. This has become a duty of citizenship in the Trump era. More personally, it is sobering to find that your view of things -- your most basic principles of ethics and political theory -- is not ascendant in the electoral world of 2016. And to find that your political party, on the verge of controlling all the elected portions of the federal government, is completely unrecognizable. It feels like a kind of exile from everything cherished and familiar. Many I disdain are cheering; but not everyone cheering is worthy of disdain. This election has also challenged my conception of American exceptionalism. When voters don't think that democracy is delivering the goods and turn to a populist strongman, I think of recent history in Central and South America. When voters turn against immigrants in service to an ethnic definition of nationhood, I think of politics in Western and Central Europe. The election outcome is a reminder that American politics is human politics, subject to the same temptations and enthusiasms felt by other nations.  What I find most reassuring at this moment is that America's founders designed a constitutional system with human politics in mind. In Federalist No. 10, James Madison says that we can't always assume the existence of ""enlightened statesmen."" And, by golly, he got that one right. The Constitution is designed to channel and balance conflicting interests, making the whole system less vulnerable to a bad leader. The founders might have been appalled by the election of a Trump-like president; they would not have been surprised by it.  America bears no resemblance to Weimar Germany, which had public institutions so weak and discredited that they crumbled to the touch. Our legislative branch -- which moves at the speed of its most disgruntled senator -- is perfectly capable of healthy obstructionism. The judicial branch does not lack for self-regard. Governors can gain a national audience through defiance. And a thick layer of civic and political institutions exists to be a pain in the backside of political leaders. This picture is complicated by Republican control of both House and Senate. An undivided government will depend on the leader of each legislative body to view himself (less likely, herself) as something more than instruments of the executive will. In this case, the chief executive has made a series of promises -- restrictions on press freedom, systematic religious discrimination, a continental wall, one of the largest mass expulsions in history -- that straddle the line between immoral and impossible. The House speaker and the Senate majority leader may be tempted to fall in line with their partisan team, as both Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Mitch McConnell (Ky.) did at various embarrassing points during the campaign. Their job as legislative leaders (or whoever holds those jobs) is to offer their restraining judgment and to defend the integrity and influence of the institutions where they serve. Republicans will genuinely agree on parts of Trump's agenda. But the republic is likely to depend, at certain defining moments, on stubborn Republican institutionalists willing to defy the wrath of populists. Democrats may find this unlikely. It is incumbent on GOP leaders to prove them wrong. Trump possesses all the faults and prejudices he had the morning of Nov. 8. But now he possesses one thing more -- democratic legitimacy. And that is not a small matter. This requires us to show the respect that is due to the office, to hope he will appoint well-intentioned and competent people and to pray he will discover a commitment to the common good.  As it turns out, stranger things have happened.  Read more from Michael Gerson's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .

From Viennese cafes to hard-luck coastal French towns to the ex-Communist flatlands of eastern Germany, anti-immigrant Europeans with views similar to Trump's said they could no longer be ignored by a political and media elite that unites conventional wisdom on both sides of the aisle. They exulted in their power to win their nations' highest offices in a marathon of elections that starts next month with the Austrian presidency and circles across some of Washington's most important partners. The new order has already begun, in a wave of congratulatory messages from European leaders who had little choice but to meekly declare readiness to work with the new American leader. France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy all face major ballot-box choices in the coming months -- and top politicians are now contending with pressure at home and from the world's biggest superpower. If Europe's mainstream leaders cooperate with an anti-immigrant, anti-trade President Trump, they will have little choice but to cooperate with far-right politicians at home, politicians and analysts said.  [Trump's victory promises to reshape U.S. political landscape]  ""He reclaimed democracy for the American people,"" said Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch far-right Party for Freedom, which is topping opinion polls ahead of March elections. ""It can indeed be an enormous incentive in Europe and the Netherlands to see that if people start moving in a certain direction, it can be done,"" Wilders said in an interview.   ""They have rejected the status quo,"" said Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Front, vowing to repeat Donald Trump's feat in the upcoming French elections. (Martin Bureau/AFP/Getty Images)  Now, he said, national leaders across Europe will have to contend with Trump's ideas -- and that means they will also have to engage with European far-right parties that share the same skepticism toward open borders for people and trade.  ""They have to take us seriously,"" he said. ""Politics will never be the same again after yesterday. I'm sure about that. It's a kind of new era that we entered."" The cheers began early Wednesday, when French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen was among the first world politicians to congratulate Trump on Twitter, just as he started to pull away in the battleground states.  ""They have rejected the status quo,"" Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, said later in the day, vowing to repeat the feat in France. ""What happened last night was not the end of the world, it was the end of a world."" Le Pen far outpolls President Francois Hollande ahead of springtime elections, and though it remains unclear whether she can pull off an outright victory, fewer people are ruling it out after the Trump upset. Le Pen has already surged after Islamic State attacks in France, which were largely perpetrated by French and Belgian citizens whose families had immigrated from North Africa.  [World gasps in disbelief after Trump's win]  ""If ISIS throws three bombs at Paris between the first and the second round of the elections, then it's Le Pen. They're not stupid,"" said Ulrike Guerot, director of the Department for European Policy and the Study of Democracy at Austria's Danube University Krems. ""You could be really cynical and say the only people who are really united right now in Europe are these people."" That view is shared by many of the far-right leaders themselves. ""This election result gives courage to Germany and Europe, because Trump has the maps for a political turnaround in his hand,"" said the leader of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, Frauke Petry, who has been climbing in opinion polls ahead of national elections next year. Euroskeptic leaders said they would study Trump's freewheeling campaign and seek to replicate it in their own nations. Nigel Farage, a leader of the successful campaign to lead Britain out of the European Union, hit the campaign trail with Trump and plans to fly to the United States on Thursday. And Dutch politicians say they were inspired by Trump's improvised election effort.  ""He has such a small campaign staff, so he relied very heavily on the ground on people in cities, organizing things. That kind of civic spirit is something we'd love to take to our campaign. That's something I'm trying to copy,"" said Thierry Baudet, a Dutch Euroskeptic leader who was one of the organizers of a successful April referendum in which Dutch voters rejected an E.U. trade agreement with Ukraine.   [What America's choice of Trump really means]  Austria may be the next country poised to elect a nationalist leader who has many positions on immigration and trade that are similar to Trump's. The anti-immigrant Freedom Party is poised to seize the Austrian presidency Dec. 4 -- and it just sent a delegation to the United States to study the Trump campaign, one official said. But in a hint at some limits on Trump's effect on European politics, the far-right Austrian presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, took a careful line on the U.S. president-elect on Wednesday, offering him congratulations but little more. Analysts said that domestic anti-Americanism dictated the careful line. ""The overall narrative that we have to stick it to the elites, that the country was usurped by the elite and we need to return it to the people, also works in Austria,"" said Reinhard Heinisch, head of the political science department at the University of Salzburg. But ""the Freedom Party has to form a coalition, and to form a coalition it has to play well with others,"" he said. No matter the local considerations, for many Euroskeptic leaders the Trump victory was a delightful glimpse into future electoral possibilities. ""When it rains in the United States of America, you feel the drops here in Europe,"" said Filip Dewinter, a leader of Belgium's far-right Flemish Interest party, which has campaigned on an anti-immigration platform. ""It will be very tough for the political elite in Europe.""  James McAuley in Paris, Annabell Van den Berghe in Brussels and Stephanie Kirchner in Berlin contributed to this report.

There's no other way to describe the massive change Americans voted for Tuesday. In electing Donald Trump to the White House, Americans handed the reins to someone whose campaign was premised on an unrelenting challenge to the status quo, distrust in government and dismissal of the politicians from both parties. They chose a man who promised to channel their anger, as much as carry their hopes. He didn't merely promise change, he promised disruption. The ramifications of the Trump presidency are difficult to measure. In his ugly, knock-down fight against Democrat Hillary Clinton, his personality was a draw more than his policies. The stump speeches that drew thousands to raucous rallies were laced with proposals but powered by his one word political philosophy: ""Winning."" But it resonated in a way few expected with white, working-class America, across the Rust Belt and in rural communities, where the scars of the Great Recession endure and winning felt like a long-lost concept. He understood their anxiety about jobs moving overseas and immigrants moving in. He claimed to hate the liberal media as much as they did. He sounded like no politician ever. This was their uprising, the elevation of a 70-year-old reality-TV and real estate mogul willing to speak their truth, rewrite rules and insult anyone along the way. It is nothing short of whiplash -- for Americans and people around the world who were alarmed by his harsh rhetoric about longtime allies and other cultures. Trump's victory comes eight years after a coalition of blacks, Hispanics, women and young people elected the first black president and ushered in what many viewed as a new era of progressive dominance in presidential politics. Tuesday's results are a stunning, if confusing, indictment of the policies of President Barack Obama, who nevertheless remains popular.  ""There's nothing like it in our lifetime,"" said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who in the days leading up the election dubbed a Trump win a ""social revolution"" on par only with Franklin Delano Roosevelt's clubbing of Herbert Hoover for his handling of the Great Depression in 1932. To many policy experts, economists, military brass, diplomats -- the establishment, Trump would say -- Trump's proposals are viewed as improbable, impossible, and at times unconstitutional. Democrats and Republicans in Washington recoiled from his proposed ban on Muslims from entering in the U.S. Few think his vow to force Mexico to pay for a wall along the border is workable, at best. And really only Trump knows if his promise to ""bomb the s--t out out of"" the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria seen is anything more than bluster. There's mixed evidence on whether Trump's victory is an endorsement of such plans. Voters sent enough Republicans back to the Senate to give the GOP control of both chambers, a clear government mandate. But for all the talk about immigration, exit polls showed it was a low priority for most voters. Just 1 in 10 voters said immigration was the most important issue facing the country. More than half of voters opposed Trump's plan for a ""big, beautiful wall."" Clearly, what many voters opposed was Clinton. The former secretary of state and veteran of two decades of political battles proved to be an exceedingly damaged candidate, distrusted both by her supporters and opponents alike. Her historic candidacy, to be the first female president, failed to rouse the enthusiasm or emotion that drove Obama's coalition to the polls. Her disconnect with white, working-class voters appears to have been her downfall. Even Obama's dire warnings -- ""the fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders"" -- didn't do the trick. It wasn't enough to scare people about a President Trump. Americans had fears about Clinton, too. Her penchant for secrecy was spun into scandal with brutal impact. Her use of a private email server as secretary of state not only dogged her for months -- but returned at precisely the wrong moment in late October when FBI Director James Comey notified Congress he was reviewing new emails for evidence that she or her handlers mishandled classified information. Comey cleared Clinton again Sunday, but in the nine intervening days, as a cloud of suspicion hovered over her, nearly 24 million people cast early ballots. That's a sizeable chunk of all the votes cast for president. Trump's win made a mockery of all the usual political rules. He had virtually no ground game, his advertising on television didn't come close to matching his rival's. He largely ignored the practice of voter targeting and analytics, elevated to religion after Obama's two victories. Clinton's campaign raised $513 million -- roughly double what Trump raised, including $66 million from his own pocket. While pollsters and political professionals in both parties dismissed him, he declared he had galvanized long-alienated voters into a movement.  ""The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,"" Trump declared. __ EDITOR'S NOTE: Kathleen Hennessey covers the White House and national politics for The Associated Press.
