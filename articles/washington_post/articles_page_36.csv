In a San Diego-area House race, Democrats are trying to unseat one of the richest and most well-known members of Congress. In a North Carolina governor's race, the Democratic challenger is claiming victory while the Republican governor is not conceding. In another California House race, the Democrat whose father is going to jail is hanging on by a thread. And there are a few state legislative chambers where partisan control has yet to be decided. In other words, there's still lots to be decided. Here's a rundown of the six biggest outstanding races of 2016. 1. The wealthy GOP congressman    Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)  Since he came to Congress in 2000, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) has never won reelection in his San Diego/Orange County district with less than 58 percent of the vote. But Issa is now leading his Democratic challenger, retired Marine Col. Doug Applegate, 51 percent to 49 percent. As of midday Tuesday, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported Issa was ahead by 4,630 votes, and the race isn't being called until tens of thousands of provisional ballots from the Orange County area are counted. If Issa loses, it will be a shock to official Washington. Issa is one of the most well-known members of Congress. As chair of the highly political House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, he was one of President Obama's main antagonists in Congress. Issa led the investigation into the Internal Revenue Service's scrutiny of conservative nonprofit groups and once said Obama should be impeached. He's also one of the richest members of Congress; in 2015 CQ Roll Call ranked him literally the richest for the third consecutive year, with a net worth of somewhere between $350 million and $250 million. But money can't buy everything. As the nonpartisan Cook Political Report wrote, ""it's possible to be the wealthiest member of Congress and still run a very poor campaign."" Issa embraced Donald Trump even though his district is more than a quarter Hispanic or Latino, and he was perhaps overly comfortable and didn't start running ads until late in the game. Toward the end of the campaign, Issa tried to move to the center -- and got blasted by Obama for it. In late October, Issa sent out a mailer with a picture of Obama signing one of his bills. Obama called Issa ""the definition of chutzpah,"" and ""shameless,"" given the congressman spent much of the past eight years as one of the highest-profile critics of the president. 2. The Democratic congressman whose dad is going to jail    Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.) speaks to a reporter. (Rich Pedroncelli/AP)  This race probably would have been close even if Rep. Ami Bera's (D-Calif.) 83-year-old father hadn't been sentenced to a year in jail just three months before the election. It's a competitive Sacramento-area swing district that Bera -- a two-term congressman -- won in 2014 with just 50.4 percent of the vote. Babulal Bera was sentenced to prison in August for illegally funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to his son's congressional campaigns. (Investigators say it happened without his son's knowledge.)    Babulal Bera, father of Rep. Ami Bera, leaves federal court in August. (Lezlie Sterling/Sacramento Bee via AP)  But the congressman's Republican challenger, Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones, had his own legal troubles when a deputy accused him of unwanted sexual advances. The result was an expensive and negative race. And now Bera leads Jones by just 2,583 votes out of more than 205,000 cast. There should be an update later Wednesday as officials scramble to count 195,000 outstanding ballots. (A Sacramento County elections official told Roll Call the turnout was ""huge."") Apparently Republicans think they have a shot to net this one: Jones showed up to new-member orientation in Washington this week. 3. North Carolina's gubernatorial race    North Carolina Democratic candidate for governor Roy Cooper and his wife, Kristin, greet supporters during an election night rally in Raleigh, N.C., Nov. 9. (Gerry Broome/AP)  This has been updated to make it clearer that so far there is zero evidence of voter fraud in this race. And on Friday, the Durham County Board of Elections dismissed the protest from the McCrory campaign alleging voter fraud.  On election night, Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) declared victory in one of the most hotly contested races of 2016. As of Thursday, he's ahead by more than 5,000 votes. out of 4.6 million cast. But Gov. Pat McCrory (R) isn't giving up. He is waiting on thousands of provisional ballots to be counted (although provisional ballots tend to favor Democrats), and his team is suggesting there may have been mistakes -- even voter fraud -- in a key Democratic county. A lawyer for the North Carolina Republican Party filed a formal protest alleging the Durham County Board of Elections engaged in ""malfeasance"" when it had to count some 94,000 votes by hand after its machines broke on Election Day. The county's vote tally was pivotal in pushing Cooper into. Elections officials -- appointed by McCrory -- are adamant they did nothing wrong, and Republicans have yet to provide any evidence otherwise. On Friday, the board of elections unanimously dismissed the complaint. But McCrory's camp isn't letting up the pressure. ""To say we are a bit suspicious is an understatement,"" McCrory strategist Chris La Civita told The Fix on late last week. Cooper's team is confident he'll be governor when this is all over: ""With every day we are more confident that Cooper's election night victory will be confirmed after the final vote canvass. We hope that with this clear margin of victory, Governor McCrory will stop all efforts to undermine the results of this election,"" said campaign manager Trey Nix in a statement. After the state certifies each county's results, if the race is still within 10,000 votes, McCrory's camp can request a recount. But that probably wouldn't happen until after Thanksgiving. If McCrory loses, he'll be the only incumbent governor to lose this year -- and one of just a handful of governors to lose in modern times. The News & Observer reported he's carrying on; he showed up at an annual Republican Governors Association meeting in Orlando earlier this week. 4, 5, 6: Arizona, New York and California state Senates     It looks as if Republicans will hang onto their pre-2016 election dominance at the state legislative level. Even though Democrats picked up four chambers, Republicans will control both chambers in 33 states.   [No, Republicans don't control enough states to change the Constitution. (But it's close.)]   But votes are still being counted in three state legislative chambers that could sway which party controls it, and by how much. Republicans turned the Connecticut state Senate into a tie. Democrats were hoping to reciprocate in Arizona, turning the 30-member state Senate from an 18-to-12 Republican majority to a 15-to-15 tie. After Election Day, four races were too close to call there, and Democrats needed to win three of the four to tie the state Senate. (Republicans have a solid majority in the state House.) But odds of a tie in Arizona are looking dimmer by the day: A Republican won one of those close races, and GOP candidates are leading in two others. Control of the New York state Senate is another nail-biter. After Election Day, the perennially close chamber's makeup is now 31 Republicans, 30 Democrats. There are two outstanding Long Island-area races that could tip the balance of the power -- or not. A Republican leads in one and a Democrat in another. If those cancel each other out, all eyes will be on Brooklyn-area state Sen. Simcha Felder. Felder was first elected as a Democrat in 2012 but has since voted with Republicans. He has yet to announce which party he'll caucus with in 2017. ""I'm not a loyal Democrat,"" he told the New York Post recently. ""I never was."" Republicans are also optimistic about the California state Senate. No, they don't think they can come close to controlling a chamber in such a blue state, but they are a few thousand votes away from blocking Democrats from having a supermajority. The race that could decide whether Democrats have virtually unobstructed power is the still-contested open state Senate seat in the Santa Ana Valley. There, Republican Ling Ling Chang leads Democrat Josh Newman by two points of all the votes tallied, but the contest remains too close to call. Republicans say this is a particularly crucial race for them, because California requires a two-thirds majority to raise taxes, and Chang would be the key vote to stop it. It would also be a symbolic victory for Republicans; after Nov. 8, California is one of just five states completely controlled by Democrats.    "

Hillary Clinton lost the three states that tipped the election -- Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- by 106,000 votes combined, so it's no surprise that there are many different explanations for the Democrats' loss. There's a compelling case that there were multiple reasons -- death by a thousand cuts, if you will -- but as liberals regroup and prepare for the next elections, one challenge is clear: getting their supporters to vote. The new Washington Post-Schar School poll contains this nugget: Among people who said they did not vote, 45 percent said they wanted Hillary Clinton to win, compared with only 23 percent who said Donald Trump. (Lest you think it was dispirited third-party supporters making up the rest: Only 5 percent said Gary Johnson or Jill Stein; 16 percent said ""none of the candidates."") When you look through the crosstabs, again and again those who did not vote were more positive about President Obama, Clinton and the Democrats and more worried about Trump than those who did vote. The gap is not unique to this poll: Past Post polls again and again found that ""likely voters"" tended to be more conservative as a group than all respondents to those polls.      A new Washington Post-Schar School of Policy and Government poll conducted Nov. 11-14 reveals Americans' attitudes in the wake of the presidential election. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   This is not a surprising finding to political veterans. A 2012 Pew Research study found that nonvoters backed Barack Obama over Mitt Romney 59-24. And we can see the effects: A number of studies both domestic and international have found that higher turnout -- especially higher turnout among poorer income brackets -- is correlated with more progressive and economically equal policies. It's not as if all nonvoters are completely unengaged with politics. In the latest Post poll, 56 percent of nonvoters said they discussed the election ""nearly every day"" or ""a few times a week"" -- a lower number than among those who voted, but still a majority. One-third of nonvoters said they discussed it almost every day. The Census Bureau has repeatedly found that nonvoters do not cite disinterest in politics but convenience -- lack of time to vote, inaccessible polling stations, being out of town on Election Day and so on. It makes sense: Many people, especially those with lower incomes, don't have the flexibile schedules that make it easy to take time off to vote. These are barriers that can be overcome -- with help. I had a number of emails after my last blog post from readers fearful of a Trump presidency asking, ""What can we do?"" There are many answers to that question, but here's an easy one: Liberals should start working now, in your states and communities, to boost turnout in two years, four years and further down the road. The sooner they start doing that, the better: Waiting until a few months before the next Election Day could lose valuable time. Liberals should ask the people they know who are worried about Trump if they voted. If somebody didn't vote because he or she didn't have time, liberals should offer to help them find a way to vote, whether obtaining an absentee ballot (available to all registered voters in many states) or figuring out a day when they can vote early. If the nonvoters weren't registered and they're eligible, progressives should help them register. And the next time they're inclined not to vote because they're not enthusiastic about the top of the ticket, liberals should remind them of how small Trump's margin was. (If a nonvoter really doesn't want to vote for a candidate, point out that they can vote for candidates that they like elsewhere on the ballot.) The battle carries over to legislation as well. Progressives should support and volunteer for groups that support voting rights and making access to the ballot easier. Those who live in a state where Republicans try to push through more state-level restrictions on voting should call state representatives to make their opposition clear. Let's not sugarcoat this: No one person is going to bring in a lot of new votes this way. But as we saw this year -- yet again -- a few votes here and a few votes there can quite quickly become all the difference."
2	https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/16/republicans-are-now-a-minority-party-wielding-near-absolute-power/	Republicans are now a minority party wielding near-absolute power	"   Hillary Clinton supporters react as voting results come in at a Clinton campaign election-night event on Nov. 8 in New York. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)  Incredibly enough, all the votes from the 2016 election have not been counted, though we are nearing the end. And as of today, Hillary Clinton has more than a million more votes than Donald Trump, 62.4 million to 61.3 million. Since most of the remaining votes are in California, which she won by nearly 30 points, her lead will almost certainly increase.  As much as Democrats would like to argue that the fact that Donald Trump is taking office after having lost the vote means he has no mandate to pursue the hard-right agenda his Republican colleagues are so giddy about, it won't matter in a practical sense. They'll do what they want to do now that they have the chance, and there's almost nothing Democrats can do to stop them. But the GOP's status as a minority party wielding near-absolute power is one of the most important facts about today's politics, a profound distortion that affects nearly everything that happens at the federal and state level. Before we go further, I'll note that since I've been talking about the electoral college and the popular vote in the past few days, my Twitter feed tells me exactly what conservatives will say in response to this issue being raised. In its more polite form, it sounds like, ""Shut up and stop your whining, liberal. YOU LOST! HA HA HA!"" But the point of this discussion isn't to re-litigate the election, which is over. It's to understand the country's political landscape and assess what the two parties, particularly the Democrats, might do in the future. The Republican advantage doesn't stop at the White House. It continues in the Senate, which is of course a profoundly anti-democratic institution by design, giving 600,000 residents of Wyoming the same two representatives as 40 million Californians. If Democrats and Republicans were equally present in small and large states, then this inequality would wash out, but they aren't -- more of the small states lean Republican, and more of the large states are Democratic.       A new Washington Post-Schar School of Policy and Government poll conducted Nov. 11-14 reveals Americans' attitudes in the wake of the presidential election. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   If we look at the Senate that will be in office next year, we can see the disparity. Presuming the GOP candidate wins a runoff election in Louisiana in December, Republicans will enjoy a 52-48 advantage, but when we add up the votes Democratic and Republican candidates got in the three elections that put them there, we see almost a mirror image: In 2012, 2014 and 2016, Democratic Senate candidates got a combined 114.8 million votes, or 52.8 percent of the total, while Republican candidates got 102.6 million votes, or 47.2 percent. There's a similar distortion in the House, though it doesn't cross the 50 percent mark as it has in the past, particularly in 2012, when Democrats got nearly 2 million more votes than Republicans but still found themselves in the minority. While there are a couple of races awaiting final results and two runoffs that have to be held in Louisiana, it looks as though the final divide in the House will be 241-194 in favor of Republicans. To put that in percentage terms, Republicans have 55.4 percent of the seats, while Democrats have 44.6 percent. Yet Republicans got only 51.5 percent of the two-party vote this year, while Democrats got 48.5 percent. Those few percentage points of difference between the number of votes the parties get and the number of seats they wind up with translate into a huge advantage for Republicans. It means that in order for Democrats to win back the House, it wouldn't be enough to get a majority of the votes; they'd essentially have to win in a blowout. (Side note: I got the 2016 presidential and House data from David Wasserman, 2012 and 2014 Senate data from the FEC, and 2016 Senate data from Dave Leip.) Republicans have some other built-in advantages, like the fact that most governor's races happen in non-presidential years, when the electorate tends to be older, whiter and more affluent. Some of the reasons the playing field is tilted in this way are simply good fortune for Republicans, especially the geographic sorting that advantages them. While both parties have many safe congressional seats, the safe Democratic ones often are 80 percent or 90 percent Democratic, while safe Republican seats are more like 60 percent or 70 percent Republican. That means that Democrats essentially have wasted votes that would be more effectively spread across a greater number of districts, the way Republicans' are. There's not much you can do about that; it's the result of millions of individual choices people make about where they want to live. But the Republicans have also very effectively maximized their ability to win before anyone casts a vote. They've gerrymandered districts to favor themselves, which doesn't make an enormous difference but does give them an extra seat here and there. The conservatives on the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, and Republican-controlled states immediately went on a rampage of vote suppression, doing everything they could to make it harder for people likely to choose Democrats, particularly African Americans and young people, to register and vote, whether it was with voter ID requirements, limits on early voting or cutting back the number of polling places, ensuring that certain people would have to wait hours to vote.  Which, from a partisan standpoint, makes perfect sense. As Sean McElwee recently noted, those who are not registered to vote skew younger, less wealthy, more friendly to Democrats and more liberal in their policy opinions. As Joshua Holland put it, ""If non-voters voted, the GOP would be hard-pressed to win anything outside of the deep South."" So it's in Republicans' interests to make registering and voting as cumbersome and difficult as possible, to keep non-voters from becoming voters. Which they do.  This all produces a self-reinforcing cycle, in which the Republican advantage helps Republicans maintain their advantage. Democrats might like to, say, promote ballot measures that would make registering and voting easier. But Republican success at suppressing Democratic votes makes those measures harder to pass, keeping the system as Republicans fashion it. So what can Democrats do? Just because you're starting at a disadvantage doesn't mean you can't win; it just means you have to try even harder. And as important as it is for them to resist President Trump and the Republican Congress, there may be no higher priority for Democrats right now than organizing at the state level. If they succeed there -- both with initiatives and state legislative races -- they can make voting laws less restrictive, gain control of the redistricting that will happen after the 2020 Census, and perhaps turn that self-reinforcing cycle in their favor. That will make Democratic victories more likely in the future. It won't be easy, but the future of their party depends on it."

Joe Manchin of West Virginia says his party lost the presidential election because ""there was no plan"" to help people in his state and other rural states who are struggling to survive economically. Manchin said Democrats not only didn't have a plan, but also ""people think you didn't care."" Manchin, who has joined Senate Democrat's leadership team, said people in his state ""feel like a returning Vietnam veteran. My little state of West Virginia has done everything this country's asked of us and then they turn their back on us."" He said West Virginians were so angry they were willing to overlook ""offensive rhetoric"" from Donald Trump, adding: ""If that's not a wake-up call I really don't know what is."" __ 11:28 a.m. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has formally announced she is seeking re-election to the job. In a letter to House Democrats Wednesday she tells them she already has support from two-thirds of the caucus. Democrats disgruntled about last week's election results had pressured Pelosi to delay leadership elections that had been scheduled for this week. They will take place Nov. 30 instead. But it's not clear anyone will emerge to challenge Pelosi -- especially now that the California Democrat, who is known for her vote-counting skills, has declared that she has the votes. ___ 10:28 a.m. Democrats have a new leadership lineup for next year and the all-Republican government. New York's Chuck Schumer will be minority leader, Illinois' Dick Durbin will be the No. 2 Democrat as minority whip and Washington's Patty Murray will be the assistant leader. Schumer told reporters Wednesday that they will work with Donald Trump on issues where they agree but challenge him when values or progress is under assault. Schumer said that ""when you lose an election like this you can't flinch."" In other changes, Sen. Patrick Leahy will be the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee and Sen. Dianne Feinstein will fill that post on Judiciary as the Senate considers a Supreme Court nominee. ___ 10:25 a.m. Senate Democrats have elected Chuck Schumer to be their new minority leader when Congress convenes in January. The New Yorker will be Washington's most powerful Democrat as the party confronts an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump. Democrats unanimously picked Schumer at a closed-door meeting Wednesday. He will succeed Harry Reid, the combative Nevada Democrat who is retiring in January after 30 years in the Senate. Republicans will control the White House, the House and Senate. Republicans will have a 52-48 edge in the Senate. Democrats will have some leverage because on important issues, they'll likely force Republicans to garner 60 votes to end filibusters. It won't always be possible for Schumer to keep Senate Democrats together because many will seek re-election in two years from GOP-leaning states. __ 10:20 a.m. Senate Republicans have re-elected Kentucky's Mitch McConnell to be majority leader when the new Congress convenes in January and starts working on Donald Trump's agenda. McConnell is widely popular among Republicans and his election was by acclimation on Wednesday. The 74-year-old is considered a clever tactician who mixes conservative leanings with a willingness to cut bipartisan deals when necessary. McConnell was Senate minority leader for eight years before becoming majority leader when the GOP took control in 2015. He enraged Democrats by refusing to let the Senate consider President Barack Obama's nomination of federal judge Merrick Garland to fill a Supreme Court vacancy last February. That paid dividends when Trump was elected president. McConnell distanced himself from Trump during the campaign, but says he's ready to work with him. __ 10 a.m. Senate Democrats and Republicans are meeting separately to pick their leaders for the Congress that convenes in January. Their selections of Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are expected to produce little drama. That's the opposite of the House, where both parties' leadership elections have been more theatrical. There, Republicans voted Tuesday to re-nominate Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., after recalcitrant conservatives and Trump backers upset by Ryan's frigid campaign-season treatment of Trump fell into line. Democrats postponed their leadership election until Nov. 30 after junior lawmakers demanded more time to digest the party's disappointing Election Day showing, a warning shot at House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  On Tuesday, Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) christened Stephen Bannon, Donald Trump's newly appointed chief strategist, the Democrats' new number one enemy.  In his speech from the Senate floor, Senator Reid called directly for Donald Trump to ""rescind his appointment of Steve Bannon.""  A number of other Democrats joined in the chorus, circulating a letter demanding that Bannon be removed from his position. Yawn. Back in the day, I worked for two GOP leaders who were similarly situated. Both Lee Atwater and John Sununu intimidated the Democrats, and they both quickly became men the Democrats wanted to ""get."" The Democrats saw Atwater and Sununu as threatening, viewing them as both the man behind the curtain and the man in their face. Both Atwater and Sununu relished the role of being a lightning rod. Both taunted their enemies and shook their fists at the Democrats' rage, and both were able to effectively deflect fire that might have otherwise been directed at the president. Atwater and Sununu enjoyed the fight. However, it is possible Bannon won't engage the Democrats in the same way Atwater and Sununu did. So far he's been media shy and not at all reckless. He's been making the rounds on Capitol Hill, and I haven't seen any smoke from fires he may have started or picked up any reports that he's assaulted any members, staffers or visiting tourists.  In fact, the anti-Trumpers may be creating a hero on the right who could be more effective than they think. There is no doubt Bannon could fill ballrooms with GOP donors today if he chose to do so. You can bet Bannon's past is being scoured by the media, Democratic opposition researchers, hostile foreign powers and the like. No doubt he will have his time in the dunking booth, but sometimes there just isn't enough water to drown the target. Breitbart may be an incendiary website at times; as the Wall Street Journal wrote today, ""the political tendency Mr. Bannon represents - and some of the unsavory customers he isn't responsible for - deserve a watchful eye"", but it's important to remember that ""Mr. Trump's political opponents have an interest in exaggerating the alt-right's influence - which is marginal at best - for the purposes of guilt-by-association."" History tends to repeat itself. The Democrats didn't get Atwater. They didn't get Sununu. They didn't get Karl Rove either, for that matter.  They wasted a lot of time and energy. And now they're focused on Bannon. It's a shame we can't break some of the patterns and get recognition from both parties that there is little value in isolating an individual and labeling them the designated bad guy.  I don't think I have ever seen so much intense hostility directed at a political operative so quickly - especially without any ""smoking gun"" that confirms Bannon is the miscreant Trump's opponents want him to be."

In many offices, this handover of power is likely to be greeted with suspicion. The meeting of  ""politicals"" and career civil servants is a Washington institution. And it's often a messy one -- messy with mistrust and questions of who is the better, smarter manager as people hired for their political affiliation and work on the campaign come in to run the government.

"   Baker, the second of the two atomic bomb tests, in which a 63-kiloton warhead was exploded 90 feet underwater as part of Operation Crossroads, conducted at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 to measure nuclear weapon effects on warships. U.S. Navy via Reuters  In March, then-candidate Donald Trump shocked nuclear policy experts by suggesting at a town hall meeting that the United States might be able to reduce the defense budget by encouraging its allies, especially Japan and South Korea, to build nuclear weapons. When pressed to clarify his comments by the moderator, CNN's Anderson Cooper, Trump replied, ""Wouldn't you rather in certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?"" Earlier that same week, Trump told Bloomberg's Mark Halperin that it was important to remain ""unpredictable"" when dealing with nuclear weapons. Since the end of the World War II -- the only time that atomic weapons have been used in war -- the policy of the United States has been to discourage nuclear proliferation, whether through defense treaties, economic sanctions or controlling international sales of uranium. Similarly, the concept of nuclear deterrence depends on rational, predictable decisions about the use of nuclear weapons. Trump's statements naturally caused a flurry of panic over an untested leader with little familiarity with the basic principles of nuclear security having control of atomic weapons. Fear of Trump having ""the nuclear codes"" became a sort of rallying cry for his opponents.   [Amid a world of problems, Trump's policy prescriptions remain opaque]   Americans terrified over this prospect, though, should take comfort in knowing that there is an option for limiting nuclear risk beyond panicking or praying. It may be time to resurrect a Cold War strategy for limiting nuclear risk: back-channel communications among private scientists. In 1955, a year after the U.S. test of a hydrogen bomb in the Bikini Atoll blanketed the globe with a thin layer of radioactive fallout, a group of scientists issued a manifesto against the development, testing and use of nuclear weapons. This public statement inspired what became known as the Pugwash Conference, an international scientists' movement on behalf of nuclear disarmament. At the height of Pugwash's influence in the late 1950s and early 1960s, scientists from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and a handful of other non-nuclear countries gathered regularly to discuss the nature of the nuclear threat and ways to reduce it. Both today and at the time, commentators have held up Pugwash as a model of nonpartisan scientific activism, a shining example of what scientists could accomplish if they worked without the constraints of formal politics. In 1995, the Pugwash Conferences and Joseph Rotblat, one of the movement's founders, received the Nobel Peace Prize for their roles in reducing nuclear tensions at the height of the Cold War. More recently, the Obama administration hailed the personal relationship between Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, as a critical ingredient in the nuclear agreement with Iran. The two men shared a background in physics and engineering and had overlapped at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s. While Moniz and Salehi obviously represented their respective countries at the negotiating table, their shared technical assumptions provided a platform on which to build political consensus. Both during and after the Cold War, the U.S. government supported initiatives that brought international scientists together outside formal political channels, whether in the form of academic conferences or cooperative research initiatives, like the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Beyond the nuclear realm, scientists have informally assisted U.S. officials in negotiating treaties on issues as diverse as climate change and exploration rights in Antarctica. This strategy, commonly known as ""science diplomacy,"" has limitations. Scientists are not elected officials, and nothing in their scientific training is designed to prepare them for the subtleties of international political negotiations. The premise of science diplomacy risks putting power in the hands of technical experts whose personal interests may or may not match those of their national governments. And yet: There is no evidence to suggest that the elected head of government -- Donald J. Trump -- possesses the finesse needed to negotiate a nuclear crisis, either. In 1955, scientists like Joseph Rotblat hoped to use their personal connections and technical expertise to avert a nuclear apocalypse. For the leaders of Pugwash, the point of an international scientists' movement wasn't so much to displace official negotiations between governments as to keep a line of communication open in the event of a crisis. The idea was that private citizens could maintain personal relationships even if their countries had severed formal relations, in much the same way that bipartisan dinner parties used to grease the wheels of government in Washington. During the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, for example, the American members of the Pugwash Committee sent their Soviet counterparts a telegram urging restraint and promising to use whatever limited influence they had over U.S. government officials to defuse the situation. The scientists acknowledged that the crisis could be solved only by heads of state but hoped that a mere reminder of their presence might jolt political leaders into recognizing the effects of a nuclear strike. Whether the president-elect and his advisers realize it, Trump is going to need scientific expertise. His comments as a candidate suggest that he'll scuttle the Iran deal and turn a blind eye to nuclear proliferation, all while engaging in a race with Russia to modernize the nuclear arsenal. It remains to be seen, of course, how many of these ideas will carry over to a Trump administration. In a normal administration, it would be a given that Trump and his advisers would confer with security experts who could provide a reality check on technical questions, from the stages of nuclear proliferation to the effects of modernized nuclear weapons on theories of deterrence. But the Trump campaign has defied expectations in a number of ways, and a Trump presidency is in many ways an open question. Should Trump decide to go forgo technical advice, Americans (and the world) should take comfort in the fact that scientists, security specialists and nuclear weapons experts from many countries will continue to talk to one another. Pugwash's scientists, too, continue to meet, forging personal links and technical knowledge that can transcend international borders. Back-channel communications among international scientists will always offer hope for preventing a nuclear catastrophe, regardless of who sits in the Oval Office.  "

As Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said in her concession speech, she did not manage to shatter that ""highest and hardest glass ceiling."" Before Tuesday, however, Clinton's campaign was imbued with an air of triumphal inevitability. In the eyes of many of her supporters, the time had surely come (if not now, then long ago) for a female president -- and here she was, facing a man they viewed as a historically weak candidate. Not only did she lose, but a man accused of numerous sexual assaults is now the U.S. president-elect. As others debate how big a role sexism played in her defeat, we are looking around the world at modern democracies that have elected women to their highest leadership position. Since 1960, 49 democracies around the world have elected at least one woman to lead. The map above shows the 15 that have a female leader, and the 34 that have had one in the past but do not now. The United States will have to wait at least four more years to join this club -- for that matter, the nation hasn't had a female vice president. Figuring out which female leaders made the cut for the map was a task in and of itself. Executive power structures vary widely from country to country, and so do the terminologies that denote who is ultimately in charge. For instance, in one country, the president may be the head of the executive, whereas in another, the president may be a largely ceremonial role appointed by a prime minister -- or a chancellor, or state counselor, or some other title. Some organizations we reached out to, such as UN Women, gave us numbers higher than 49 because they included women who, say, headed their country's parliaments, or who were appointed as chief executive during a brief interim, or transition, between two men. For our map, we decided to eschew terminology as much as we could. Instead, we sought to display countries where women were either directly elected or were the head of a political party that was elected, thus becoming their country's chief decision-maker, whatever they ended up being called.   [Despite a big year for women in politics, national legislatures are still dominated by men]   The first woman to do so was Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who was elected prime minister of Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, in 1960 -- 56 years ago. Bandaranaike's story mirrors that of many of the initial female leaders: She came into power after the death of a father or a husband who had led the country before her. Bandaranaike's husband was assassinated, but she quickly established herself as a deserving replacement and was elected on two occasions, serving as head of state for a total of 12 years. Known simply as ""Mrs. B,"" she strengthened her husband's Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which she eventually handed over to her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, who became the country's second female leader. Bandaranaike's was a political family, like many that followed her. Indira Gandhi, for example, was the daughter of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. The same goes for South Asia's other female heads of state: Benazir Bhutto was the daughter of a previous prime minister of Pakistan, and the two women who have led Bangladesh in alternating terms since 1991 are the wife of a previous prime minster and the daughter of the country's first prime minister. But in Europe and South America in particular, women began rising to the top positions of power through the 1980s and 1990s, without necessarily being part of political dynasties. Thirteen European nations have elected a woman to lead, and two of the continent's most powerful leaders today are women: Angela Merkel of Germany and Theresa May of the United Kingdom. Women have led countries that are majority Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Jewish, on each of the six continents with countries on them. Women are slowly gaining better representation in legislatures, too. As of this summer, 22.8 percent were women, about twice as many as 20 years ago. But why hasn't the United States had a female president? There may be as many theories as there are reasons, one of which may be that it is harder to achieve something without precedent. This map just asks that American girls and women look beyond their country's borders, for the time being.  Here is a list of the 49 countries that have or have had a women lead them: Current: Bangladesh Chile Croatia Estonia Germany Liberia Lithuania Malta Marshall Islands Mauritius Norway South Korea Taiwan United Kingdom Myanmar Past: Argentina Australia Bosnia and Herzegovina Brazil Canada Central African Republic Costa Rica Denmark Dominica Finland Guyana Iceland India Indonesia Ireland Israel Jamaica Kosovo Kyrgyz Republic Latvia Malawi New Zealand Nicaragua Pakistan Panama Philippines San Marino Sao Tome and Principe Serbia Sri Lanka Switzerland Thailand Turkey Ukraine Read More: These are all of the other political glass ceilings that still haven't been cracked The world is getting better at paid maternity leave.

Liberals are insistent that Clinton's defeat was the result of nominating a candidate who failed to excite the party's base of progressives, African Americans and Hispanics. Establishment voices fret that nominating a liberal to run the party misses the point of an election in which Clinton's loss can be directly traced to her inability to win over white voters in the industrial Midwest. ""The next DNC chair needs to understand what became painfully obvious in the election -- that there are two different Americas and that Democrats are really struggling to bridge the gap between the two,"" said Mo Elleithee, a longtime Democratic operative who runs the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service. ""The fundamental problem is that the party stopped really communicating what it means to be a Democrat.""   [Keith Ellison, Howard Dean offered as possible DNC chairs as Democrats seek to regroup]   No matter which side of that argument you take, what's clear is that there is an unexpected power vacuum within the Democratic Party at the moment. Clinton was considered a shoo-in on Tuesday, meaning that no one thought that the DNC job would be open or that the 2020 Democratic nomination would even be a thing. What that means is that the DNC fight is the first in a series of scrambles among ambitious pols trying to seize the moment in the wake of the shocking end of Clintonism. ""This is suddenly a really important gig as one of the centers of opposition,"" said one longtime Democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly assess the DNC race. ""You can't do it part time, and you shouldn't do it while sitting inside one of the most despised institutions in the country.""    [What's next for Democrats? For starters, a battle for the soul of their party.]   The DNC chair field doesn't look set just yet -- Rep. Xavier Becerra (Calif.) remains a real possibility, for example -- but here's a look at the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates who are either running or leaning that way.  * Ray Buckley: A current vice chair at the DNC, Buckley has said that he is being ""strongly encouraged to run"" for the top job. If he does, Buckley, who serves as the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, would probably cast himself as the only candidate who truly understands the hopes and desires of the 300-plus committee members. Still, a party insider from New Hampshire doesn't seem like the sort of ""change"" candidate many Democrats are clamoring for.  * Howard Dean: Dean was the last full-time chairman of the DNC and oversaw the hugely successful 2006 midterm and 2008 presidential elections. While many party establishment types insisted that those victories came despite Dean and not because of him, it's still a record of success that no other modern DNC chair can claim. In announcing his bid, Dean made clear that he would work to reinstitute his signature ""50-state strategy"" and broaden the party's appeal to young people. Not everyone is a fan of that plan. ""The problem with the '50-state strategy' was it never really was a strategy,"" one senior party professional said. ""It was a marketing slogan.""  * Keith Ellison: The Minnesota congressman is one of the most visible liberals in Congress. And many people within the party believe that Ellison, as a Muslim American and an African American, is exactly the sort of person the party should put forward to counter President Trump. Even before he has formally announced whether he will run, Ellison has won the endorsements of Sens. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.). The knock on Ellison is that he has a day job, making it impossible to focus full time on rebuilding a party infrastructure that badly needs it. ""I absolutely love Keith and think he's great,"" a former DNC senior official said. ""But [we] need a full-time organizational leader who gets the importance of the tyranny of data but who also has the skills to negotiate the intersection of blue-collar fears and urban aspirations.""  * Martin O'Malley: The former Maryland governor and 2016 presidential candidate said Friday that he is taking a ""hard look"" at the chairmanship. If he runs, he's likely to pitch himself as the hybrid that Democrats need: a committed liberal on policy but someone also able to reach working-class, white voters who have walked away from the party in recent elections. Another O'Malley edge: He could do the job full time because, well, he's not doing anything else in politics these days.  * Thomas Perez: The sitting labor secretary was seen by many liberals as the ideal vice-presidential pick for Clinton. She passed. But the same traits that recommended Perez as vice president are also potentially intriguing in a DNC chair: a liberal, Hispanic voice with ties to President Obama. Perez is reportedly interested in the race, but his candidacy is less advanced than the other names on this list.  "

How well they can get along will help determine what gets done over the next four years, and whether the new president's agenda flounders or succeeds. President-elect Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell make up an unlikely alliance, one defined in advance mostly by Trump's opposition to the Washington establishment that Ryan and McConnell exemplify. Trump and Ryan clashed throughout the campaign, with Trump taking offense when Ryan initially refused to endorse him and later distanced himself over the audio of Trump talking about groping women.  ""Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.,"" Trump groused over Twitter last month. But that was then, this is now, as Ryan, the GOP's 2012 vice presidential nominee, said Thursday after meeting with Trump at the Capitol.  ""The past is in the past,"" Ryan said in an interview on Fox News Channel. ""This was an unconventional year, he was an unconventional candidate, but the point is we unified, especially at the right point, at the end. And it worked."" Indeed, thanks partly to Trump's coattails, Ryan and McConnell limited expected losses to their majorities and will enter the new administration with control of both chambers of Congress and the White House. For now the glow of victory appears to be soothing past tensions. And Republicans aligned with all three note they have something very important in common: They need each other.  ""Ryan needs Trump to accomplish his policy agenda,"" said GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, in comments that apply to McConnell as well. ""Trump needs Ryan to get things to his desk."" There are well-known policy disagreements to navigate on issues like trade, immigration, Medicare and Social Security, where Trump's proposals and campaign rhetoric often flew in the face of Ryan and McConnell's standard business-friendly Republican approach. But Trump's own unfamiliarity with the tedious business of legislating, and unformed policy positions in some cases, may give Ryan and McConnell a unique opportunity to fill in the details. That would be a welcome role for both - McConnell as a deeply experienced legislator and dealmaker, and Ryan as an eager wonk who chaired the Ways and Means Committee before becoming House speaker. Ryan is steeped in details on reforming taxes and reshaping entitlement spending -- although Trump has been critical of Ryan's past budget proposals.  ""I don't think there's any question that a President Trump will be looking for legislative expertise,"" said Josh Holmes, McConnell's former chief of staff. ""Some of that comes from the staff that he hires, and some of that will come from allies on Capitol Hill."" Moreover, Ryan's personal political future, including potential presidential ambitions of his own, may depend in part on how effectively he manages the relationship with Trump. The speaker's tepid embrace of Trump during the campaign angered some conservatives in his conference, stirring talk that he could face a challenge to his speakership. But Ryan's enthusiastic response to Trump's victory appears to have diminished any appetite for a leadership coup. The wide majority he will continue to enjoy next year -- with at least 240 Republicans in the 435-member House, compared to 247 now -- also reduces the potential for mischief by a small band of disgruntled conservatives.  ""Victory soothes lots of differences,"" said GOP Rep. Chris Collins of New York, a top Trump backer. ""The mood of us right now is we can't waste any time with recriminations and finger-pointing. My God, we won!"" Unlike Ryan, McConnell was quick to endorse Trump as soon as he clinched the GOP nomination. McConnell never wavered on that, nor provoked Trump's ire over Twitter. At 74, McConnell has reached the long-sought pinnacle of his career as Senate majority leader, and unlike Ryan, 46, has no potential higher ambitions to manage. Just as important, McConnell is known for professional relationships that are all business and have nothing to do with personality. So even though the closed-mouth Kentuckian would seem to have nothing in common with a freewheeling, thrice-married Manhattanite like Trump, allies say that doesn't matter to McConnell. That said, both men could face opposition from members of Trump's inner circle, particularly Stephen Bannon. Bannon was chief executive of the conservative news site Breitbart before assuming a role in Trump's campaign and is under consideration for a senior spot in Trump's White House. Just before Ryan's primary race in July, with Bannon still at the helm of Breitbart, the site called the speaker a hypocrite for building a ""border wall"" around his Janesville, Wisconsin, mansion when he refused to support Trump's southern border wall proposal. Breitbart continued attacking Ryan this fall, publishing a lengthy post titled, ""He's with her: Inside Paul Ryan's months-long campaign to elect Hillary Clinton president."" Breitbart has also slammed McConnell, criticizing him over occasions where he bestowed lukewarm praise on Clinton and criticized Trump's undisciplined campaigning. What position Trump gives Bannon versus Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, a Trump confidante and close Ryan ally, may be a signal as to how the incoming president plans to collaborate, or not, with the congressional leadership. ___ Associated Press writers Julie Bykowicz and Alan Fram contributed to this report.
