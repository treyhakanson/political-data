There are 41 days left in the year. Today's Highlight in History: On Nov. 20, 1789, New Jersey became the first state to ratify the Bill of Rights. On this date: In 1620, Peregrine White was born aboard the Mayflower in Massachusetts Bay; he was the first child born of English parents in present-day New England. In 1910, the Mexican Revolution of 1910 had its beginnings under the Plan of San Luis Potosi issued by Francisco I. Madero. In 1925, Robert F. Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts. In 1945, 22 former Nazi officials went on trial before an international war crimes tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany. (Almost a year later, the International Military Tribune sentenced 12 of the defendants to death; seven received prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life; three were acquitted.) In 1947, Britain's future queen, Princess Elizabeth, married Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh, at Westminster Abbey. In 1959, the United Nations issued its Declaration of the Rights of the Child. In 1966, the musical play ""Cabaret,"" set in pre-Nazi Germany, opened on Broadway with Jill Haworth as Sally Bowles and Joel Grey as the Master of Ceremonies. In 1969, the Nixon administration announced a halt to residential use of the pesticide DDT as part of a total phaseout. A group of American Indian activists began a 19-month occupation of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. In 1975, after nearly four decades of absolute rule, Spain's Generalissimo Francisco Franco died, two weeks before his 83rd birthday. In 1976, the boxing drama ""Rocky,"" a United Artists release starring Sylvester Stallone as a journeyman fighter who's given the chance to face the heavyweight champion, premiered in New York. In 1985, the first version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, Windows 1.0, was officially released. In 1992, fire seriously damaged Windsor Castle. Ten years ago: After a firestorm of criticism, News Corp. said it had canceled the O.J. Simpson book and TV special ""If I Did It,"" in which Simpson was to speak hypothetically about how he would have committed the 1994 slayings of his ex-wife Nicole and her friend, Ronald Goldman. (A federal bankruptcy judge later awarded the rights to Simpson's book to Goldman's family, who had it published under the title, ""If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer."") Six imams were removed from a US Airways flight at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport after passengers reported they were acting suspiciously. (The imams, charging discrimination, later settled with the airline.) Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies was voted the National League's MVP. Movie director Robert Altman died in Los Angeles at age 81. Five years ago: Spain's opposition conservatives were swept into power as voters dumped the Socialists -- the third time in as many weeks Europe's debt crisis had claimed a government. Tony Stewart held off Carl Edwards to win his third NASCAR championship in the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Landon Donovan scored in the 72nd minute on passes from Robbie Keane and David Beckham, and the Los Angeles Galaxy's three superstars won their first MLS Cup together with a 1-0 victory over the Houston Dynamo. The Americans won the Presidents Cup as a team, 19-15, in Melbourne, Australia. One year ago: Islamic extremists shot up a luxury hotel in Mali's capital that was frequented by diplomats and businessmen, killing 20 people in an attack blamed on Islamic extremists. A week after the deadliest attacks on France in decades, shell-shocked Parisians honored the 130 victims with candles and songs. Jonathan Pollard, a former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst, was released from prison after 30 years behind bars for spying for Israel. Actor Keith Michell, remembered for his portrayals of England's King Henry VIII, died in London at age 88. Today's Birthdays: Actress-comedian Kaye Ballard is 91. Actress Estelle Parsons is 89.

While I wasn't necessarily planning on inviting her, there is always enough food, so I explained that if she'd like to come there's room at the table. Now she's telling everyone in the family that I ""begged'' for her to come, but this just simply isn't true. My husband's relationship with her is already strained due to her overly dramatic style. Do I address this with her or leave it? I'm at an absolute loss.  About how to tell your mother-in-law, and maybe everyone else, that while you are tolerating her presence, you wouldn't dream of begging her to attend? Happy Thanksgiving to you, too. Miss Manners fails to understand what harm it does for the lady to tell the family that you welcome her. She would even suggest that you do beg her. As she is going to show up anyway, you have nothing to lose, and perhaps a pleasanter Thanksgiving to gain.  Dear Miss Manners: I am not a very big fan of most wines, but I do enjoy port. When I go out to eat, is it appropriate to order a dessert wine like port or sherry during the main course? Also, if it is all right to drink port with dinner, how do I politely explain to the waiter that I know what I am ordering? I've had two waiters tell me that I should select something else for dinner, even though I was quite certain of what I wanted.  ""All right'' with whom?  Granted, these are not the conventional choices to drink with dinner. But you go to a restaurant to buy a meal. Surely you should choose a meal that you will enjoy. Miss Manners is not going to discourage you from doing that, nor do those waiters mean to do so. You need only thank them for their offer of advice and repeat that what you have selected is what you prefer.  Dear Miss Manners: For many years I would host Thanksgiving and Easter dinners in my home. People would ask if they could bring anything, and I always said no because I feel that if you invite people to your home, the host puts on the dinner. My nephew hosts Thanksgiving now, and he has asked me what I'm bringing. I don't mind bringing a dish to pass, but feel I should offer. My niece feels that to accept an invitation without bringing a dish to pass is rude. Have I missed something?  You have missed the current notion that every meal is a cooperative venture and that bringing a dish cancels the need to reciprocate. Miss Manners keeps trying to bat down this trend in favor of true hospitality, but so far with little success. There is, however, historical precedent, as well as modern custom, for Thanksgiving's being a joint endeavor. So while you should have a say in what you bring while acknowledging the chief planner's need to balance the menu, this is not the best holiday to be annoyed at the request.

They were separated from the rest of his motorcade after he attended a dinner for world leaders attending an Asia-Pacific summit. Three vans carrying a TV crew, still photographers and wire service and other reporters were became separated Saturday as Obama departed the gala dinner at Parque de la Reserva. The vans managed to catch up to the motorcade as Obama arrived at his hotel. Confusion apparently set in at the dinner venue as multiple motorcades were trying to leave at the same time. Obama is in Peru to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum. It's the third and final stop on his last overseas trip as president. Obama has a full schedule of meetings plus a news conference on Sunday before he heads back to Washington. ___ 5:30 p.m. Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) says he hopes there is a smooth transition to the next U.S. president and that he hopes the relationship between the United States and China will continue to grow. Xi is meeting with President Barack Obama during an Asia-Pacific economic summit. The two leaders spoke to reporters briefly before their meeting. Xi says the two are meeting at a ""hinge moment"" in the U.S.-China relationship. He says he hopes the two nations will focus on cooperation and managing their differences. Obama says the two nations have played a pivotal role in addressing climate change. He also says the two leaders are united in their opposition to North Korea's provocations, and they will intensify efforts to de-nuclearize the Korean Peninsula. Obama says he also expects a candid conversation on areas where the two leaders differ. ___ 4:45 p.m. President Barack Obama is praising Peru for its success in dramatically reducing poverty in recent years. So says the White House in a statement. The White House says Obama acknowledged the progress in a meeting with President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru. Peru is the host of an Asia-Pacific summit that Obama is attending. The White House says Obama and Kuczynski also affirmed commitments made by the two nations under a 2009 trade pact. In particular, they discussed steps Peru is taking to combat illegal logging. Peru is home to the second largest chunk of the Amazon rainforest after Brazil and a major focus of the fight against illegal logging. Under the terms of the U.S.-Peru free trade agreement, regulators have more tools to bring accountability to a timber industry whose exports are overwhelmingly illegal. ___ 4:20 p.m. The White House says President Barack Obama is urging world leaders to continue their work to advance a 12-nation trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Obama has failed in his efforts to get Congress to approve the agreement before he leaves office. President-elect Donald Trump made opposition to the pact a centerpiece of his campaign. As part of his final foreign trip, the president met with leaders of the 11 other nations participating in the TPP effort. The White House says Obama urged his counterparts to ensure that trade agreements work to reduce inequality. Obama is holding out hope that Trump will warm to trade deals once he's in office. Obama says TPP will level the playing field for American workers and advance America's interests in an economically dynamic and growing region. ___ 3 p.m. President Barack Obama is citing Chile, Peru and Columbia as examples of nations that are growing faster and doing better economically because of a new level of freedom and openness. Obama is speaking to about 1,000 young adults at a town hall-style gathering in Peru during the final foreign trip of his presidency. Obama was asked by one man from Venezuela about how to create a world that doesn't have to choose between peace and democracy. Obama says the evidence of recent decades suggests that countries that silence their critics go backward economically because they hide mistakes rather than solve them. He says countries with repressive governments ""rot from within."" Meanwhile, he says, freedom allows people to start businesses and organizations designed to improve society. ___ 2:50 p.m. President Barack Obama is trying to ease concerns in Latin America that his successor will stomp on trade deals. As he's done at many turns in his final trip abroad as president, Obama is asking foreigners to give Donald Trump a chance and not to assume he will upend U.S. policy. He told people at a town hall-style meeting in Peru on Saturday that there are likely to be new tensions over trade, given Trump's stance against the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other deals liberalizing commerce across borders. But he predicts that once Trump looks closely at trade in office, he'll see the benefits more than he does now. Obama says there could well be some modifications to trade deals. But he says he does not anticipate major change on U.S. policy on Latin America. ___ 1 p.m. President Barack Obama is emphasizing opportunities to create jobs as he meets with leaders of countries involved in a sweeping trade deal that is now in jeopardy. Obama is meeting in Peru with leaders from 11 countries that joined the U.S. to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The agreement appears unlikely to be ratified due to opposition by President-elect Donald Trump. Obama says the meeting is a good chance to talk about expanding prosperity. He didn't elaborate or discuss prospects for ratifying the deal as reporters were allowed in briefly for part of the meeting. Obama supports trade deals as a way to boost U.S. exports and create American jobs. But Trump criticized the Pacific agreement during the presidential campaign, saying such agreements hurt American workers. Democratic rival Hilary Clinton said she was against it, too. ___ 11:30 a.m. The White House is demanding an immediate halt to Syrian strikes on eastern Aleppo after the opposition's Aleppo Health Directorate said the bombings have put all hospitals there out of service. White House national security adviser Susan Rice says the U.S. is tracking those reports about health conditions. She says the U.S. condemns ""horrific attacks"" against hospitals and aid workers ""in the strongest possible terms. Rice says there's ""no excuse"" for the attacks. The White House is putting the onus on Russia to lower the violence and help humanitarian aid get to besieged Syrians. The White House says President Barack Obama joins other leaders in Europe and those gathering for an Asia economic summit in Peru over the weekend in demanding a halt to bombings. ___ 11:15 a.m. President Barack Obama is meeting with Peru's president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. The two leaders are sitting down on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific economic summit in Lima. They exchanged pleasantries but made no substantive remarks as reporters were allowed in briefly to witness the start of their meeting. Their meeting comes as leaders in Latin America are anxious about the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. He's vowed to take a hard line on immigration and his early selections for top advisers and Cabinet officials have reflected that expected approach. Obama plans to take questions from young leaders later Saturday in Lima. ___ 11 a.m. President Barack Obama will close a three-nation, post-U.S. election tour the same way he opened it. He wants to reassure world leaders that U.S. democracy isn't broken and everything will be fine when Donald Trump succeeds him next year. Obama is in Lima, Peru, at an annual Asia-Pacific summit. Global concerns about Trump's pending ascension to the world's most powerful office after a surprise win will be a key topic of discussion. The Trump issue overshadowed the president's interactions with world leaders earlier this week in Athens, Greece, and Berlin. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Formula One organizers and political officials say that the continuation of the race at the Interlagos track needs greater financing at a time when Brazil is cutting expenses amid a severe economy crisis. The Brazilian Grand Prix will run a deficit of around $4 million for just this year, according to race organizer Tamas Rohonyi, but the total figure for next year could be significantly worse -- perhaps up to $10 million -- because of the absence of key sponsors.  ""If we can't bring sponsors back, then Formula One management would have to cover that gap,"" Rohonyi told reporters shortly before Sunday's race, which was won by Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton. ""That is why Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone is worried."" Organizers and local officials have said that a Wednesday meeting in Sao Paulo will be important to determining the future of the race in Brazil. Ecclestone suggested earlier this year that three races were at risk for 2017: Brazil, Germany and Canada. At the time, Brazilian organizers answered that uncertainty by saying the event is under contract until 2020. Two companies, Shell and state-run oil giant Petrobras, declined to renew key sponsorships ahead of this season's race. Petrobras has needed to cut expenses in the wake of a growing corruption scandal and has also pushed away from its sponsorship deal with the Williams team, which saw Brazilian driver Felipe Massa run the last home Grand Prix of his F1 career. Ecclestone met with President Michel Temer, who took office after Dilma Rousseff was impeached in May, for the first time earlier this week. Neither side offered details of the conversation, but Temer has direct power over Petrobras and other state-run companies that have made large investments in sports in recent years. Brazil's economy, which fell 4 percent in 2015, is expected to dip another 3 percent this year, though economists are predicting a mild recovery in 2017. The loss of sponsorships isn't the only risk to the traditional race in Sao Paulo, which has been on the calendar since 1973. Sao Paulo's Mayor-Elect Joao Doria, who introduces himself as a manager first and politician second, has pledged to privatize the entire Interlagos compound. Current Mayor Fernando Haddad said his administration is eager to complete ongoing renovations at the facilities, which began in 2015 and were reported to cost $60 million, ""but it is better that we discuss that with the new mayor this week because it might not be worth to invest more here."" Still, Haddad believes a solution will be found.  ""When I took over in 2013, no one expected this infrastructure that we built at Interlagos,"" he told reporters on Sunday. ""Even with the economy crisis, we managed to do almost all of it.  ""Formula One is a good investment. It brings revenues of about $60 million in only one weekend and it makes Sao Paulo known abroad. I hope it stays."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Nevada Democrat said in a statement that ""If Trump wants to roll back the tide of hate he unleashed, he has a tremendous amount of work to do and he must begin immediately."" Reid said white nationalists, Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Islamic State extremist group are celebrating Trump's election, ""while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear."" That ""does not feel like America,"" Reid said. Absent from the statement was any note of conciliation or a congratulatory olive branch. The 76-year-old Reid is retiring at the end of this year after five terms, so unlike other congressional Democrats he has no imperative to try to make nice with Trump. That position allows him to give voice to bolder sentiments than other Democratic leaders who may need to try to work with Trump. Reid's replacement, New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, has had little to say about Trump so far, but he did congratulate him in a phone call and a brief statement. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi also offered congratulations and the prospect of working together on an infrastructure and jobs bill. For Democratic leaders who have spent months campaigning for Democrat Hillary Clinton and against Trump, his election now presents a challenge on several levels, including whether or how to try to reach out to him. Reid doesn't have to deal with such considerations and instead on Friday aimed harsh parting shots at Trump, whom he'd spent months denouncing on the Senate floor.  ""Winning the electoral college does not absolve Trump of the grave sins he committed against millions of Americans,"" Reid said. ""Donald Trump may not possess the capacity to assuage those fears, but he owes it to this nation to try."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

""He just earned a mandate,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin declared of Trump. ""We are going to hit the ground running."" Said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky: ""We would like to see the country go in a different direction and intend to work with him to change the course for America."" Republicans saw their majorities in the House and Senate reduced, but not by much, as Democrats' hopes of retaking Senate control vanished. And though Ryan and McConnell both had well-publicized reservations about Trump, both were quick to declare that the newly elected president deserved the credit.  ""Donald Trump pulled off an amazing political feat. He deserves tremendous credit for that,"" said Ryan, who initially refused to endorse Trump and only last month declared he'd no longer defend him. ""It helped us keep our majorities, but it also showed the country that people don't like the direction we were going."" First up would be repealing President Barack Obama's health care law, something Republicans have already shown they can get through Congress with just a narrow Senate majority. What they haven't done is unite around a plan for ensuring that the 20 million who achieved health care coverage under the landmark law don't lose it. Republicans also celebrated the opportunity to fill the existing Supreme Court vacancy, and potentially more to come, with ""constitutional conservatives."" McConnell was being widely praised for his strategy, once seen as risky, of refusing to act on Obama's nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last February. And Republicans pledged to try to unwind any number of executive moves by Obama, including tougher clean air rules on power plants, looser restrictions on travel to Cuba, and tougher rules on sleep for long-haul truckers, among others -- ""Every single one that's sucking the very life out of our economy,"" GOP Sen. David Perdue of Georgia said in an interview. That threatened to wipe away key areas of progress highlighted by Democrats under the Obama administration. Some of Trump's goals could be harder to achieve. A wall on the southern border is estimated to cost $10 billion to $20 billion, money that Congress may be unlikely to provide given that cooperation from Democrats would be necessary. Indeed the Senate Democratic minority stood as the only legislative barrier to Trump's goals, since 60 votes are required for most consequential moves in the Senate. Republicans were poised to end up with 52 Senate seats after Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., conceded to Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan in their close race. That assumes the GOP wins a December runoff in Louisiana, as expected. Democrats managed to pick up only one other GOP-held Senate seat, in Illinois, a devastating outcome for a party that went into Election Day with high hopes of holding the White House and winning back Senate control. In the House, Republicans were on track to lose a maximum of nine seats, an unexpectedly modest reduction to a wide GOP majority that now stands at 247-188, including three vacant seats.  ""We kicked their tails last night,"" said GOP Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, head of the Republicans' House campaign committee. Trump's extraordinary win appeared to be going far to heal divisions within the GOP, as even Republicans who'd long harbored doubts about him offered warm pledges of support. Here and there, notes of caution were sounded, as a few Republicans made clear that Congress would be asserting its constitutional prerogatives as a check and balance on the executive, following what Republicans viewed as overly expansive use of executive power by Obama.  ""It's just our constitutional duty to keep the executive branch in check,"" GOP Rep. Todd Young, the newly elected Republican senator in Indiana, told reporters in Indianapolis. Yet McConnell appeared to invite executive action by Trump, suggesting he should be exploring what kinds of ""unilateral action"" he could take -- to undo unilateral actions by Obama. ___ Associated Press writers Brian Slodysko in Indianapolis and Matthew Daly and Andrew Taylor in Washington contributed to this report.

An unexpected guest will be there, too. The visit by the reigning NBA champions will coincide with President-elect Donald Trump's meeting with President Barack Obama to discuss the handover of power and transition following a shocking election that left James -- and millions of Americans -- wondering about the future. Gov. John Kasich, a onetime Republican presidential rival who refused to endorse Trump and boycotted the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, also was to visit the White House on Thursday. James had supported Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, appearing on stage with the former secretary of state at a campaign rally Sunday to urge Cleveland residents to vote. On Wednesday, just hours after Clinton had conceded the election to Trump, James posted on his Instagram account that he woke up ""looking and searching for answers on what has happened."" He posted the audio to ""Alright,"" a song by rapper Kendrick Lamar. James wrote: ""Parents and leaders of our children please let them know they can still change the world for the better! Don't lose a bit of faith! They're our future and we must remain stronger than ever!! Yes we all wanna lace up the boots, put on the hard hats and strike but that's not the answer. Love, genuine LOVE and FAITH will be the only thing that can get us through this."" The Cavs' trip to Washington has been planned for weeks. Coach Tyronn Lue, who received a phone call in June from Obama shortly after Cleveland rallied to beat Golden State in the NBA Finals, wanted the visit to happen before the first African-American president left office. Cleveland plays at Washington on Friday night. James has openly expressed his views on numerous political issues in recent years. Following Trump's election, the three-time champion and father of three said he felt the need to offer encouragement to minorities and women.  ""Please know that this isn't the end, it's just a very challenging obstacle that we will overcome!!"" he said. ""... To all the youth out there I PROMISE I'll continue to lead u guys every single day without no hesitation!! Time to educate and even more mold my children into being the greatest model citizens they can become in life!"" James wasn't the only Cavaliers player to express his feelings. J.R. Smith, who also attended Clinton's rally in Cleveland, posted a photo of his daughter standing outside the White House.  ""How do I even feel confident sending her on play dates knowing the kids family voted for the racist, sexist person an I don't know how they will treat her when she's gone,"" Smith said. ""How? Seriously How?"" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. "

Gov. Terry McAuliffe waits to vote for Clinton	"  RICHMOND -- Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, one of Hillary Clinton's closest friends and biggest boosters, cast his ballot for her at 8:20 a.m. after waiting in line for an hour at Richmond City Library. ""Yeah, it was an hour wait, but the greatest hour of my life,"" McAuliffe (D) said. ""You think of the history of this election. I believe we're going to elect the first woman in the history of the United States of America. We're going to have the first Virginian on the ticket, Tim Kaine, first time in 100 years. I can give an hour.""  [Tim Kaine casts ballot in Va., ending campaign close to home]  Delivering Virginia for his longtime political ally has been a priority for McAuliffe, but he has mostly played a behind-the-scenes role. While keeping up a busy schedule as governor, he has closely monitored the race through former president Bill Clinton, with whom he speaks almost daily, and Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, who also led McAuliffe's 2013 campaign.

He spent the past weekend trying to fire up campaign volunteers, zipping between canvass kickoffs and phone banks in Richmond and its suburbs, Hampton Roads, Northern Virginia and back again.

She was also at the epicenter of a relentless series of political storms during the Clinton administration, from the deadly raid on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, to the seizure of 5-year-old Cuban immigrant Elian Gonzalez. One of the Clinton administration's most recognizable and polarizing figures, Reno faced criticism early in her tenure for the deadly raid on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, where sect leader David Koresh and some 80 followers perished. Known for deliberating slowly, publicly and in a typically blunt manner, Reno frequently said, ""the buck stops with me,"" borrowing the mantra from President Harry S. Truman. Reno, 78, died early Monday of complications from Parkinson's disease, her goddaughter Gabrielle D'Alemberte told The Associated Press. D'Alemberte said Reno spent her final days at home in Miami surrounded by family and friends, who sang songs and recited poetry at her bedside. Her sister, Maggy Reno Hurchalla, told The Associated Press that former President Bill Clinton called over the weekend said to ""tell Janet I love her"" and that many others from her career visited or called, including former Florida governor and Sen. Bob Graham.  ""When I tucked her in at night, I said 'I love you,'"" Hurchalla said. ""She looked like she was asleep and raised one eyebrow and said, 'I love you too very much.' She was surrounded this weekend by people who love her."" After Waco, Reno figured into some of the controversies and scandals that marked the Clinton administration, including Whitewater, Filegate, bungling at the FBI laboratory, Monica Lewinsky, alleged Chinese nuclear spying and questionable campaign financing in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election. In the spring of 2000, Reno enraged her hometown's Cuban-American community when she authorized the armed seizure of young Elian. The boy was taken from the Little Havana home of his Miami relatives so he could be returned to his father in Cuba. During her tenure, the Justice Department prosecuted the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case, captured the ""Unabomber"" Theodore Kaczynski that same year and investigated the 1993 terrorist attack on New York's World Trade Center. The department also filed a major antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp. and Reno was a strong advocate for protecting abortion clinics from violence. President Barack Obama called her ""an American original"" in a White House statement.  ""When Janet Reno arrived in Washington in 1993, the city had never seen anyone like her before -- and hasn't since,"" Obama said. ""Her legacy lives on in a generation of lawyers she inspired, the ordinary lives she touched, and a nation that is more just."" Attorney General Loretta Lynch praised Reno's integrity and status as a female trailblazer, calling Reno in a statement ""one of the most effective, decisive and well-respected leaders"" in Justice Department history. Reno, added Lynch, approached challenges ""guided by one simple test: to do what the law and the facts required. She accepted the results of that test regardless of which way the political winds were blowing."" Miami U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer, who worked for Reno in Washington from 1995-2000, recalled her compassion for the nation's dispossessed, her warm relationship with employees and her practical approach to problems.  ""Even if you agreed or disagreed with her, you knew she was coming from a place of integrity,"" Ferrer said in an interview. """"Through her work, through her decisions, she exhibited a lot of strength and a lot of courage. And that is also inspiring."" After leaving Washington, Reno returned to Florida to run for governor in 2002 but lost in a Democratic primary marred by voting problems. The campaign ended a public career that started amid humble beginnings. Born July 21, 1938, Janet Wood Reno was the daughter of two newspaper reporters and the eldest of four siblings. She grew up on the edge of the Everglades in a cypress and brick homestead built by her mother and returned there after leaving Washington. Her late brother Robert Reno was a longtime columnist for Newsday on Long Island. After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in chemistry, Reno became one of 16 women in Harvard Law School's Class of 1963. Reno, who stood over 6 feet tall, later said she wanted to become a lawyer ""because I didn't want people to tell me what to do."" In 1993, Clinton tapped her to become the first woman to lead the Justice Department after his first two choices -- also women -- were withdrawn because both had hired illegal immigrants as nannies. Reno was 54.  ""It's an extraordinary experience, and I hope I do the women of America proud,"" Reno said after she won confirmation. Clinton said the vote might be ""the only vote I carry 98-0 this year."" A little more than a month after taking office, however, Reno became embroiled in controversy with the raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco. The standoff had started even before Reno was confirmed as attorney general. On Feb. 28, 1993, agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms made a surprise raid on the compound, trying to execute a search warrant. But during the raid gunfire erupted, killing four agents and six members of the religious sect. That led to a 51-day standoff, ending April 19, 1993, when the complex caught fire and burned to the ground. The government claimed the Davidians committed suicide, shooting themselves and setting the fire. Survivors said the blaze was started by tear gas rounds fired into the compound by government tanks, and that agents shot at some who tried to flee. Reno had authorized the use of the tear gas to end the standoff and later called the day the worst of her life.  ""It was a dangerous situation,"" Reno said of the incident during a 2005 lecture at Duke University. ""The tragedy is that we will never know what was the right thing to do."" Things got no easier after Waco. In 1995 Reno was diagnosed with Parkinson's after noticing a trembling in her left hand. She said from the beginning that the diagnosis, which she announced during a weekly news conference, would not impair her job performance. And critics -- both Republicans and Democrats -- did not give her a pass because of it. Republicans argued she should have sought appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of Clinton-Gore fundraising violations. Democrats, meanwhile, grumbled that she failed to act as a team player. In early 2000, Reno tried to negotiate the return to Cuba of young Elian, who had been rescued after his mother and others had drowned trying to boat from Cuba to Florida. He had been placed in the care of a Miami uncle, but his father, who lived in Cuba, wanted him returned to the island. When Reno decided talks had broken down that April, she ordered an early morning raid by federal agents who seized the boy, provoking the ire of Miami's Cuban-American community. Reno insisted that Elian should be with his father -- she even kept a snapshot of a smiling Elian in his father's arms near her home computer. Reno said later that federal officials tried up until the last minute to negotiate a voluntary handover and avoid the raid -- where Elian was found hiding in a closet and confronted by an agent with a gun.  ""We have been to great lengths to resolve this case in the least disruptive manner possible,"" she said at a news conference following the raid. As attorney general, Reno often was teased by late night talk show hosts for her unassuming appearance and no-nonsense attitude. Comedian Will Ferrell memorialized her in a recurring ""Saturday Night Live"" skit called ""Janet Reno's Dance Party"" and Reno visited the skit the night she left the Justice Department in January 2001. Reno began her career in Miami in the mid-1960s and had her first encounter with the ""glass ceiling,"" getting passed over for a job at a law firm because she was a woman. She later made partner. In 1972, she lost a race for a Miami-area legislative seat but learned the importance of sticking to her principles from mentor John Orr, a former state lawmaker.  ""Don't equivocate, don't pussyfoot, don't talk out of both sides of your mouth and you'll wake up the next morning feeling good about yourself,"" he told Reno. It became one of her favorite sayings. After losing that election, Reno was hired by the Dade State Attorney's office, where she established herself as an organized and competent lawyer. In 1978, when State Attorney Richard Gerstein decided to step down, Reno was named his successor. As prosecutor, Reno built programs to help reform drug dealers and combat domestic violence. Another program strong-armed deadbeat dads into paying child support, inspiring a rap song named after her. It included the line: ""All the money you get, all the checks you make; Janet Reno will make sure and take."" She also weathered a 1980 riot after an all-white jury acquitted five police officers for the beating death of a black insurance salesman. Eighteen people were killed in the rioting and crowds chanted Reno's name, accusing her of being a racist and demanding her resignation. Reno refused.  ""To resign was to give into anarchy,"" she said. Reno eventually won the support of the city's black community, attending countless community meetings, church services and parades. Her last foray into politics was the race for Florida governor. Known for being down-to-earth -- her home number was listed in a city directory both before and after Washington -- and even folksy, she crisscrossed the state to campaign in a red Ford Ranger pickup truck. But Reno lost the primary to Tampa lawyer Bill McBride despite her name recognition. Republican Gov. Jeb Bush defeated McBride to win a second term. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who also worked for Reno at main Justice in the 1990s, marveled at the twists and turns in her journey.  ""Hers was a great and uniquely American life and was well lived,"" Holder said in a statement. ""All who truly knew Janet loved her and all in this nation were made better by her service and by her sacrifice. I will miss her."" After retiring from politics she served on the boards or as an adviser to several organizations. In 2004 she joined the board of the New York-based Innocence Project, which works to free prisoners who can be proven innocent through DNA testing. She also spent more time with her family. Reno never married but remained extremely close to her tight-knit family. Asked to describe her legacy after ending her gubernatorial campaign, Reno quoted George Washington: ""If I were to write all that down I might be reduced to tears. I would prefer to drift on down the stream of life and let history make the judgment."" ___ Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Jessica Gresko in Washington and AP video journalist Joshua Replogle in Miami contributed to this report.
