(Courtesy of Oracle)  President-elect Donald Trump is meeting with one of the technology industry's most prominent executives Thursday: Safra Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle. It is not clear why Trump wants to meet with Catz. Oracle confirmed the meeting, but declined to comment on what it will be about. Catz has an impressive resume. She has been co-CEO at Oracle since 2014, when she took over from the firm's larger-than-life chief executive Larry Ellison, along with Mark Hurd. She was Ellison's longtime deputy -- nicknamed his ""enforcer"" -- and has been with the company since 1999. In her career at Oracle, Catz has overseen some of the company's largest acquisitions, including its $4.7 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems. Before that, she was an investment banker at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Catz also recently earned the distinction of being the country's highest-paid female executive, with a salary of $57 million, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. Catz has donated money to politicians from both major political parties. During the Republican presidential primary, Fortune reported that she, Ellison and Hurd had all contributed to the campaign of then-candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.).

The names of those pardoned by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi were compiled by a committee he set up to examine the cases of young detainees who had not been involved in violence. Members of the committee have said active members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group would not be pardoned. The military overthrew President Mohammed Morsi, who hailed from the Brotherhood, in 2013. El-Sissi, who led his ouster, was elected the following year. Authorities have detained thousands of people in the last three years, mostly Islamists but also prominent secular activists. The government has not said how many detainees are being held, but rights groups estimate the number at between 20,000 and 40,000. Those released Thursday included more than 30 students, five of them aged 18 and 19. The 82 also included 21-year-old news photographer Mohammed Ali Salah Mohammed. A second batch of detainees are expected to be pardoned before the end of the year. The government maintains that there are no political detainees in Egypt, arguing that everyone in detention is being accorded due process. Rights activists say a large number of detainees are being held, sometimes for as long as two years, without charge or trial. Among those released Thursday was Islam Behery, who was convicted and sentenced to one year in prison in March. Behery had used his television program to air calls for the removal of what he described as ""extremist material"" in texts of religious interpretation and heritage. He was also a vocal advocate for religious reforms and argued that some texts by historic Islamic scholars -- including ones upheld and revered by Al-Azhar, the pre-eminent seat of Sunni scholarship -- contain passages that promote extremism. His incarceration has been cited by critics as an example of the government's crackdown on freedom of expression, as well as the conservative discourse of Al-Azhar and its reluctance to modernize. The decision to create the committee was taken during a youth conference attended by el-Sissi last month after a handful of speakers raised the question of young people arrested for participating in peaceful protests, opposing the government or simply being at the wrong place at the wrong time. In September 2015, el-Sissi pardoned two Al-Jazeera English journalists, ending a case that was widely condemned by human rights groups. On the same day he pardoned about 100 people, including dozens of human rights activists, most of whom were convicted and imprisoned for breaking a 2013 law that prohibits unauthorized protests. Some of the best-known activists behind the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak have also been jailed. None were among those released Thursday or last year.

So it stands to reason that whoever plays a pivotal role in blocking President Trump would be Republican, too. In some cases, all it will take is a few Republicans in Congress to derail his agenda, especially when it comes to the Senate approving his appointees in the critical first few days of his presidency. Scroll down to the bottom for the math*, but basically Democrats would need to win over just three Republicans to block Trump's appointees. There are at least eight Senate Republicans who ditched Trump during the primaries. Ten days after Trump's election, the cracks are already starting to show between Trump and key congressional Republicans on Trump priorities like immigration, term limits and some of the president-elect's top advisers. Here's a list of six Republicans poised to make Trump's life very difficult, should they choose: 1. Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.)    (Patrick Fallon/Bloomberg)  Why he could make Trump's life difficult: Paul, who ran for president himself, is one of the Senate's most prominent non-interventionists. In other words, he and other libertarian-leaning politicians want to steer clear of most international conflicts, which is generally in line with the foreign policy views Trump espoused on the trail. But then word floated that Trump was considering one of the most hawkish hawks in foreign policy, John Bolton (a Bush administration ambassador to the United Nations), to be secretary of state. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani's name is also being floated for the job. Paul isn't a fan of either man. What he's said: ""I can't support anybody to be our secretary of state who didn't learn the lesson of the Iraq War,"" he told Reason Magazine. ""I'll do whatever it takes to stop someone like John Bolton being secretary of state,"" he told Politico. ""Will Donald Trump betray voters by hiring John Bolton?"" he asked in an op-ed. But: Paul also told Politico he's more inclined to ""start a conversation"" than actually try to block any of these nominees. 2. Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.)    (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)  Why he could make Trump's life difficult: Graham was one of Trump's most vocal GOP critics during the campaign. (Graham also briefly ran against Trump for president.) Graham didn't even vote for Trump. Also, Graham wants to investigate Russia -- specifically, whether it hacked into Democrats' emails during the campaign. His call for an investigation came amid news Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin chatted on the phone after the election and both agreed to improve relations. Trump alarmed Graham and many other foreign policy intellectuals when he declined to criticize Putin during the campaign. Graham -- a hawk and respected defense leader on the Hill -- said he's encouraged by Trump's apparent willingness to boost defense spending. But he also told the Military Times he wouldn't support some of Trump's immigration policies. What he said: ""Clearly me and the Donald have issues, and I will do everything I can to help him because he will be commander in chief in dangerous times,"" he told reporters on Capitol Hill this week. ""I worry about Russia."" But: Graham is trying to play nice with Trump for now.   .@LindseyGrahamSC on @CNN: ""I'm going to push back when I need to push back... but I try to help presidents, including #DonaldTrump."" -- The Post and Courier (@postandcourier) November 17, 2016   3. Sen. John McCain (Ariz.)    (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  Why he could make Trump's life difficult: For pretty much the same reasons Graham could. McCain broke with Trump during the primary and he's someone else who is alarmed by Trump's apparent embrace of Russia. (Coincidence? McCain is also the third senator on our list to have run for president, although McCain didn't run against Trump.) What he said: Here's a statement McCain released Tuesday. It's heavily critical of Trump's initial approach to Russia: ""With the U.S. presidential transition underway, [Russian President] Vladimir Putin has said in recent days that he wants to improve relations with the United States. We should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections."" But: McCain, like Graham, hasn't outlined any specific ways he'd block Trump -- on Russia or anything else. 4. Sen. Susan Collins (Maine)    (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)  Why she could make Trump's life difficult: Collins is one of the most moderate Republicans -- if not one of the only true moderates -- in the Senate. During the campaign, she broke with Trump early on, calling him unsuitable for office in an August op-ed for The Washington Post. On Election Day, she wrote in House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) for president.   [The 5 most brutal lines from Collins's rebuke of Donald Trump]   What she's said: She congratulated Trump on his win and told WABI Channel 5 in Maine she's hopeful that Trump will strike a more conciliatory note as president: ""[S]ome of what Donald Trump said is totally unacceptable, and I was very critical of some of what he said, and I think there is an obligation on him to show that he's leaving that behind."" Collins, who is up for reelection in 2020 (or could run for governor of Maine in 2018), is also under some pressure back home to continue to speak out against Trump. In an editorial Tuesday, the Portland Press-Herald called on her to denounce Trump's choice of former Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon as his top aide: ""We hope Collins, who publicly declared Trump unacceptable during the campaign, will continue to act as a moderating force in a federal government soon to be completely under the control of Republicans."" But: Unlike most of the other candidates on this list, so far Collins hasn't said or done much to indicate she's planning to be a major thorn in Trump's side. 5. Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.)    (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via AP)  Why he could make Trump's life difficult: The freshman senator is the Senate's original #NeverTrump-er. ""I'm as frustrated and saddened as you are about what's happening to our country,"" he wrote in a Facebook post in February. ""But I cannot support Donald Trump."" He voted for Mike Pence for president.   [As the GOP's anti-Trump, Ben Sasse picked a big fight]   What he's said: Honestly, based just on what he's said since the election, Sasse is the least likely senator on this list to make life difficult for Trump. He wrote an op-ed in the Omaha World Herald saying he'll look for places to compromise with Trump, though he encouraged voters to continue to be critics when necessary. But: Sasse also surprised us by criticizing the media Thursday for not looking into ""paid riots"" (not a thing) re the protests going on in cities across the nation against Trump. It was a tweet we would expect to come from the president-elect's account, not the Senate's original Never-Trump-er.   Why don't we have more reporting on paid rioting? Who pays for it?How much?Why?Through what orgs?Who are the ""workers""?Who recruits? -- Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) November 17, 2016   6. Sen. Jeff Flake (Ariz.)    (Andrew Harnik/AP)  Why he could make Trump's life difficult: During the campaign, Flake also earned a reputation as one of Trump's most vocal critics in Congress. ""I don't think that that's our best foot forward at all,"" Flake told reporters this spring. In July, he literally stood up to Trump in a closed-door Capitol Hill meeting with the nominee.   [Why a red-state senator can dis Donald Trump and probably get away with it]   What he's said: Now that Trump is going to be president, Flake is playing nice, too. In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, he declined to criticize Trump's choice of Bannon for a top aide. ""I'm of the mind to give the president a lot of deference when he's putting together his team,"" he said. But: Flake stays on this list because there are several flash points that could pop up between him and Trump: Molly Reynolds with the Brookings Institution pointed out that Flake is particularly opposed to increased federal spending, and Trump's infrastructure plan would cost $500 billion.  *Thanks for reading this far! Here's our math breakdown on why it will take just three senators to block some of Trump's appointments. You only need 50 senators to approve Trump nominations. (That's thanks to Senate Democrats removing the option of a filibuster for most political and judicial appointees. And Vice President-elect Mike Pence (R) can serve as tie-breaker.) Come 2017, there will be 52 Republicans in the Senate and 48 Democrats. (Louisiana's Senate race is outstanding pending a December runoff, but all indications are Republican John Kennedy will win.) So 52 Republican senators - 3 Republican senators + 0 Democratic senators = 49 senators -- in other words, not enough to get a nominee over the line."

Buzbee's appointment is effective Jan. 1. She will oversee a global news operation that includes journalists working in more than 260 locations in 106 countries to deliver text, video and photo coverage.  ""The AP's mission of strong, impartial, fact-based journalism has never been more important,"" Buzbee said. ""My colleagues are the most talented and committed journalists in the world, rededicating themselves to that mission each day. It is a privilege to be a part of this team as we dive into the future."" Buzbee replaces Kathleen Carroll, AP's top editor since 2002, who announced her plans to leave the job earlier this year. Buzbee has led the AP's Washington bureau for the past six years, responsible for guiding coverage of national politics and foreign affairs. She previously spent five years as the AP's Middle East editor, based in Cairo, overseeing coverage of the Iraq war and other stories in one of the globe's most challenging regions for newsgathering.  ""Sally's leadership and extensive history with the AP make her the perfect candidate to take the helm as executive editor,"" said AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt. ""Sally's focused vision will guide our news content in all formats well into the future."" Buzbee, originally from Olathe, Kansas, joined the AP in 1988 as a reporter in Topeka. She moved to San Diego as the news agency's correspondent before relocating to the Washington bureau in 1995. Buzbee reported on education and politics in Washington, and was eventually promoted to assistant chief of bureau, responsible for overseeing coverage of foreign affairs and national security. In 2004, Buzbee was named AP's Middle East editor, in charge of news reporting, staffing and logistics for a region covering 16 countries. In addition to Iraq, she led coverage of the conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah, the Darfur crisis and the growth of terrorist cells in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and elsewhere. In early 2010, she was promoted to deputy managing editor in charge of building out AP's Nerve Center, a hub created at the agency's New York headquarters to work with regional and department leaders around the world to ensure comprehensive coverage. Later that year, she was named chief of the Washington bureau, where she continued efforts to accelerate delivery of news for readers on mobile and social platforms. In Washington, Buzbee oversaw coverage of the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, the White House, Congress, the Pentagon and the bureau's polling and investigative teams.

There he gives U.S. officials information he claims links top Moldovan political leaders and possibly U.S. citizens to a $1 billion heist that gutted the tiny eastern European nation's banking system. Gofman used to be deputy chief of a government anti-money laundering unit in Moldova, a former Soviet republic sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania. He says he was forced out after speaking about people he said were linked to the theft. He's holed up in Washington trying to make the case that Americans should care what happened in a little-known country 5,000 miles away -- and to help it try to recover the missing money. The U.S. government already has interests in the former Soviet republic, Gofman argues. The impoverished country has received $44.9 million in U.S. aid this year, plus a $180 million loan from the International Monetary Fund, which is partially supported by U.S. taxpayers. Moreover, Gofman claims to have evidence that at least one American was involved in the theft. His claims could not be independently verified. Moldova is also important for strategic reasons. The theft has tainted the reputation of the Europe-leaning party that has run Moldova since 2009. Widespread anger kindled support for Igor Dodon, a pro-Russian candidate who won Sunday's presidential runoff election. Gofman said U.S. authorities reached out to him after he sent documents to the FBI and other federal agencies. He talked with U.S. investigators at least twice in the past couple months. The FBI said it could not comment or confirm the existence of an investigation and it's unclear how deeply it is investigating. The 2014 theft from the three banks was devastating for Moldova. The amount stolen was equal to more than 12 percent of the country's gross domestic product that year, according to the Congressional Research Service. The money was funneled out of Moldova and laundered through a complex network of offshore entities.  ""We understood what they (the thieves) were preparing,"" Gofman said recently through an interpreter at The Associated Press office in Washington. ""They were preparing to steal"" the national reserves of Moldova. So far, authorities have accused only a few individuals as having a role in the theft. One is Ilan Shor, a rich Moldovan businessman named in an independent investigative report on the theft conducted by the Kroll company. The report was commissioned by the National Bank of Moldova. Another is Vlad Filat, a former prime minister sentenced in July to nine years on charges of taking bribes and influence trafficking. In addition, businessman Veaceslav Platon was arrested in Ukraine and has been extradited to Moldova to face charges. Gofman says that based on the details he amassed during his work at the money-laundering unit, many more people were involved. His claims are bolstered by former presidential candidate Andrei Nastase, a lawyer and former prosecutor who told AP that he too has met with U.S. investigators, including FBI agents, twice during the past three months. Nastase said he has seen ""evidence that some funds now reside in the U.S. and that some shell companies were created in the U.S."" Among the people that Gofman claims benefited from the theft is Vlad Plahotniuc, a wealthy businessman feared because of his alleged influence over law enforcement and the judiciary. Plahotniuc, who is active in the pro-European party, has repeatedly defended himself, saying he had nothing to do with the theft and had no ties to any of the banks from which the money was stolen. Plahotniuc's name is not mentioned in the Kroll report. Andrian Candu, speaker of the Moldovan parliament, defended the pro-European party, saying it has worked hard since the theft to fight corruption, implement reforms and arrest judges, customs officials and police officers. He said Plahotniuc has had an active role in helping institute reforms. Still, many Moldovans were outraged to see photographs of Plahotniuc meeting in May in Washington with Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland. The State Department said Plahotniuc was part of an official delegation visiting from the country. Gofman decided to leave Moldova after German diplomats advised him to do so in July. ""They even told me to photograph what was in my bags so nobody could put something in them, like drugs."" Gofman said. Within an hour of that meeting, after his children helped him photograph the contents of his luggage, he took off unnoticed in a borrowed vehicle. He spent two days in neighboring Romania, where he is a dual citizen, and then flew to the United States. For now, Gofman is a man without a country. He said U.S. investigators advised him not to return to Moldova -- at least not now.  ""I hope that in the end we'll solve this,"" said Gofman, whose wife and three children remain in Moldova. ""I'm not going to spend my whole life going from country to country."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

""We will not accept proposals to roll back civil rights ... not on our watch,"" Wade Henderson, president of Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said Monday. Seven of the nation's largest civil rights organizations -- the NAACP, the National Urban League, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National Action Network -- also criticized the appointment of conservative media executive Stephen Bannon as Trump's senior counselor. The selection of Bannon, a favorite of the alt-right and white nationalist movement, concerned many of the groups, which said they would be prepared to organize and mobilize if necessary. ""This is not a good sign if we're talking about the unity of our nation,"" said Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and convener of the Black Women's Roundtable. With black and Hispanic voters, Trump apparently did as well as Republican Mitt Romney when Romney lost to President Barack Obama in 2012, according to exit polls. Trump appeared to have won more than half of white voters, who made up 70 percent of the electorate. Trump has cooled on his campaign rhetoric, seemingly backing off his vow to build a solid wall along the southern U.S. border on Sunday. House Speaker Paul Ryan also has rejected any ""deportation force"" targeting people in the country illegally. But that doesn't mean that other Trump policies, like his admiration of ""stop and frisk,"" or his desire to attempt to ban Muslim immigrants from the United States, aren't still on the agenda, the groups said.  ""I think we're mistaking a change in tone with a change in content,"" said Rev. Al Sharpton, head of the National Action Network. The groups said they would wait to see Trump's actual policies dealing with the inner cities, which the president-elect said he would focus on. There are some areas in which they can work with the Trump administration, but ""these seem to be the exceptions rather than the rule,"" Henderson said. Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., and Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said they would continue to work on voting rights issues under the Trump administration, given they fielded thousands of voting rights complaints -- 30,000 on Election Day alone, according to Clarke -- during last week's elections. Fourteen states had new voting or registration restrictions in place for the 2016 presidential election, raising concerns that minority voters in particular would have a harder time accessing the ballot box.  ""We are not going to stand by as votes continue to be suppressed,"" Ifill said. With Republicans in control of the White House and Congress, the groups refused to say what their plans were for opposing any of Trump's policies. ""We will use all of the tools available to us,"" said Cornell William Brooks, president of the NAACP. The groups also refused to say whether they would seek a meeting with Trump before or after his inauguration. ""Today is not a day to discuss meetings. Today is a day to say as loudly as possibly where we stand,"" said Marc Morial, head of the National Urban League. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Surveys by several polling organizations showed Gen. Rumen Radev, 53, a former non-partisan chief of Bulgarian Air Force, taking about 58 percent of the vote.  ""We accept the will of the people and we congratulate those who have the support of the majority of the voters,"" Borisov said. Tsetska Tsacheva, a 58-year-old lawyer and member of Borisov's center-right party, had about 36 percent. Initial results from the official vote count were expected later on Sunday. The new president will face a possible rise in migrants from neighboring Turkey and growing tensions between Russia and the West. In the first round of voting, Radev surprisingly finished first with 25 percent of the vote, followed by Tsacheva with 22 percent. Bulgaria, which joined the European Union a decade ago, remains the poorest member of the 28-nation bloc. Its 7.2 million people are very much divided in its loyalties. Bulgaria belongs to NATO and the EU, but many Bulgarians still feel a cultural and historical affinity with Russia, and the country's heavily dependence on Russian energy supplies leaves it vulnerable to political pressure by the Kremlin. Borisov, whose party has triumphed in all national elections in the last decade, has said he will resign if Tsacheva loses the runoff, opening the way to an early parliamentary election. Halfway into its four-year term, Borisov's coalition government has managed to restore political stability after months of anti-corruption protests, but its popularity has faded due to the slow pace of reforms to eliminate graft and overhaul the judicial system. A political rookie, Radev has attracted many Bulgarians who are fed up with corrupt politicians. The former NATO fighter pilot who once studied at the U.S. Air War College in Alabama, has pledged to maintain Bulgaria's place in NATO but also says ""being pro-European does not mean being anti-Russian."" Tsacheva, seeking to become Bulgaria's first female president, was expected to continue her party's pro-Europe foreign policy. She has tried to rally other right-wing parties behind her, urging them not to allow ""Bulgaria to return to the dark past"" of being under Russia's thumb. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)  After all that effort and wasted broadband, maybe celebrities aren't worth much to a person trying to be president.  A standing joke during the later months of the 2016 presidential campaign was that it was much easier to count Donald Trump's celebrity supporters (on one hand -- Scott Baio, Stephen Baldwin and . . . who else?) than to tally the vast army of Hillary Clinton's superstar endorsements, from the A-list all the way down. In the hours leading up to Election Day, Clinton made jubilant get-out-the-vote appearances with some of the biggest names in popular culture: Beyonce, Jay Z, Lady Gaga and Bruce Springsteen, among others.  In the President Obama era, that sort of celebrity firepower has been seen as a crucial part of winning the most voters -- and perhaps it still is, seeing as how Clinton did narrowly win the popular vote on Nov. 8 without winning enough states.  For all the people willing to draw a straight line from the president-elect's years spent hosting NBC's hit reality show ""The Apprentice"" and ""Celebrity Apprentice"" to the White House, the fact remains that Trump's celebrity status was always an amorphous and complicated beast, more akin to notoriety than celebrity. In hindsight, celebrity wasn't the essential component to his appeal with voters; celebrity was meaningless in the face of notoriety. The kind of fame that comes with reality TV is indeed powerful, but it's negligible for those of us who tend to connect being famous with being cool. That's why we overlook the ratings for highly rated crime procedurals and dopey sitcoms or the latest sales on bro-country albums.  Some of us develop an expertise in separating plain fame from superstar wattage; over time, it leads to near-blindness. Thus the rush to write about Donald Glover's ""Atlanta"" on FX, with nary a word for Kevin James's ""Kevin Can Wait"" on CBS, which gets four times the viewer ratings.    Donald Trump from his days on ""The Apprentice."" (Ric Francis/AP)  What this election suggests is that celebrities -- those with the most cachet, from Queen Bey all the way down to the snarky-cool comedians who make endless rounds on talk shows where the hosts are friends of friends -- are fun to have around but cannot be relied upon to deliver votes. Their presence, in fact, is cited as a deterrent by those on the right. Their emphatically liberal politics, coated in the rainbow-colored candy shell of diversity, send out only one truly clear signal, and it's precisely the thing that gets under the skin of all those ""mysterious"" voters who rose up and took this election's data experts by surprise.  A raft of celebs at a rally is now just one more example of how the movie, music, fashion and TV industries keep force-feeding an ""elitism"" to lesser Americans. You can only turn your nose up so much at country music, mixed martial arts and Jeff Dunham puppet shows before your audience gets sick of hearing how ""Hamilton"" and ""Lemonade"" are going to permanently alter the culture. You only had to watch the ever-increasing number of late-night shows this year to recognize that the contours of the fun house had formed an echo chamber, with viewers enthusiastically sharing viral video clips that reinforced their own politics and the politics of their like-minded friends. Stevie Wonder came on CBS's ""Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" the night before Election Day to compare the notion of trusting Trump with the presidency to trusting a blind music legend with driving a car.  It was amusing, but it was also an example of just how far and how deeply celebrities had involved themselves in endorsing Clinton. Eight hours before polls opened, what possible difference would it have made to hear Wonder's political metaphors? What use, in the end, were all those viral video sketches and pantsuit formations and get-out-the-vote harangues from your favorite actors, musicians and comedians? Who decided that to be the cool candidate, you had to submit to the bizarre ritual of being interviewed by Zach Galifianakis on one of his ""Between Two Ferns"" videos? If someone is making a montage of awkward missteps and miscalculations by the Clinton campaign, be sure to include the footage of Mary J. Blige ridiculously serenading Clinton during a face-to-face meeting. After the election, of course, it's easy to see that Hollywood was breathing in its own fumes of hubris. Going back as far as Frank Sinatra singing ""High Hopes"" for John F. Kennedy's campaign and continuing with Hollywood's embrace of antiwar and countercultural activism in the late 1960s, celebrity buy-in became a part of the political experience. You only have to look at coverage of the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner over the past two decades to see the glitzy evidence of how Washington and Hollywood forge mutually beneficial uses of publicity. This paved the way for another fairly recent phenomenon: relying on celebrities and performers to affirm one's own political beliefs. Looking for the answers to misogyny in a sketch (or two or three) from ""Inside Amy Schumer"" and then sharing with friends who reaffirm it with likes. Looking to have a depressingly corrupt world explained on ""Last Week Tonight With John Oliver"" and then, once shared enough, considering the problem licked. Looking for the answers to race relations in music videos or the demographics of the ""Saturday Night Live"" cast. Looking for validation by counting the number of TV characters who look like you and share your opinions. And, finally, believing that all of this will somehow coalesce into an undefeatable party of the woke and beautiful, voters who sing along to the hit lyrics and already know the dance moves and have agreed to be part of the flash mob. When polls and primaries challenged their notion of this nirvana-like existence, as Trump grew more successful in his campaign, celebrities started talking about moving to another country. This has become a standard feature of petulant, star-struck politics. Celebrities, as we all know, aren't much fun to be around when they are displeased, and the list of those who've joked, with varying degrees of seriousness, about leaving the United States in the event of a Trump presidency includes Lena Dunham, Cher, Samuel L. Jackson, Chelsea Handler, Miley Cyrus, Ne-Yo, Barbra Streisand and Bryan Cranston -- to name a few. They never quite get around to delivering on the ultimatum. Maybe some celebrities with the means to travel are already gone. What is gone -- along with polling science, punditry and the general idea that anyone can get an accurate read on the whole of this hurt nation -- is the idea that one must be surrounded by celebrities to become the most important American alive. The only fame a president truly ever needs is his (or her) own. "

In the NBA, players such as David West and coaches such as Doc Rivers, Steve Kerr and Stan Van Gundy were outwardly critical, expressing anxiety, uncertainty and fear. In the NFL, Brandon Marshall, Aaron Rodgers and Doug Baldwin sorted out their feelings, while in New England, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady faced questions about their seeming support for Trump. ""The message was loud and clear last night,"" West, a veteran forward for the Golden State Warriors and two-time all-star, said Wednesday (via CSN Bay Area). ""I don't think there's any room to not face the obvious truth: that he speaks for the majority of the people in this nation. His attitudes about black people and Muslim people, about women, about just about whatever group you can name, folks agreed with his position. And you can't deny that because folks voted for him. ""So this whole fairy tale about some post-racial . . . this utopia that Obama supposedly created, it's all bull. That's the bottom line. When you look at what the results say from last night, this nation has not moved a thread in terms of its ideals."" West, 36 and in his 14th season, made headlines recently when he revealed that he has staged a silent national anthem protest for years, standing two feet behind teammates during the song to protest inequalities faced by African Americans.   David West called the election disappointing: ""A lot of the things (Trump) was saying publicly, a majority of this country feels privately"" pic.twitter.com/E65ZQXLUiy -- Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) November 9, 2016   West was disturbed by the election as well as by things Trump said during the campaign. ""The things that he said, the things that he represented, that's the way that the majority of this nation feels,"" West said. ""I think he just emboldened them because he's able to say it publicly. He got the platform. It is kind of unnerving and unsettling. ... The man's 70 years old, so he is who he is. It's just a shame that, throughout the process, a lot of these people were in hiding and waited for the cover of the ballot to represent who they are."" Trump won the electoral college but, with 92 percent of votes counted, was second to Hillary Clinton in the popular vote in an election in which only a little over half of those eligible to vote did so. Rivers, the head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers, seized on the bigger picture -- that people have the power to change the results of the election peacefully. ""Listen, Donald Trump is going to be fine, all right, as president,"" Rivers said (via USA Today). ""That's something I never thought I'd have to say, honestly. But at the end of the day he will be because I just believe America overall works. There's a Congress and a Senate and it's gonna work out. ""But if you don't like it, you have two years from now to change it. Not [to change the] president, but you can change the Congress and you can change the Senate. So if you don't like it, change it. And you change it by either running for office or voting. ... ""Don't get mad; go do something."" Detroit Pistons Coach Stan Van Gundy, on the other hand, was extremely critical of Trump and the election, as was Steve Kerr, the Warriors coach. Van Gundy, who coaches in a state that helped tip the election in Trump's favor, embarked on a tirade Wednesday, saying, ""I don't think anybody can deny this guy is openly and brazenly racist and misogynistic and ethnic-centric."" ""We have just thrown a good part of our population under the bus, and I have problems with thinking that this is where we are as a country,"" he said (via Freep.com), adding that his players were quieter than usual because of ""last night."" The 57-year-old coach noted that he understood that voters had issues with Clinton but that Trump's victory made him ""ashamed of our country."" To Van Gundy, Trump's comments toward women and minorities should have disqualified him from the presidency. ""Certain things in our country should disqualify you. And the fact that millions and millions of Americans don't think that racism and sexism disqualifies you to be our leader, in our country..."" Van Gundy said. ""We presume to tell other countries about human-rights abuses and everything else. We better never do that again, when our leaders talk to China or anybody else about human-rights abuses. ""It's incredible,"" he continued. ""I don't know how you go about it, if you're a person of color today or a Latino. Because white society just said to you, again -- not like we haven't forever -- but again, and emphatically, that 'I don't think you deserve equality. We don't think you deserve respect.' And the same with women. That's what we say today, as a country. We should be ashamed for what we stand for as the United States today."" Kerr, who coaches in a state that broke heavily for Clinton, and Van Gundy work in a league in which the majority of players are African American, like in the NFL. Kerr applauded Van Gundy's comments. ""Maybe we should've seen it coming over the last 10 years. You look at society; you look at what's popular. People are getting paid millions of dollars to go on TV and scream at each other, whether it's in sports or politics or entertainment, and I guess it was only a matter of time before it spilled into politics,"" Kerr said. ""But then all of a sudden you're faced with the reality that the man who's gonna lead you has routinely used racist, misogynist, insulting words.   Steve Kerr -- ""this is my rant"" -- for 2+ minutes on the presidential election: ""Maybe we should've seen this coming"" pic.twitter.com/MJOcSdXxHH -- Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) November 10, 2016   ""That's a tough one. That's a tough one. I wish him well. I hope he's a good president. I have no idea what kind of president he'll be because he hasn't said anything about what he's going to do. We don't know. But it's tough when you want there to be some respect and dignity, and there hasn't been any. And then you walk into a room with your daughter and your wife, who have basically been insulted by his comments, and they're distraught. Then you walk in and see the faces of your players, most of them who have been insulted directly as minorities; it's very shocking. It really is.""   [Raw emotions surface when an NBA player asks what he should tell his daughter]   San Antonio Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich, who made headlines when he defended San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's decision to kneel during the national anthem, has also weighed in on the controversy surrounding the recent shootings of unarmed African American men and has called race in America ""the elephant in the room."" ""It's easier for white people because we haven't lived that experience. It's difficult for many white people to understand the day-to-day feeling that many black people have to deal with,"" Popovich recently told the San Antonio media. ""I didn't talk to my kids about how to act in front of a policeman when you get stopped. I didn't have to do that. All of my black friends have done that. There's something that's wrong about that, and we all know that."" Popovich, a 67-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, explained to ESPN's The Undefeated this week that he credits his social consciousness to growing up in a racially diverse city in Indiana and that he values learning from other cultures. ""There is a big world out there and a whole lot of stuff going on,"" Popovich told the website. ""The more aware people are, the better off. For our team, since we have so many people from so many different areas, it helps us come together when they realize how big the world is."" On Thursday, members of the Cleveland Cavaliers will visit the White House on the same day as Trump's visit, joining President Obama in a championship tradition that will be tested, at least by NBA teams, by Trump's time in office -- unless he turns out to govern differently than he campaigned. As West indicated, NBA players are skeptical. Veteran guard Richard Jefferson sarcastically posted on Snapchat that he feels honored to be part of the ""last team to visit the White House,"" as others have wondered whether players or even entire teams will skip the tradition once Trump is in office. J.R. Smith, who had campaigned for Clinton in Ohio with Cavaliers teammate LeBron James, wondered Wednesday on Instagram what he would say to his young daughters. ""How do you explain to this face what happen? You can be a educated women in your field an[d] not get the job because your a women or cause your black?"" he wrote. ""How do you say 'go try your best' even though it won't be good enough. How do I even feel confident sending her on play dates knowing the kids family voted for the racist, sexist person an I don't know how they will treat her when she's gone. How? Seriously How? I understand let go and let God! But damn!"" Like Smith, New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony was considering what to tell his child. ""I talked to kids today this morning, my family, you can just hear the nervousness,"" Anthony said Wednesday night (via Newsday). ""They are afraid and don't know what to think, and people don't know what to do at this point. I think it is up to us as individuals to kind of take on that responsibility, and everybody has to lead in their own way. We can't rely on a system or one person, and we got to move on from that."" Anthony's son is 9 and he was thinking about how to discuss the election with him. ""It is a conversation that we all are going to have to have with our kids,"" Anthony said. ""What is that conversation? That is the scary part for me, what is that conversation? . . . I am a big believer about worrying about things that you can control and in this situation, we as people have to worry about the things that we can control. We can't control what is going to happen, but it doesn't mean that we have to stop, just because somebody is in a position now that we may not agree with and might not like and we may not want in that position. The work has to start right now. And it is going to be even harder, but we can't stop working.""   Westbrook on the election: pic.twitter.com/hIMgxaccXM -- Brett Dawson (@BDawsonWrites) November 9, 2016   Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook preferred to let others interpret his thoughts. ""I didn't vote for Trump. I'll tell you that much,"" he said. ""That's all I'm gonna say."" James, the vocal Clinton supporter and face of the NBA, admitted on Instagram that the election result left him ""looking and searching for answers,"" as he shared audio of ""Alright"" by rapper Kendrick Lamar. ""If we continue the faith (as hard as it may be to do so) we will BE ALRIGHT!! Parents and leaders of our children please let them know they can still change the world for the better! Don't lose a bit of faith!"" wrote James, a father of three, pledging to lead the youngsters who idolize him ""every single day without no hesitation."" He concluded the post with, ""Even if whos now in office doesn't, Know that I LOVE YOU'LL!!!"" Politics came to the NFL this summer, when Kaepernick decided to remain seated or kneel during the national anthem to raise awareness of violence against African Americans and racial injustice. Kaepernick, who said he did not vote for either candidate, said he has received death threats, but he continues his protest. Others in the NFL took up the gesture or similar ones, with the Seattle Seahawks linking arms. Doug Baldwin, the son of a former police officer and a man with relatives serving in the military, was one of the leaders of the team as it decided how to protest brutality without indicting the military. ""I thought that a lot of the things that we had seen in the past few months brought up a lot of old emotions and old feelings,"" he said Wednesday (via ESPN). ""And in terms of growing up in the South [Florida] and being around a more conservative area, it resonated with me pretty painfully that that's what our population wanted. That's what the country wanted. To move in that direction, it's disheartening."" Baldwin has hosted police officers at the Seahawks' facility, and he chose to focus on the fact that the divisive presidential rhetoric has opened the conversation about race. ""It was in relation to everything, especially what I'm doing, the groundwork in terms of trying to bridge the gap between police officers and the community,"" Baldwin said. ""At times it's been divisive because of the conversation, because of the political conversation that we've had in the context of what's going on and what has been going on with the election, and now it's become more divisive. And so it's discouraging at some point, but the fight must continue. ""It's an opportunity for us as individuals to educate ourselves more, to take the opportunity to join together more and to have the conversations, the difficult conversations. Because a lot of the times, what I've been seeing and what I've been discussing with my teammates and people outside this locker room is that there's more of a divide in this country than we wanted to admit in terms of race, in terms of all kinds of things. We've been trying to hide it for so long, and I think this just brings it more to the forefront. So if there's a silver lining in it to me, it's that this conversation about what progress truly looks like is going to continue."" Brandon Marshall, the New York Jets wide receiver, has been one of the NFL's most vocal advocates for increased mental-health awareness since revealing a few years ago that he has borderline personality disorder. He chose not to talk about whether he had even voted, focusing instead on the personality of the president-elect. ""The good thing about it is we have a flawed man in office leading our country who's had some really public, nasty things go on,"" he said (via the New York Daily News). ""I think that's a good thing because we put certain people and certain positions on a pedestal and we expect perfection. And that's not the case. And I think if we all look in the mirror, we will all see someone who also has their own issues.""   [Brady and Belichick open up. A little bit.]   Marshall, who tweeted that the locker room is not the proper place to talk politics, chose to focus on the positive. ""I just pray that he does a great job. I also pray that he leads all -- not just some. That's what I'm hopeful for,"" Marshall said. ""That's his job. Obviously there's some people that have been offended. Rightfully so. Now that he's our president, I just pray that he leads all and not just some."" NFL players tend to be more controversy-averse, perhaps because their contracts are not guaranteed. But Martellus Bennett, a Patriots tight end, had a message for his little girl, Jett. ""Let's color the world together, your dreams are my dreams,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""Together we can be the change we wish to see in the universe. We have a lot of work to do, but I think we will have help.""   Patriots' Martellus Bennett wrote an emotional letter to his daughter after the election https://t.co/1xLqOHGt90 pic.twitter.com/ZIe7h3nqkd -- Sports Illustrated (@SInow) November 10, 2016   NFL quarterbacks Rodgers and Brady preferred not to step forward on the matter. Rodgers opened his comments with humor. ""I just want to thank all the voters out there who did vote for me,"" he said (via the Green Bay Press-Gazette). ""I know for some people it was between me and Harambe [the Cincinnati zoo gorilla who was killed when a child fell into his pit]. I think I finished second in that vote."" Rodgers didn't say which candidate he selected but said he was up late watching. ""I knew it was going to be a historic night either way,"" Rodgers said. ""You have an outsider winning, or the first woman to be president. So I thought it was an important night for our country, and really a message to the establishment, if you're looking at it from an objective point of view. ""I hope as a country we can now come together and work a little better with each other. Obviously, there were some people who were -- rightfully so -- worried about the direction of the country now, but I think it's an important time for us that we come together and figure out how to work with each other."" In New England, Trump brought up the regionally beloved duo of Brady and Belichick in a New Hampshire stump speech Monday, but both seemed uncomfortable with the spotlight that brought. Trump claimed that Brady, who has called Trump a friend, called to say he had voted for him. Brady's supermodel wife, Gisele Bundchen, emphatically responded ""NO!"" to an Instagram user who asked whether the couple supported Trump. Her husband was only too happy to deflect Monday. ""Talk to my wife,"" he told reporters. ""She said I can't talk about politics anymore."" Trump read a gushing letter from Belichick at the rally, and Belichick, in his most Belichickian way, offered a statement Wednesday, saying that he writes ""hundreds of letters and notes every month. [It] doesn't mean I agree with every single thing that every person thinks about politics, religion or other subjects."" Because the NBA and NFL seasons are going on, their players are accessible. Baseball players have the luxury of maintaining a lower profile right now, but that didn't keep Chicago Cubs ace pitcher Jake Arrieta from tweeting about stars who had threatened to leave America if Trump were elected. ""Time for Hollywood to pony up and head for the border,"" he wrote. ""#illhelpyoupack #beatit"" Cubs President Theo Epstein, who had donated to the Clinton campaign, was at the general managers' meeting Wednesday, and he expressed support for Arrieta's right to express himself. ""Just like our ownership group is as diverse as you can be politically. Tolerance is important, especially in a democracy,"" Epstein told reporters. ""The ability to have honest conversations, even if you come from a different place, a difference [in] perspective is fundamentally important."" At some point, the Cubs will face the decision of whether to celebrate their championship with a traditional White House visit. Although Obama extended an invitation to the team to try to squeeze in a team from his home town of Chicago before he leaves office, visiting the White House may be a decision that is deferred into 2017. For now, the Cavs are up next. They'll meet with Obama on Thursday afternoon, just hours after Trump makes his first post-election trip to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to talk with Obama about succession."

Bernie Sanders. Seated left to right: Alexander Atkins, Claire Chevrier, Matt Blair and Dom Gallucci. (Photo courtesy of Alexander Atkins.)  Alexander Atkins decided to study law to learn why things are the way they are and how they can be changed. Like many of his classmates, he was drawn to Georgetown University Law Center because it is right at the heart of the political system in Washington, at the base of Capitol Hill. He felt sure it would give him a great opportunity to engage in democracy. That is, until he and some friends wanted to set up a table on campus to advocate for Sen. Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign last fall. Atkins said he was told that partisan activity by students was prohibited because the university, as a tax-exempt organization, is not allowed under IRS rules to get involved in a campaign. And after many months of urging law school officials to change the policy, and then clarify the revised policy -- with support from a nonprofit and a congressional hearing -- he felt the issue came full circle Monday, in the final hours before one of the most contentious elections in recent memory. Atkins said he was told this week that his group, again, could not advocate for a candidate in the way they had planned. ""It was certainly a painful blow,"" he said, after feeling he kept being stymied by university policies he finds unnecessary and illogical. The group did find a last-minute solution and got permission to promote the candidate another way. Universities must comply with restrictions on partisan political activity to maintain their tax-exempt status, according to IRS rules. But students are presumed to speak for themselves, not the institution, said Marieke Tuthill Beck-Coon, a senior program officer for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which wrote a letter to the law school last winter objecting to the policy and arguing it unfairly restricts students' freedom of speech. It is a common concern, she said, and one that the organization has raised with numerous universities. ""These are young people, this is where political speech should be happening, where political discourse should be at its most robust,"" Beck-Coon said. ""It's a shame when any university does anything to dampen that.""   [At Georgetown Law, efforts to close the gap between law, tech]   On Tuesday, Mitchell Bailin, dean of students, defended the school's policy. ""Our partisan political speech policy actually does permit members of the Georgetown Law community to engage in partisan political activities with advanced approval from the Office of Student Life,"" he said in a written statement. ""Requests to use classroom space must be submitted to the Office of Student Life at least one week in advance of a planned activity to facilitate review and approval. The request you are referring to did not meet the one-week notice requirement, which is why it was justifiably denied. ""Unfortunately, the staff member incorrectly advised the student that classroom space cannot be used for partisan political activity, which is not the case. Had the student escalated the request to my office, I could have clarified matters and perhaps made an exception, but I'm just now learning of it."" This spring, Atkins was invited to speak at a congressional hearing on ""protecting the free exchange of ideas on college campuses,"" to tell the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee about his experiences and what he described as unsuccessful efforts to reach an understanding with Georgetown Law officials. A few days before the hearing, Scott Fleming, the university's associate vice president for federal relations, wrote to subcommittee members that Georgetown cherishes free speech and lively debate and that students are encouraged to express their opinions. He said that the location and academic strengths of the university give it a particular orientation toward public service and engagement in the political process, with a long history of helping students express their ideas and advocate for issues they care about.   [Georgetown law professors argue over how, and whether, to mourn Justice Scalia]   Fleming wrote that Atkins's request had been denied because university policies allowed only recognized student groups to organize events and ""contained an overly cautious interpretation of the legal requirements governing the use of University resources"" under IRS guidelines for tax-exempt organizations. He wrote, the words underlined, ""We are adjusting the policies to make very clear that individuals as well as groups are able to reserve tables for organized activity and that all members of our community are able to make reasonable use of University resources to express their political opinions.""   [Black law students at Georgetown write: 'We are shaken and angry at conservatives' response to Scalia's death']   The university revised its policy in March, allowing students to reserve a table for partisan political activity. Atkins and others soon took advantage of that, to promote Bernie Sanders. But Atkins said while that was an improvement, the policy is still so vague that he's unsure whether using the university WiFi or email constitutes a violation. People must request approval for partisan activities other than ""tabling."" He and other students went through the steps to become a recognized student group -- Georgetown Law Students for Democratic Reform -- and sponsored events this fall. But he said after they had received permission to phone-bank for congressional candidate Zephyr Teachout on Monday night, he was surprised to get an email Monday informing him that holding that event in the classroom they had reserved would violate the policy. Atkins said the ""truly ironic and absurd thing,"" was that the group was told that while the classroom use would not be allowed, they could reserve a table for the event. So they did, he said Monday night after making calls urging people to vote for Teachout.
