Airstrikes, automatic fire and artillery were heard from dawn and one soldier was reported killed in clashes. Civilians, some of them wounded, could be seen fleeing the fighting. According to the officers, the Iraqi forces aim to take complete control of the city's Tahrir area and from there move into the adjacent Muharabeen district. The officers spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. Iraqi forces launched the long-awaited operation to retake Mosul a month ago but have only advanced into a few eastern districts. The troops have faced fierce resistance, with snipers, mortar fire and Islamic State suicide bombers driving armor-plated vehicles packed with explosives. On Thursday, cloudy skies over Iraq's second-largest city obscured the visibility of the drones and warplanes on which the troops rely, hindering their advance. Instead, special forces secured areas they had seized, set up checkpoints and swept for explosives. The pause also allowed the residents running out of food in areas liberated from IS to get some supplies from Iraqi troops and aid organizations. Mosul is the last major holdout for the militants in Iraq. Driving them out would deal a severe blow to the Islamic State's self-styled caliphate stretching into Syria. IS on Friday claimed responsibility for an attack the previous night in which a suicide car bomber struck a wedding near the western city of Fallujah, killing at least 10 people and wounding 32. The wedding was full of government-allied Sunni tribal fighters who are also part of the campaign to rid the country of IS, said Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Saad Maan. It was the second incident this week in Fallujah. On Monday, twin suicide bombers targeted the city's security checkpoints, killing six people. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Obama, in remarks at Arlington National Cemetery, noted that Veterans Day often comes on the heels of hard-fought campaigns that ""lay bare disagreements across our nation.""  ""But the American instinct has never been to find isolation in opposite corners,"" Obama said. ""It is to find strength in our common creed, to forge unity from our great diversity, to maintain that strength and unity even when it is hard."" He added that now that the election is over, ""as we search for ways to come together, to reconnect with one another and with the principles that are more enduring than transitory politics, some of our best examples are the men and women we salute on Veterans Day."" Tuesday's election of Republican Donald Trump led to protests across the country. Obama noted that the U.S. military is the country's most diverse institution, comprised of immigrants and native-born service members representing all religions and no religion. He says they are all ""forged into common service."" With just two months left in his term, Obama also noted how he's aged over the past eight years. He read excerpts from an essay by a middle-schooler who wrote that veterans are special because they will defend people regardless of their race, gender, hair color or other differences.  ""After eight years in office, I particularly appreciate that he included hair color,"" Obama quipped. Turning serious again on his final Veterans Day as commander in chief, Obama said that ""whenever the world makes you cynical, whenever you doubt that courage and goodness and selflessness is possible, then stop and look to a veteran.""  ""On Veterans Day, we acknowledge humbly that we can never serve our veterans in quite the same way that they served us, but we can try. We can practice kindness, we can pay it forward, we can volunteer, we can serve, we can respect one another, we can always get each other's backs,"" he said. Before speaking, the president laid a wreath at the cemetery's Tomb of the Unknowns. He bowed his head in silent tribute before a bugler played taps. Obama also held a breakfast reception at the White House with veterans and their families. ___ Associated Press writer Nancy Benac in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

So he quickly posted a video on Facebook, along with a plea to ""check this guy out."" But he did not quite expect the level of outrage provoked by the video, which went up the afternoon after Election Day and within about 24 hours had racked up 300,000 views. Strangers posted expletive-laden comments and dug up the truck owner's name and address. Other commenters suggested the driver had good reason for his views. By Wednesday night, Gavish had deleted the video. ""I felt like it was just spreading anger,"" said Gavish, 27, owner of Weard Beard Trading Co., a gemstone firm in Brooksville, Fla. ""I hope this country is heading in a good direction. I'm just not sure right now."" Three days since businessman Donald Trump won the presidency, it is clear that the animosity wrought by a historically divisive election did not simply die in its wake, but may have intensified. U.S. cities have been convulsed by anti-Trump protests. Swastikas, racial slurs and personal threats have appeared on public buildings and dorm room doors. And online, the vicious word-slinging between supporters of the two candidates has escalated to include videotaped accounts of personal confrontation and retribution.          1 of 60       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   x           Protests swell across U.S. in wake of Trump victory      View Photos   Vigils and protests flared up across the country as opponents of President-elect Donald Trump expressed dismay with the election results, underscoring the difficult task he faces in uniting a fractured country.

""We can't forget that a fringe element of our society was emboldened over a period of months, and it's going to take more than words to create an atmosphere where people feel truly united."" At a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on Friday, President Obama again called for reconciliation. He noted that the federal holiday ""often follows a hard-fought political campaign -- an exercise in the free speech and self-government that . . . often lays bare disagreements across our nation. But the American instinct has never been to find isolation in opposite corners. It is to find strength in our common creed, to forge unity from our great diversity, to sustain that strength and unity even when it is hard."" The remarks came after another night of unruly protesters in a handful of cities smashed cars, lit fires and vandalized buildings. At least 350 people have been arrested this week -- more than half of them during protests in Los Angeles -- amid demonstrations that included highway blockades, angry chants of ""Not my president"" and a rampage through Portland, Ore., that police declared a ""riot."" The protests continued for a third night on Friday in Atlanta, Miami and other cities, but remained largely peaceful.     Trump, too, departed briefly from his calls for reconciliation Thursday night to blast the protesters on Twitter, but tweeted Friday that the protesters were exercising their constitutional rights.     Demonstrations continued for a third night in a row after President-elect Donald Trump won Tuesday's presidential election. (Reuters)   But a Trump adviser described the protesters as ""messed up"" and ""clueless."" ""If they want to protest and make fools of themselves, that's fine,"" Carl P. Paladino, Trump's New York campaign co-chairman, said in an interview with The Washington Post. ""This isn't like Vietnam, where there was a war and misery to protest. I have no idea what these protesters are really protesting other than what the media tells them is a bad thing."" The vitriol was not limited to those angry about Tuesday's results. Across the country, women and minorities reported incidents of intimidation perpetrated by Trump supporters or those claiming to be, who under the cloak of anonymity seemed to see in the results a validation of their extremist views. Many of the incidents took place at schools and colleges. At Wake Forest University, some freshmen ran out of a dorm early Wednesday celebrating Trump's victory and using slurs, including the n-word. University officials condemned the behavior, and said two suspects have been identified.  On social media, students at the University of Pennsylvania shared screen shots of a text they received indicating they had been added to a racist Group Me account that included a ""daily lynching"" calendar. A law student posted on Facebook, ""I just can't stop crying. I feel sick to my stomach. I don't feel safe."" University officials are investigating in hopes of cutting off the offending account. Leaders at Babson College in Massachusetts apologized for two male students who had driven a pickup truck around neighboring all-female Wellesley College, flying a Trump flag and shouting ""highly offensive"" remarks Wednesday. And at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering, someone wrote ""Trump!"" on the door of a room reserved for Muslim prayer. Elementary, middle and high school classrooms and cafeterias also became backdrops for the nation's divisions. In Newtown, Pa., swastikas and anti-gay epithets were scrawled on bathroom walls, and a Latina student found a note stuffed into her backpack, warning her to go back to Mexico. Middle school students in Royal Oak, Mich., erupted in ""Build the wall!"" chants during their lunch period, echoing a Trump rallying cry.  And on Wednesday, two white high school students in York County, Pa., were videotaped holding a Trump sign and parading through the halls as someone yelled ""white power.""  Sandra Thompson, president of the NAACP branch in York County, wondered what it meant. ""Regardless of what they heard from politics, why did they believe that they could be so vocal in the midst of the school?"" It was also unclear whether the rage and hostility of recent days would fade with greater distance from Election Day. ""Part of that depends on events and decisions that have not yet been made, and part of that depends on the behavior of the president-elect,"" said Michael Barone, a historian and resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Barone, who blames most of the post-election strife on liberals, said he couldn't recall a presidential election in American history that had inspired as much partisan rancor as this one. But he and other experts also agreed that most of the 120 million people who voted have not visited their gloating or despair on their fellow citizens.  ""There's been so much increased visibility for white supremacists and extremist groups as a consequence of this election, but that doesn't mean the majority of people who identify as Trump supporters are actually the white supremacists,"" said Segal, of the ADL. ""The majority of people, Republican or Democrat, are not extremist.""   Nusrat Qadir Chaudhry, a Muslim neonatal-intensive-care nurse who wears a headscarf, said she was nearly paralyzed by anxiety when she got word of Trump's victory during her overnight hospital shift in Manhattan. Two months ago she was assaulted by a white man in a parking lot, she told her co-workers. She feared it would happen again. But when she walked out into the morning sunlight, no one shouted insults or attacked her. Instead she was approached by two female strangers. ""I'm sorry,"" one said. ""We're not all like that."" Then she offered her a hug.         susan.svrluga@washpost.com  Emma Brown, Mark Berman, Robert Costa and Alice Crites contributed to this report. "

Some clues from the campaign	" WASHINGTON -- In a campaign for president packed with moments to remember, and more than a few decisions to forget, there are some that will resonate for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Election Day. Here's a look at five key points in Trump's race for the White House that offer clues about what will happen as the campaign comes to its conclusion. ___ IMMIGRATION The Republican National Committee's ""autopsy"" of Mitt Romney's 2012 loss urged that the GOP reach out to minority voters, in part by passing immigration reform. Trump had other ideas. In the first moments of his candidacy, Trump said that Mexican immigrants were ""bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people."" He pledged to build a southern border wall, putting a hard-line immigration policy at the very heart of his campaign. The decision electrified a swath of the Republican base, many of whom felt immigrants had taken their jobs and threatened their position in society, and led to ""Build the wall!"" chants becoming a staple of his signature rallies. But while the plan helped separate Trump from the crowded Republican primary field, Democrats used it as means to mobilize Latino voters, and early voter turnout among Hispanics surged in battleground states like Nevada and Florida. ___ POPULIST MESSAGE A billionaire who lives in the penthouse of a Manhattan skyscraper that bears his name is an improbable choice to be a champion of the working-class. But Trump settled on a populist rhetoric, denouncing trade deals that he says have particularly hurt Rust Belt workers and tailoring his message to white-working class voters. That pitch has allowed Trump to play in traditionally Democratic strongholds in the Midwest; most polls have him close in Michigan, Ohio, Iowa and Pennsylvania. And, win or lose, it threatens to reshape his adopted party, potentially splintering the Republican's working class base from the GOP establishment. ___ UNCONVENTIONAL CAMPAIGNING During the Republican primaries, Trump boasted that he was self-funding his lean campaign operation. While that was not entirely true, it foreshadowed Trump's decision to run a small, unorthodox campaign that frequently pitted advisers against each other and he went through three campaign managers. He eventually reluctantly embraced fundraising, and while he proved skillful at collecting small donations, he was left far behind Clinton's financial behemoth. Moreover, the campaign's decision to largely outsource its voter outreach efforts to the Republican National Committee, which is not as robust as the joint Clinton-Democrats operation, could leave him at a disadvantage in turning out supporters to the polls. ___ PICKING FIGHTS Trump emerged from his party's annual convention in Cleveland in July with a momentum and a-- mostly-- unified party behind him. But the following week, Khizr Khan took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Khan praised his soldier son, who was killed in Iraq in 2004, and while waving a copy of the Constitution, denounced Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigrants from entering the U.S. Trump lashed out, attacking both Khan and his wife -- whom he suggested was forbidden from speaking in public due to her religion -- in interviews and on Twitter, drawing bipartisan condemnation and opening a fault line with some military families, normally reliable Republicans. He made a similarly reckless decision after the first debate, during which Clinton mentioned a former Ms. Universe, Alicia Machado, who says Trump belittled her appearance. Trump couldn't resist taking the bait, attacking Machado during a 3 a.m. ""tweet storm."" The fight, which contributed to a plunge in the polls, underscored Trump's difficulties with women and Latino voters. ___ PROBLEMS WITH WOMEN From the beginning, the reality TV star struggled with winning over women. The thrice-married businessman, whose personal life was fodder for the New York tabloids for decades, had very public, insulting feuds with female celebrities like Rosie O'Donnell and was known for describing women by their appearances, often in unflattering terms. And then things got dramatically worse. Last month, a 2005 video emerged of Trump riding on an ""Access Hollywood"" bus with then-host Billy Bush while using vulgar terms to describe women and talked about how his fame allowed him to force himself on women. And then in the aftermath of the second presidential debate, nearly a dozen women came forward and accused Trump of kissing or grabbing them without consent. Trump has denied the charges and threatened to sue his accusers -- but his poll numbers with women only sank further. ___ Follow Jonathan Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Debido al rechazo que causa Donald Trump en muchos suburbios y comunidades de diversidad etnica, los democratas ansian ganar unos doce escanos o mas. Los mas vulnerables son los de Virginia, Nueva Jersey, Illinois, Florida, Nevada y California. Sin embargo ambos partidos pronosticaban que los democratas no llegarian a conquistar los 30 curules necesarios para apoderarse de la camara baja por primera vez en seis anos. Una posicion muy deseada es la del representante republicano Darrell Issa en California, que hostigo a la presidencia de Barack Obama con investigaciones sobre la muerte de cuatro estadounidenses en Bengasi, Libia y sobre supuesto maltrato de grupos derechistas por parte del Servicio de Rentas Internas. Otro asiento codiciado es el del representante Scott Garrett de Nueva Jersey, quien ha sido acusado de negarse a aportar dinero a las campanas de candidatos que sean homosexuales. Algunos republicanos ""estan empenados en hacer todo a su alcance para impedir el progreso en Washington"", denuncio el presidente Obama en un anuncio de radio. El actual titular de la Camara de Representantes, el republicano Paul Ryan, promete reformar el sistema de impuestos, el sistema de asistencia publica a los pobres y revocar la reforma al sistema de salud que Obama logro. En un email proselitista, dijo que ""es nuestro deber como conservadores"" retener el control de la camara baja. El impacto de Trump en las contiendas legislativas parece ser debil y en algunos casos se veia contrarrestado por la antipatia popular hacia Hillary Clinton. Los republicanos estaban al acecho de bancas actualmente ocupadas por democratas, como unas al norte de Miami, en el norte de Minnesota, y en Omaha, Nebraska. Por otra parte defendian intensamente las de Nueva York, Iowa y Wisconsin. La ventaja actual que tienen los republicanos en la Camara de Representantes, de 247 contra 188, es la mayor que han tenido desde las 270 que lograron en 1931. Pero solo un punado de escanos realmente son competitivos. Tanto los partidos como grupos afines gastaron en total 1.100 millones de dolares en campanas para la camara baja, comparado con el record de 1.200 millones de dolares en el 2012, segun el grupo experto Center for Responsive Politics. Los republicanos superaban a los democratas en cuanto a recaudacion de fondos, pero no por mucho. Desde que Ryan obtuvo la dirigencia de la camara baja el ano pasado, esa instancia ha aprobado medidas como una sobre programas antidroga, una sobre medidas de aduana, ayuda financiera a Puerto Rico y medidas para luchar contra el virus del zika. Pero a pesar de la amplia ventaja que tienen los republicanos, no se pudieron aprobar partes de gastos debido a las objeciones de sectores derechistas, entre ellas algunas del llamado Freedom Caucus.

The selection is intended to predict the result of the U.S. election. (Agence France-Presse/Getty Images)  With U.S. polls yo-yoing and conspiracy theories swirling on both sides of the political spectrum, some of the smartest people in politics are at a loss in predicting the outcome of Tuesday's presidential election. So, since people can't seem to predict the most epic election in U.S. history, why not let animals give it a shot? Thankfully, the Shiyanhu Ecological Tourism Park in China's Hunan province had the same idea, and decided to roll out their not-so-secret weapon for unmasking the future: a Chinese monkey described as the ""king of prophets,"" according to Agence France-Presse. His name is Geda, and local legend has pegged him as a mystical monkey with prophetic insight -- one with an impressive record of correctly predicting the winners of European soccer matches. This time, Geda was asked to predict the winner of the U.S. presidential election and -- unlike many a highly-paid pollster -- he did exactly that, AFP reported, and with absolute conviction, going as far as planting a smooch on the winner's face. Geda -- whose name means ""goose bumps"" -- cast his vote by selecting bananas beside life-size cutouts of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. ""After 'deliberate thought,' the mystic monkey chose Mr. Trump, Shiyanhu Ecological Tourism Park said on Thursday,"" according to AFP. ""Without even waiting, he congratulated the cardboard candidate with a kiss on the lips.""   [Russia has a $4 snack that looks like Donald Trump. It's meaty and overpowering.]   Geda, who is 5 years old and wears a yellow shirt advertising his title, correctly predicted that Portugal would win the 2016 European football championship in July, AFP reported. Two days later, Cristiano Ronaldo's team defeated France 1-0 in overtime. The Chinese news media is playing close attention to the U.S. presidential election because of the damning fodder it has provided the state-run propaganda machine, according to AFP. The tumultuous, insult-laden election cycle has offered the closely-monitored Chinese media a rare opportunity to disparage America's democratic traditions and the leaders who normally promote them. "" 'The innumerable scandals, rumours, conspiracy theories and obscenities make it impossible for a person to look away,' the official Xinhua news service wrote in a commentary last week, likening the 2016 election to a train wreck,"" AFP reported. The AFP didn't clarify whether Geda, the soothsaying simian, was intended as a mockery of American politics or merely a promotional tool for the ecological park that organized his appearance. He may be special, but he's not unique. The monkey's extrasensory insight is supposedly shared by other animals around the globe who have been asked to predict high-pressure sporting events and political elections. In 2012, according to the Raycom News Network, a 9-year-old squirrel named Gnocchi was asked to predict the outcome of the U.S. presidential election after correctly identifying the winner four years earlier. On his second try, Gnocchi failed, eating nine peanuts from a bowl representing Mitt Romney and only five from an President Obama bowl. Perhaps the most astute animal psychic in recent memory is Paul the Octopus, a cephalopod who correctly predicted the results of all eight soccer games played by Germany in the World Cup in South Africa in 2010, AFP reported. Paul -- who made his predictions by selecting a mussel in a box draped in each country's flag -- even selected Spain over the Netherlands in the World Cup final. Paul, the eight-armed native of Weymouth, England, didn't initially reveal his supernatural talent at the Sea Life Centre where he was born, his caretakers told the Daily Beast in 2014. After he was transferred to Sea Life Oberhausen, an aquarium in Germany, his powers became manifest, the Daily Beast reported. Eventually, a German TV station began broadcasting each selection, turning Paul into an immediate celebrity. ""He never made any predictions while he was living here, but maybe he was waiting for a big event like the World Cup until he revealed his abilities,"" said Fiona Smith, a Sea Life Centre employee. Paul ""died peacefully of natural causes"" in 2010, Der Spiegel wrote in a 2010 obituary highlighting the animal's rise to international fame. ""There was a one in 256 chance that he would get all eight predictions right,"" the paper reported. ""Paul's success rate confounded mathematicians, angered bookmakers and spooked hundreds of millions of football fans around the world."" ""Paul delighted people from all continents with his seven consecutive correct predictions for the matches of the German national team and for the final,"" the aquarium's general manager, Stefan Porwoll, told the paper. ""He was dear to all our hearts and we will sorely miss him. He died peacefully in the night of natural causes. It is a comforting thought that he had a good life with us with the best possible care delivered by a committed team."" By 2014, people around the world began turning to animals to predict World Cup games, including an elephant, a cow, a Bengali white tiger, a Japanese otter and a Brazilian turtle, according to the Guardian. Not to be forgotten was Shaheen, a ""clairvoyant camel"" in Dubai who, at one point, was ""19-of-29 on his World Cup picks, giving him a respectable 66 percent success rate,"" according to Bleacher Report. More recently, a group of orphaned dogs in Cleveland, were asked by Cleveland.com reporters to choose between Clinton and Trump by selecting presidential chew toys in a ""highly unscientific poll"" that still bears some resemblance to a real-life election cycles.

Hillary Clinton holds up her book ""Living History"" at a book signing in Auburn Hills, Mich., on Aug. 13, 2003. (Bill Pugliano/AP)  No doubt, dozens of campaign 2016 book deals are being inked right now, with political journalists and campaign insiders promising to deliver the inside story of this extraordinary presidential race. I hope they do deliver it, and I will read as many of those books as I can stand. In the meantime, though, there are several works -- some published this year, others long ago -- that tell us much about the presidential race, about the candidates and their parties, and, above all, about the world that gave them to us. As a book critic, new American citizen and first-time voter this Nov. 8, I've spent the past year reading books that I hoped would illuminate this moment, and I found plenty. Here are my 16 book recommendations as Election Day approaches:    Yes, yes, yes, if you want to understand the Republican nominee, ""The Art of the Deal"" (1987) remains the foundational document of Trump Studies. Even if it was ghostwritten by a ghostwriter who now disavows it, the book has become, in Trump's personal and political narrative, his own story. So it's essential to unpacking how the candidate hopes to be seen and understood. ""The Art of the Comeback"" (1997), his third memoir, is especially useful to understand Trump's thoughts on women; in his worldview, it is women who emerge as the predators, not him. In addition to ""Trump Revealed"" (2016), by my Washington Post colleagues Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, make sure to check out Michael D'Antonio's ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" (2015), which shows Trump as a distorted, exaggerated version of American obsessions with wealth, sex and fame.    (Signet Classics)  As the Trump campaign grew in both success and darkness, I relied on two dystopian novels of homegrown totalitarianism to help imagine the worst-case scenarios. I fully expect ""It Can't Happen Here"" (1935) by Sinclair Lewis and ""The Plot Against America"" (2004) by Philip Roth to shoot to the top of the Amazon sales rankings if we awake on Nov. 9 to President-elect Donald J. Trump. But the most useful work to comprehend Trump's appeal is ""What Is Populism?"" (2016) by Princeton University political scientist Jan-Werner Muller. In this essential book, Muller defines populism's most salient characteristics -- anti-elitism, anti-pluralism, exclusivity -- and explains Trump and other populists through that framework. It is a quick read, and worth every page. Of course, 2016 has been the year that the white working class was rediscovered as an object of journalistic fascination and electoral strategizing, and books such as the poignant but preachy ""Hillbilly Elegy"" by J.D. Vance and the acclaimed but condescending ""Strangers in Their Own Land"" by Arlie Russell Hochschild have gotten plenty of attention. Yet, I found ""White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America"" by Nancy Isenberg to be most instructive in detailing the origins of the long-held class resentments that this campaign has surfaced. Jeff Chang's ""We Gon' Be Alright: Notes on Race and Resegregation"" captures the fights over diversity and representation that Trump skillfully deploys to rally his base, while Sarah Jaffe's ""Necessary Trouble: Americans In Revolt"" surveys the activist movements on the left -- from Black Lives Matter to Occupy Wall Street -- that helped shape the Democratic primary contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and that have provided a whole new vocabulary of radicalism and protest, one that has permeated the discourse of the Democratic Party.    (Random House)  As with Trump, Hillary Clinton's memoirs show us how she wishes to stage-manage her reputation. If you want to read one of them, it's not a hard choice -- read ""Living History"" (2003). Though still guarded, it provides a much clearer sense of Clinton as a person, not just a policy automaton. That said, if you're looking for a real Clinton political manifesto, or the closest thing to it, you still can't do better than ""It Takes a Village"" (1996). Largely panned when it came out, it nonetheless showcases a mix of Clinton's values -- including a surprising streak of social conservatism -- and her eternal struggle to define herself. This is a book that gets better with age. The 2014 Clinton memoir ""Hard Choices"" ostensibly details the candidate's experiences and triumphs as secretary of state, but too often lapses into trip reports and foreign-policy buzzwords. Skip it. A deeper dive into Clinton's record as America's top diplomat is available in ""Alter Egos: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the Twilight Struggle for American Power"" by Mark Landler, which purports to reveal a clash of worldviews between the former rivals turned partners, but instead merely delivers a terrific survey of American foreign policy in the Obama years, replete with pivots, rests and Clintonian credit-mongering.    (Simon & Schuster)  The universe of conspiratorial anti-Hillary literature is vast and constantly expanding, and 2016 saw several additions to the canon. In particular, Dinesh D'Souza's ""Hillary's America"" is an intricate reinterpretation of American history in which the Democratic Party, and Clinton as its ""dark id,"" are the purveyors of all evil for all time in America. It is easy to see how, if you bring yourself to believe what is in these pages, it becomes nearly impossible to vote for Clinton, no matter your reservations about her opponent. And ironically, the campaign book by Hillary Clinton and Tom Kaine, ""Stronger Together,"" makes a case for the ticket's ready-on-day-one expertise, but does so in such a lazy, repetitive and unreadable manner that it undercuts that very premise. Finally, several works offer insight into the evolution and challenges of the two major parties. Thomas Frank's ""Listen, Liberal: Or, Whatever Happened to the Party of the People?"" (2016) is a classic disaffected liberal's case -- and a persuasive one -- against what the Democratic Party has become under the Clintons; that is, in Frank's telling, a party more concerned with the creative class than the working class. Yuval Levin's ""The Fractured Republic: Renewing America's Social Contract in the Age of Individualism"" (2016) shows how misplaced nostalgia permeates modern politics, and offers a road map for the Republican Party after the wreckage of the 2016 campaign.

(The Washington Post)   This story has been updated. You haven't heard it much in the media, but this election is likely to have large consequences for how the United States, and perhaps the world, addresses climate change. And that is simply because the candidates' positions contrast sharply on the matter, and because the world has begun an ambitious emissions reduction regime under the Paris climate accord that only one of the candidates wants to continue. Donald Trump, in an interview with the Washington Post's editorial board in March, said he is ""not a big believer in man-made climate change."" And Trump has said that if elected he would ""cancel"" the Paris climate agreement - which enters into force on Friday, Nov 4. He has also stood up strongly for the U.S. fossil fuel industries, and especially the struggling coal sector. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, wants to continue and extend Obama's climate policies, including striving to reach the U.S.'s Paris agreement target of cutting our greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent or more below 2005 levels by 2025. She also wants to, as she has put it many times, make the U.S. a ""clean energy superpower"" by stoking growth of the solar and wind industries. That's quite a contrast. But at the same time, and as many have noted, the mainstream presidential election discussion of the past two months, and especially the presidential debates, has tended to ignore all of this. (I was fortunate enough to participate in an exception to this trend Wednesday on the ""Diane Rehm Show."") So let's look more closely at how it is that Earth's most momentous and depressing environmental problem has somehow stayed mostly out of what some would say is Earth's most momentous and depressing election - and what the implications for climate and energy would be, depending on who wins on November 8. Climate silence? First let's think back about two weeks. (I know it's hard.) Environmentalists, and liberal pundits, were aghast. The third presidential debate had ended, concluding a presidential debate season in which the topic of climate change wasn't asked about by any of the moderators, and only came up relatively briefly as a Hillary Clinton talking point. The real subtext here: A lot of people on the left wanted to see Donald Trump try to defend his stance of climate change doubt, even as Clinton prosecuted the case that such a view is denying science, etcetera, etcetera. Bring popcorn, right? But I would assert to you that even if it had happened, that would not have been a major moment in this election. Here's why. The truth is that in this race, Hillary Clinton has made much of the climate issue, brought it up repeatedly, campaigned with Al Gore in Florida and linked a changing climate to ferocity of Hurricane Matthew, and much more. That's far more than President Obama did in 2012. Unlike Obama, apparently, Clinton saw it as a political winner for her, particularly with millennials and Bernie Sanders followers. All in all, you could argue it's a very substantial change for the issue of the climate in recent U.S. elections. It's an elevation and a prioritization. It's just that it has happened during a race that has been extremely scandal-focused, extremely negative, and obsessed in all ways with Donald Trump - and that has been a unique aspect of this election. If Clinton had been running against Marco Rubio, or John Kasich, or Ted Cruz, it's likely the subject would have come up even more. So as I wrote earlier, in this election, there's just really ""no oxygen left for a serious debate about carbon."" Climate and energy under a President Clinton So what might we have heard, if the debates had explored these topics more extensively? The truth is that we actually kind of know: While energy and environment matters barely came up in the presidential debates, the University of Richmond School of Law recently hosted an energy and environment debate between Clinton and Trump campaign advisers, and it was pretty illuminating. And indeed, there's a huge gap between the contenders, especially on the existence and seriousness of human-caused climate change, although there are also interesting areas of agreement, like on nuclear power. (For a more thorough rundown of this debate, read Brad Plumer here.)    If Clinton wins, let's face it: We know it's going to be more of Obama. This is certainly one case where she represents the status quo. Under Clinton, we can assume that the Paris process goes full speed ahead, the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan advances (assuming it survives its current legal challenges), and much more. Clinton has also made extremely bold clean energy pledges, such as her promise (as her campaign website explains) to, within 10 years, ""generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America, with half a billion solar panels installed by the end of Hillary's first term."" In this scenario, many fascinating questions arise. For instance, it's far from clear that generating all of our home electricity from intermittent renewables (wind and solar) is going to be feasible, given the nature of power grids and the fact that you can't always count on the sun shining and the wind blowing. We will have to start asking, for instance, how much wind and solar power can grids handle in the U.S., especially in states like California, and how much will they need to back that up with energy sources that can fire up quickly when renewables slump. Those sources could be either natural gas, or, in the future, enormous grid batteries. Another major question will depend not only on whether Clinton is elected president, but also the composition of the Senate and the House, and therefore, what is politically feasible. But the truth is that a centrist policy consensus has been emerging in recent years on how to fix climate change, in the wake of the political failure of cap-and-trade early in the Obama years. Let's not forget that the EPA's Clean Power Plan arose in a context in which it seemed impossible for Obama to actually get a piece of major climate legislation through Congress. But beyond EPA regulatory action, there seems to be general agreement, especially among economists, on the need to set a price on carbon dioxide emissions. This would likely take the form of what is known as a revenue-neutral carbon tax, in which emissions are taxed but that revenue to the government is offset with tax reductions elsewhere, or paid back to citizens in the form of dividends. The question is whether Clinton would pursue such a policy, if she finds herself with a Congress at all favorable to it. And it's important to note that this is closely tied to another key energy question: What happens to two key low carbon energy sources -- nuclear power and coal plants that have been designed so that their emissions can be captured and stored underground (so-called ""carbon capture and storage"") -- which many analysts believe will be needed to supplement wind and solar. Both electricity sources have been struggling -- and both would be more competitively priced with a tax on carbon. The politics of taxing carbon could get pretty interesting, as we see in Washington state, which has a carbon tax on the ballot as an initiative and actually, we're seeing that some environmentalists and denizens of the political left are uncomfortable with it. One key divisive issue is the revenue-neutrality: These groups would like to use emissions reductions policies to also promote clean energy investments, rather than return revenues to taxpayers. ""If it passes, it's going to be important, it's going to be path-breaking, it's going to set an example that will get attention in other states and importantly in Washington, D.C.,"" Dallas Burtraw, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, told me recently of the Washington state carbon tax push. But if that push fails, it may suggest that even the coalition of interest groups behind climate action is too fractious for certain policy approaches. So we'll have to very closely watch this initiative and how it fares. Finally, if Clinton is elected, perhaps the biggest battle is going to be over natural gas and fossil fuel infrastructure, as she draws pressure from the left and the anti-fracking crowd, which believes that the transition away from fossil fuels has to be super fast and that even relying on lower-emitting natural gas is a luxury we can't afford. ""The climate movement has to elect Hillary Clinton -- and then give her hell,"" writes the movement leader and journalist Bill McKibben. Because of this push, we can expect continuing debates over whether or not natural gas is a ""bridge fuel,"" and how much fugitive methane emissions undermine that role, and whether regulating those away will be enough. In general, the question of methane -- how much we're emitting from fossil fuels, as opposed to from other sectors, like agriculture, and how much that matters -- will continue to be a major debate in coming years, in significant part because the issues here remain more uncertain than are those surrounding the principal greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. Thus, under Clinton, we should expect the U.S. executive branch to take every step that it can to try to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and advance the global climate process -- but we should also expect a series of hard questions to arise when it comes to the precise nature of the transition to less carbon-intensive energy in the U.S., and what that means for natural gas, nuclear energy, and just maybe, a cleaner way of burning coal. It's worth noting, incidentally, that this runs in an interesting parallel to what other countries that are committed in a major way to grappling with climate change through their energy systems, like Germany, are now facing. Climate and energy questions in a Trump presidency Trump is expected to try to withdraw from, or simply not participate in, the Paris process. One question is precisely how Trump would attempt to extricate the U.S., given that the agreement will be in force and its language states that a party cannot withdraw for three years, followed by a one-year waiting period. A lot of analysts have spun out scenarios for how this would occur. In the video above, Trump energy adviser Kevin Cramer, a U.S. representative from North Dakota, argues that a Trump administration would submit the agreement for ratification to the Senate -- something the Obama administration argues is not required for this type of agreement -- and that it would likely fail there. Yet it isn't clear what happens in this case, since the U.S. has already, in an international context, formally joined the accord. Legal points aside, it's pretty obvious that a Trump administration could simply fail to participate in the Paris process -- just not engage -- and there's not much that the world could do about that, other than very loudly disapprove. At that point, a key question would be whether there is so much global perception of urgency that we would see other nations move forward anyway, even without the United States, with the hope of waiting out a Trump administration and banking at least some emissions cuts in the meantime.      The Paris Agreement is expected to come into force within the next few months. The Post's Chris Mooney explains where we go from here. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)   Meanwhile, back at home, Trump has repeatedly pledged to try to help the domestic coal industry. And an enormous question is how he would actually go about doing that. Given that Trump has tended to misdiagnose that industry's problems - pinning them rather exclusively on EPA regulations, rather than also crediting the surge in competition from natural gas, which has changed the economics for utility companies - it's not clear that he could succeed. Interestingly, Trump often talks about ""clean coal."" And it's true that the climate concerns about burning coal would lessen greatly if large percentages of the emissions were being captured and sequestered in some way, but the industry just isn't ready to do that at a large scale at this point. Would Trump invest further in clean coal technology and even consider carbon pricing, to help carbon capture-and-storage compete? Trump would also presumably try to thwart the EPA's Clean Power Plan, if it survives the courts -- though it's not entirely clear how that scenario plays out either. Based on some analyses of what this would look like, it sounds like most courses of inaction, such as trying to create a new and different regulation that would be weaker, or failing to enforce the plan, would probably end up with environmental groups suing the EPA and throwing matters to the courts. But let's remember that the compliance period under the Clean Power Plan doesn't start until 2022 anyway. And renewables and natural gas have so much momentum right now that U.S. emissions could actually continue to decline without it ever taking effect - perhaps even more so if electric vehicles continue the kind of growth we've been seeing. After all, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have been declining during the Obama years, without any Clean Power Plan in place, in part because of more burning of natural gas and also, increasingly, more renewables:    (U.S. Energy Information Administration)  To see why renewables could advance even under Trump, consider the state of Texas, a state that regularly votes Republican in presidential elections, but also leads all of the United States in the amount of wind energy generating capacity that it has installed. And in fact it's not even close: Texas has over 18 gigawatts (or billion watts) of wind capacity right now, with another 5 on the way. The second two states, Iowa and California, were around 5 to 6 gigawatts. So it's quite possible that Trump could come into office, reject climate change, reject the international climate process, and we could still actually see U.S. emissions tick down at least somewhat over the course of four years, thanks simply to the free market and technology. Granted, it's dubious this would be at a rate that would match Paris climate targets, or anything like what Clinton would achieve by actively trying to produce such an outcome. And given that the world is in urgent need to ramp up its pace of emissions cuts, those differences could have major implications for international climate cooperation (to say nothing of the physical climate system). And there's perhaps one more thing to point out. Today we're seeing a pretty dramatic conflict over a piece of fossil fuel infrastructure: the Dakota Access Pipeline. In recent years a ""keep it in the ground"" movement has arisen that has increasingly targeted such projects. Under Trump, it seems likely that such demonstrations would increase, perhaps markedly, as a lack of climate action through policy would spur more attempts to push climate action through protests. Most of all, we should expect climate change to be a far more salient political issue under a Trump presidency -- a major source of sharp conflict -- simply because of the obvious high-profile political and international conflagrations that would ensue if he keeps his campaign pledges. Oh, and one more thing: We've had a run of very hot years lately, but we can also expect that the years of the next presidency will likely keep pace with the warmth of the 2010s so far -- if not bringing still more records. In that case, maybe by 2020, a debate moderator would indeed ask about climate change.

(Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  Critics of Donald Trump often invoke the concept of monstrosity. Trump is either characterized explicitly as monstrous (e.g. ""Trump is the GOP's Frankenstein monster"") or more implicitly as abnormal, deviant and warped (e.g. an ""abomination""). That includes reactions to the Access Hollywood tape, in which he was recorded talking about grabbing women by their genitals, and to subsequent allegations of sexual assault: Many cast Trump as a man of ""monstrous"" appetites. This monster discourse isn't just a symptom of Halloween. Monsters offer a way of metaphorically encoding threats, which makes them useful political tools. George Lakoff, a cognitive linguist, argues that metaphors in political discourse operate on us unconsciously. They help us make symbolic connections that put events and people in context, shaping our understanding of the social and political world. Looking closely at the many monstrous characterizations of Trump shows us that monsters are functional metaphors. Examining how and why his behavior is defined, by some people, as monstrous teaches us about the psychology of voters and the strategic behavior of political elites. Here are three insights into political monsters and the functions they perform. 1. Monsters moralize and mobilize. Monster discourse reflects two important social psychological processes: dehumanization and moral distancing. According to psychologist Nick Haslam and his colleagues, morality and humanness are closely intertwined. Dehumanizing language, such as the monster narrative, clarifies boundaries between groups so that perceptions of moral distance between groups widen. This dynamic is particularly pronounced in groups that are defined in relation to one another, as with the political left and the political right. So, for instance, Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.), a Democrat, said that Trump ""is the monster the Republicans built. He is their Frankenstein monster."" He's dehumanizing and creating moral distance, assuring his constituents that the sentiments Trump mentions belong only to the Republican other. Defining someone as a monster, and therefore outside a moral boundary, helps a group build its own moral identity and strengthen its own group attachments. Pointing at an outside monster reminds people of their shared commitment to core values -- and mobilizes them against the threat. Although researchers have yet to empirically link monster narratives specifically to political behavior, the psychological research on moral distancing is suggestive. Italian psychologist Maria Giuseppina Pacilli notes that ""moral differences are more socially divisive than other classes of differences,"" and can ""aggravate intergroup conflict."" Research on dehumanization also shows that people who seem morally distant may be seen as less human, which makes violence against them seem more acceptable. Thus calling someone a monster is not only a political tool but also testifies to our own monstrous potential. 2. Monsters deflect and redirect.  For Republicans, monster narratives make it easier to distance themselves from Trump's racial and gendered comments without much self-examination. Trump states directly that a variety of racial and ethnic groups threaten white Americans. For instance, he calls for a ban on Muslims entering the country, claims Mexicans who wish to cross the border are rapists and criminals, or equates life in the inner cities to living in hell. Until now, the Republican Party has conveyed such threats in far more coded language. Casting Trump as a monster is an effort to distance the party from what some researchers claim is its long history of ""playing the race card"" when appealing to its base. It defines Trump as deviant for using a more explicitly racial discourse -- pointing to the differences between him, other GOP elites and the party base rather than to their similarities. It allows them to reject Trump and use moral outrage to distance themselves from political rhetoric they don't necessarily disavow. The Trumpenstein image is an attempt to draw a stark distinction between the candidate and the party. However it's a distinction that isn't really there. In political monster narratives, the monster doesn't always destroy the system that created him. Sometimes he is destroyed to keep the system intact. Defining him as a monster seems to carve the problem from the system from which it is entangled, and offers a target that can be destroyed without bringing the whole system (or party) down with it. The monster makes a convenient scapegoat. English professor Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, author of ""Monster Theory,"" writes: ""The scapegoated monster is perhaps ritually destroyed in the course of some official narrative, purging the community by eliminating its sins. The monster's eradication functions as an exorcism and, when retold and promulgated, as a catechism."" But destroying the monster -- which in Trump's case means electoral defeat -- doesn't in fact purge the sins assigned to it. It's only a symbolic victory -- one that distracts from the problems that remain. 3. Monsters destroy but also create.  The final lesson of monster discourse is that monsters have many kinds of power, both destructive and creative. Critics of Trump seem to suggest that he is both a monster and a monster maker. Some observers believe that Trump may destroy the Republican Party. Others are concerned that he may be bringing forth a more robust white nationalist movement. Monster discourse isn't just hyperbole. It shapes our thinking. The monster politics invoked throughout this election reveal that our nation's political polarization results not so much from competing principles and policy priorities but from identity politics and categorical prejudices. Our political monsters tell us something about who we are as a nation and reveal the challenges we face in living up to our nation's egalitarian commitments. Monstrous language is strategic and powerfully shapes voters' imaginations. As philosophy professor Stephen Amsa wrote in his book ""On Monsters,"" ""Monsters, both real and imagined, are bound up with our feelings of insecurity and our responses to those anxieties."" This election has laid bare many fears that once lurked uneasily beneath the surface of public life. Regardless of the outcome, those monsters will still be with us on Nov. 9. Erin C. Cassese is an associate professor of political science at West Virginia University, currently working on a project tentatively titled ""The Political Psychology of Monstrosity."""
