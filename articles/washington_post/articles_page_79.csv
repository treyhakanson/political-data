The United Educators of San Francisco posted the plan on its website and distributed the plan via an email newsletter to its more than 6,000 members. The school district has more than 57,000 students. It is unclear how many teachers have used the plan outlined by a Mission High School teacher, said union spokesman Matthew Hardy and school district spokeswoman Gentle Blythe on Wednesday. Blythe said the plan is an option and not part of the official curriculum.  ""Educators are entrusted to create lessons that reflect the California standards, support students' social and emotional well-being and foster inclusive and safe school communities,"" she wrote in an email, adding that teachers are encouraged to include various perspectives and not refer to people or political parties. Harmeet Dhillon, an RNC committeewoman from California, called the lesson plan and introductory statement put out by the teachers' union ""inappropriate propaganda that unfairly demonizes not only the campaign that Donald Trump won but also all of the people who voted for him."" The Nov. 9 plan outlined by teacher Fakhra Shah encourages teachers to talk to students about how they feel about the election results. The plan encourages teachers to offer students hope and to tell them that they can keep fighting. San Francisco is diverse, with many students whose families are in the country illegally and who are worried by Trump's calls for deportation. She warned teachers that some students may use inappropriate words to express their fear and anger.  ""I know that they might curse and swear, but you would too if you have suffered under the constructs of white supremacy or experienced sexism, or any isms or lack of privilege,"" she wrote. More than 2,000 San Francisco students walked out of class last week to protest the new president. On Monday, Mayor Ed Lee declared that San Francisco would continue to provide sanctuary for all immigrants, religious minorities and gays and lesbians. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Junker reportedly said the asylum requests had come from ""more than one family,"" but declined to say how many individuals were involved. Turkey has arrested thousands of members of its military following a failed coup attempt in July. Relations between Germany and Turkey were strained recently when officials in Berlin said that Turkey's extradition requests for coup suspects wouldn't be granted, if they were politically motivated.

The federal government sent hundreds of military police to help after a similar protest last week became violent. Wielding shields and pepper spray guns, helmet-clad police formed lines in front of the legislative assembly of Rio de Janeiro state. Over several hours, protesters broke fences in various areas in attempts to get inside.  ""It's regrettable that our own police are protecting a chamber of thieves,"" said Alexandre Neto, a retired police commissioner who was protesting. ""That is what is really happening."" Violent protests ""don't bring any benefit,"" Gov. Luiz Fernando Pezao told reporters earlier in the day, urging protesters to ""take their ideas inside parliament to resolve this crisis, which isn't just in Rio de Janeiro, but in all of Brazil."" The state is mired in fiscal crisis just months after its signature city, Rio de Janeiro, hosted the 2016 Olympics. Thousands of state employees and retirees have not been paid, or have been paid months late. The federal government has said it won't bail the state out, fearing that a cascade of states could ask for help. Latin America's largest economy is suffering its worst recession in decades. Both unemployment and inflation are over 10 percent, and announcements of layoffs are a daily occurrence. Measures being discussed by Rio legislators include trimming social services and lowering the salary of top officials. Meanwhile, a group of protesters broke inside the lower house of congress, the Chamber of Deputies, in Brasilia on Wednesday. Images on Globo news showed about 50 people interrupting a session. They gathered in the middle of the plenary, chanting that they wanted a return to military rule. The transmission of the session was stopped and police arrived shortly thereafter. ____ Associated Press journalist Renato Spyrro contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Stephane De Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images)  As Donald Trump prepares to take office in January, climate scientists and activists have begun to speculate about how his presidency could affect the success of the Paris climate agreement. And in fact, just one week in, Trump's election has already begun to make waves in the dialogue surrounding the international community's climate efforts.   On Monday, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy suggested that Europe impose economic repercussions on the United States should Trump actually withdraw from the Paris agreement as he's promised. ""Donald Trump has said that he would not respect - it will be seen whether he sticks to this commitment - the conclusions of the Paris accord on climate,"" Sarkozy told the French television station TF1. ""And so I ask that Europe construct a carbon tax at Europe's borders, a tax of one to three percent for all the products that come from the United States, if the United States exempts itself from the environmental regulations that we ourselves have imposed on our businesses.""   Such a move could be a major blow to American exporters -- and the suggestion isn't without teeth. Sarkozy, who was president of France from 2007 to 2012, is currently considered a front-runner to become the center-right Les Republicains party candidate in next year's election. The comments came as representatives from around the world entered into their second week of meetings at the UN climate change conference in Marrakech, Morocco. There, attendees are now considering the potential future of the Paris accord minus U.S. involvement.   Climate experts have expressed doubts about the international community's ability to meet its global climate goals -- namely, keeping global warming within at least a 2-degree temperature threshold -- if the United States fails to follow through on its national commitments. And some are also concerned that a U.S. withdrawal could weaken other nations' resolve to stick to their own climate pledges. In fact, ripples from Trump's election have already made themselves apparent a little closer to home. In Canada, the election results have caused a renewed conservative push-back against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plan for a nationwide carbon price.  Last month, Trudeau announced he would allow Canadian provinces two years to come up with their own carbon pricing schemes, before moving to have  the federal government impose one upon them. Trudeau has proposed a minimum price tag of $10 per metric ton of carbon dioxide starting in 2018, gradually increasing to $50 per ton by 2022. Currently, Alberta and British Columbia already have set prices on carbon, and Ontario and Quebec are in the process of moving forward with their own carbon pricing schemes.   The proposal was met with immediate backlash at the time from conservatives, who argued that the plan was too heavy-handed. And now, critics are pointing to the impending Trump administration as another reason to abandon the plan. They're arguing that the extra costs imposed by the carbon price will make Canadian businesses less competitive with U.S. firms operating under an administration that promises corporate tax reductions and vows to eliminate federal spending on climate change policies.   ""That criticism hasn't been all that new,"" said Werner Antweiler, an expert in international trade and environmental economics at the University of British Columbia. ""But what has changed is that the opponents of any form of carbon pricing feel emboldened by the fact that there will probably be no carbon policy at the federal level in the U.S. for the next number of years.""   For his part, Trudeau has pledged to stick to his carbon pricing plans, despite the outcome of the U.S. elections. But as the aftershock of Trump's election continues to reverberate, some experts are arguing that more action is needed to bolster the Paris agreement against a possible U.S. drop-out. In a recent paper published in the journal Climate Policy, environmental policy expert Luke Kemp of Australian National University outlined a number of ways that participants in the accord could attempt to ""U.S.-proof"" the agreement. One strategy could be to implement penalties, such as trade restrictions, for parties who drop out.  In fact, Kemp said, ""Sarkozy's idea of a one to three percent carbon tax on U.S. imports was exactly the kind of idea I had in mind."" But he added that this idea is something of a ""nuclear option,"" and may not be all that politically feasible for the time being, especially if it came down to getting other nations like China on board.   Another, perhaps less politically sensitive, move he suggested is making a place for subnational players -- that is, cities and states -- in the accord. Even under the Trump administration, it's likely that climate-conscious states and municipalities will continue writing their own carbon-cutting policies, and there are ways that the Paris accord could take those into account, Kemp said.   ""The weakest way would be to simply set up a framework to recognize and review subnational actors,"" Kemp told The Washington Post. ""And that could be a way to not just encourage subnational action in the U.S., but also identify where there's areas for investment and areas for encouragement.""   Even this framework could potentially promote greater action at the federal level, Kemp suggested. There's a precedent for national environmental policies being inspired by state-level action: Federal fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, developed under the Obama administration, were largely the product of clean car standards first enacted in California, for instance.   A more stringent framework would be to actually facilitate a linkage in carbon markets between U.S. subnational actors and other countries. But there's little precedent for this kind of action and it would likely be more difficult to accomplish.   Another idea, Kemp suggested, would be for the world's biggest carbon emitters -- China and the European Union, for instance -- to forge their own separate climate agreement without U.S. participation. It could exist alongside the Paris deal, but would also help safeguard the world's climate goals against a possible collapse of the accord in the event of a U.S. withdrawal.   Any of these actions would take time and extensive negotiations to implement, and it's unclear whether the international community would be open to restructuring the existing agreement at this time. But Kemp argues that it's important for the global community not to take Trump's threats lightly when the accord, in its current form, includes no concrete ways of addressing non-compliance.   And even now, world leaders are already vowing to hold the U.S. accountable for its future actions. ""The United States, the largest economic power in the world, the second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, must respect the commitments they have undertaken,"" said French President Francois Hollande during the ongoing climate conference in Marrakech. ""France, I can assure you this here, will lead this dialogue with the United States and its new president in openness, in respect, but with demands and determination, on behalf of the 100 states who have already ratified the Paris Agreement."""

The 38-year-old African American mother of a 1-year-old daughter donated money and volunteered to help the first woman to win a major-party nomination become the country's first female president. Dial, who lives in Charlotte, knew that not all black women shared her enthusiasm. ""I knew of a couple of black women who had issues with Hillary, but they were still going to vote for her,"" she said. And vote for her they did. Black women, exit polls show, were by far Clinton's strongest supporters, at 94 percent. By contrast, 53 percent of white women supported President-elect Donald Trump. This was Clinton's and the Democrats' most reliable voting bloc, and now they are trying to digest their defeat and move beyond it. ""Having lost the White House and the House and Senate and now being at risk with the Supreme Court, I think what our need will be is an energetic and aggressive defense by Democrats remaining the House and Senate,"" said Jessica Byrd, founder of the D.C. consulting firm Three Point Strategies. ""They'd better fight like hell to be a firewall to legislation that could hurt us.""     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted View Graphic     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted  In 2012, black women voted at a higher rate than any racial or gender group, and 96 percent of them voted to reelect President Obama. Black women made up a similar share of the electorate for this presidential contest, but they didn't have as much help from other segments of the Obama coalition, including black men, Hispanics and Asian Americans, all of whom voted at higher rates for Trump than they did four years ago for Republican nominee Mitt Romney. ""I was devastated when she lost,"" Dial said. ""This whole Trump thing has me frightened. It has me frighten because I have a 1-year-old daughter and I'm scared about how she's going to be treated. I'm scared about the rights of all women."" Trump's victory Tuesday was the realization of black women's worst political fears. In exit polls from Election Day, 76 percent of black women said they were ""scared"" of a Trump win; in a Gallup poll in July, 72 percent of black women said they were ""strongly"" afraid of what would happen if their preferred candidate did not win the election. No other group came close to that level of worry about a Trump presidency, either in the Gallup poll or in Tuesday's exit poll. In the exit poll, 56 percent of black men, 34 percent of white women and 26 percent of white men said that they were scared of Trump winning. Just under half of Latinas and 40 percent of Latino men said they feared a Trump presidency. Feminist scholar Brittney Cooper described black female voters as both pragmatists and visionaries. ""We have a vision for the kind of future we want to build, but also an acute sense of taking care of the least of these, such as protecting funding for schools for our kids and benefits like Medicare and Social Security for the elderly. We always vote with those things in mind,"" she said. Clinton enjoyed solid support among black voters during both the primary and general-election campaigns, although young African Americans were less enthusiastic about her than they were about Obama. Exit polls show 83 percent of black voters under 30 cast ballots for Clinton; four years ago, 91 percent of young black voters backed Obama. The generational divide between older and younger African Americans over Clinton's candidacy was embodied in one of the key issues affecting black communities in recent years -- the deaths of unarmed African Americans during encounters with law enforcement officers. Some of the women whose children were killed in such incidents campaigned extensively for Clinton under the moniker ""Mothers of the Movement."" Meanwhile, many of the young activists who were leading the Black Lives Matter movement through protests and confronting the presidential candidates over their plans to address police conduct vowed publicly that they could not support Clinton. They cited her support for harsh anti-crime legislation pushed by her husband in the 1990s and her use of the term ""super predator"" to describe some young offenders.     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump View Graphic     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump  Dial, a classroom teacher for 16 years, said although she recalled Bill Clinton's presidency as a period of economic prosperity, she acknowledged that the crime bill had contributed to the disproportionately high incarceration rate for black men. But Dial said that she was reassured after Clinton and her husband said last year that they regretted the damage that been done by the harsh anti-crime measures. Like most black voters, she started out as a Clinton supporter in 2008 and this years was excited ""to get this opportunity to vote for her again."" Although she is disappointed, Dial said that she is not defeated. ""I'm even more motivated to be involved. To canvass, to make calls, to make sure I encourage everyone I know to vote because 2016 has shown us that our individual vote really does matter,"" Dial said. ""I am not going to sit back and do nothing."" Sandra Fletcher, a retired federal employee who lives in Florida's Tampa Bay area, also said that members of her sorority and black women in her social circles worked hard phone banking and canvassing to elect Clinton.  ""The fact that her life mission and work was about family and children, that resonated with me and with other black women,"" Fletcher said. ""She's been about public service all her life."" But most of all, Fletcher said, ""my vote for her was based on her qualifications. She was the most qualified person for the job.""  Exit polls showed that 52 percent of black women said that they were excited about Clinton winning, making them the only group in which a majority of voters felt that way. Glynda Carr, co-founder of Higher Heights, a nonpartisan group working to increase the number of black women in elected office, said an organizer in Cleveland shared a story of a cashier she encountered at a store the day after the election. The young woman, who was wearing a ""#BlackWomenVote"" button, lamented that her vote hadn't mattered. ""Our organizer told her, 'Your vote does matter, regardless of who your candidate was.' "" Carr said.  The next task for Higher Heights is organizing women to participate in municipal elections next year and the next round of federal elections two years from now.

The 38-year-old African American mother of a 1-year-old daughter donated money and volunteered to help the first woman to win a major-party nomination become the country's first female president. Dial, who lives in Charlotte, knew that not all black women shared her enthusiasm. ""I knew of a couple of black women who had issues with Hillary, but they were still going to vote for her,"" she said. And vote for her they did. Black women, exit polls show, were by far Clinton's strongest supporters, at 94 percent. By contrast, 53 percent of white women supported President-elect Donald Trump. This was Clinton's and the Democrats' most reliable voting bloc, and now they are trying to digest their defeat and move beyond it. ""Having lost the White House and the House and Senate and now being at risk with the Supreme Court, I think what our need will be is an energetic and aggressive defense by Democrats remaining the House and Senate,"" said Jessica Byrd, founder of the D.C. consulting firm Three Point Strategies. ""They'd better fight like hell to be a firewall to legislation that could hurt us.""     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted View Graphic     2016 Election exit polls: How the vote shifted  In 2012, black women voted at a higher rate than any racial or gender group, and 96 percent of them voted to reelect President Obama. Black women made up a similar share of the electorate for this presidential contest, but they didn't have as much help from other segments of the Obama coalition, including black men, Hispanics and Asian Americans, all of whom voted at higher rates for Trump than they did four years ago for Republican nominee Mitt Romney. ""I was devastated when she lost,"" Dial said. ""This whole Trump thing has me frightened. It has me frighten because I have a 1-year-old daughter and I'm scared about how she's going to be treated. I'm scared about the rights of all women."" Trump's victory Tuesday was the realization of black women's worst political fears. In exit polls from Election Day, 76 percent of black women said they were ""scared"" of a Trump win; in a Gallup poll in July, 72 percent of black women said they were ""strongly"" afraid of what would happen if their preferred candidate did not win the election. No other group came close to that level of worry about a Trump presidency, either in the Gallup poll or in Tuesday's exit poll. In the exit poll, 56 percent of black men, 34 percent of white women and 26 percent of white men said that they were scared of Trump winning. Just under half of Latinas and 40 percent of Latino men said they feared a Trump presidency. Feminist scholar Brittney Cooper described black female voters as both pragmatists and visionaries. ""We have a vision for the kind of future we want to build, but also an acute sense of taking care of the least of these, such as protecting funding for schools for our kids and benefits like Medicare and Social Security for the elderly. We always vote with those things in mind,"" she said. Clinton enjoyed solid support among black voters during both the primary and general-election campaigns, although young African Americans were less enthusiastic about her than they were about Obama. Exit polls show 83 percent of black voters under 30 cast ballots for Clinton; four years ago, 91 percent of young black voters backed Obama. The generational divide between older and younger African Americans over Clinton's candidacy was embodied in one of the key issues affecting black communities in recent years -- the deaths of unarmed African Americans during encounters with law enforcement officers. Some of the women whose children were killed in such incidents campaigned extensively for Clinton under the moniker ""Mothers of the Movement."" Meanwhile, many of the young activists who were leading the Black Lives Matter movement through protests and confronting the presidential candidates over their plans to address police conduct vowed publicly that they could not support Clinton. They cited her support for harsh anti-crime legislation pushed by her husband in the 1990s and her use of the term ""super predator"" to describe some young offenders.     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump View Graphic     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump  Dial, a classroom teacher for 16 years, said although she recalled Bill Clinton's presidency as a period of economic prosperity, she acknowledged that the crime bill had contributed to the disproportionately high incarceration rate for black men. But Dial said that she was reassured after Clinton and her husband said last year that they regretted the damage that been done by the harsh anti-crime measures. Like most black voters, she started out as a Clinton supporter in 2008 and this years was excited ""to get this opportunity to vote for her again."" Although she is disappointed, Dial said that she is not defeated. ""I'm even more motivated to be involved. To canvass, to make calls, to make sure I encourage everyone I know to vote because 2016 has shown us that our individual vote really does matter,"" Dial said. ""I am not going to sit back and do nothing."" Sandra Fletcher, a retired federal employee who lives in Florida's Tampa Bay area, also said that members of her sorority and black women in her social circles worked hard phone banking and canvassing to elect Clinton.  ""The fact that her life mission and work was about family and children, that resonated with me and with other black women,"" Fletcher said. ""She's been about public service all her life."" But most of all, Fletcher said, ""my vote for her was based on her qualifications. She was the most qualified person for the job.""  Exit polls showed that 52 percent of black women said that they were excited about Clinton winning, making them the only group in which a majority of voters felt that way. Glynda Carr, co-founder of Higher Heights, a nonpartisan group working to increase the number of black women in elected office, said an organizer in Cleveland shared a story of a cashier she encountered at a store the day after the election. The young woman, who was wearing a ""#BlackWomenVote"" button, lamented that her vote hadn't mattered. ""Our organizer told her, 'Your vote does matter, regardless of who your candidate was.' "" Carr said.  The next task for Higher Heights is organizing women to participate in municipal elections next year and the next round of federal elections two years from now. The group also will poll black women online about which issues are important to them and write an open letter to the new White House and Congress. Byrd, of Three Point Strategies, said defending legislation and policies put in place by Obama will be a priority among black female political organizers.

Trump said the meeting lasted longer than expected and easily could have gone longer. (The Washington Post)   President-elect Donald Trump and President Obama met for the first time Thursday and pledged to work together, starting the whirlwind transition that will unfold over the next 10 weeks until Trump is sworn into office Jan. 20. Trump later met with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) at the Capitol and said they also would work together -- but on Republican goals that are opposed by Obama and his fellow Democrats. ""We're going to lower taxes,"" Trump told reporters, with Ryan seated by his side. ""We're going to fix health care and make it affordable and better."" He appeared to be referring to a plan to lower taxes that heavily benefits top earners and to the GOP's aim of repealing the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. Following his meeting with Ryan, Trump conferred with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) in the Kentucky senator's Capitol office. An hour and a half after Trump entered the White House through the South Lawn entrance -- avoiding news cameras and the president's staff -- a group of reporters was ushered into the Oval Office, where the president and president-elect were seated in the high-backed armchairs at the end of the room. In a sign of how tensions between the two politicians have not disappeared in the immediate aftermath of the election, the White House did not arrange for the traditional photo-op between the current first couple and the incoming one, a custom that George W. Bush and his wife Laura observed when the Obamas visited the White House in 2008. Melania Trump met separately with Michelle Obama.   [Trump maps out a new administration to bring a seismic shift to Washington]   Still, Trump told reporters Thursday that he expects to work closely with Obama now and in the future to seek his advice in guiding the country. He noted that a session that was supposed to last 10 to 15 minutes went on for an hour and a half. ""As far as I'm concerned, it could have lasted a lot longer,"" Trump said. ""We discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel."" ""So Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future,"" he added, calling Obama ""a very good man.""          1 of 22       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                   Skip Ad   x           What President-elect Donald Trump did on his trip to Washington      View Photos   Trump arrives at the White House for a meeting with Obama and on Capitol Hill to meet with Republican congressional leaders.

And I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face."" The president said that the men's two wives had enjoyed spending time together Thursday morning. ""We want to make sure they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition,"" Obama said. ""Most of all, I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed -- because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.""   [Trump's victory exposes Obama's inability to connect with white working class]   Later, Trump and his wife, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, met with Ryan at the Capitol, where Trump pledged to work closely with Republican congressional leaders. Ryan ushered Trump out onto the Speaker's Balcony and gestured toward the Washington skyline and the monuments west of the Capitol. He pointed to an inaugural platform being built on the Capitol grounds, appearing to show Trump where he would be taking the oath of office as president. McConnell joined Trump and his entourage on a walking tour through part of the building. At the White House, first lady Michelle Obama and Melania Trump met for tea in the private residence and took a tour that included stepping onto Truman Balcony, as well as a tour of the State Floor with the White House curator. They talked about raising children in the White House, and then they visited the Oval Office to meet the president and president-elect. As the two leaders met, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough gave a tour to Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and other aides, notably Dan Scavino, across the edge of the Rose Garden. Afterward McDonough led Kushner on a walk down the South Lawn for nearly 20 minutes, at which point the two men rejoined Trump's senior staff and reentered the White House. During Obama and Trump's press availability, Kushner snapped photos with his iPhone. A slew of journalists, including international reporters, milled about on the driveway leading to the West Wing ahead of Trump's arrival. Some did live updates to their networks. Across West Executive Drive, dozens of White House staffers gathered on a steps in hopes of a glimpse of the president-elect.  This is the scene on the West Wing driveway right now. pic.twitter.com/KoLxqek8qo -- David Nakamura (@DavidNakamura) November 10, 2016  Obama has pledged his administration's full cooperation with Trump's transition team, citing the close working relationship he enjoyed with President George W. Bush during their transfer of power eight years ago. The White House said that Pence met with Vice President Biden in the afternoon. ""I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the president-elect,"" Obama said in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. The president said he called to congratulate Trump early Wednesday morning after news networks had formally announced Trump as the winner over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.' White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after the meeting that the two men did not try to resolve all of their differences, but he said it was ""a little less awkward"" than reporters might have anticipated. Obama and Trump met privately without any other staff in the room. A large part of the Oval Office session was devoted to talking about how to staff and organize the White House. ""That's complicated business,"" Earnest said, noting that presidents have to deal with multiple challenges and crises at the same time. It is ""something President Obama has thought about extensively over the past eight years."" Obama had denounced Trump as ""temperamentally unfit"" for the White House during a long and brutal campaign. But he said that ""we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world."" Trump, and Clinton, already had been receiving national-security briefings as the nominees of the two major political parties. The White House said Thursday that Obama has convened a coordinating council to facilitate a smooth transition, including providing briefings from federal agencies to Trump's transition team, headed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R). Officials from the Trump transition team are starting to set up shop in agencies across the federal government, where they can consult with top Obama officials as they assemble their staffs. The current White House has already begun to transfer a massive amount of information to the National Archives and Records Administration: so far it has sent 283 million files, comprising 122,000 gigabytes of data. In an interview Wednesday, White House communications director Jennifer Psaki said the president has talked privately with his staff, as well as publicly, about putting institutional interests ahead of political ones. Referring to the speeches Obama delivered upon winning the presidency and at his first inaugural, she said: ""He reflects a lot about the cog in the wheel that you are as president. He was taking the baton, he's handing it off. But I think it's a recognition that it's bigger than individual aspirations and it's bigger than yourself, and bigger than anything that you've accomplished. Because we as a country need to be stable, need to have continuity."" In the wake of protests over Trump's win, Earnest said that while the president believes the protesters have a right to express their opinions, his message to them is that ""we're Americans and patriots first"" and that an orderly transfer of power ranks as a top White House priority. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who ran unsuccessfully in the GOP presidential primary and harshly criticized Trump, was at the White House on Thursday to attend Obama's ceremony for the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers. Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing, Kasich said he saw people protesting Trump's election as he entered the White House gates, and he called for unity. ""I just want to remind everyone in our country that the office of the presidency needs to be respected,"" he said. ""Today, I said my prayers on the plane for the success of Donald Trump. And I think as Americans, we all need to come together."" There is long-standing bad blood between Trump and Obama, after the New York businessman led a public campaign to try to force the president to disclose his long-form birth certificate in 2011 over unfounded questions from some conservatives who thought the president was not born in the United States.      As a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to dismantle some of President Obama's key achievements.

(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   During the White House Correspondents' Association dinner that year, Obama lit into Trump, mocking him before a ballroom of 2,000 guests and on live television. During the campaign, Trump promised to repeal the president's signature health-care law and overturn many of his executive actions. Obama said Trump was not to be trusted with the nation's nuclear codes and represented an existential threat to democracy. Obama sought to play down their differences and said Trump's victory speech was magnanimous and set the right tone to help try to heal the nation's political divisions that were exposed and inflamed over the past 15 months. ""They do not have an extensive personal relationship,"" Earnest said Wednesday, drawing laughs from reporters. ""This is not a situation where they've had many conversations or played golf together or any of that business. So I guess that will be among the many, many, many reasons that tomorrow's meeting will be rather interesting.""

In what appeared to be a wave election, Republicans also secured majorities they already enjoyed in the Senate and the House and in governor's mansions and state legislatures across the country. Democrats were all but wiped out in places like Iowa and Kentucky. The defeat of Hillary Clinton, an experienced Washington politician who sought common ground with Republicans, could make it more likely that the party will turn to its liberal wing as it grapples with its future. That's best represented by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom Clinton defeated in a long primary, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a pull-no-punches progressive darling. The Democratic Party should remold itself in the image of Warren and Sanders ""and offer a systemic critique of the rigged economy"" that appeals to the same voters who put Trump over the top, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Green said Democrats must make a ""conscious decision to separate themselves from the corporate villains who are to a large extent funding their campaigns."" Trump's open warfare with Republican leaders over the past year and a half obscured the extent of the Democrats' crisis, and they are only now beginning to contend with it.  ""This is painful, and it will be for a long time,"" Clinton said in her concession speech Wednesday in New York. She implored those who want to fight for Democratic values -- particularly young voters -- to participate every day, not just every four years. Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz urged careful deliberation as the Democratic reckoning begins. He said the ""rush to recalibrate"" strategy and messaging concerns him.  ""Democrats need to take, not forever, but weeks and months to diagnose what just happened to us and why,"" he said. But the outlook for Democrats may well get worse before it improves. In two years, they will be defending about two dozen Senate seats, including at least five in deep-red states. That election could hand Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a filibuster-proof majority, further clearing the way for a conservative policy agenda.  ""We have to ask ourselves what is wrong with our party,"" said Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, arguing it's at least in part a failure to connect with working-class people who are hurting. One small Democratic bright spot this year was the election of three women of color to the Senate, Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, Kamala Harris in California and Tammy Duckworth in Illinois. At the same time, the party's marquee names are far older than the core Democratic coalition. Sanders is 75, Warren 67 and soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer turns 66 this month. Across the Capitol, Democrats are led by 76-year-old Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California. In a telephone interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Sanders said Democrats must take a strong stand against the role of corporate interests in politics. That millions of white working-class people voted for Trump ""suggests that the Democratic message of standing up for working people no longer holds much sway among workers in this country,"" Sanders said. Warren is speaking Thursday at an AFL-CIO executive council meeting. Although labor leaders spent millions of dollars backing Clinton, many union members, particularly in Rust Belt states that had been Democratic strongholds, appear to have voted for Trump.  ""We should hear the message loud and clear that the American people want Washington to change,"" Warren is telling them, according to her prepared remarks. ""Working families across this country are deeply frustrated about an economy and a government that doesn't work for them."" Democratic woes ripple into their party's infrastructure, as the Democratic National Committee in Washington struggles. Both the chairwoman who stepped down this summer and the woman who succeeded her in the interim have been dinged by embarrassing emails published by WikiLeaks after what the government believes was a Russian hack of their internal Democratic systems. Sanders said he would support Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota to become the next chairman of the DNC. Democrats emphasized their party's diversity, and some argued that Trump's singular appeal as a plain-spoken celebrity businessman does not translate into a wholesale voter rejection of Democratic policies. Jaime Harrison, the South Carolina party chairman, downplayed the idea that Trump's nationalistic populism should necessarily push the Democratic Party leftward. ""That might be overthinking what happened,"" he said. Harrison argued it's more about finding the right messengers to take the Democratic platform to the pockets of the electorate that have drifted away from the party, naming New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker among others as potential role models for other Democrats. Yet Walsh warned Democrats not to fall into the same trap as they did eight years ago, after an inspiring 47-year-old first-term senator with a powerful stage presence was elected president.  ""Every now and then you get a shining star, and that person takes over the party,"" Walsh said. ""And during that time you sort of lose the bench."" ___ Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Bill Barrow contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

" Latino voters are making themselves heard in city halls and statehouses from Idaho to Florida, reshaping the nation's political landscape and delivering a surge of support for Hillary Clinton in the homestretch of the presidential campaign. In the nation's capital, by contrast, their voice is barely audible. As residents head to the polls this week, they will once again be electing a D.C. Council without a single Latino representative -- despite a growing Hispanic population that now stands at about 10 percent. The city has elected a handful of Latino advisory neighborhood commissioners and school board members, as well as Franklin Garcia, who serves as the District's unofficial ""shadow representative"" in Congress. But a Latino mayor or council member has never held office. ""We're still powerless in terms of political representation,"" said Pedro Aviles, a longtime political activist and founding member of the Latino Civil Rights Task Force, which was formed after the 1991 riots in the city's heavily Hispanic Mount Pleasant neighborhood. ""We've had deputy mayors, and we've had appointments to powerful positions in the District of Columbia. But we've never gotten anyone elected,"" Aviles said. ""There is participation at the political level, but it's not enough."" The reasons for that absence are rooted both in demographic realities that have hampered Latinos' influence at the ballot box throughout the country and in the idiosyncrasies of D.C. politics. Mirroring a national trend for a minority group substantially made up of recent immigrants, fewer Latinos are eligible to vote in the District than in the city's population as a whole. Less than half of District Latinos are eligible to cast a ballot, compared with 76 percent of blacks and 85 percent of whites, according to the Pew Research Center. Rapid development and rising rents have dispersed the District's Hispanic population from its historic concentration in Columbia Heights, Mount Pleasant and Adams Morgan, leaving Latinos without a political power base in a single council ward. The District's small number of elected offices and insular political culture have also made it tougher for Latino politicians to ascend here than in neighboring Virginia or Maryland, said Joshua Lopez, a 32-year-old Petworth resident who ran and lost in 2011 for an at-large council seat. The winner in that race was veteran District politician Vincent B. Orange, who lost his primary race in June and then resigned under pressure from the council in August because of his effort to take on a dual role as head of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce. ""There's only so many seats you can go for because we're not a state,"" Lopez said. Given the city's limited and diffuse Latino population, he added, identity politics alone isn't a sufficient foundation for a successful campaign. Whether in a ward or citywide, Lopez said, a Latino candidate would have to build an electoral coalition that includes other ethnic and interest groups. ""If you're going to go at it as a Latino only, it would be very, very difficult to win on that platform,"" he said. Angela Franco, president of the Greater Washington Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the problem of Hispanic political representation in the District was ""a two-way street."" She said a talented candidate was needed -- as well as the right political and demographic alignment -- to elect the city's first Latino council member or mayor. ""Honestly, from my point of view, there's nobody who's ready to take on that role,"" Franco said. Jackie Reyes, director of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's Office on Latino Affairs, said Bowser (D) is using the machinery of government to help Latinos even in the absence of Latino elected representatives. Just last week, Reyes noted, the mayor's office announced close to $1.3 million in grants for community organizations that work with Hispanics. ""We might not have the representation of public officials, but we have the structure to give services,"" Reyes said. The lack of Latino officeholders in the District contrasts with elected bodies elsewhere in the country. Nationwide, the number of elected Latino officials grew by 25 percent between 2004 and 2014, according to NALEO Educational Fund, a nonprofit group that advocates greater participation by Latinos in politics. Last year, Seattle -- a city whose size and Hispanic population are similar to the District's -- elected the first two Latino members in history to its nine-seat council. Just north of the District, Nancy Navarro is serving as the first Latina on the Montgomery County Council. The District's predominantly Salvadoran Hispanic population is young compared with those of cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Miami, with many tracing their roots to a wave of Central American immigrants to the city in the 1970s and 1980s. Peter Tatian, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies the District's demographic trends, said Latino involvement in local politics could increase as an established second generation comes of age and guides its children through the city's school system. ""We have a lot more Latinos who have been in the District a while now,"" Tatian said. ""Not only immigrants who are coming in, but people who are living here, having families here. And that's changing the community."" On a recent morning in Mount Pleasant -- a neighborhood where pupuserias jostle with upscale coffee shops, and different types of newcomers, young and white, tote skateboards and yoga mats past clusters of men and women speaking Spanish -- Jasmina Garcia said a Latino elected representative in the District's government was overdue. A 58-year-old housekeeper who speaks limited English and lives in Friendship Heights, Garcia said she thought an elected Latino in city hall would better understand and address problems widely experienced among those she knows, issues such as wage theft and the challenges of the immigration process. ""I don't know who the representation is for Latinos in this city,"" she said. Walking her dog nearby, Gloria Sanchez, 51, said she thought many of her neighbors were still focused on the immediate concerns of first-generation immigrants. ""I think that the Latin families, their thing is just work, work, work. They don't take the time to figure out what they can do [politically],"" said Sanchez, who moved to the District with her family from El Salvador when she was 5. ""They're always busy and tired."" Asked whether that might change in the years ahead, she paused. ""Maybe with this new generation,"" she said. ""Maybe.""  This story has been updated from an earlier version, which incorrectly stated that no Latino had held citywide office.   "
