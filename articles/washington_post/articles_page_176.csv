LUCIE, Fla. -- Police say a Florida officer shot and killed a 25-year-old man threatening officers with a machete. Port St. Lucie police Sgt. Frank Sabol says officers had gone to a home Friday afternoon after getting a call about a disturbance and found Samson Fleurant inside, armed with a machete. Sabol says in a press release that one officer shocked the man with an electric stun gun, but Fleurant continued to advance with the machete. Sabol says another officer then shot the man. Fire officials initially reported that Fleurant was hospitalized in extremely critical condition, but police later said that he had died. Police say Fleurant was black. The officer who shot Fleurant is black, and the officer who used the Taser is white. Port St. Lucie is on the Atlantic coast, about 50 miles north of Palm Beach. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

""At the right time, I will be so presidential you will be so bored,"" Trump assured us back in April, when the notion seemed fanciful. ""I know when to be presidential."" Does he? On three dimensions -- temperament, competence and ideology -- Trump's conduct since the election has offered more basis for worry than for relief. That Trump's temperament is a problem is underscored by exit polls showing that 63 percent of voters do not think he has the temperament to be president -- including 26 percent of Trump voters.  In the immediate aftermath of the election, it was possible to argue the temperament case either way. There was Presidential Trump, proclaiming that he would be ""president for all Americans."" He dropped the talk about locking up ""Crooked Hillary"" in favor of praising her service to the country.  And then, increasingly, there was Tweeting Trump, starting with an assault on ""professional protesters, incited by the media,"" and continuing with a series of attacks on the ""failing"" New York Times, ""upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me."" Pick your adjective: thin-skinned, childish, unpresidential.  Also in the basket of worries about temperament: Trump's heedlessness to issues of conflict of interest and nepotism. The government is not, or shouldn't be, a family business. Whether the federal anti-nepotism law technically applies to Jared Kushner, its spirit would clearly be violated by having Trump bring his 35-year-old son-in-law, entirely lacking in government experience, onto the White House staff.  And the arrangement would pile conflict upon conflict. Trump's refusal to follow the practice of previous presidents and put his holdings in a blind trust means that his children (and spouses who benefit from their holdings) should be kept at arm's length from the workings of government -- not put on his transition team or in his White House.  On the subject of Trump's competence, again, voters knew what they were getting: Sixty percent said he is not qualified to be president, including 23 percent of Trump voters. But the apparent disorganization of the transition does not bode well for the conduct of the Trump administration.  Sure, all transitions are chaotic, but Trump's, with the post-election purge of Chris Christie and the New Jersey governor's loyalists, has started in a particularly chaotic manner. The Christie-led group, I'm told, was actually in reasonably good shape. But who needs preparedness when there are scores to settle, on the part of the candidate or his son-in-law?  That has left the new, shellshocked Trump team clueless about the magnitude of the task facing them. Really, all White House employees of the previous administration are out the door on Inauguration Day? How were they to know? Um, ask an experienced transition planner?  Third, and most disturbing, are the unnerving clues about the ideological direction of the Trump administration. A president has the right to assemble advisers with whom he is comfortable and who reflect his views.  But most of his choices so far convey the message that loyalty will be rewarded above all, and that Trump's election night promise to ""bind the wounds of division"" was empty rhetoric. Choosing Stephen K. Bannon to be his chief White House strategist does not bind the wounds of division. This is a man who prides himself on being the voice of the alt-right; whose ex-wife said in a sworn declaration that ""he doesn't like Jews"" and didn't want his daughters ""going to school with Jews""; whose website blasts a columnist as a ""renegade Jew"" and proclaims that ""birth control makes women unattractive and crazy.""   Choosing Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer -- and oversee issues of discrimination, police brutality and voting rights -- does not bind the wounds of division. This is a man who called the NAACP ""un-American,"" said he thought the Ku Klux Klan was ""Okay until I found out they smoked pot"" and described a white civil rights lawyer as a ""disgrace to his race.""  Choosing retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn to serve as national security adviser does not bind the wounds of division. This is a man who has tweeted that ""fear of Muslims is RATIONAL"" and described Islam as a ""malignant cancer,"" a ""political ideology"" that ""hides behind this notion of it being a religion.""  Perhaps the full picture will be less disturbing than the sketch so far. Perhaps Trump will grow on the job. The evidence so far offers slim grounds for hope.

"   Ronald A. Klain served as assistant to President Obama and oversaw the team implementing the American Recovery and Renewal Act from 2009-2011. He was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. The views expressed here are solely his own.     As the White House official responsible for overseeing implementation of President Obama's massive infrastructure initiative, the 2009 Recovery Act, I've got a simple message for Democrats who are embracing President-elect Donald Trump's infrastructure plan: Don't do it. It's a trap. Backing Trump's plan is a mistake in policy and political judgment they will regret, as did their Democratic predecessors who voted for Ronald Reagan's tax cuts in 1981 and George W. Bush's cuts in 2001.  First, Trump's plan is not really an infrastructure plan. It's a tax-cut plan for utility-industry and construction-sector investors, and a massive corporate welfare plan for contractors. The Trump plan doesn't directly fund new roads, bridges, water systems or airports, as did Hillary Clinton's 2016 infrastructure proposal. Instead, Trump's plan provides tax breaks to private-sector investors who back profitable construction projects. These projects (such as electrical grid modernization or energy pipeline expansion) might already be planned or even underway. There's no requirement that the tax breaks be used for incremental or otherwise expanded construction efforts; they could all go just to fatten the pockets of investors in previously planned projects.  Moreover, as others have noted, desperately needed infrastructure projects that are not attractive to private investors -- municipal water-system overhauls, repairs of existing roads, replacement of bridges that do not charge tolls -- get no help from Trump's plan. And contractors? Well, they get a ""10 percent pretax profit margin,"" according to the plan. Combined with Trump's sweeping business tax break, this would represent a stunning $85 billion after-tax profit for contractors -- underwritten by the taxpayers.  Second, as a result of the above, Trump's plan isn't really a jobs plan, either. Because the plan subsidizes investors, not projects; because it funds tax breaks, not bridges; because there's no requirement that the projects be otherwise unfunded, there is simply no guarantee that the plan will produce any net new hiring. Investors may simply shift capital from unsubsidized projects to subsidized ones and pocket the tax breaks on projects they would have funded anyway. Contractors have no obligation to hire new workers, or expand workers' hours, to collect their $85 billion. To their credit, the plan's authors don't call it a jobs plan; ironically, it is Democrats looking to align with Trump who have given it that name. They should not fool themselves. Third, because there is no proposed funding mechanism for Trump's tax breaks, they will add to the deficit -- perhaps as much as $137 billion. Yes, some economists think more deficit spending will boost growth. But you can be sure of this: In Trump's hands, rising deficits will be weaponized to justify future cuts in health care, education and social programs. Just as David Stockman used deficits caused by the Reagan tax cuts as a rationale to slash social programs three decades ago (the ""starve the beast"" theory), the deficits caused by Trump's infrastructure tax cuts will be used to justify cuts in programs. Thus, Democrats should know that every dollar spent on the Trump tax scheme to enrich construction investors and contractors is a dollar that will later be cut from schools, hospitals and seniors. Fourth, if the Republican approach to the Recovery Act is any indication, the Trump plan will come chock-full of policy changes that undermine core Democratic principles. Buried inside the plan will be provisions to weaken prevailing wage protections on construction projects, undermining unions and ultimately eroding workers' earnings. Environmental rules are almost certain to be gutted in the name of accelerating projects.  I understand why Democrats are searching for areas where they can make progress under a Trump presidency and why some Democrats say they won't follow the Republican example of 2009 -- when the GOP minority unanimously opposed the Recovery Act, even after intense negotiations with them diverted one-third of the plan to tax cuts. It is possible that Trump may modify the plan he released in October, and some Trump advisers are talking about sweetening the deal for Democrats by adding an ""infrastructure bank."" But even with such an addition, the Trump plan would not be a reasonable compromise -- acceptance of its huge tax breaks for construction investors and profits for contractors would be a wholesale concession. Democrats supporting such a deal in the moment will find that their votes will wear poorly in the future. After the disappointing election results, Democrats are looking for ways to connect with working-class voters -- and Trump's plan appears to offer that. But when the plan is passed and those voters see that it fattens investors' and contractors' pockets (but not workers'), creates few jobs, depresses wages and damages our environment, they will sour on it and turn against its backers. Democrats may lack the votes to stop Trump's plan, particularly if the GOP uses extraordinary legislative vehicles or processes to pass it. But Democrats should not add their votes and credibility to this poorly designed initiative.

A remarkable election that propelled Republican Donald Trump to the White House also resulted in Republican wins in a trio of governorships previously held by Democrats in Missouri, New Hampshire and Vermont. The only potential Republican setback came in North Carolina, where Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper declared victory over Gov. Pat McCrory in a race that remained too close to call Wednesday. If Cooper's slim lead holds, Republicans will control 33 of the 50 governors' offices -- one shy of their record set in 1922. Republicans also appeared likely to maintain control of about two-thirds of the state legislative chambers, meaning that in many states they will have the power to enact whatever policies they choose. In Missouri, for example, newly elected Republican Gov. Eric Greitens has pledged to enact a right-to-work law barring mandatory union fees in the workplace -- a long-sought priority of GOP legislative leaders that had been vetoed by Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon. Newly elected New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu also could be paired with a Republican-controlled Legislature. The GOP held its majority in the state Senate, and House Republicans also claimed victory. Republicans last saw such a sweep in 2002. In Vermont's gubernatorial election, Republican Lt. Gov. Phil Scott defeated Democrat Sue Minter, a former transportation secretary for outgoing Gov. Peter Shumlin. Scott campaigned on making government more efficient but also appealed to voters in the liberal-leaning state by embracing abortion rights and gay marriage. The Republican Governors Association spent more than $50 million on this year's races, primarily targeting seven states. That almost doubled the estimated amount of money coming from the Democratic Governors Association, though Democratic candidates in some states outraised their Republican opponents. Democrats are hoping for better results in the next two years, when 27 of the 38 governors' office up for election are held by Republicans.  ""It's clear that Democrats need to rebuild,"" said Democratic Governors Association spokesman Jared Leopold. Democrats did have a few bright spots Tuesday. Despite a dominant victory by Trump in West Virginia, Democratic businessman Jim Justice won the governor's race over Republican state Senate President Bill Cole. And although Trump easily carried Montana, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock retained his seat against a challenge from Republican businessman Greg Gianforte, who poured millions of his own money into the race. ___ Follow David A.

(Gerald Herbert/Associated Press)  So let's start with the bad news. Donald Trump -- a death-penalty zealot who called for the execution of the (innocent) Central Park Five and essentially ran a campaign of fear-mongering about immigration, the ""war on cops,"" and the ""inner cities"" -- will be the next president of the United States. Trump is anything but predictable. Perhaps he'll surprise us. This, after all, is a man who within the last five years called for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and has in the past called for drug legalization. But all we have to go on now is his campaign rhetoric. And that doesn't bode well. It seems likely that he'll end the Obama administration's use of the DOJ's Office of Civil Rights to investigation police brutality, profiling and misconduct. He has all but promised to undo Obama's modest reforms to the 1033 program, which provides surplus military gear to local police departments and has contributed to the militarization in both mind and action of police agencies across the country. He's likely to appoint federal judges less skeptical of police misconduct and less protective of the Fourth Amendment. He'll almost certainly appoint U.S. attorneys more likely to seek the death penalty at the federal level. As Bill Keller points out over at the Marshall Project, Trump can also undo Obama's executive orders on juvenile solitary confinement, federal private prisons, ""ban the box"" and designating federal drug crimes a low-priority. These reforms were revolutionary in that Obama is the first president in a couple of generations to at least acknowledge that the criminal-justice system is in need of reform, other than simply making it ""tougher on crime."" But in practice, they were all relatively modest. Still, Trump could undo them with the stroke of a pen. He could also undo or simply end much of the important but largely symbolic work the administration is doing on forensics reform. Then there are the people he'll appoint within his administration. This list of potential cabinet picks from Politico ought to terrify anyone interested in civil liberties. Rudy ""Freedom is about authority"" Giuliani at DOJ? Sheriff David Clarke at DHS? This is a recipe for a civil liberties massacre. Beyond Trump, there's more bad news. The death penalty was on the ballot in three states last night, by way of four separate initiatives. In all of them, the death penalty won. In Oklahoma, voters approved a nutty amendment to the state constitution that essentially puts capital cases beyond the purview of judicial review. (The amendment will not -- and could not -- prevent federal habeas review of capital cases.) This is the state that badly botched one execution, and demonstrated inexcusable incompetence in its haste to carry out another (and that one on a man who has a compelling innocence claim). In Nebraska, voters repealed a bill ending the death penalty passed by the state's Republican-dominated state legislature. The measure was largely due to the work of Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts (R), who poured a massive amount of his family's considerable wealth into the initiative. But it wasn't just in red states. California voters weighed in on two death penalty initiatives -- one to repeal it, and one to speed it up. The former failed, the latter passed. This is a state that Hillary Clinton won by 28 points. Americans still revere the death penalty. It's almost as if the past 20 years of exonerations, the persistent parade of crime lab scandals, the ample evidence of false confessions, the astonishing incidences of prosecutor misconduct -- it's almost as if all of those things never happened. It's hard to comprehend how, after all of that, voters in two very different states would still opt to rush executions and limit judicial review. As I've pointed out here before, the argument that DNA testing will somehow preclude the execution of the innocent fails because DNA is only relevant in a subset of criminal cases -- capital cases included. Meanwhile, there's every reason to believe that the flaws exposed by DNA testing are systemic. That is, it would be foolish to believe that problems with crime labs, eyewitness testimony, police misconduct and prosecutor misconduct are limited only to those cases in which DNA testing has exposed them. But there was also a lot of good news last night. Marijuana won in 8 of the 9 states in which it was on the ballot -- including outright legalization in California, Massachusetts and Nevada. Those states all went blue in the presidential race, but red states Montana, Florida, Arkansas and North Dakota all legalized medicinal marijuana. The lesson here appears to be that pot has finally transcended the culture wars, but the death penalty hasn't. There are a couple of other important reform measures that passed. Ironically, both were in states that strengthened the death penalty. California voters approved Prop 57, which expands parole (as opposed to prison) and time off for good behavior for nonviolent offenses, and lets judges (instead of prosecutors) determine whether juveniles should be tried in adult courts. And in Oklahoma, voters approved of a measure to reclassify certain property and drug possession crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. They also approved a measure that would use the money saved from reclassifying such crimes to fund rehabilitation, mental health treatment and vocational training for inmates. New Mexico voters passed a bail reform measure that, while poorly drafted, at least indicates that there's an appetite in the electorate for such reforms. There was also some good news in individual races. Most significantly, Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- the self-proclaimed ""toughest sheriff in America"" -- was finally defeated (the fact that he's currently under federal indictment may have had something to do with that). Unfortunately, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery -- one of the most punitive prosecutors in the country -- did win. (Arizona was also the only state to vote against a bill to loosen restrictions on pot, although medicinal marijuana still remains legal there.) Voters also showed the door to overly punitive prosecutors like Harris County, Tex., District Attorney Devon Anderson (see my post about her here), and Birmingham, Ala., prosecutor Bill Veitch. In Tampa, a challenger won on an explicit reform campaign. It was the same story in New Mexico, where Marco Serna explicitly campaigned on ""treating people like people"" and getting addicts treatment, not prison time. His opponent ran a traditional law-and-order campaign. Serna won with over 70 percent  of the vote. It was a similar story in Denver. And of course over the last year or so we've seen aggressive prosecutors go down in Cleveland, Chicago, Jacksonville, Louisiana and eastern Mississippi, and as Maurice Chammah writes, we've seen black prosecutors touting reform agendas get elected in St. Louis, Orlando and the Atlanta suburbs. On the flip side, voters in Mississippi retained state Supreme Court justice Jim Kitchens, despite an aggressive effort by a couple of shadowy law-and-order groups to portray him as ""soft on crime."" Such efforts have been successful in the past. On the rare occasion that a justice interested in due process or the rights of the accused has made it onto the court, they've often lost the next election after aggressive, often blatantly dishonest ad campaigns from out-of-state groups like Law Enforcement Alliance of America (or in this case, the Center for Individual Freedom). It's so bad that some justices have outright admitted that fear of such attack ads can affect the way they and their colleagues vote in criminal cases when they're up for reelection. In that sense, Kitchens's victory last night is encouraging. So what to make of all of this? There's little evidence that the election of Donald Trump had anything at all to do with criminal-justice issues. That said, it's likely to kill any momentum for reform that remained at the federal level. It's hard to see the handful of reform-minded Republicans in Congress agitating to make criminal justice a priority in the current political environment -- or of the Republican leadership listening to them if they do. That said, most criminal-justice policy happens at the state and local level. And here, even in an election that swung overwhelmingly to the right, voters for the most part are still indicating that they want to rein in the excesses of the drug war, and they're continuing the recent trend toward punishing the most punitive of elected law enforcement officials. The one exception here is of course the death penalty. There are a couple of reasons for that. First, as I wrote above, the death penalty remains loaded with racial and culture war baggage. This election was as culture war-driven as any since 1992. There's a strong sentiment among most people that capital cases are reserved for the ""worst of the worst,"" and only for those for which there is overwhelming evidence of guilt. (Neither of these things is true. But we're discussing what voters want, not how well they're informed.) Second, for most people, the death penalty remains remote. Lots of people -- lots of white people in particular -- smoke pot, or know people who do. Lots of people -- and again, lots of poor, rural white people among them -- might know what it's like to be in the cross hairs of an overly aggressive prosecutor, or could envision it happening to them. But few people have much personal incentive to care about the death penalty. The typical voter -- of any race or ethnic background -- will never be accused of murder, much less wrongly accused. That happens to other people. Meanwhile, the typical voter can envision themselves or someone they know getting murdered. It's on the local news all the time. None of this is to say that the death penalty isn't important, or that the results from last night aren't disheartening. But the death penalty votes can be distinguished from what we saw elsewhere. To sum up, if Trump sticks to the rhetoric and promises we heard during the campaign, the next four years -- at least at the federal level -- look to be a dark age for reform. The names he's floating for cabinet positions are nightmarish. But there are still good reasons for reformers to feel optimistic about where voters stand on criminal-justice issues. Yes, America just elected a demagogue. But I've seen little evidence that they did so because of his grandstanding on these issues (with the obvious and important exception of immigration). Moreover, given Hillary Clinton's record, for anyone who wanted to vote on these issues, there really wasn't much in the way of an inspiring and viable alternative. While that's probably of little comfort for reformers, good news does come down ballot, where even in an overwhelmingly red election, voters in very red states and counties still managed to drive eight more nails into the coffin of pot prohibition, reject overly punitive prosecutors (and one exceptionally awful sheriff) and embrace reforms aimed at rehabilitation and redemption. Trump's election aside, there's still a strong appetite for reform at the state and local level."

It depends on each of us.	"   The meaning of this election will depend not on the president-elect but on what every one of us does today and tomorrow and the next day and the day after. The true contest begins only now. Over the past 15 months, the matters at stake have been written about extensively on these pages. Can we preserve a people united by a shared commitment to a democratic republic, if by nothing else? Can we secure the constitutional rights that make our commitment to a democratic republic real? Can we put racial domination behind us; abandon the denigration of women, sexual minorities, immigrants, the disabled and the religiously faithful; and also free our economy from the inequality traps set for us by globalization?  With high hope for the future, to paraphrase Lincoln, I nonetheless venture no prediction. The prayers of one side to put 11 million undocumented citizens on the path to citizenship and of the other side to deport them all cannot both be answered. The hopes of one side for an end to discrimination against transgender people and of the other side to be free of even having to think about transgender experiences cannot both be satisfied. Nor is it likely that, in the end, the prayers and hopes of either side will be answered fully. To believe in democracy is to accept the disappointment of the imperfect outcome. What good, then, is democracy? By virtue of participating in these contests, we are free. Only by participating in these contests can we be free. We are disappointed today but can try again for tomorrow. To be a democratic citizen requires endurance, resilience and tenacity. The project of self-government endures just as long as we are willing to accept our losses in electoral contests. If we cease to accept our losses, democracy is at an end. It must break up into ever smaller units, until it is no more. What makes us a united people is nothing more and nothing less than our willingness to accept political defeats. That's it -- the strange alchemy that makes democracy. But there's a vital second part to this question: What makes it possible to accept loss in the political arena? Only unshakable confidence that impartial judicial institutions will secure our constitutional rights. These rights limit the depth of the defeat we can suffer. To preserve ourselves as a people willing to concede elections, we need confidence in our mutual commitments to one another's constitutional rights. And if we are to have this confidence, we need judicial institutions that act with disinterestedness and impartiality. Compared with the antics of the FBI, the findings against Rolling Stone for defamation and against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's ""Bridgegate"" deputies bring sweet relief. Somewhere, out there, outside of Washington, the justice system still operates in plain and sensible ways, securing liberty and dispensing justice to all. This election has made clear that we have work to do to restore the value of disinterestedness in the nation's capital and everywhere. If we lose impartiality, we lose our democracy. Finally, as we speed toward being a society in which no ethnic group is in the majority, there is the question of whether we can refashion our social and economic relations to support liberty and justice for all. In this election, rural Americans and Americans without college degrees sought release from the trap of diminished opportunities. Sadly, their fine aspirations have gotten wretchedly mixed up with the desires of the David Dukes among us, and their amplifiers, including the president-elect. The David Dukes of our country find their solutions to our problems in the pursuit of racial purity and restored domination. In this election, they have gained far too much influence.  Each and every one of us can help unmix that mess by bringing our creativity to the question of how to reorganize educational and economic opportunities so that they are spread fairly throughout the population. Add to the list the task of engaging anew in a fight for hearts and minds, a quest to inspire a commitment to equality. Finally, let us begin, each and every one of us, to learn again how to listen. We are hearing important things from both sides that, in each case, the other side doesn't know how to hear. Surely, we all seek a just and lasting peace among ourselves. If so, three things are necessary: securing our peoplehood; securing our rights; and securing social equality and economic fairness. In a time where we seem to have no common projects, we should shift our collective focus to the one thing we do share: our constitutional union. We need to focus on restoring the health and functionality of our political institutions. With charity toward all, and malice toward none, I, for one, concede today. With charity toward all, and malice toward none, with firmness in the right as my own God helps me to work to discern the right, I, and others, too, I'm sure, commit to using pen and voice, argument and exhortation, tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that, at every phase of the great contest that faces us now. It is a worthy cause, an effort to rebuild our democratic republic and to forge a connected society with liberty and justice for all. What will become of us depends on each of us.

Just two days before Election Day, Republican businessman Donald Trump tweeted: ""The Electoral College is a disaster for a democracy."" As it turns out, without the Electoral College, Trump probably wouldn't be the president-elect. A day after Election Day, Clinton held a narrow lead in the popular vote, according to unofficial results tallied by The Associated Press. With nearly 125 million votes counted, Clinton had 47.7 percent of the vote and Trump had 47.5 percent. That's a lead of about 236,000 votes. Many states count votes after Election Day, so Clinton isn't guaranteed to keep her lead. However, most of the outstanding votes appear to be in Democratic-leaning states, making it very likely she will become the second Democratic candidate for president this century to win the popular vote but lose the presidency. The biggest chunk of uncounted votes is in California. Washington State, New York, Oregon and Maryland also have large numbers of uncounted votes. Clinton won all those states, and if the trends continue, she will pad her lead by more than 1 million votes. There are also votes to be counted in Arizona and Alaska, two Republican-leaning states. But they are far outnumbered by uncounted votes in Democratic states. Under the Electoral College system, each state gets one vote for each member of Congress representing the state. California has the most, with 55. Seven states have only three. The District of Columbia has three, even though the nation's capital has no vote in Congress. It takes 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency. Trump's total stands at 279, with races in Michigan, New Hampshire and Arizona too close to call. There have been occasional calls to scrap the Electoral College, with no success. The latest push came after the 2000 presidential election, in which Democrat Al Gore lost to Republican George W. Bush, despite winning the popular vote. Any calls to scrap the Electoral College aren't likely to go anywhere this time, either, with Republicans controlling both the House and Senate. Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic candidate for vice president, praised Clinton on Wednesday for winning the popular vote. But when Clinton made her concession speech, she didn't mention it. ___ Follow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter at http://twitter.com/stephenatap Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The unnamed officer's federal lawsuit says he was struck in the face by a piece of concrete or a ""rock like substance"" thrown at police during a July 9 protest over the death of Alton Sterling, a black man shot and killed during a scuffle with two white officers. The suit doesn't accuse Mckesson of throwing anything at officers but claims he ""incited the violence"" on behalf of Black Lives Matter, which also is named as a defendant. Mckesson ""was in charge of the protests and he was seen and heard giving orders throughout the day and night of the protests,"" the suit says. ""The protest turned into a riot."" The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, says the officer lost teeth and had injuries to his jaw and brain. Mckesson, who said he hasn't seen the suit and couldn't immediately comment on it, was among nearly 200 protesters arrested during the protests sparked by Sterling's fatal shooting July 5. He and other protesters have sued the city of Baton Rouge over their arrests, accusing police of using excessive force and violating their constitutional rights. The officer suing Mckesson is identified only as ""John Doe"" in the suit, saying the anonymity is ""for his protection."" A separate court filing Monday cited the July 7 sniper attack that killed five Dallas police officers and the July 17 shooting that killed three law-enforcement officers in Baton Rouge as grounds for concealing the officer's identity. The suit describes Black Lives Matter as a ""national unincorporated association"" and claims Mckesson is a ""managing member"" of it. Mckesson described himself as a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement.  ""No organization started the movement,"" he said. Dane Ciolino, a Loyola University law professor in New Orleans, said it's ""really unusual"" for the officer to sue under a pseudonym in a case of this kind. Ciolino also said it could be difficult for the officer's attorneys to prove that Mckesson or Black Lives Matter ""aided and abetted"" the alleged battery or somehow negligently allowed it to happen.  ""Black Lives Matter is just a social movement. It's not an entity. I don't know how it could be liable,"" he said. Donna Grodner, a Baton Rouge-based attorney for the officer, declined to elaborate on the suit's allegations. She said the officer is still being treated for his injuries. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards has defended the police response to the protests. The governor, a Democrat who comes from a family of sheriffs, also noted that a police officer had teeth knocked out by a rock during the protests. It's unclear if that officer is the same one suing. Baton Rouge Police Sgt. Don Coppola, a department spokesman, declined to comment on the suit. Mckesson, a Baltimore resident, was arrested July 9 near Baton Rouge police headquarters on a charge of obstructing a highway. East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore has said Mckesson is one of roughly 100 arrested protesters who will not be prosecuted by his office for the same charge.
