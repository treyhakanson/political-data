My father routinely lies to me. When I was growing up he sold his business for several million dollars. He chose not to pay his taxes, invested the money, lost it all and then kept it hidden from my mother until the truth came out that he was under IRS investigation. He has always been secretive and deceptive with his money, hiding money in the ceiling, taping it to the backs of photo frames and opening secret bank accounts and bragging that my mom didn't have access. Fast-forward 10 years. My parents are divorced. I paid my own way through college, spent four years in counseling and am in the process of buying my first home. My dad agreed to give me $10,000 toward my down payment in lieu of contributing toward a wedding. Two weeks later he denied ever having that conversation. Last month, he was bragging about saving more than $75,000 in 2015. He says he received approximately $500,000 in inheritance. When my offer was accepted on a home, I let him know that I needed him to write the check. He accused me of being ""manipulative"" and ""backing him into a corner."" Now I am angry and bitter. I don't know if I should still try to work toward having a healthy relationship, or back off with the realization that his money is more important to him than keeping his word. What do you think? Sad  Sad: I'm wondering what you learned in four years of therapy that you would actually go to your father for money, or believe him when he dangles it in front of you. According to you, he has always lied, cheated and lost when it comes to money. You should not have any financial dealings with him. Furthermore, you should check your own wallet after spending time with him. He sounds like an operator.  Dear Amy: Every three years I visit my home town and stay with my brother and his wife for about 12 days. I make a sincere effort to be considerate, giving them space, doing some cooking and buying supplies. I take them out to dinner and rent my own car. This year they took time off from their business to gadabout with me. I was thrilled they could join me, because visiting them (and other family members and friends) is why I go home. On my departure day, my brother told me which washing cycle to use for washing the sheets. I put the sheets in the washer. I then had to get ready to leave for the airport. When I got home, I got a text from my brother. He said that when he got home the sheets were still in the washer and all moldy (I doubt that). He said, ""I'm not your maid,"" and implied that I did this on purpose. I was shocked! I sent a thank-you card and apologized for forgetting the sheets. I had no idea he felt this way. His wife was pleasant enough during my visit, but didn't seem energetic or happy. She works from home, and they eat most of their meals out. Now I wonder if they even want to have a relationship with me! Right now, I am doing nothing to be in touch. What's your take? Holy Cow!  Holy Cow: My take on this is that 12 days is too long for you to visit. Your brother and his wife have responded to this in an exceedingly passive-aggressive way, but you have apologized, and they should accept your apology. I hope you will continue to keep in touch with them. This seems to have strained your relationship; please don't let it end it. In the future, you should perhaps look for an Airbnb place to stay; then you could spend time with your family members without creating a strain on the household.  Dear Amy: For ""Left-Out Liberal,"" who can barely stand to discuss politics because she and her husband disagree, my parents disagreed on religion (she was very active in her church, he was lapsed), and so they agreed from the beginning not to discuss religion. However, in their case they did agree on politics. Politics was the dinner topic every evening of my childhood. The couple should shift to topics they can discuss. Kate  Kate: This tough political year has a lot of families on a slow boil. I hope we all settle down soon.    2016 by the Chicago Tribune  "

Earlier this month, Jakarta was rocked by a massive protest by conservative Muslims against the popular Gov. Asuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaja Purnama, with one person killed and dozens injured in rioting. Hard-liners have threatened more protests if Ahok isn't arrested. Police last week named Ahok as a suspect in the blasphemy investigation. The rally Saturday attracted more than 10,000 people, including religious leaders, legislators and members of human rights groups, who marched at the National Monument and along nearby main streets.  ""We are gathering here not to protest but to show that we are not easily divided by religious or political issues,"" said Budiman Sujatmiko, a legislator from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, the country's largest political group. The crowd, many waving the red-and-white national flag, cheered and chanted ""United Indonesia cannot not be defeated."" The Islamic Defenders Front, a vigilante group that wants to impose Shariah law in secular Indonesia, began demanding Ahok's arrest after a video circulated online in which he joked to an audience about a passage in the Quran that could be interpreted as prohibiting Muslims from accepting non-Muslims as leaders. The governor has apologized for the comment. Blasphemy is a criminal offense in Indonesia. Amnesty International documented 106 convictions between 2004 and 2014, with some individuals imprisoned for up to five years. Ahok is the second Christian governor of Jakarta since Indonesia declared independence in 1945, and the first ethnic Chinese to run the sprawling, chaotic city. He is popular with the city's middle class, but has made enemies from a tough stance against corruption and an urban program that has evicted thousands of the city's poorest from slums.

Romney appeared to warmly shake hands with Trump, each man gripping the arm of the other, as he arrived at Trump's New Jersey golf course. The two exchanged pleasantries, with Trump placing his hand on Romney's back, and disappeared behind a large brown door with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. After the meeting, which lasted for more than an hour, Romney said the men had a ""very thorough and in-depth discussion"" regarding ""the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance."" Romney said that he and Trump exchanged views and that he looks forward to the new administration. Trump said of the meeting: ""It went great.""

According to the Kremlin, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Monday, agreeing that U.S.-Russian relations are ""unsatisfactory"" and vowing to work together to improve them.

Romney told CNN in June that a Trump presidency could bring ""trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny"" to the nation. In a speech, Romney called the real estate mogul a ""con man"" and a ""fake."" Trump said Romney ""blew it"" and ""choked like a dog"" in his failed bid to unseat President Obama in 2012, and he called the former Massachusetts governor ""one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics.""  [Trump demands apology from 'Hamilton' after cast's message to Pence]  Trump and Pence are spending the weekend at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., in a nearly constant stream of meetings with potential administration hires and others looking to dispense advice. Trump said Saturday evening that he was seeing ""tremendous talent."" When asked if his cabinet was being shaped, he said: ""Yes. Partially. We're doing this again tomorrow."" He and Pence met earlier in the day with retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, a potential pick for secretary of defense who could be seen as a rebuke to President Obama. Mattis oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East from 2010 to 2013. He was said to have consistently pushed the military to punish Iran and its allies, including calling for more covert actions to capture and kill Iranian operatives and interdictions of Iranian warships. Former defense officials said Mattis's views on Iran caused him to fall out of favor with the Obama administration, which was negotiating the Iranian nuclear deal at the time. Mattis, who also clashed with the administration over its response to the Arab Spring and how many troops to keep in Iraq, was forced to retire earlier than expected to clear room for his replacement at U.S. Central Command. Now a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Mattis has publicly criticized Obama's defense and national security policies.  When asked whether he would choose Mattis as defense secretary, Trump said: ""We'll see."" He called the retired general ""the real deal"" and a ""brilliant wonderful man."" A source familiar with transition discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that no decision has yet been reached about whether Mattis will join the Trump administration.         1 of 26       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                           Skip Ad   x           Here's what President-elect Donald Trump has been doing after the election      View Photos   He has been holding interviews and meeting with Congress and the president as he prepares to transition into the White House.

Rhee served three contentious years as chancellor of the District's schools, where she oversaw a rise in test scores but shuttered some schools, laid off nearly 700 teachers for poor performance and filled more than 91 principal openings that were created via firings, resignations and retirements. Rhee has been a supporter of Common Core, which Trump opposes. Trump also met with donor Betsy DeVos, who is also reportedly being considered for education secretary. DeVos is a proponent of charter schools and vouchers. Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire oncologist who advised Vice President Biden's efforts to combat cancer, also met with Trump and Pence on Saturday afternoon, as did conservative community development leader Robert L. Woodson Sr., who told The Washington Post that he is under consideration to be secretary of housing and urban development. The president-elect and vice president-elect are also planning to huddle this weekend with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an immigration hard-liner who is on Trump's transition team, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was ousted as chairman of Trump's transition team.   [Trump demands apology from 'Hamilton' after cast's message to Pence]  ""These meetings that the president-elect and vice president-elect are having really show . . . the depth to which we're going to pull in diverse ideas and different perspectives as we form this administration,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Saturday. Some visitors, he said, are ""potential administration hires,"" while others are coming only to offer advice. ""The president-elect is bringing together folks who have been on the opposite side of him politically,"" Miller said. Questions about Trump's ability to bring Americans together arose onstage Friday night on Broadway. In a morning tweetstorm -- a communication method that Trump often used as a candidate but that is unprecedented for a president-elect -- Trump claimed that Pence was ""harassed"" Friday night at a New York theater, where he went to see ""Hamilton,"" a Tony Award-winning musical about Founding Father Alexander Hamilton that features a diverse cast and crew. ""Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!"" Trump tweeted.  [Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump's Cabinet]  At the show's curtain call, the cast stood onstage as actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who portrays Hamilton nemesis Aaron Burr, addressed Pence, who apparently was walking out of the theater.  ""We sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir,"" Dixon said during his remarks. ""But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us -- all of us.""  A spokesman for the show told the Associated Press that Pence stood outside the theater to listen to Dixon.  Later, Trump took to Twitter, saying the cast should apologize for addressing Pence. ""The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!"" Dixon tweeted back to Trump: ""@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen."" Trump also used Twitter to address a $25 million settlement to end the fraud cases pending against Trump University, a defunct real estate seminar program. Trump, who had repeatedly claimed that he never settled lawsuits, despite doing so for years, now will likely not face the prospect of testifying in court during his presidential transition. ""I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country,"" Trump tweeted. He added: ""The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Friday that the settlement includes a $1 million penalty paid to the state for claiming the program was a ""university"" even though it did not offer degrees, violating New York education law.

So the cast of the Broadway musical ""Hamilton"" reportedly gathered at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York half an hour before the curtain rose Friday evening.   According to an account in Broadway.com, the cast dialed up Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show's writer and creator, and Jeffrey Seller, the producer, and together they crafted a message encouraging the incoming administration to uphold America's values on behalf of people of different backgrounds, beliefs and orientations.  The audience, however, did not know Pence was there until just moments before the curtain rose. Some speculated a VIP would be in attendance: As theater-goers arrived, they saw black Suburbans, Secret Service and an ambulance clogging the street outside. As they sat in their seats and waited in line for the bathroom, they speculated whether the VIP would be President-elect Donald Trump, or maybe first lady Michelle Obama, for a repeat performance.  Most of the audience members were in their red velvet seats when Pence entered the theater. He was greeted with loud boos, a smattering of cheers, and the flash of cellphone cameras. He waved as he walked to his seat in the orchestra section, Row F.    [Trump and Pence vs. 'Hamilton' cast: A collision of two Americas]     Police stand guard Friday as a motorcade carrying Vice President-elect Mike Pence leaves the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York. (Andres Kudacki/AP)  Shannon Stagman, 32, a researcher for an education nonprofit organization in Brooklyn who was seated in the mezzanine, said she heard the crowd's reaction work its way up the theater after the audience spotted Pence. ""From my vantage point, it sounded like the entire theater was booing,"" Stagman said. Christy Colburn, 43, of Boston, bought tickets to the musical as a Valentine's Day gift for her husband. She ended up sitting about 20 seats away from the vice president-elect, she said.  ""It was a mixed response, but it was overwhelmingly boos,"" she said. ""People kept booing after he sat down; it was almost uncomfortable. He smiled, and some people took his picture. He didn't seem that fazed by it."" ""Hamilton,"" a Broadway musical that has won 11 Tonys, usually provokes a loud and joyous reaction from its crowds. But that night, the reaction was heightened. ""This particular show, there are a lot of scenes that are very antithetical to the ideas of the Trump-Pence campaign that they've been running on. So I think that was resonating with people, knowing he was in the room,"" Stagman said.    [Arts critic: Why Trump gets theater completely and utterly wrong]   The musical chronicles Alexander Hamilton's roots as an orphan and immigrant, his rise to prominence via the war, and his contentious participation in the formation of the American government. It is noted for featuring a multicultural cast. The actor who currently stars as Alexander Hamilton, Javier Munoz, is Latino and openly gay. And Friday evening also sought to raise money for AIDS-related services as part of the annual Broadway Cares campaign. Theater and the arts have long been havens for members of the LGBT community, which has been vocal in condemning Pence's apparent past support of conversion therapy for gay people.      The cast of ""Hamilton"" delivered a message to Vice President-elect Mike Pence from stage after he watched the show at Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York on Nov. 18. Pence was booed by some audience members when he first walked in. (Twitter/Hamilton via Storyful)   The LGBT community and nonprofit groups such as the Human Rights Campaign have criticized Pence for signing a law as governor of Indiana that allowed business owners to decline to participate in same-sex weddings because of their religious beliefs. Pence later signed an amendment clarifying that the provision could not be used to discriminate based on sexual orientation, and he has not said that he will roll back gay rights under the new administration. Stagman said she had headed to the theater that night in search of a few hours of diversion. ""I was definitely looking forward to going to Hamilton as kind of an escape, to get away for a few hours from our current reality."" Instead, she was thrown into an unusual political experience, as the crowd clapped, hooted and hollered at the parts of the show that seemed to apply to Pence and President-elect Donald Trump's political agenda.  A song sung by King George III particularly resonated with the crowd. During the song ""What Comes Next?"" in which the character of King George III admonishes America of the challenges of ruling itself. During the stanza, actor Rory O'Malley paused several times as people cheered and shouted, as he sang lines like ""Do you know how hard it is to lead?"" and ""When your people say they hate you/ Don't come crawling back to me.""    [Read a 2015 review of ""Hamilton""]   But the biggest crowd reaction came to the words of the chorus jointly sung by Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis di Lafayette regarding the war: ""Immigrants, we get the job done."" The audience rose to its feet to give a standing ovation.  ""I've seen the show three times, it's always a big applause line, but the reaction last night was insane,"" said Stagman. Pence left just before intermission, and he returned to his seat after the lights were down.  The cast had known ahead of time that Pence was coming. Pence contacted the owner of the theater, the Nederlander Organization, to request several ""house seats"" from a reserve that is set aside for ""special guests and urgent last-minute needs,"" show spokesman Sam Rudy said. Pence paid for his tickets, although Rudy declined to say whether Pence paid face value or how many people were in his party. The Nederlander Organization notified the cast, crew and producers in advance of Pence's attendance.  As the show ended and the cast took a bow amid a standing ovation, Pence was already on his feet. Secret Service was ushering him out the exit when Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, stepped forward to address him.  ""You know, we have a guest in the audience this evening,"" he said to audience hoots and laughter. ""And Vice President-elect Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you will hear us just a few more moments. There's nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen. There's nothing to boo here. We're all here sharing a story of love. We have a message for you, sir. We hope that you will hear us out."" As he pulled a small piece of paper from his pocket, Dixon encouraged people to record and share what he was about to say, ""because this message needs to be spread far and wide."" The cast, in their 18th-century costumes, and the crew, in jeans and T-shirts, linked arms and hands behind Dixon. Audience members said Pence appeared to linger by the theater door, but Secret Service ushered him out. Still, he stood in the hallway to listen to the rest of Dixon's message, Rudy confirmed.  ""Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you, and we truly thank you for joining us here at 'Hamilton: An American Musical.' We really do,"" Dixon said to further applause. ""We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us . . ."" The crowd began to cheer, and Dixon raised a finger to silence them.  ""Our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us. All of us,"" he said, gesturing to the crowd.  The audience erupted in cheers again. ""Again, we truly thank you for sharing this show, this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colors, creeds and orientations."" Stagman said that despite some booing when Pence arrived, the cast's tone was gracious, and the vibe in the audience wasn't negative. ""It was more like, wow, that was a weird experience, and interesting that we got to be part of this moment of a group of us getting to express ourselves to elected officials, which isn't something that most of us get to do very often."" ""We got to speak out,"" she added. ""I think that's really important right now.""  As they exited the theater, audience members saw a few protesters outside. One woman held a sign reading, ""Immigrants we get the job done.""  Peter Marks, Ellen McCarthy and Michael O'Sullivan contributed to this report.  "

That we need everyone, Democrat, Republican or Independent, to know why it's a really, really troubling speech for a president of the United States who has taken an oath of office to say that it doesn't really matter if the legislation passes laws that I want them to pass, I've got a pen and I've got a phone.

Your job is about the administration of justice because the checks and balances that you believed in two weeks ago and that [the Federalist Society] was founded about 35 years ago are not just your new callings when you take the oath, but you have this special new catechetical opportunity.

Police barricaded key roads in downtown Kuala Lumpur and put water-cannon trucks on standby, but it did not stop protesters. Some were chanting ""Save Democracy"" and ""Bersih, Bersih""-- the name of the electoral reform group that organized the rally. The name means ""clean"" in the Malay language. The protesters gathered around the Independent Square, the main venue that was locked down by police. A smaller group of red-shirt pro-government supporters held a counter-rally. Najib, who is attending an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru, has kept an iron grip since graft allegations emerged two years ago involving the indebted 1MDB state fund that he founded. 1MDB is at the center of investigations in the U.S. and several other countries. Najib, who has denied any wrongdoing, has said he won't be cowed by the rallies. In a statement on his blog, Najib called Bersih ""deceitful"" and said the group has become a tool for opposition parties to unseat a democratically elected government.  ""We want to see Malaysia more developed and not robbed of billions of ringgit,"" said Wan Aisyah Wan Ariffin, an opposition supporter. Police said in a statement they raided the Bersih office on Friday and detained its chairwoman Maria Chin for investigation into ""activities detrimental to parliamentary democracy."" Another Bersih official, Mandeep Singh, and 12 others including several politicians were also detained, mostly in connection with the rally and to prevent rioting, the police said. Those detained include ruling party politician Jamal Mohamad Yunos, whose supporters trooped to downtown Kuala Lumpur to counter the Bersih rally. Police have banned both events by Bersih's yellow-shirt supporters and Jamal's red-shirt group. Bersih said on Twitter that another of its official, Hishamuddin Rais, was nabbed Saturday after giving a speech to supporters at a commuter station. A rally that Bersih organized in August 2015 also demanding Najib's resignation brought together 50,000 people, according to police estimates. Bersih said the number was much higher. Human rights group Amnesty International slammed the crackdown and called for the immediate release of the Bersih activists, describing them as prisoners of conscience.  ""These arrests are the latest in a series of crude and heavy-handed attempts to intimidate Malaysian civil society activists and other human rights defenders,"" Amnesty said in a statement. The investigations into 1MDB fund are centered on allegations of a global embezzlement and money-laundering scheme. Najib started the fund shortly after taking office in 2009 to promote economic development projects, but the fund accumulated billions in debt over the years. The U.S. Justice Department said that at least $3.5 billion had been stolen from 1MDB by people close to Najib and initiated action in July to seize $1.3 billion it said was taken from the fund to buy assets in the U.S. The U.S. government complaints also said that more than $700 million had landed in the accounts of ""Malaysian Official 1."" They did not name the official, but appear to be referring to Najib. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(David McNew/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)  Shadi Hamid is a senior fellow in the Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution and author of ""Islamic Exceptionalism: How the Struggle Over Islam Is Reshaping the World."" Are people who believe in deplorable things themselves ""deplorable""? Donald Trump voters, whether they intended to or not, empowered racists. Many hold misogynistic and Islamophobic views, even if they might like to believe that they don't. But this should not -- it cannot -- have much bearing on whether someone is ""good"" or ""bad"" in an absolute sense. To prioritize one's tribe or family to the exclusion of others has long been a universal condition. The nature of this in-group identity is malleable and can morph from ethnic to religious to nationalist identities. Whatever its form, however, it remains a potent force, steeped as it is in those most natural of sentiments -- fear and the will to survive. As anthropologist Scott Atran writes: ""Across most of human history and cultures, violence against other groups was considered a moral virtue."" Today we know that the desire to exclude shouldn't be the norm, but that doesn't make it any less a part of who we are.   [America's working class has its own culture. And they will fight to keep it.]   Until Donald Trump's victory shattered the idea, liberals -- many of whom didn't know a single Trump voter -- could content themselves with the remarkable progress of the Obama era: gay marriage, universal health care and the growing willingness to confront the realities of sexual assault and police brutality. Maybe we were fundamentally good people. But, as the philosopher John Gray writes: ""Sooner or later anyone who believes in human goodness is bound to reinvent the idea of evil in a cruder form."" The ""arc of history"" is supposed to bend toward justice, leaving those that resist it enemies of both history and progress. Evil comes to be seen as something that is outside of us, which must not merely be fought but excised entirely. When someone writes that there is no such thing as a ""good"" Trump voter, the sentiment is understandable, fitting as it does within the modern liberal conception of progress. But it fundamentally misunderstands the very nature of good and evil. For me, the more useful question isn't why Trump voters voted for him, but, rather, why they wouldn't. It seems self-evident that minorities would generally vote for the party that goes out of its way to consider -- and protect -- the rights of minorities. In a period of ""existential"" politics, that's naturally what takes precedence over other concerns. Why would whites, or at least a large percentage of them, act any differently? It has become common to assume a permanent Democratic majority in due time, as a result of irreversible demographic trends. In cruder terms, it amounts to longing for immigration and minority birth rates to erode white majorities on both the national and state levels. But this has profound implications, since it ""practically compels whites to behave electorally like a minority constituency."" In this respect, white nationalism or white identity politics overlap with racism, but they are not quite the same thing. After all, if I was a member of the so-called ""white working class"" rather than an American Muslim, I can't be sure I wouldn't have voted for Trump. This may make me a flawed person or even, as some would have it, a ""racist."" But it would also make me rational, voting if not in my economic self-interest then at least in my emotional self-interest.   [States are a relic of the past. It's time to get rid of them.]   There is, of course, another way of seeing this -- one that in many ways is easier and more pure. It would certainly feel good to think I'm morally superior to Trump supporters.  I could take refuge in outright disdain for those who haven't seen the light. But it is unclear what this kind of purity and certainty -- the self-satisfaction of knowing that we were right, despite everything -- can really do for us. It leaves us without a path forward. It is also contrary to most of what we know about human nature: Good and bad have never been separate or easily distinguishable categories. They are endlessly intertwined. That Americans increasingly insist on separating people into good and bad suggests an unwillingness to understand -- much less empathize with -- those who threaten our conception of America, whatever that happens to be. I could try to explain what I think our nation is, but I can no longer be sure if tens of millions of my fellow citizens would agree. But I cannot simply take solace in the fact that soon there will be more non-whites and therefore more people who share my ideology. This is a recipe for more conflict, not less. Well before Brexit and the rise of Trump, Bulgarian political scientist Ivan Krastev wrote that ""threatened majorities -- those who have everything and who fear everything -- have emerged as the major force in European politics."" They feel threatened in the United States as well; the only difference, perhaps, is that they do not have everything but still fear everything. Yet as demographics inexorably shift, both the perception and reality of this ""threat"" will only grow. Unless something changes, American politics will continue to collapse along ethnic lines. The task ahead of us comes down to preventing what, for now, seems sadly inevitable. Read more: Lawrence R. Samuel: States are a relic of the past. It's time to get rid of them. Dale M. Coulter: America's working class has its own culture. And they will fight to keep it."

The military alliance says both leaders agreed during a telephone call on Friday that progress has been made on making sure member countries are sharing the defense burden, but that there is more to do. NATO became a debated part of the presidential election after Trump suggested that the U.S. might abandon its NATO treaty commitments and pull out of the alliance if other countries don't contribute more. The alliance statement says Stoltenberg looks forward to welcoming Trump to Brussels for next year's NATO summit. ___ 1:20 p.m. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz says last week's election could be called ""the revenge of flyover country."" In his speech at the conservative Federalist Society Friday, the Republican senator said the ""utter astonishment"" of Democrats is a result of not listening to the American people. He said voices were crying, ""leave us alone."" Cruz lost the GOP primary to President-elect Donald Trump, and didn't endorse him until late in the race. Without mentioning Trump by name, Cruz said Republicans should move forward by being honest and trustworthy and remembering they serve a cause greater than themselves. When asked if he might be a candidate for the Supreme Court's open seat, Cruz said ""history is long and can take unexpected paths,"" but he looks forward to continuing his time in the Senate. __ 12:40 p.m. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley says Donald Trump won election as president by running against both political parties. Haley is telling conservative lawyers who are meeting in Washington Friday that Trump's victory offers Republicans a chance to regain the public's trust, but only if the party restrains spending and returns power to the states. Haley says voters rejected ""the political class of all stripes, Republicans included."" She says now Republican control of the White House and Congress offers the party a rare opportunity, and that it's important that Trump and Republican leaders in Congress take action quickly and ""we don't stop."" Haley acknowledges that she was not Trump's ""biggest cheerleader."" But she said she voted for him and was thrilled that he won. ___ 12:30 p.m. Among the people meeting with the president-elect this weekend: the man who marshalled more outside money than anyone else to help Donald Trump win the White House. Todd Ricketts, a co-owner of the Chicago Cubs, helped raise at least $66 million for outside groups called Future 45 and the 45 Committee -- a nod the incoming 45th president. Ricketts is emblematic of what a topsy-turvy election it has been. Before helping Trump, Ricketts was part of a super PAC that spent more than any other trying to stop him from winning the Republican nomination. Ricketts lives in Chicago and is a small business owner and board member of TD Ameritrade, which his billionaire father founded. Trump's team is turning its attention to economic positions in the administration, including the Department of Commerce. __ 11:55 a.m. Donald Trump is stoking speculation about his future cabinet picks as he continues holding meetings behind closed doors. Trump aides say the president-elect will be meeting Saturday with retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis. Mattis is a potential contender to serve as Trump's defense secretary. Trump is also meeting with Michelle Rhee and Betsy DeVos, two well-known education activists. Trump aides have cautioned that not everyone meeting with the president-elect is under consideration for an administration position. They say Trump is meeting with experts to hear their thoughts and advice. Also expected to sit down with Trump on Saturday are 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, anti-poverty advocate Bob Woodson, and restaurant executive Andy Puzder. __ 11:20 a.m. A Democratic House member says attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions is the right pick ""if you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen."" Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., says no senator has fought harder ""against the hopes and aspirations"" of Latinos, immigrants and people of color. Gutierrez is a member of the House Judiciary Committee. While the Senate, not the House, will decide if Sessions should be confirmed, the comments by Gutierrez suggest the process will likely be contentious. Sen. Sessions, R-Ala., is one of the more conservative members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and has said the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division should not be used as a ""sword"" to promote political agendas. The Senate denied him a federal judgeship in 1986 after he was accused of making racially charged remarks while U.S. attorney in Alabama. ___ 10:50 a.m. Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley says he is confident his panel would approve the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Sessions would still face a vote by the full Senate, but a committee endorsement would be a critical first step. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, says Sessions is a respected colleague who ""has worked across the aisle on major legislation."" Grassley added that as a former U.S. attorney, Sessions has the right background. ___ 10:40 a.m. Mike Pompeo, a conservative Republican congressman from Kansas, says he accepts President-elect Donald Trump's decision to nominate him to lead the CIA. In a statement on Friday, he said that while he has loved representing Kansans in Congress, the opportunity to lead a top U.S. intelligence agency is a call to service he can't ignore. Pompeo still must be confirmed by the Senate. The 52-year-old was elected to Congress during the tea party wave of 2010. Pompeo has been a harsh critic of the Obama administration. He denounced the Iran deal, which granted Tehran sanctions relief for rolling back its nuclear weapons program, and was a member of the congressional committee that blasted Hillary Clinton over the attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Libya. ___ 8:15 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump has picked Mike Pompeo (pahm-PAY'-oh) -- a Kansas congressman -- to be CIA director. That's according to a Trump transition official. Pompeo is a conservative Republican and a fierce critic of President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. Trump is beginning to fill out his governing team, and the transition official says Trump will make the Pompeo announcement on Friday morning, along with his nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general and his selection of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be national security adviser. The official wasn't authorized to disclose the decisions ahead of Trump's announcement and insisted on anonymity. --By Julie Pace ___ 8 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump is offering the post of attorney general to Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, one of the Trump's closest and most consistent allies. That's according to a senior Trump official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the conversation. The official on Friday wouldn't say whether Sessions had accepted the job, which left open the possibility that the arrangement was not finalized. Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump and was a close adviser throughout the campaign. Trump released a statement Thursday after a meeting with the senator saying he was ""unbelievably impressed"" with Sessions. The Alabama Republican previously struggled with a Senate confirmation hearing when he was nominated for a federal judgeship in 1986. He was dogged by racist comments he was accused of making while serving as U.S. attorney in Alabama. He later withdrew from consideration for the post. --By Jonathan Lemire. ___ 6:50 a.m. A Republican Party spokesman says President-elect Donald Trump is searching among ""the best and brightest in the country"" to set up his administration. RNC communications director Sean Spicer tells Fox News Channel's ""Fox and Friends"" the billionaire businessman isn't ""looking at someone's political affiliation, whether they supported him or not."" He was asked the question in the context of Trump's scheduled meeting this weekend with 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who earlier this year was a harsh critic of the real estate mogul. Spicer wouldn't comment on whether Trump was set to offer Romney a position in the administration now being formed. But when asked what the pair was expected to discuss, the Republican strategist said only that ""they're going to have a conversation."" Spicer called Trump the ""new sheriff in town"" and said he's determined to bring qualified people into his administration. ___ 3:35 a.m. President-elect Donald Trump is offering former military intelligence chief Michael Flynn the position of national security adviser, elevating a fierce critic of current U.S. foreign policy into a crucial White House role. Flynn's selection amounts to Trump's first signal to allies and adversaries about the course he could take in office. It's unclear whether Flynn, a retired Army general, has accepted the job, though a senior transition official confirmed Thursday that the president-elect has made the offer. The official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly and insisted on anonymity. Flynn was a fierce critic of President Barack Obama's military and foreign policy long before he began advising Trump on national security issues during the presidential campaign. While the position of national security adviser doesn't require Senate confirmation, Flynn would work in the West Wing and have frequent access to the president. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

And every year, at least for those who come from your typical, slightly dysfunctional but lovably kooky family, the idea that we'd need an entire coping strategy to get through one meal seems a bit histrionic. This year is different. Hoooboy, do some of us need advice on how to get along with our families after a year like this one. Could we postpone Thanksgiving for another month or so, until we've all cooled down? No? Okay then, let's take a deep breath, set out the decorative gourds, and dive in:   O'Neill thanksgiving plan: 3-6PM pro-Clinton family dines, leaves 6:15 new turkey/sides ready 6:30-9:30 pro-Trump family arrives, dines -- Kevin O'Neill (@KevinBuffalo) November 9, 2016     Can't wait to make fun of my #libtard cousin at thanksgiving.  -- Some guy (@J_r0dd) November 10, 2016     Hello, my name is Brody and this Thanksgiving I'll be playing the role of Angry Liberal Cousin. -- Brody Trash (@brodythesloth) November 11, 2016     Lucky for me, I've been uninvited from Thanksgiving dinner for being a Trump supporter so I don't have to spend the day with sore losers. -- T R I U M P H (@aeonicsonic) November 13, 2016   Oof. ""Every single patient I have seen has been talking about different aspects of the election and how it's affected them, even young kids,"" said Cynthia Mathis, a licensed marriage and family therapist with McLean Psychotherapy Practices. ""Some of them are concerned about Thanksgiving and what that will be like, being together with relatives. Should they talk about it, or would it be better to keep the peace?"" The answer depends on a person's tolerance for conflict and their family's communication style. For families of mixed political beliefs, there are five ways this could turn out.   [Thanksgiving Central: Your essential menu planner]   1. Everyone gets in a ""Real Housewives""-style table-flipping, screaming match.    Thanksgiving dinner is going to be a whodunit where I gather everyone around the table and reveal the racists one by one. -- Louis Virtel (@louisvirtel) November 14, 2016   Rob Rains, 32, who lives in the District, voted for Clinton. His mother voted for Trump. He thinks his Thanksgiving visit to Cleveland, his home town, could be rough. ""We just are at loggerheads,"" he said. ""I'm sure at some point there will be some shouting match about it."" John W., a 40-year-old state police officer who lives in Cherokee County, Ga., and who is one of the few Trump voters in his family, anticipates some ""loud exchanges."" ""I like seeing liberals' heads explode about it. It warms my heart,"" he said, half-joking. One of those liberals: his cousin, a Bernie Sanders fan who ""has a master's degree in feminist dance therapy or something like that,"" said John, who asked that his last name not be used. ""I had to tell him, 'I'm not going to gloat, I'm not going to parade myself around during Thanksgiving dinner,'"" said John. But he added that his wife doesn't trust him to keep that promise and will be kicking him under the table all night. The cousin, he thinks, may come armed with some arguments from DailyKos. Some liberals in particular say they feel obliged to bring up politics, because ignoring it for the sake of a polite turkey dinner would be implicitly condoning a vote against disenfranchised groups' rights. ""It's never not the time to start a fight about this,"" said Louis Virtel, a television writer in Los Angeles who fears that members of his extended family in the Midwest voted for Trump. ""I can't pretend . . . that my entire lifestyle is not compromised by them voting against what I am."" Virtel is gay. Sarah Briggs, a licensed professional counselor and co-owner of Creative Therapy in Fairfax, says those discussions can be valuable even if they get heated. Some liberal voters think it is ""incongruent that somebody might vote for DT but might still maintain a core value system that is not racist or not sexist,"" she said. ""People are trying to understand that, and to understand that, there has to be some kind of conversation."" 2.

She would know: Magyarics works as a freelance wine and spirits writer. But when her conservative in-laws visit from Pennsylvania, she acknowledged, ""There's no good that can come of talking about it, especially after we have a few glasses of wine."" But maybe Jack Daniel makes a good mediator. John, the policeman, says he told his family he would bring a bottle of good whiskey to take the edge off their political conversation. His most liberal cousin ""seemed agreeable to that,"" he said. 3.

""You get a feeling that people you've known your whole life aren't as on your side as you think,"" he said. ""I'm somewhat reluctant to be around that."" But shutting one another out, some say, is the way this election became so corrosive in the first place. ""To hell with Facebook. What we need now is face time.

If her family won't let it rest, she plans to go to the other room to cook or do dishes. That's a good strategy for de-escalation, Mathis says. ""You can only control yourself and be in charge of what you do. If other people are doing upsetting things, hopefully there are other people to talk to,"" she said. And if not, you can just play some Adele. 5. Everyone has a respectful conversation over some turkey and pumpkin pie and comes away with a better understanding of one another.

Do such families exist? ""If you have a family that is very good at communication and can be respectful of others' views, it might be okay to discuss it,"" Mathis said. That's the case for Ian BrowningSmith, 26, of Palatine, Ill. His mother is a Clinton supporter -- so much of one that she had pre-booked a hotel room in Washington, anticipating attending the inauguration of the country's first female president. Her son voted for Libertarian Gary Johnson, turned off by Clinton's establishment status. His mom is okay with it. They're not going to fight. And that's what he's thankful for this Thanksgiving: ""To have a family that's very understanding, that doesn't fight over what's more or less petty politics,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, we're still going to be a family, we're still going to love each other. I'm thankful because a lot of people aren't going to have that."""

Here’s why.	"   Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump cheer during an election rally on Nov. 9 in New York. (AP/ Evan Vucci)  Donald Trump's election as president startled many Americans. A number of observers commented that Trump's campaign represented a set of illiberal values and policy positions far outside of the United States' political traditions of individual rights, equality and democracy. But in many ways, Trump represents a return to the historical norm. Such classical liberal values have often not predominated in the United States. In fact, they have always logically competed against -- while being politically intertwined with -- a set of commitments to hierarchies of race, nationality and religion, among others. Indeed for much of American history, these illiberal values held sway. The U.S. is emerging from an exceptional period of caution about race and ethnic nationalism Since the 1940s, chastened by the example of Nazism and conscious of the U.S.'s modern global responsibilities, both major parties have avoided more overt racism and ethno-nationalism. But the U.S. has always had at least one (and often more than one) major political party devoted to some notion of white nationalism. From its founding in the 1820s up until the 1940s, the Democratic Party was explicitly devoted to white supremacy, first supporting slavery and then Jim Crow.   [This book helps explain the rise of Donald Trump]   Similarly, since the end of Radical Reconstruction, the Republicans (like their Whig predecessors) have advocated a variety of immigration restrictions for certain nationalities and religions -- positions that the party increasingly stressed as part of its ""Southern Strategy"" of appealing to racial conservatives beginning in the 1960s. Trump emphasized these themes more explicitly during his campaign. U.S. efforts toward racial equality have come during wars  As we have written, illiberal beliefs and practices have been so strong that the United States has usually only made significant progress toward racial equality only under the exigencies of war. For example, African American rights only advanced dramatically during three periods in U.S. history -- during the Revolutionary War, the Civil War and immediately after, and most recently during World War II and the Cold War.   [The education gap among whites this year wasn't about education. It was about race.]   In each of these periods the United States was fighting a war against illiberal enemies, prompting it to highlight its own liberal values. In addition, each of these were big wars in which victory required African Americans as soldiers, sailors, defense workers, and at the very least, quiescent citizens. Finally, and perhaps most important, black and white civil rights advocates used wartime pressures to leverage for legal changes. But for many white Americans, these advances were instrumental to the need to win the war and accepted only grudgingly. Wartime pressures for equality were felt most keenly at the elite level. Most ordinary white Americans were apathetic at best about such changes. Many were virulently opposed. Once the external pressures of war were removed, the elite consensus broke down, allowing various factions to encourage and harness these racial sentiments for their own political ends. But the Cold War ended 20 years ago These historical patterns help explain Trump's election victory. After the Cold War ended with the fall of the Communist bloc in 1989, the United States no longer faced the external pressures that had pushed it toward greater egalitarianism. Moreover, rising levels of immigration combined with the 9/11 attacks moved many American in the direction of great ethnocentrism and nationalism. Furthermore, the rise of right-wing nationalist movements in Western Europe has provided inspiration and encouragement to similar movements in the United States. Racial conservatives who had abandoned legal segregation began fiercely attacking measures designed to aid nonwhites. Nevertheless, the 1965 Immigration Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act combined to increase the political clout of nonwhites, making possible President Obama's election in 2008. Aside from these historical legacies, recent decades have seen little overall progress for African Americans relative to white Americans. In recent years, conservative Republicans have successfully litigated to weaken the Voting Rights Act, culminating in the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which eliminated the federal government's ability to review in advance changes in voting laws and regulations in historically discriminatory states. In response, many states have enacted restrictive voting laws that disproportionately exclude minority voters.   [Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had a very good election night]   In the wake of these shifts, U.S. voting patterns have become even more racially polarized. Scholars like Michael Tesler, Christopher Parker and Matt Barreto, and Marisa Abrajano and Zoltan Hajnal have shown how Republicans and Democrats are increasingly polarized by attitudes on race and immigration. In turn, race has become one of the best predictors of partisan preferences. To be sure, Trump appealed to many voters disgusted by gridlocked Washington elites and to those suffering economic stagnation. At the same time, he exploited and amplified these trends of racial, ethnic and religious polarization. He gained political prominence by denying the citizenship of the nation's first African American President. He ignited his successful presidential campaign by denouncing Mexican and later Muslim immigrants.   [Everything you need to know about the worldwide spread of populism]   Philip Klinkner's research has found that racial resentment, antipathy to Muslims, and belief that Obama is a Muslim were much more important factors in explaining support for Trump over Hillary Clinton than were income or economic attitudes. As President, Trump will likely accelerate the transformation of the Republicans into the party of white nationalism, which for many of his evangelical supporters means specifically white Christian nationalism. So now what? What does this mean for the future of American politics? A number of alternative scenarios are possible. Here's one: Trump presides over economic growth and some policies aiding white workers while avoiding catastrophic blunders. Meanwhile, Republicans continue to make it harder for nonwhites to vote. In this case, lightly perfumed white nationalism may predominate for years to come.   [How rural resentment helps explain the surprising victory of Donald Trump]   On the other hand, even some Republican-appointed judges have voided many of the most egregious vote suppression efforts. Demographic trends suggest that the U.S. may soon be a ""majority minority"" nation. Perhaps such shifts will mean only continued deep and paralyzing national polarization. But here's another possible scenario. Advocates of an egalitarian multicultural society devise policies to help accommodate and assist those white Americans made anxious and angry by their perceived cultural and economic eclipse. Meanwhile, if Trump's policies fail to improve the economic and cultural standing of those who voted for him, it's possible that the plurality of U.S. voters who chose Clinton may be joined by enough others to select a different president and vision of the United States in 2020.
