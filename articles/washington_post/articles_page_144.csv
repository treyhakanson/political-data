Kennewick Police Sgt. Ken Lattin said 69-year-old Sandra Harris was taken Friday by someone she knew. Lattin said her abductor then used Harris' cellphone to call her husband at work to demand an undisclosed amount of money in exchange for her return.  ""This was not a random act,"" Lattin said. ""They're not related. We're not exactly sure what the nature of the relationship was, but this was not random."" Local and federal law enforcement agencies contacted a kidnapper and negotiated for several hours, ultimately agreeing to pay the ransom. Authorities made the money exchange just before 10 p.m. near the town of Eltopia, and shortly after they arrested a suspect: 49-year-old Theresa Wiltse of Connell, Washington. Wiltse was driving a rental car with California plates, according to a statement from police, and she was the only person in the car. Wiltse is being held in the Benton County jail without bond on suspicion of kidnapping. It wasn't immediately clear if she had retained an attorney.  ""There's possibly another suspect or suspects involved, or it's possible she acted alone,"" Lattin said. He said they didn't know what condition Harris is in or where she might be. Abductions for ransom are rare in the United States.  ""They are unusual for us here as well,"" Lattin said. ""I've been here 28 years, our chief has been here 35 years plus, and that's not something that has happened during our lifetime here in Kennewick."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

EPA/SHAWN THEW  Defense hawks are quietly celebrating the election of Donald Trump  -- now, they might just get more than they ever dreamed possible. That's because Washington Republicans and the president elect have more in common on defense spending and priorities than it might seem given Trump's hardline foreign policy stance against immigration, his questioning of longstanding strategic alliances like NATO and support for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, a contender for a cabinet position, said on CNN Sunday that strengthening the military is a major priority of the president-elect. ""He's going  to be facing Putin with a country that is not diminishing it's military but a country that is dramatically increasing it to Reagan like levels,"" Giuliani said, invoking the Reagan mantra of ""peace through strength."" Trump and congressional Republicans are actually on the same page on a host of defense priorities, including increasing the number of active duty troops in the Army and size of the Navy, large-scale modernization of military facilities, weapons and the nuclear arsenal; and a dramatic spike in missile defense. And Trump -- despite benefiting politically during the campaign from hacks of Democratic political groups -- also touts the need for improved cyber security, which is already under discussion on Capitol Hill. ""This is all music to the ears of not only Republican leaders in defense, but many Democrats too,"" said Michael Herson, a prominent defense lobbyist. Trump's team hasn't laid out all the specifics yet on defense policy, which will be largely implemented by his defense secretary . A figure like Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) or Gen. Michael Flynn - both Trump campaign surrogates - could mean a different Pentagon than if the military establishment was headed by former Bush administration adviser Stephen Hadley, or an establishment hawk who has criticized Trump like Sen. Kelly Ayotte. The biggest obstacle to enacting a wide-ranging host of GOP defense priorities is the cost -- according to an estimate from the American Enterprise Institute's Mackenzie Eaglen and Rick Berger, anywhere from about $100 billion to $300 billion more over the next four years than President Obama's current plan. Congress can't legally spend that money until it gets rid of budget caps as part of the sequester holding spending check since the start of fiscal 2013. Trump called for the end of those budget caps on the campaign trail, promising he would ""ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military,"" during a September speech in Pennsylvania. House Armed Services Committee Chair Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.) ""is encouraged by the president elect's determination to rebuild America's military, a priority that Chairman Thornberry shares,"" his spokesman Claude Chafin said. So, apparently, are the markets: defense stocks spiked considerably the day after Trump's election -- with the stock value of some of the biggest defense contractors like Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and Lockheed jumping between more than 5 to 7.5 percent at the news. But there is still resistance in Congress to Trump's plans -- potentially from the more fiscally conservative Republicans and Democrats. ""There is considerably more demand for defense spending than there is money to meet that demand,"" House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said the morning of the election. ""Look at all the programs that are out there, from the B-21 (bomber) to upgrades to our submarines, upgrades to our arsenal, to rising personnel costs - add it all up and it is vastly more money than we're going to have. How do you deal with that?"" Under a Trump administration, finding a way to lift budget caps depends on whether lawmakers and the president-elect can agree on a series of tax reforms and entitlement cuts, both of which could spark intraparty conflict. For example: Trump the populist promised not to touch Social Security benefits, which are limited under House Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) fiscal plan. Progress is more likely on defense priorities because Republicans believe Trump is unlikely to adopt the Obama administration's stance that every dollar of discretionary defense spending be matched by a dollar of discretionary domestic spending, which covers  such programs as food stamps, community development and education programs, and transportation and infrastructure. Thornberry has frequently complained that Democrats' insistence on parity between domestic and defense spending effectively means defense budgets are ""held hostage"" to non-defense spending. The GOP argues that means the military must choose between rehabilitating planes so old they are running on scraped-together ""museum piece"" replacement parts and a credible missile defense; or between giving over-taxed and under-equipped soldiers a reasonable number of training hours and funding operations against the Islamic State. Republicans have sought to get around this by demanding emergency war funds - which are not subject to budget caps -- to cover certain defense spending. Democrats have repeatedly decried the tactic as a sneak attack to let the GOP avoid tough budget negotiations to end sequestration. If the sequestration hurdle is cleared, Washington's leading defense hawks are betting they start to see defense get a long-needed influx of cash. ""Nobody gets a blank check,"" Herson said. ""But I think we get the infusion we need to restore our strength."" The first targets for an increase would be infrastructure and materiel upgrades, replacing legacy systems, and boosting the military's recruitment program, which are already Republican priorities. Then could come some of the priorities Trump has identified -- such as ramping up thew Army up to 540,000 soldiers and increasing the Navy's fleet to 350 ships -- and, Republicans hope, increasing procurement dollars for next-generation bombers and missile defense. Trump has proposed cutting non-defense spending by about one percent a year, which could make way for more military investment. A recent estimate from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that under Trump's plan, by 2026, spending on non-defense programs would drop by anywhere from 29 to 37 percent.  "

(Isaiah J. Downing/USA Today Sports)  COLUMBUS, Ohio -- It was pure coincidence that the World Cup qualifying showdown between the United States and Mexico was scheduled the same week as the presidential election. And as the American soccer squad gathered here ahead of Friday's match at Mapfre Stadium, kicking off the final round of regional qualifiers for the 2018 tournament in Russia, the confluence of events was not lost on players who represent their country on the international stage more frequently than any other U.S. sports program. ""Given the way everything has gone [in the political arena] the last few months, there is an added layer to this game,"" captain Michael Bradley said before Wednesday's training session. ""But my general feeling is that we, as Americans, trust our system, we respect our democracy and, regardless of your beliefs, regardless of how you voted, we have an obligation to come together, get behind our new president and to have faith and trust that he will do what's best for the entire country. ""That's what we've always done and, in moments like this, it's easy to question things, but again, this is what makes our country great -- the fact that we have our system where every American can go and vote. The results may not be what every person wanted -- some people are happy, others aren't -- but the way forward is to come together and give our new president support and rally behind him."" Bradley said he remained awake late into the night at the team's downtown hotel and watched TV coverage of Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. ""The whole thing has been incredibly captivating. I followed it closely,"" said Bradley, a New Jersey native who joined MLS's Toronto FC last year after a long European career. Trump's campaign rhetoric about Mexico and immigration issues should not spill into the crowd Friday, Bradley said. ""I would hope our fans do what they always do, which is support our team in the best, most passionate way possible. I would hope they give every person in that stadium the respect they deserve, whether they are American, Mexican, neutral, men, women, children. I hope every person that comes to the stadium comes ready to enjoy what we all want to be a beautiful game between two sporting rivals that have a lot of respect for each other, and hope that it's a special night in every way."" Goalkeeper Tim Howard said he went to bed before the election results were clear. ""They count the votes and they tell me who's president in the morning,"" he said. ""I wouldn't have voted for Trump if I voted, but there it is."" Howard, a native of New Jersey who plays for the MLS's Colorado Rapids, reiterated that he didn't vote: ""Some guys [on the team] are more into politics than others. I'm not."" Asked whether Trump's comments about Mexico will raise the fervor at the sold-out stadium, Howard said: ""They are going to be excited hopefully for a U.S. win. It's politics and this is football. Mexico is going to try to kick our asses and we're going to try to kick theirs. It's got nothing to do with politics."" Christian Pulisic, who turned 18 in September, said he could've registered in time and voted, but ""I thought, 'Why? I'm not voting for either of these candidates,' so I didn't get to it."" In Germany, Pulisic said he was often asked about the election. ""Europeans are interested, and they are thinking, 'What's going on with this whole election thing?' They ask me about it, yeah, simple stuff like, 'Is this a joke?' And I am like, 'No, I think Donald Trump is really running for president. He has a real chance.' ""  "

Here are the key moments from that fervent address. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)   NEW YORK -- An emotional Hillary Clinton acknowledged a stunning political defeat inside a hotel ballroom in Manhattan on Wednesday morning, calling for her supporters and the country to accept the results of the presidential election and to keep fighting for the causes they believe in. ""Donald Trump is going to be our president,"" Clinton said from the New Yorker hotel, a historic art deco tower in Midtown. ""We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" It was the first time that Clinton publicly acknowledged that business executive Donald Trump had been voted the next president of the United States, a prospect that just weeks ago she had urged the country to consider with dread.   [A traumatic campaign produces a shocking ending, with Trump victorious]   ""I am sorry that we did to win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country,"" Clinton said. ""I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it, too. This is painful and it will be for a long time."" She took the stage with her husband, former president Bill Clinton, her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and her son-in-law, Marc Mezvinsky, to an extended standing ovation from her emotional staff. Earlier, a glassy-eyed Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) praised his running mate and noted that she had won the popular vote. ""I'm proud of Hillary Clinton because she has been and is a great history-maker in everything she has done,"" Kaine said. He ended his brief introduction on a note of defiance, promising to continue their fight for children and families. ""Hillary and I know well the wisdom and the words of William Faulkner: 'They killed us, but they ain't whooped us yet!'"" he said.   [The Daily 202: Why Trump won -- and why the media missed it]   As election results rolled in Tuesday, Clinton watched in Manhattan from a suite in the Peninsula Hotels as her would-be electoral advantage disappeared and Trump performed stronger than expected in several upper-Midwestern states that had been Democratic for a generation. Around 2 a.m., Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta addressed a deflated crowd gathered at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center underneath a sparkling glass ceiling, told them that the race is too close to call, and that Clinton would not appear. Within the hour, however, the race was called for Trump and Clinton conceded. At nearly 4 a.m., Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook wrote to staff thanking them. ""Campaigns are incredibly hard, and sometimes the results don't reflect the merit, work, and commitment that goes into them. This is one of those times,"" Mook said. ""But as I disappointed as I am in the results, I remain amazed at the way every person on this campaign stepped up to each challenge and gave their all. You each have earned my respect and gratitude.""   [Donald Trump could actually take steps to try to jail Hillary Clinton]   Trump's victory was a historic defeat by an outsider of one of the most well-funded and well-known political figures. And for Democrats, it means voters made clear that they wanted a new direction and a dramatic break from the status quo. It represents a potential seismic change in the way Democrats win election: States like Michigan and Wisconsin, which had been reliably blue, slipped from Clinton's grasp. Clinton also lost Pennsylvania, a state Democrats have won since 1992 and a key to her path to the presidency. ""We have seen our nation is more deeply divide than we thought,"" Clinton said. ""But I still believe in America, and I always will."" Clinton's loss also means that the prospect of the country's first female president will be deferred once again. ""To all the little girls who are watching this: Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams,"" Clinton said. As a light rain fell Wednesday morning, a few harried campaign staffers corralled reporters and photographers on the sidewalk on one side of the hotel doors and supporters and Clinton staff on the other. At 8:30 a.m., two hours ahead of the scheduled start of the event, Clinton's top image-maker, Greg Hale, the man responsible for sets, backdrops and all manner of atmospherics for her biggest rallies, wandered alone on the hotel's third floor. The kind of picture-perfect setting he was in charge of ensuring seemed far removed. In the hotel ballroom where Clinton would speak, one floor down, workers had not yet erected a riser for TV cameras. The final setting was an unadorned lectern in front of more than a half-dozen American flags and a teleprompter. As Clinton's senior staff entered the room with strained smiles, they gave one another long hugs. Moments before Clinton took the stage, Mook, Podesta and top policy adviser Jake Sullivan were greeted with cheers and applause as they took their seats in the front row. Clinton ended her remarks on a prayerful note. Citing a favorite bible verse Galations 6:9, she urged her supporters-- especially young people-- to keep fighting. ""This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it,"" Clinton said. ""So my friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do."""

"   Beyonce performs onstage with Martie Maguire of the Dixie Chicks at the 50th annual CMA Awards at the Bridgestone Arena last week in Nashville. (Rick Diamond/Getty Images)  On most days, and in the long run, culture may be upstream from politics. But today is Election Day, and I suspect even the most culturally-obsessed of us will prioritize the monumental decisions Americans are making collectively -- if fractiously -- all over the country. Which is not to say culture can't help. Hillary Clinton's bringing out Bruce Springsteen at her last rally Monday night. And for those of us who aren't lucky enough to see the Boss on the trail, and who are looking forward to long waits at polling places today or simply for the hours to tick by before returns start to come in, here's a playlist of 25 of my favorite songs and notes on why they reminded me of this particular presidential contest. No ""Fight Song."" I promise.    1. ""I Need You To Survive,"" Hezekiah Walker and the Love Fellowship Choir: When I was in college, I occasionally went to services at a church where the choir sang this song on loop until everyone had greeted not just their neighbors, but every single other worshiper in attendance. At a moment when the election offers a choice between division and unity, this is about as beautiful expression of the latter idea as I can imagine. 2. ""American Land,"" Bruce Springsteen: In the midst of an election that turns on the question of what American greatness consists of, it's worth revisiting this optimistic immigrant narrative, inspired by Pete Seeger's ""He Lies in the American Land,"" an adaptation of steelworker Andrew Kovaly's poem of the same name. It's got a warning, too: ""They died building the railroads, they worked to bones and skin / They died in the fields and factories, names scattered in the wind / They died to get here a hundred years ago, they're still dying now / Their hands that built the country we're always trying to keep out."" 3. ""Bread and Roses,"" Judy Collins: Yeah, yeah, I know all the objections against the arguments against the idea that women will provide a civilizing influence in politics simply because we don't have a hand in the atrocities of governments past. Suspend that critique for the three minutes and five seconds it takes to listen to this song, an unbearably beautiful invocation of women's political power. 4. ""A Change Is Gonna Come,"" Sam Cooke: Even more so than most presidential election, 2016 feels like a year in which the work that lies beyond Election Day is highly daunting. But if you've ever needed an exhortation to keep doing something difficult, Sam Cooke's got you covered. 5. ""Bridge Over Troubled Water / We've Only Just Begun,"" Aretha Franklin: One of those combinations that is just otherworldly. 6. ""If I Were a Boy,"" Beyonce: There are any number of tracks by the magnificent Ms. Knowles-Carter I might have included here, but in a year when the very different playing fields for men and women were on full display, this one just feels too right. 7. ""Down To The River To Pray,"" Alison Krauss: I feel about the best Christian music the way Ron Swanson feels about churches: The theology's not for me, but I love the creative efforts in support of it. If you need a song that will elevate the feeling of standing in line to vote, or really, standing in line to do anything, this is a good choice. 8. ""This Land Is Your Land,"" Pete Seeger: In an election that's suggested in stark, and often ugly terms, that we have to choose between different versions of America, or that there's not enough of America to go around, Seeger's joy in the scale and beauty of the country is a tonic. 9. ""The Times They Are A-Changin',"" Bob Dylan: One of my favorite things about this song is how carefully it counts the cost of change, and how Dylan observes that sometimes, people only accept change when it's right on top of them, and when the consequences of resisting or ignoring that change have already arrived. It's an appropriate warning for the political moment. 10. ""By Way of Sorrow,"" Cry, Cry Cry: No matter what happens today, this election will have cost us a great deal. This gorgeous song is all about acknowledging the loss that often accompanies great change, and setting a determined course for the future. 11. ""Sons and Daughters,"" The Decemberists: This is as good a modern anti-war anthem as exists. 12. ""Easy Silence,"" Dixie Chicks: ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is the most obvious Dixie Chicks choice here, but ""Easy Silence,"" which is about trying to balance engagement with a world that feels frightening with taking care of yourself, or another person, is a better choice for today. 13. ""Become You,"" Indigo Girls: Another great song about the hard work involved in any sort of transformation. Plus ""The landed aristocracy / Exploiting all your enmity / All your daddies fought in vain / Leave you with the mark of Cain"" feels pretty apropos for this political moment. 14. ""Mama's Eyes,"" Justin Townes Earle: Am I a bad person if I admit that this utterly brutal kiss-off to Earle's father, the legendary country singer-songwriter Steve Earle, which ends in praise for Justin Townes Earle's mother, is really just in here as a coded message to Tiffany Trump? Be free, Tiffany! 15. ""Democracy,"" Leonard Cohen: In college, a dear friend liked to quote one of the last lines in this song, Cohen's declaration that ""I'm junk but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet."" This election has been draining and faith-destroying. But I'm holding onto the idea of that little wild bouquet as best I can. 16. ""The Pill,"" Loretta Lynn: To be played as loudly as possible in the direction of anyone who starts talking about Making America Great Again. 17. ""I Will Move On Up A Little Higher,"" Mahalia Jackson: When they go low, we -- well, you know the drill. 18. ""I Shall Be Released,"" Nina Simone: There have been a lot of sad and frightening things about this election, and I hope that anyone who's felt less safe in this country and in their own community because of the rhetoric on display and the policies on offer feels a modicum of relief come Tuesday night. As I've said earlier, I think the work is just beginning. But any break in the sense of threat that so many Americans live under will be welcome. 19. ""Home and Dry,"" Pet Shop Boys: I know, I know. This is a playlist with entirely too many slightly sobering tracks. What can I say? I'm anxious. But this song certainly expresses how I'd like to feel about the end of this election. 20. ""The Body of an American,"" The Pogues: During an election where Donald Trump repeatedly suggested that the state of America was somehow shameful or depressing, I found myself repeatedly listening to this song, which is a loud, enthusiastic blast of pride in being an American. 21. ""Ladies First,"" Queen Latifah and Monie Love: To a certain extent, it's depressing that we're making the same arguments all these years later. But during an election cycle where women have stepped up, repurposing Donald Trump's insults and making plans to ""grab back,"" the blast of feminist energy in Monie Love's declaration that ""We are the ones that give birth / To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First"" is undeniably invigorating. 22. ""Come So Far (Got So Far To Go),"" the cast of ""Hairspray"": Clinton has the ""Hamilton"" vote, while Trump favors Andrew Lloyd Webber. But this song from the 2007 musical version of ""Hairspray"" takes the ""there's so much more work to do"" idea that's at the heart of so many other songs on this list and makes it absolutely, irresistibly uplifting. Use it to get ""Fight Song"" out of your head. 23. ""End of the Line,"" Traveling Wilburys: Like I was really going to get through the end of this list without making at least one more ""Parks and Recreation"" reference. 24. ""I Decided, Part 2,"" Solange: Because no Election Day playlist would possibly be complete without a song you can use as a processional for that climactic march into the voting booth. 25. ""I Was A Teenage Anarchist,"" Against Me!: For playing loudly in response to anyone who tries to talk you out of voting, or into voting for Jill Stein.  "

""While he was not all good,"" the 15-member court said in passing judgment on one of Asia's most infamous strongmen, ""he was not pure evil either."" Court spokesman Theodore Te said the justices voted 9-5 with one abstention to dismiss petitions opposing President Rodrigo Duterte's approval of the Marcos family's plea for the dictator to be buried at the Heroes' Cemetery in metropolitan Manila, where former presidents, soldiers and national artists have been interred. The decision on a deeply emotional issue that has divided the poor Southeast Asian nation can be appealed. Outside the court, more than 300 Marcos supporters erupted in celebration, chanting the dictator's name repeatedly. Some waved Philippine flags and wept in joy. Anti-Marcos activists were outraged, and some of the petitioners vowed to ask the court to reconsider.   Activists, including victims of martial law, march towards the Supreme Court in Manila on November 8. (Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images)  Riot police stood between the opposing groups.  ""We are disappointed. We are heartbroken. We are outraged,"" a coalition of nearly 40 groups opposed to Marcos's burial at the cemetery said in a joint statement. ""With this decision, the very definition of hero is now in question."" Sen. Risa Hontiveros, an anti-Marcos activist in her younger years, lamented the decision. ""No tombstone, no grandiose cemetery can change the fact that Marcos was not a hero,"" she said in a statement. ""He was a plunderer, torturer and a thief with a family seeking to rewrite history to serve their interests."" The dictator's son and namesake, former Sen. Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr., thanked the high court for its ""magnanimous act to uphold the rule of law"" and expressed his gratitude to Duterte.  ""It is our sincerest hope that this will lead the nation towards healing,"" Marcos Jr. said in a statement, citing the decades of discord over his father's burial. The Marcos family did not immediately announce a burial date. Burying a dictator accused of massive rights violations and corruption by thousands of activists and dissenters at the heroes' cemetery has long been an emotional issue in the Philippines, where Marcos was ousted by a largely nonviolent army-backed uprising in 1986. At the height of the political turbulence, Marcos flew to Hawaii, where he lived with his wife, Imelda, and children in exile until he died in 1989. The Philippine revolt became a harbinger of change in authoritarian regimes worldwide. The Marcoses, however, have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The late dictator's wife, Imelda, and two of his children eventually ran for public office and won in a stunning political comeback. Marcos Jr. ran for vice president in May and garnered more than 14 million votes, but lost by a slim margin. In 1993, Marcos's body was flown back to his hometown in the northern province of Ilocos Norte, where it has been displayed in a glass coffin and became a tourist attraction. But his family fought for his remains to be transferred to the heroes' cemetery. Duterte, who took over the presidency in June, backed the dictator's burial at the cemetery, citing Marcos's privilege as a president and soldier, and taking a political risk in a country where pro-democracy advocates still celebrate Marcos's ouster each year. Duterte has said his late father, a former provincial governor, had served in Marcos's Cabinet and was one of his most loyal men. He acknowledged that one of Marcos's daughters, Imee Marcos, the current governor of Ilocos Norte, had backed his presidential bid. After the court ruled, Duterte's spokesman, Ernesto Abella, expressed ""hope the matter will finally be laid to rest, and that the nation finds the wherewithal to move forward."" The military, which is in charge of burials at the heroes' cemetery, said it would abide by the decision. The Supreme Court dismissed seven petitions, including by former torture victims under Marcos, that argued that an honorable burial for the dictator is ""illegal and contrary to law, public policy, morals and justice."" Opponents cited Duterte's political debt to the Marcoses. Marcos had not been convicted by final judgment of any offense involving moral turpitude, the court ruled, saying court convictions cited by anti-Marcos petitioners were civil in nature. While critics may disregard Marcos as president and commander-in-chief due to his human rights abuses, the court said he cannot be denied the right to be acknowledged as a former legislator, a defense secretary, a military member, a war veteran and a Medal of Valor awardee.  ""We agree with the proposition that Marcos should be viewed and judged in his totality as a person,"" the court said, adding that he was ""just a human who erred like us."" Despite the ruling, Sen. Hontiveros called on Duterte to reject plans to give Marcos a heroes' burial and ""to rise above his indebtedness and loyalty to the Marcos family."" Left-wing activist Renato Reyes said his group could not accept the court decision.  ""Our protests will hound Marcos all the way to his grave,"" Reyes said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Saakashvili was appointed governor of the corruption-riddled Black Sea region in May 2015 by President Petro Poroshenko. But in his resignation announcement in Odessa, Saakashvili accused Poroshenko of supporting the criminal clans in Odessa. Saakashvili announced his resignation in a video posted on his Facebook page, saying he felt ""cheated and tired.""  ""We are witnessing retrograde forces attacking everything progressive,"" he said. ""We are seeing all new beginnings being nipped in the bud."" Poroshenko has made Ukraine's integration with the European Union a priority, but endemic corruption throughout the country impedes that policy. During Saakashvili's 2004-2013 tenure as Georgian president, one of his main achievements was a significant reduction in corruption as well as a crackdown on organized crime. He reformed the Georgian police force, ending its long history of bribe-taking. Hot-tempered and uncompromising, Saakashvili was a divisive figure. He left Georgia after his party lost the 2012 parliamentary election and was stripped of his Georgian citizenship after becoming Odessa governor. His efforts in Odessa, Ukraine's main Black Sea port, have met stiff resistance. He accused local elites of thwarting his efforts, especially Odessa Mayor Gennady Trukhanov, a member of the party once headed by Viktor Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president who fled in 2014 to Russia following massive protests. Saakashvili has likened Odessa, known for its exquisite theaters and museums but also for its organized crime, to Chicago at the time of Al Capone. Last December, a video was made public of Saakashvili lambasting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov over alleged corruption during the national Reforms Council. Avakov in turn mocked Saakashvili's stutter and threw a glass of water at him. In the summer, Saakashvili took the dramatic step of setting up his office in a tent alongside a main highway that is in poor condition despite government promises to fix it. In a video of his resignation announcement, Saakashvili said he would begin ""a new step in the fight,"" but it was not immediately clear what that would entail. He has founded a new political movement, which staged anti-corruption rallies that attracted thousands across Ukraine.  ""Saakashvili's resignation deals a powerful blow to reformist forces in Ukraine and gives a bad signal to the West,"" said Vadim Karasyov, a Kiev-based political analyst. ""The charismatic Saakashvili now has just one option: to join the opposition. And that may herald a new wave of massive protests in Ukraine."" __ This version corrects the spelling of Trukhanov. __ Karmanau reported from Minsk, Belarus. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Instead, he effortlessly converted it into more evidence for the argument he's made all along -- the system and the election are both rigged, and any Clinton victory in this election will by extension be illegitimate. ""You have to understand, it's a rigged system,"" Trump said last night, after FBI Director James Comey advised Congress that the newly discovered emails will not change the FBI's recommendation against charges. ""And she's protected."" Trump also dismissed the possibility that the FBI had examined the emails in such a short time: ""You can't do it."" In so doing, Trump laid bare the core of his whole argument for the presidency. But he also revealed that in the end, Trump's own argument, objectively described, constitutes the strongest possible argument against electing him.   [Reactionary Trump fans: Meet 2016 America]   I'm going to attempt to demonstrate this with a chart -- it is below -- that, I believe, objectively captures the sum total of Trump's arguments, and why those arguments, taken on their own terms, compellingly demand a vote against him. At the heart of Trump's case for the presidency lies two components. The first is a hyper-exaggerated narrative of national decay and decline -- skyrocketing crime, rotting inner cities, decaying factories, a festering terror threat from within, a border that is being breached by dark hordes of invaders. The second is the notion that our elites are both fecklessly responsible for that perilous state of national decline and too corrupted to fix it -- they've rigged the system against you, undermining American sovereignty to enrich themselves, while allowing American identity to be degraded by immigrants who are at best parasitic and at worst a lethal threat. But Trump's diagnosis runs deeper than that. His argument is not simply that elites are ripping you off from above while enabling those subgroups to rip you off and threaten you from below. Rather, the truly pernicious component of Trump's argument is that our institutions and our democracy have themselves grown so hopelessly corrupted and compromised that they are no longer even capable of arresting and turning around that decline via conventional democratic processes. The only outcome that can change this state of affairs is electing him president. Any other result would only confirm that our system has been so corrupted that it is fundamentally no longer capable of producing legitimate political outcomes. Trump sometimes expresses this idea explicitly, and sometimes implicitly. But it is the thread that runs through everything he has been saying and promising for months:       [Defeating both Trump and Trumpism]   Before discussing this chart, let's contrast it with Trump's final restatement of his argument in his two-minute closing ad, which is running in multiple battleground states:      Donald Trump's campaign released an ad, Nov. 6, featuring billionaire investor George Soros, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. All three are Jewish. (Donald Trump)     This ad portrays a ""global power structure"" that conspires with American elites to enrich themselves with trade deals and economic policies that have ""bled our country dry."" (The antisemitic overtones here have already been widely noted). The ad also pictures literal images of decay and decline in the form of rotting factories. Some of this overlaps with Bernie Sanders-style populism's indictment of a government that has been taken captive by ""the billionaire class."" But Trump's spot also blames elites for ""massive illegal immigration,"" while displaying images of shadowy, lurking figures and teeming hordes. Trump is scapegoating what historian John Judis calls ""outgroups,"" a key feature of right wing (and, to be fair, previous iterations of left-wing) populism, which tells the people (whoever the target audience happens to be) that they are being squeezed between elites above and parasites below. Crucially, Trump's ad airbrushes out of his worldview its more obvious authoritarian elements. The Muslim ban is gone, and the ad shows Trump telling a crowd (an overwhelmingly white one) that only ""you"" can break the power of this corrupt ""machine"" and ""save our country."" That seems to suggest that our democratic institutions can break elite corruption and arrest our precipitous national decline.   [Here's the America Trump doesn't get]   But the unavoidably authoritarian elements in Trump's worldview have been on display everywhere -- in less controlled settings. Consider the key elements from our chart above: * Trump's narrative of national decline is rank propaganda. Trump's regular claims about skyrocketing crime and soaring murder rates are distortions and lies. His relentless claim that the border is being overrun is a Big Lie, too -- immigration rates have leveled off and experts have said the border is being managed. Trump speaks to legitimate economic grievances. But his trade bluster suggests he would likely start destructive trade wars, and his promise to bring back coal mining jobs to suffering communities is a cruel hoax. He is both selling an agenda that is pure fraudulence and exploiting legit grievances with xenophobia, nativism, and white nationalism, all of which rest upon a narrative of national decline that is a fever dream of invention. Which leads to the fact that... * Trump has repeatedly and explicitly said that if he is elected, he will have no choice but to resort to measures well outside our political norms and democratic processes. The vow of mass deportations promises unthinkably cruel disruptions that even many Republicans who oppose legalization have rejected. He's banned media organizations from his rallies, egged on supporters against reporters just doing their jobs, and promised to somehow open up libel law to restrict criticism. His proposed ban on Muslims would impose a religious test for entry. He's flirted with closing mosques and a Muslim registry. In a quote that never got the attention it deserved, Trump even explicitly said this of the terror threat: ""We're going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago."" Why should we not believe he means what he says? And who wants to find out what ""unthinkable"" things Trump has in mind? * Trump's narrative charges that elites are complicit in enabling outgroups to fleece you and weaken our American (and white) identity. Trump says the media is covering up the truth about the thousands of American Muslims who celebrated 9/11. That our elections officials are allowing rampant voter fraud in ""certain areas"" (wink, wink), in order to throw the ""rigged"" presidential election to the candidate not legitimately chosen by the American people. And that our political leaders are letting in illegal immigrants so they too can nefariously influence the election's outcome, a story that the media is also suppressing. The sheer volume and truly destructive nature of his demagoguery and lies about our institutions is alone -- or should be -- disqualifying. * All roads lead to ""I alone can fix it."" That was probably Trump's single most telling declaration of the campaign. But it must be understood in the broader context of Trump's ongoing claims that our democratic institutions are so corrupted and corroded that they are no longer capable of solving our problems. Thus, ""I alone can fix it"" has two interrelated meanings. It means that, if elected, he would likely shred political and constitutional norms and resort to extreme measures to deal with terrorism and immigration (which our institutions can no longer cope with) and our treasonous media. It also means that, if he is not elected, it will prove that our system is no longer capable of not just addressing our problems, but of producing political outcomes that are legitimate. This is intimately bound up with Trump's shifting reactions to the FBI's treatment of Clinton. Back when the FBI originally declined to recommend charges, Trump went on a tear about how the ""corrupt"" FBI is participating in rigging the election. Then, when the FBI announced its new discovery, Trump said the FBI was heroically trying to correct its original wrong. And now that the FBI has not found anything to derail her candidacy, Trump is back to claiming that she is being ""protected."" Trump regularly says Clinton is a criminal who never should have allowed to run for office at all. But his argument goes farther still. He is claiming that our institutions cannot legitimately clear his political opponent of criminality.  That is an objective description of his argument. All of this is plainly designed to badly undermine faith in our institutions -- no matter who wins the election. Trump has explicitly said that he may not accept the outcome if he loses, which raises the prospect of further disruptions. But if he does win, he has already made his intentions -- to conduct his presidency in full accordance with his contempt for those institutions -- absolutely clear. Maybe Trump is just putting on a big show. But why should we not entertain the possibility that he might mean what he says? There has been a great deal of debate over whether our institutions are strong enough to withstand a Trump presidency. We can only hope that a majority of voters are horrified by the prospect of ever discovering the answer to that question, and make their choice accordingly.          1 of 8       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                     Skip Ad   x           Eight of the most memorable moments from the 2016 presidential campaign      View Photos   A look at some of the historic, amusing and cringe-inducing events of the race between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

"         Has a work of fiction ever arrived so swaddled in shenanigans? ""Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff,"" a best-selling audiobook -- part thriller, part political commentary -- narrated and championed by Sean Penn, comes with as much hoopla as a campaign rally.     Sean Penn narrated the book ""Bob Honey Just Do Stuff."" (Kwaku Alston for StocklandMartel.com)  Penn appears in a documentary about the audiobook, in which he tells us, while making a meal in what seems to be his kitchen, about the novel's mysterious backstory: that he first met its author, one Pappy Pariah, at a writers' conference in Florida in 1979. The Bob Honey manuscript circuitously, miraculously found its way to Penn via his mother earlier this year. Penn was so profoundly moved by the story's relevance to the junkyard-in-flames that is American politics circa 2016 that he dropped everything and hastened it into production, with the help of a few other actors, such as Frances McDormand. Bolstered by talking heads -- historian Doug Brinkley, Bill Maher, producer Art Linson -- the short film has the air of a bookish ""This Is Spinal Tap."" Penn's enthusiasm for Pariah has been so robust that he has made the rounds of late night television with it -- but not so robust that he'll let people give the author money directly: ""Bob Honey"" is available free via Audible (perhaps that price explains some of its popularity).  [A history of Sean Penn's curious habit of inserting himself into international controversy]    But, okay, fine. Let's take Penn at his word and assume that he is only the enthusiastic steward of this book, not its author. If so, it's revealing about Penn anyway. Pariah expresses the same sour mood toward America's military adventures that Penn himself has, and shares Penn's concerns with populism and authenticity: Among Bob Honey's chief targets is a society that has been ""marketed into madness."" And, befitting an actor whose resume includes both ""Dead Man Walking"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" Bob Honey is all over the place, slapdash in style and structure. Just consider what we're asked to believe about the novella's hero, Bob Honey: He's a 55-year-old Southern California loner whose job cleaning septic tanks (his main clients are Jehovah's Witnesses) brings him into the orbit of military contractors in Iraq, which in turn introduces him to the ""Scottsdale program,"" a secret government plot designed to dispose of America's elderly, who are a drain on resources and bad for the nation's branding to boot. Honey coolly dispenses with the aged via the kind of mallet he used in his youth as a carny in test-your-strength games.    The author of ""Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff"" is named Pappy Pariah. Sean Penn says he is only the enthusiastic steward of this book, not its author. (M. Unal Ozmen/Shutterstock)  Bob goes about this business amid prose that at times resembles a news release from the Tinfoil Hat Enthusiasts of America. ""This is the thing about brands and beauty: They cannot be randomly claimed,"" Penn intones in a somber whiskey-and-cigarettes voice. ""They demand polish and a system of greed valuation that would allow its practitioners to bring society a continuing sense of fraudulent comfort."" And the plot? As shaggy-dog stories go, this one is pretty much in shreds: I haven't even mentioned the helicopter conveniently crashing into a nosy neighbor's home, or Pariah's commentary on the elderly's methane overproduction. Adding to the absurdity, Penn voices Bob in a sleepy, squeaky drawl that at once evokes Larry the Cable Guy and Kermit the Frog.  [A former Romney strategist's satirical political novel]  Of course, Pariah doesn't intend for us to confuse Bob's bonkers backstory for literary realism. Bob Honey is best appreciated as the fever dream of a boomer who watches the news, can't make sense of it, but can't contain his fury at it anyhow: His head is filled with fantasies of an attractive young girlfriend, a gig setting off fireworks for a South American strongman and chaos on the streets during the Republican National Convention. ""I don't ever really tell the truth much,"" he tells an investigative reporter. ""I wonder sometimes if the truth might be more habit than virtue."" Bob's preposterousness does have its charms. There's a reckless, Hunter S. Thompson-ish spirit to its climactic chapter, as Bob watches the RNC (where ""the Mussolini of Mayberry was fomenting his flock"") and stumbles upon marchers chanting ""yellow lives matter"" -- yellow as in Aryan blond. To underscore the point that we've been on this road before, Pariah returns often to folk song lyrics -- Bob Dylan, John Lennon and especially Phil Ochs, whose jaundiced lines are a fine fit for Bob's cynicism. But how to reconcile that with scenes of a chance meeting with an El Chapo-esque drug lord, gratuitous mallet-swinging and hunting down a sex toy in Las Vegas? Or delivering black, Jewish, Middle Eastern and Latino characters in the broadest, most stereotypical accents? Absurd times demand gonzo storytelling, we are meant to assume; politics soaked in racism presumably demand ironic, on-the-nose racial caricatures. But such gestures feel more like sloppy, hollow provocations than the sharp political commentary Penn says he was smitten by. Maybe Pariah is on to something, however. At one point, Bob's perhaps-imaginary girlfriend beseeches him to work harder to keep this story together.  But why should he?  In this political season, sensible narrative is just another piece of kindling for the junkyard fire.             Mark Athitakis is a writer in Phoenix. ""The New Midwest,"" a book of his criticism, will be published in February.  Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff By Pappy Pariah Narrated by Sean Penn et al. Audible. 21/2 hours. Free "
