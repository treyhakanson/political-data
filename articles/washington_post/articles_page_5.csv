(Eric Gay/AP)  Blaming the polls for getting the 2016 election so wrong is understandable, but there was arguably a bigger problem: the false confidence that the polls inspired. Indeed, the flood of polls may be having a perverse consequence: making voters worse at predicting the election, not better. And the media landscape isn't helping.  In the past, voters were good at predicting election outcomes.  Since 1952, the American National Elections Studies (ANES) has asked people to say who they thought was likely to win the White House and whether that candidate was likely to ""win by quite a bit"" or in a ""close race."" As media polls became a staple of elections coverage in recent decades, the percentage unable or unwilling to offer a prediction has declined from almost 25 percent to less than 1 percent. Meanwhile, predictions about the presidential race have tracked the popular vote closely:    Source: ANES cumulative data file.  But in 2012, an unusually high number predicted Obama or Romney would ""win by quite a bit."" Something changed when Obama and Romney faced off. In earlier elections, the percentages predicting a ""close race"" or a ""win by quite a bit"" varied predictably with the closeness of the race. In 2012, however, voters were far more confident -- with large percentages believing that either Obama or Romney would win by quite a bit. You can see this in the graphs below, where the 2012 data points sit far away from the others.    Source: ANES cumulative data. Trend lines exclude the 2012 race.  These confident 2012 predictions are particularly striking given that polls showed a very narrow Obama lead. Better educated people were the most overconfident Moreover, 2012 stands apart because the most educated people were the most confident, unlike in earlier elections that were similarly close. In these earlier elections, people with more formal education were less likely to predict a bigger win. In 2012, this pattern was reversed:    Source: Weighted ANES sample for 1976, 2000, 2004, and 2012 election cycles.  In other words, the people most attentive to politics -- and perhaps best equipped to understand the limitations of polls -- were the most overconfident. The impact of education persisted even after accounting for other factors such as vote choice, party identification, knowledge of politics, age, gender and self-reported interest in election news. The news media amplifies the polls -- and therefore overconfidence  I have interviewed several dozen political journalists and pollsters about how polling is used in news coverage. Almost everybody said they regularly followed polling aggregators and forecasters like the Upshot, FiveThirtyEight and Huffington Post. Many expressed hope that by paying attention to averages, it would limit cherry-picking of outlier results and make coverage of the horse race more accurate. At the same time, there is concern about the attention paid to poll aggregators and forecasters. One reporter said that ""It's almost from about six weeks out from any election people start saying, 'It's over.'"" It was no surprise, then, that the Romney campaign in particular pushed back against forecasts showing they would most likely lose. As one reporter told me: ""If you had asked Stuart Stevens, the Republican, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney, and I did, I asked him multiple times what do you make of FiveThirtyEight showing Romney only having like a 20 percent, 30 percent chance of winning? And he would always just roll his eye and make fun of it and stuff. And the campaign was actively pushing back against Nate Silver because it was such a ... he was guiding the common wisdom that Romney was going to lose."" In 2016, the media's fascination with polling-based forecasts may well have created false certainty about the outcome, which in turn altered the way the campaign was covered. Previous research has found that perceived front-runners receive more negative coverage than candidates who are behind in the polls. Thus, the perception that Clinton was the clear front-runner may have affected the coverage she faced. Clinton's apparent lead may also have caused news organizations to discount or otherwise qualify anecdotal evidence of Trump's support in rural areas -- evidence that may have indicated the truly competitive nature of the race. To be fair, the news media alone are not solely to blame. The larger media landscape, which has spawned a cottage industry of armchair poll analysis, may also be a factor. The constant debate about polls on social media makes it easier than ever to select only the poll numbers, however flawed, that reinforce your own preferences. Because poll results and forecasts are numeric -- reported to the fraction of a percentage point -- political observers often mistake these estimates as exact. As one media pollster I interviewed put it, ""If it's a number, it's precise. It's $1.39. It's 34 percent. And it's hard for people to get into their heads that there's imprecision around that."" Ultimately, quantification may make it more difficult to appreciate uncertainty. The challenge facing political journalists is not only in cataloging, analyzing and evaluating a complex array of available data but in not losing sight of just how much these data sometimes leave out. Benjamin Toff is a research fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford and will be an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Minnesota beginning in 2017."

But made-up stories are only part of the problem.	"   Fake news spreads easily on Facebook. (Reuters/Dado Ruvic)  For years, I have rolled my eyes at news headlines on Facebook. Even respected mainstream news institutions were marketing their articles for clicks, shares and an ever-dwindling piece of the advertising-revenue pie. But lately, some more questionable outlets have started appearing in feeds, mimicking the attention-starved style that bothered me when real news organizations used it. These other sources -- with names such as 100percentfedup.com and Natural News -- started showing up as citations in my students' papers and referenced as authoritative in classroom discussions, too. These days, as more and more people turn to Facebook to stay informed, it's hard to tell the difference between news and ""news,"" especially when the ""news"" is posted by people you trust. So this past Monday morning, I put together a resource for students in my media class, ""False, Misleading, Clickbait-y, and/or Satirical 'News' Sources."" I populated it using some notes I've been taking in recent weeks, a site that recently tricked me with a too-good-to-be-true story about Aaron Rodgers, my observations of websites I follow on Facebook relying more and more on hyperbole and outrage to drive traffic, suggestions and resources provided by my own Facebook friends (many of whom are also media and communication scholars) and emails from strangers who stumbled on the growing list. Shortly after creating it, I set it to be visible to the general public. My own Facebook friends were already asking to share it with other teachers or professors whom I didn't know. And by coincidence, fake news was in the real news, too. About the same time, I was alerted to and alarmed by reporting that the top Google News item about the winner of the popular vote in this month's election had come from a fake news site: 70news.wordpress.com. I can't tell if that site is trolling conservatives or the alt-right with fake news or creating fake news in twisted support of those ideologies. But it claimed, without any actual data or shred of truth, that Hillary Clinton had lost the popular vote when, in fact, she won it, and by a margin that's been steadily increasing as more votes are tallied. Immediately, I added this website to the list while hundreds of additional suggestions began flooding my email inbox and Facebook shares started racking up beyond anything I could have imagined. The last time I checked, which was Thursday evening, it had been shared about 25,000 times. That a list of sources you should be skeptical of when you encounter their stories on social media would go viral on social media might be a sign that the problem goes deeper than just the fake news.   [Facebook fake news writer: 'I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me']   Nearly 40 percent of adults, and 100 percent of my class, get their news online. It's hard to tell how much fake news there is on Facebook, specifically, or across the Internet as a whole, but there is evidence that fake news drew more engagement on Facebook than real news did during the closing weeks of the election. I'm hesitant of claims saying without a doubt that this influenced the election -- we need way more research on the topic -- but I am sure it played a role in shaping and, especially, reinforcing political beliefs. And I've noticed, with some concern, that the same techniques that get people to click on fake or overhyped stories are also being used to get people to read about my own list. It's routinely described in headlines as a ""fake news list,"" but it's not just that -- most of the sites on it don't publish intentionally false stories. Many publish news that exists in a liminal area -- akin to ""Truthiness"" -- or present their content on Facebook with a headline or description that poorly represents the actual article. I wanted to help my students navigate a cluttered, complicated and often overwhelming media environment by alerting them to be skeptical and rigorous at all times. It's not that I think every source or website listed was ""bad."" I love the Onion, for example, and believe it often serves an important political purpose. Nor was I calling sites out for political bias one way or the other, as I'm not inherently skeptical of political bias. I just want my students to read stories from sites on my list in conjunction with other news sources (as they should with all of the media they consume, ideally). I'm not convinced that a majority of people who shared my list actually read my list, much as I'm not convinced that many people who share or comment on news articles posted to Facebook have actually read those articles. (One study found that nearly 60 percent of links posted to social media are never clicked; that tracked with the less scientific, informal poll I did of my 64 students.) For instance, people emailed me outraged that MSNBC was on the list but Fox News Channel wasn't. But in reality, MSNBC was not on the list at all. A fake version of the network was, specifically MSNBC.com.co. There are many more sites that could or should be included, and hundreds of suggestions (including the New York Times, The Washington Post and the Boston Globe) currently awaiting evaluation in my inbox. But I'm honestly not sure whether I'll get to them or what the next iteration of this document will be. Clearly, we need solutions beyond the educational resource I gave to my students, and somewhat inadvertently, the world. Obviously, fake news is a major problem. We need to make sure people have the tools to detect it, and we need to understand why people may purposefully share news they know to be fake -- maybe they're being malicious, they think it's funny or it aligns with what they want to be true. And we definitely need to find ways to discourage the production of non-comedy, non-satire fake news. We need to do all of this while making sure that alternative voices and robust exchange of information are not stifled. Fake news is cheap to produce -- far cheaper than real news, for obvious reasons -- and profitable. The profitability of these sites is precisely why Facebook and Google are looking for ways to prevent them from receiving advertising revenue. It's a ""starve the beast"" strategy, so to speak. But another reason fake (or unreliable, questionable, potentially misleading or ""truthy"") news has become such a huge problem is the growing distrust and flaws of our actual news media.   [The real reason Trump is winning: No one thought it was possible]   Studies show a significant portion of the population distrusts ""the media."" The level of distrust varies widely by news outlet and by reader, but in the aggregate, people no longer believe press reports the way they once did, especially if the news challenges their preexisting beliefs. Too many news organizations focus on short-term stories -- horse-race election coverage, the daily twists of the stock market -- and not enough deal consistently and seriously with issues that affect people's lives in a way that explores not only what's happening but also why and what can be done about it. I teach my students about how daily newspapers are folding in communities across the country and foreign bureaus closing around the world. I teach them that the number of people working for newspapers has shrunk by 40 percent in the past 20 years thanks to concentration, conglomeration and greater emphasis on profits. I teach them why ""If It Bleeds, It Leads"" and other categories of newsworthiness are problematic. I teach them not only about political bias in the media but also about entertainment bias (a focus on celebrities and human-interest stories) and corporate bias (a focus on businesses and profits over workers and stagnant wages), an issue I am much more concerned with.   We are inundated with media -- whether fake, real or somewhere in the middle -- on an hourly basis. I'm not sure whether the best way to manage it all is with browser plug-ins, app filtering technologies or databases that can help people easily find information about the sources they are reading or watching. I don't yet know what kind of impact my Google document will have on the world -- to say nothing of my 60-person ""Introduction to Mass Communication"" class. But I do know that while we think about fake news, we need to start thinking about how to make our actual news better, too."

Democrats have a gushing head wound.	" While the challenges of the GOP -- its long-term demographic difficulties, its erratic leadership, the bitter struggle for its ideological soul -- are obscured by victory, the problems of the Democratic Party are on full display. Republicans suffer from heart disease; Democrats have an ugly, gushing head wound.  The losing party would be foolish to minimize the scale of its political failure. Hillary Clinton proved incapable of defeating a reality-television host whom more than 60 percent of Americans viewed as unfit to be president. It is perhaps the most humiliating moment in the long history of Mr. Jefferson's party. But the effect is more than reputational. The Democratic candidate and her team could not protect the United States from a serious risk to its ideals and institutions by an untested and unstable novice who flirted with authoritarianism and made enough gaffes on an average Tuesday to sink a normal presidential campaign.  Donald Trump was riding a modest electoral wave in certain parts of the country, but it was not large enough to overwhelm a reasonably capable Democratic candidate with a decent political strategy. Trump's vote did not burst the levees; it barely lapped over the top of them in the industrial Midwest. The ""blue wall"" was too low by just a foot or two.  But why was the election even close enough for bad strategy in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, or utter incompetence by the FBI director, to matter? Trump obviously benefited from extreme polarization. The proposition ""anyone but Hillary"" was tested, with Republicans (and others) ultimately rallying to ""anyone."" The Obama coalition -- including young, minority and college-educated voters -- did not turn out in sufficient numbers. And an appeal to racial and ethnic resentment remains disturbingly potent in our politics -- the continuing evidence of America's original sin.  But here is the largest, long-term Democratic challenge: It has become a provincial party. It is highly concentrated in urban areas and clings to the coasts. But our constitutional system puts emphasis on holding geography, particularly in the House of Representatives and the electoral college. It is difficult for Democrats to prevail from isolated islands of deep blue. In 2012, President Obama won the presidency with fewer than 700 counties out of more than 3,000 in the United States -- a historical low. Clinton carried a little under 500 -- about 15 percent of the total.      President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it's ""healthy"" for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. ""When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,"" Obama said. (The Washington Post)   This is another way of saying that the Democratic candidate for president can't prevail -- at least at the moment -- when she receives less than 30 percent of the vote from the white, non-college-educated Americans who live in the spaces between the cities. Most of these voters were not examining public policy and calculating their interests -- except in the vague sense that they don't like sending American jobs abroad and don't want anyone messing with their Social Security. They were convinced that Trump had their back. Democrats have become symbolically estranged from white, working-class America.  What are the Democratic options moving forward? First, there is the Bernie Sanders option -- the embrace of a leftist populism that amounts to democratic socialism. This might also be called the Jeremy Corbyn option, after the leftist leader of the British Labour Party who has ideologically purified his party into political irrelevance. Second, there is the Joe Biden option -- a liberalism that makes a sustained outreach to union members and other blue-collar workers while showing a Catholic religious sensibility on issues of social justice. Third, there is the option of doubling down on the proven Barack Obama option, which requires a candidate who can excite rather than sedate the Obama-era base.  Democrats should not overlearn the lessons of a close election. Option No. 3 is the Democratic future on the presidential level. Clinton was correct to appeal to a slightly modified version of the Obama coalition (fewer African American and millennial voters, but more support from Latinos and college-educated women). She simply could not pull it off. But for the foreseeable future, Democrats will also need a dash of No. 2, including a more accommodating attitude toward religion and associational rights. In this election, evangelical Christians and white Catholics sensed real hostility to their institutions from law school liberalism.   There is a serious prospect, however, that Democrats will choose No. 1. There would be many reverberations for our politics. But chiefly, the United States would cease to have a center-left party and a center-right party. Both radicalized institutions would exaggerate our national differences, becoming the political equivalent of the hard-left and hard-right media. And the cause of national unity would be damaged even further.  Read more from Michael Gerson's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .   Read more here:   Robert J.

4	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/17/earmarks-are-good-earmarks-work-congress-should-bring-them-back/	Republicans almost did something very smart on Wednesday	"   Pigs. This is a metaphor. (Carsten Koall/Getty Images)  For a minute earlier this week, House Republicans almost did something very smart. A proposal was offered to bring back earmarks -- the pork-barrel spending added to bills that allow individual members a little goody here or there for their district. Speaker Paul D. Ryan put the kibosh on the plan even though it enjoyed significant support within the room, according to The Washington Post's Mike DeBonis. The measure isn't totally dead yet -- a task force will look into it, and a floor vote on a revised proposal could happen next year. Earmarks have been banned since Republicans retook control of the House majority in 2010. Then-Speaker John A. Boehner was a lifelong opponent of earmarking and pushed the prohibition as an example to voters that the GOP was serious about cleaning up Washington. (Republicans had taken a major hit earlier in the decade due to the earmarking scandal of Rep. Duke Cunningham.) Good! You think to yourself. It's inarguably bad for members of Congress to be able to slip $50 million for a highway with their name on it into some unrelated bill! It's exactly what people are sick of in Washington! That point of view makes sense -- in theory.     But, politics -- real politics -- isn't a theoretical discussion among political scientists. And if you believe that Congress works better when it, um, actually works, then you should be rooting like hell that Ryan changes his mind if/when the possibility of a return to earmarking comes to the floor for a vote. Jonathan Rauch, in a hugely important cover story in the Atlantic earlier this year, makes the best case for earmarks I've ever read: For most of American history, a principal goal of any member of Congress was to bring home bacon for his district. Pork-barrel spending never really cost very much, and it helped glue Congress together by giving members a kind of currency to trade: You support my pork, and I'll support yours. Also, because pork was dispensed by powerful appropriations committees with input from senior congressional leaders, it provided a handy way for the leadership to buy votes and reward loyalists. Starting in the '70s, however, and then snowballing in the '90s, the regular appropriations process broke down, a casualty of reforms that weakened appropriators' power, of ""sunshine laws"" that reduced their autonomy, and of polarization that complicated negotiations. Conservatives and liberals alike attacked pork-barreling as corrupt, culminating in early 2011, when a strange-bedfellows coalition of Tea Partiers and progressives banned earmarking, the practice of dropping goodies into bills as a way to attract votes -- including, ironically, votes for politically painful spending reductions . .. . . . Like campaign contributions and smoke-filled rooms, pork is a tool of democratic governance, not a violation of it. It can be used for corrupt purposes but also, very often, for vital ones. As the political scientist Diana Evans wrote in a 2004 book, Greasing the Wheels: Using Pork Barrel Projects to Build Majority Coalitions in Congress, ""The irony is this: pork barreling, despite its much maligned status, gets things done."" Earmarks are the WD-40 that helped the gears of government grind forward. They are the carrot in the carrot-and-stick approach that legislative leaders have long used to cajole weary members to cast a certain vote. They are the cheese on the broccoli. Politics works best when compromise is incentivized, not scorned. Earmarks helped to do just that. They were a lever to pull on the way to the presumed end goal: dealmaking. Without them, compromise became a dirty word, and the GOP leadership -- Boehner chief among them -- paid a price. His decision to step down from the speakership (and Congress) was fueled by an inability to rally the bulk of the Republican Conference behind proposals he supported. He couldn't do that because he was, effectively, fighting with one hand tied behind his back due to the earmark ban. Earmarks are an easy target, sure. Witness John McCain's oft-recited riff on the 2008 campaign trail regarding a $3 million expenditure to study the DNA of bears in Montana. Three million for bear DNA! Outrageous! But, if you think about it, $3 million is a tiny price to pay for some semblance of order and compromise when it comes to the broader spending bills with which Congress must deal. In fiscal year 2010, before the earmark ban went into effect, $16.5 billion was spent on earmarked projects. That's a ton of money, for sure. But it pales in comparison with the $3.8 trillion in spending budgeted for the federal government that year. The simple fact is that opposing earmarks makes for smart politics and dumb governance. People hate the idea of the government spending their tax dollars on pet projects. But, if you consider those earmarks against the broader spending by the government, they are paltry -- a totally acceptable price to pay if it means that Congress begins to work together to solve problems via compromise rather than reverting to the I'm-taking-my-ball-and-going-home stance that has dominated the last six years. Retiring Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), that most pragmatic of politicians, is an eloquent defender of earmarking. ""I have been a fan of earmarks since I got here the first day,"" he told Politico in 2014. ""Keep in mind that's what the country has done for more than 200 years, except for the brief period of time in recent years that we haven't done these. It is wrong to have bureaucrats downtown make decisions in Nevada that I can make better than they can make. I don't run away at all -- this is something that has been going on for centuries in our country and it has worked quite well."" The federal government is an imperfect system made up of imperfect people. Earmarking may not be the way government should work, according to some textbook. But it is the way government does work. So bring it back."

(Byron Cohen/FX)  This post discusses the last two episodes of the third season of ""You're The Worst."" It's the highest compliment I can give ""You're The Worst"" that FX's comedy about a group of ill-behaving Angelenos struggling through love and life that there's probably no show on television that gives me more pure, transporting pleasure, or makes me feel more pain. And so it's highly fitting that the show's third season wrapped up with an hour-long finale full of both. And for my purposes as a critic who writes about culture and politics ""You Knew It Was a Snake"" and ""No Longer Just Us"" are, collectively, a master class in showing how politics play out in personal contexts. As Lindsay (Kether Donohue) and Paul (Allan McLeod) begin the process of breaking up for real this time, ""You're The Worst"" acknowledges the validity of Paul's anger about Lindsay's abortion without giving up the idea that she had the right to do what she did. Lindsay may overuse the slogan ""my body, my choice"" to the point of utter meaninglessness, but just because she's an unworldly dope doesn't mean she's wrong. Showing its usual admirable ability to comprehend that multiple complex ideas can co-exist at once, ""You Knew It Was a Snake"" has both respect for Paul's profound anger and sorrow that Lindsay would make this decision without him, even as it's clear that this was absolutely the right decision to make. Necessary choices can still be made in ways that cause good people pain, without invalidating the fundamental correctness of the decision. And just as the exercise of our rights doesn't always proceed smoothly, just because something is a right doesn't mean consequences don't flow from it. Edgar (Desmin Borges) and Dorothy's (Collette Wolfe) argument about which one of them faces a greater disadvantage in comedy proceeds along similar lines. They're both correct that they face substantial obstacles. Dorothy has faced horrific and persistent sexual harassment from her colleagues in comedy, and the narrow window during which women are considered sexually desirable by Hollywood means that Dorothy has been disqualified from a certain class of roles before she even landed one. And Edgar is right that Latinos are dramatically underrepresented in pop culture, meaning that there's simply a lower demand for people like him than for people who fall into the same broad category as Dorothy: white women. But their fight isn't entirely, or even really, political; it's not as if Dorothy even had a chance to compete for the job that Edgar's been offered. They're simply on trajectories, inflected by race, gender and class, that make it difficult for them to provide the support each other needs. In Edgar's success, Dorothy can only see the reflection of her own stalled career. And in Dorothy's misery, Edgar sees his own bleak despair. They love each other, but they're afraid of what the other one represents. In both stories, big issues are necessary, but insufficient to explain what's going on. Part of the reason ""You're The Worst"" manages to feel so emotionally acute and lived-in, even as the show maintains its theatricality and functions as a well-tuned joke machine, is that it doesn't artificially separate politics from its characters' lives. Jimmy, Gretchen, Lindsay, Paul, Edgar and Dorothy live in a world where questions of race and gender and abortion access are material to their decisions and their happiness. This makes ""You're The Worst"" a realistic show, rather than a primarily political one. And so it's fitting that this pair of episodes is framed by Jimmy (Chris Geere) and Gretchen (Aya Cash), whose relationship is determined by their inner states rather than external pressures. ""You're The Worst"" seems to have wrapped up Gretchen's therapy prematurely, but she's certainly learned something in the process. Jimmy, by contrast, is still in a place where he believes, in an almost magical way, in the power of gestures, be it a heckling session, a tree-house construction project, or a proposal. He hasn't yet learned that a gesture is the beginning of something, not the thing itself. What comes now that Paul and Lindsay are divorcing, or that Edgar and Dorothy have broken up, or that Becca (Janet Varney) and Vernon (Todd Robert Anderson) are parents, or that Jimmy's gotten into his car and driven away? ""You're The Worst"" has gotten to the hardest, and realest, part of its story."

While not personally involved in lobbying, Giuliani spent years at firms which represented governments and multinational companies, some of which had interests that diverged from those of the United States. He also made speeches demanding the State Department remove an Iranian opposition group from a U.S. terror blacklist. As the former New York mayor waits to discover if he is Trump's choice for secretary of state, Giuliani's extensive consulting and advising work for foreign and corporate clients could expose him to the same criticisms he raised about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's ties to foreign governments and corporations that had donated to her family charity, the Clinton Foundation.  ""What she did with the Clinton Foundation and all the favors the State Department did for hundreds of millions of dollars is, to me, clear violation of the conflict of interest law,"" Giuliani told CNN in August. But when Clinton was secretary of state, she was the one concerned about Giuliani after he took a trip to Belgrade and met with leaders of a Serbian political party once allied with Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic.  ""This is outrageous,"" Clinton wrote in an April 2012 email after her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, forwarded a copy of an Associated Press story about Giuliani's meeting with Serbian Progressive Party officials. Milosevic, accused of war crimes for his conduct in the Balkan wars of the 1990s, died in prison a decade ago. As Giuliani's visit became known, the U.S. embassy in Belgrade issued a statement saying it wasn't taking sides in Serbia's elections. The leader of the party that Giuliani met, Aleksandar Vucic, now heads Serbia's government. A longtime associate defended Giuliani's extensive international work Wednesday, saying the former mayor currently has only one international security contract. It is with the government of Colombia, said the associate, who asked not to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak officially for the former mayor. He said Giuliani would provide lengthy public disclosure of his business interests, if nominated. Giuliani did not respond to requests, made through his associate, to speak to the AP. In an interview Tuesday with the New York Times, Giuliani said he never lobbied for any interests, foreign or otherwise. He defended his consulting firm's work in the Persian Gulf monarchy of Qatar and the money he received for supporting the Mujahedin-e Khalq, the Iranian dissident group, even as it was a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. Giuliani said that he did consulting work for TransCanada, the company pushing for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the State Department would have a role in approving. But Giuliani said he had no involvement in that effort. He said his work for TransCanada focused on a planned natural gas facility in New York that never materialized.  ""I have friends all over the world,"" Giuliani said. ""This is not a new thing for me. When you become the mayor, you become interested in foreign policy. When I left, my major work was legal and security around the world."" For most of 2016, Giuliani worked as a senior adviser and head of the cybersecurity and crisis management division at lobbying giant Greenberg Traurig. At the same time, he played a prominent role as Trump's television and political rally supporter. Giuliani took a leave of absence from the firm in October to work full-time for Trump. During Giuliani's tenure, Greenberg Traurig's lawyers worked for a host of foreign clients, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, which has been accused of eroding democracy. It also worked for a Belarusian potash firm suspected by several U.S. senators of evading Treasury Department sanctions. Other clients at the time included Mexico's agriculture agency, a Libyan think-tank, the governments of Panama and East Timor, and Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, according to federal foreign agent filings with the Justice Department. Giuliani's associate said he has not met any foreign officials for Greenberg Traurig and isn't involved with the firm's government lobbying practice. Giuliani has never registered with the government as a lobbyist. Instead, he acted abroad as a security consultant and occasional political adviser, even though his actions sometimes sought to influence U.S. policy. Giuliani joined prominent politicians-- Democrats and Republicans, many of them paid-- in petitioning the State Department to de-list Iran's MEK, which was linked to assassinations of at least six Americans in the 1970s and a string of attacks against the Iranian government. When the group was finally taken off the terror list in 2012, by Clinton's State Department, U.S. officials said it hadn't committed any acts of terrorism in at least a decade.  ""My ties to them are very open,"" Giuliani told The Times. His work included speeches in Washington and Berlin and signing a letter along with influential former government officials, including James Jones, President Barack Obama's onetime national security adviser. Another signature: Former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, another in contention to become Trump's secretary of state. If nominated, Giuliani would have to describe his finances much like he did during his 2007 presidential campaign. The disclosure he filed for that campaign showed he was already a multimillionaire with assets between $18 million and $70 million. Giuliani was a frequent critic of Clinton's paid speeches to special interests during her campaign against Trump. But Giuliani's own foray into the lecture circuit in the mid-2000s could pose similar potential ethics problems. From late 2005 through early 2007, Giuliani made more than 100 paid speeches-- most for $100,000 each_ to oil companies, investment banks and Wall Street firms, including Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co. Giuliani earned $9.2 million for the speeches over a 15-month period, according to his presidential financial disclosure. Giuliani, who founded his global management firm, Giuliani Partners, in 2002, refused to divulge his firm's clients when he ran for president. ___ Follow Chad Day on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ChadSDay Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Thanks to Trump, he’s only getting started.	"   Jim James says performing his new songs will ""feel different"" in the wake of last week's election. (Neil Krug)  My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James isn't happy about the results of last week's election, but he isn't entirely surprised. On ""Same Old Lie,"" from his new solo record, ""Eternally Even,"" released on Nov. 4, James warned of what might happen: ""It's the same old lie you been reading about/ Bleeding out -- now who's getting cheated out?/ You best believe it's the silent majority/ If you don't vote it's on you -- not me."" The politically and socially charged ""Eternally Even"" bears little resemblance to James' first solo album, 2013's wide-ranging ""Regions of Light and Sound of God,"" or the psychedelic Southern rock he's championed with My Morning Jacket for nearly two decades. Sonically, the new album is James' most experimental work in years, with several of the funky, soul-inspired songs emerging out of improvised pieces from a failed film score. Express spoke with James two days after the vote -- and ahead of this weekend's show with Twin Limb at the Warner Theatre -- as President-elect Donald J. Trump weighed heavily on his mind.    How are you reacting to the election? I've been devastated, like most people that I know. It almost feels like somebody died, there's that period of grief. It kind of comes in and out of your consciousness. I feel like most people were all talking like, ""What do we do?"" in a very concrete and literal way. Obviously, there's this ""he's not my president"" [movement], which, I feel that way too -- he's definitely not my president. But at the same time, how do we move forward, because I also don't want to hate anybody. I don't want any fighting, I don't want any violence; I have no hatred in my heart for Trump supporters. What are you most concerned about? I feel like it's across-the-board. I feel like climate change is probably the biggest one because if the Earth is destroyed we're not going to have anywhere to even care about, and you can really see the reality of that because we just keep selling the planet away for oil drilling. We keep going down this dangerous slope that nobody really seems to want to act on. That's the biggest thing, but also the f--ing health-care thing: Why is it so hard for us to take care of each other? The racism and the sexism, I just don't understand it. You wrote this dark, political record that seems even more resonant now. Will performing these songs be cathartic? Definitely. You always hear things differently depending on what happened in your life. So our focus has been shifted and, obviously, I hoped it would be shifted in a good way. I was hoping we'd be going on this tour and be feeling positive, having the songs feel that way, but it is what it is, so they're gonna feel different. I still try to put positivity into everything I do. There is a lot of darkness and there is a lot of questioning but I still try to maintain that I believe there is hope and I always will believe that. So yeah, I hope people can get together and enjoy feeling the music and have it be some source of comfort. What do you feel like you can do, as a musician, to help make the world a better place? Well, I think it's not just me being a musician. I really think it's all of us. I feel like we really can't be silent anymore. I think a lot of us have had really great lives and we've been very fortunate and we've been able to coast through in a lot of ways and I feel like those days are done, especially if [Trump] takes office and they really start taking away people's rights and freedoms. We can't sit around and let that happen.    What led you down this path of being more direct, more political? I just felt like there was nothing else I wanted to sing about; nothing else made sense anymore because this is so much more important. And I feel like I really also try to make it very clear that I'm trying not to preach and I'm not saying I know the answers better than anybody else. [My Morning Jacket is back with an epic new album, 'The Waterfall,' and a free set on the National Mall] You're already writing the next My Morning Jacket album. Does Trump change your direction? Yeah, I think it does. I've got all these songs that are written already and some of them are political and some aren't, so yeah, when we get in the studio in the spring, however we're feeling and whatever's happening in the world will definitely dictate what goes down. What makes you hopeful for the future? Well, I really do believe in humanity and I believe that the system is broken and the way that we do things is broken and at the end of the day there's still hope that people can see the good in each other and find a way to love each other. I think we just have to spread the word: You gotta get out and vote and you gotta stand up and speak up for people because we've got to stick up for each other. There's no time to be silent and sit around and watch TV anymore. Warner Theatre, 513 13th St. NW; Sat., 8 p.m., $33.

And they will fight to keep it.	"   A supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump holds a sign during a campaign rally in Winston-Salem, N.C. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)  Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we're talking about American identity. Need a primer? Catch up here. Dale M. Coulter is an associate professor in the School of Divinity at Regent University. America is a patchwork of regional and local identities, stitched together by a shared history and the values and political structures enshrined in the Constitution. Despite the immortalization of cultural assimilation in the 1907 play ""The Melting Pot,"" Americans have preferred the richness of regional and local flavors to a bland, everyman America. More like PBS's ""A Chef's Life,"" with its focus on the food and traditions of eastern North Carolina, many Americans remain rooted in the folk culture of their region, whether it's the way of life found in the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia, or the Great Lakes of the Upper Midwest. The vast majority of those who inhabit the regional folk cultures of America's fruited plains belong to what historian Christopher Lasch called the ""petty bourgeoisie."" By this, Lasch meant the confluence of the working class and the lower middle class -- small proprietors, artisans, tradesmen and farmers. They at one time unionized against the forces of industrialization and now have voted against globalization, and they share the same set of values and thus a common perspective.   [Do Americans still have a shared identity?]   Regardless of which political party is in power, the petty bourgeoisie will repel efforts to impose a form of politics that seems to dismantle their regional and local identity. Populist resentment is the backlash against such measures. The distinctive viewpoint of this group, its valorization of community and hard work, stems from the way in which regional and local identities organize around family, church and neighborhood. The values of the petty bourgeoisie are a moral conservatism, egalitarianism, respect for work and loyalty, a preference for solidarity over social mobility, and a concern for communal structures over individual advancement. These priorities are evident in the preference that the majority of Americans have for staying close to their hometowns and the likelihood of returning to one's state or region. Saturday Night Live's recent sketch of ""Black Jeopardy"" with Tom Hanks hit on how this shared outlook can cross ethnic lines. Since the values of the petty bourgeoisie remain embedded in the folk cultures, regardless of where the individuals reside, they also transcend socioeconomic distinctions. This partly explains why Donald Trump outperformed Hillary Clinton by a four-point margin among whites with a college degree. A person who begins in a blue-collar family and moves into the professional class of white-collar employment does not necessarily leave behind the provincialism of family, church and neighborhood. And new and old values can coexist -- the affirmation of egalitarianism and solidarity explains how the petty-bourgeois mind-set could affirm equal pay for equal work while also vigorously defending motherhood and the right of women to stay at home and raise their children. Pitted against the petty-bourgeois world is the voice of the expert who, in Lasch's words, offers the promised land of progress as ""the true and only heaven."" And fueling the working classes reactionary fire is the tendency of a cultural elite to look down upon petty-bourgeois values as a backward form of anti-intellectualism that needs to embrace the progressive vision of a global and cosmopolitan future.  In the United States, many see increasing environmental regulations, gun-control measures and efforts to redefine familial structures as destructive to their communities. Such a viewpoint was merely reinforced by claims of prejudice against Islam, homophobia and xenophobia among media elites.  The populism of Middle America stems from the view that the traditional world of the petty bourgeoisie is under threat from the ""politics of the civilized minority."" It is a culture -- a way of living that is being defended. But in the face of external threats, folk cultures can succumb to the temptation to tribalism and a politics of envy and resentment. The racist rhetoric in certain sectors of the electorate is the manifestation of the instinct to protect folk identity. This is the dark side of populism.   [States are a relic of the past. It's time to get rid of them.]   Nevertheless, it would be reductionist to view recent events solely through the prism of race, just as analyses of ""working-class"" concerns should not reduce everything to economic factors. The potent mix of immigration, wage stagnation, job loss and disintegration of moral values were kindling that Trump's populist rhetoric ignited. This may be why Midwesterners who previously voted for President Obama cast their lot with the president-elect. In 2004, Obama's populist speeches against George W. Bush's ""trickle-down"" elitism and his easy familiarity with religion tapped into the concerns for church and community. In 2016, Trump built on this anti-elite narrative and applied it to Obama's policies and Clinton's character. In America's past, religion supplied the balm of spiritual discipline in order to resist the temptation to resentment and self-righteousness. Grounded in a transcendent hope, this discipline made forgiveness possible, humanizing the opposition. It channeled resentment into activism that sustained a conversation about how to find liberty and justice for all. Martin Luther King Jr. saw how hope and forgiveness nourished non-violent resistance ""until justice rolls down like mighty rivers."" Even with the rise of the ""nones,"" especially in white America, religion retains a vital role at the level of folk culture. To try to privatize the influence of religion upon American culture rather than seeing it as a way to facilitate ongoing conversation among various folk cultural identities would be a mistake. The moral discourse within religion is precisely what is needed to curb the dangerous extremes to which populism can go. All politics is still local, and local culture is often where the strength of American identity resides. In the year where folk artist Bob Dylan won a Nobel Prize and anti-establishmentarian Donald Trump won the presidency, it may be time to acknowledge the vitality of folk cultures while also helping them to resist the darkness of a tribal politics of resentment.

Kim oversaw an ambitious drive to clean up the country, even authorizing the arrest of his two immediate predecessors on corruption-related charges, although he eventually became infected by the ""disease"" himself when his son was arrested on corruption and bribery charges. Corruption, bribery, embezzlement and the abuse of power have been modulated over the past generation but remain indisputable components of official South Korea, as the scandal now engulfing President Park Geun-hye shows. Park is set to be questioned by prosecutors as soon as Thursday about her role in an influence-peddling scandal revolving around a friend of 40 years. Although every South Korean president since democratization in 1987 has become ensnared by corruption in one way or another, Park will become the first incumbent to be grilled by prosecutors. She cannot be charged while in office but could be indicted after she leaves, which may happen sooner than expected.     South Korea's president is engulfed in a political scandal with plotlines straight out of a soap opera: rumors of secret advisers, nepotism and ill-gotten gains. (Anna Fifield, Yoonjung Seo, Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)   Most analysts had thought Park would try to ride out the storm until the next election, in December 2017. But after a third week of huge protests -- hundreds of thousands gathered in central Seoul on Saturday, drawing comparisons to the demonstrations that ended military rule almost 30 years ago -- the chances of her being forced out of office have increased. Eurasia Group, a consulting firm that assesses risk, now puts the probability at 70 percent.  [South Koreans gather en masse to protest against president]   ""The situation has reached a point of no return,"" Moon Jae-in, an opposition politician and presidential hopeful, said Tuesday. Up to then, he had demanded that she hand over day-to-day running of the country to the prime minister, chosen by parliament. But now, he said, that was no longer sufficient. ""I, along with the citizens, will carry out a nationwide campaign for Park's resignation until she declares she will unconditionally step aside,"" he said. The scandal flared last month when it emerged that Park, widely considered a distant figure, was being secretly advised by a friend of 40 years, a woman with no policy background but with ties to a religious cult. The woman, Choi Soon-sil, is accused of receiving classified information and of using her ties to Park to raise up to $70 million from big business groups for two foundations -- most of which she is said to have siphoned off -- and to get her daughter into a prestigious university. She is in custody and is expected to be indicted this week. Park's attempts at quelling the public fury over this ""shadow president"" have amounted to nothing, as shown by the increasingly large protests against her.         1 of 18       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                           Skip Ad   x           Photos of South Koreans rallying to demand president's ouster      View Photos   Hundreds of thousands of people flooded Seoul's streets demanding the resignation of President Park Geun-hye amid an explosive political scandal, in what may be South Korea's largest protest since it shook off dictatorship three decades ago.

Nov. 12, 2016 A mass of South Koreans gather to demand President Park Geun-Hye's resignation in Seoul after she issued a rare public apology in the midst of a corruption scandal.  Jeon Heon-Kyun/AFP/Getty Images  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.   .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video{width:100%;height:100%}        The scandal has highlighted just how prevalent ""the Korean disease"" remains. It encompasses the presidential Blue House, with some of Park's aides suspected of helping Choi raise money, and big business, with Samsung alone said to have given $20 million directly to Choi or to her foundations. Senior officials from big conglomerates including Samsung, Hyundai Motors and LG have been called in for questioning. This adds to the woes at Samsung, already reeling from the withdrawal of one its flagship products, the Galaxy Note 7 phone. It also involves the powerful prosecutors office, which is accused of being too political. A prominent former prosecutor who served as a senior presidential secretary to Park is now under investigation on suspicion of helping Choi and tipping off big businesses to pending raids. And hard-charging prosecutors often end up working in the Blue House or at the big conglomerates, further cementing personal links between institutions.  [South Korean president offers to withdraw her prime-minister nominee]   Stephan Haggard, professor of Korea-Pacific studies at the University of California at San Diego, said the scandal is bigger than Watergate. ""It's the scope of the violations that are in play,"" he said. ""There's the classified information, the foundations, the university. There are half a dozen discrete things that are likely to be illegal."" Ra Jong-yil, a former deputy director of South Korean intelligence, also sees echoes of the Watergate scandal. ""The easiest way to fix this is for the president to resign, just like Nixon did,"" Ra said. The kind of corruption seen in South Korea is partly the result of government-sponsored industrialization. It was Park's father, authoritarian president Park Chung-hee, who supported the creation of corporate giants such as Samsung and Hyundai, encouraging links between government and business in the 1960s and 1970s that remain strong today. Park learned about the coalition of business and politics from her father, said Kim Dong-choon, a professor of social sciences at Sungkonghoe University. ""Park's watch stopped in the 1970s,"" he said. This homogeneous nation also pits friendship and loyalty against following the law. ""This is a very communitarian society, and there's an expectation that you're going to go with the flow,"" said Scott Snyder, a Korea specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""In America, friendships are run as contractual relationships and people know the boundaries, operate within social rules of etiquette that generate a little more distance,"" Snyder said. But in South Korea, creating this kind of distance is contrary to the bond of friendship. The concept of ""butak"" -- literally ""favor,"" but with a deep sense of obligation and expectation attached -- means that it is hard to say no when a friend asks you for something.  [As a bizarre scandal unfolds, South Korea's president depicts herself as lonely]   This concept makes it difficult to create checks and balances that can overcome personal networks, Snyder said. ""Institutions end up being compromised by the fact that Mr. Kim at the Blue House went to elementary school with Mr. Lee at the prosecutors office,"" he said. ""That's the classic struggle that makes corruption endemic."" This scandal comes just after South Korea enacted a new law designed to root out bribery and corruption, prohibiting people from spending more than $27 on a meal for public officials, employees of state-run companies or journalists. But that law was designed to target corruption at the lower end of the scale, doing little to address the kinds of issues raised in ""Choi-gate,"" as it is known here. Almost two-thirds of people surveyed by the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission in 2014 said they thought South Korean society was corrupt. Tackling this problem will not be easy, said Lee Tae-ho of People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, an activist organization. ""We are calling for Park's resignation, but because there are many structural problems, we are calling for citizens to help solve this problem,"" he said. ""The solutions should come from the political sphere, but the political sphere also has problems."" Lee noted that some left-wing parties had been banned. Kim Dong-choon, the social scientist, said, ""This is not just about Park's and Choi's misdeeds but other forces -- the prosecutorial system, the bureaucratic system -- and the shortcomings that have made this incident possible."" ""This is a great opportunity for Koreans to rebuild our society and our politics,"" Kim said, ""to overcome old ways of thinking.""  Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report.
