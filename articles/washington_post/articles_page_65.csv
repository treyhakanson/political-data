The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the globe averaged 58.4 degrees (14.7 Celsius), which is 1.3 degrees (0.7 Celsius) warmer than the 20th-century average but not as warm as Octobers in 2015 and 2014. From May 2015 to August 2016, Earth set monthly heat records for 16 straight months. Scientists blame continued man-made climate change from the burning of fossil fuels, goosed by a now-gone El Nino. El Nino is the occasional natural warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather worldwide. The first 10 months of 2016 have been the hottest year to date, averaging 59.15 degrees (15.07 Celsius). That beats 2015 by .18 degrees (.1 Celsius). NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden said it is likely that this year will eclipse 2015 as the hottest year on record . If November and October are just average for the 21st century, it will set a new record. But Blunden said a weak La Nina, the cooling flip side of El Nino, provides a small possibility that 2016 will slip slightly behind 2015. Still, 2016, 2015 and 2014 will go down as the three hottest years on record ""however they stack up,"" Blunden said. Records go back to 1880. Since 2000, the globe has set 42 monthly heat records and four annual heat records. No global monthly records for cold have been set since December 1916. New Mexico had its hottest October on record, while neighboring Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado had near record heat for the month. NOAA meteorologists said the Arctic was unusually warm for a long period of time, both before and after the strong El Nino. Parts of Greenland, including the top of Greenland's ice sheet, were more than 13 degrees (more than 7 Celsius) warmer than average last month. There has been ""a meteoric rise in October temperatures on Alaska's north slope,"" said Rick Thoman, NOAA's climate science and services manager in Alaska. Barrow's The average October temperature in 2016 in Barrow, Alaska, was 30.2 degrees, nearly double the 20th century normal of 15.6 degrees. And the last 15 years have all averaged more than 20 degrees in October in Barrow.  ""Since October 2001, there have been no cold Octobers (in Barrow), not one,"" Thoman said. ""This change is the direct result of the really catastrophic loss of autumn sea ice on Alaska's north coast."" Arctic sea ice in October -- the first full month when sea ice is supposed to grow in the region set a record low for the month, Blunden said. She called the Arctic the ""canary in the coal mine"" for global warming. ___ Follow Seth Borenstein at http://twitter.com/borenbears and his work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/seth-borenstein Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Think of it as photosynthesis on steroids. Photosynthesis is how plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into food. But it's a very inefficient process, using less than 1 percent of the energy available, scientists said. By genetically modifying part of the plant's protective system, which kicks into gear when too much sunlight beams down, scientists were able to increase leaf growth between 14 and 20 percent in experiments with tobacco plants, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science .  ""Now that we know it works, it won't be too difficult to do it with other crops,"" said study lead author Stephen Long, a professor of crop sciences at the University of Illinois. ""If you look at crops around the world, it would (increase yield) many million tons of food."" That's still at least 15 years away, but this is the first time scientists have been able to do something like this, Long said. A plant's protective system is like a pressure relief valve in a steam engine. When there's too much sunlight, it turns on and gets rid of excess energy safely. When the plant is in the shade, the protective system turns off, but not quickly, said study co-author Krishna Niyogi, a plant scientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the University of California, Berkeley. Long said the protective system regulates sunlight in much the same way light-adjusting glasses darken and lighten. But it takes 10 minutes to an hour for plants to adjust, so the plant doesn't get the optimal amount of energy, especially when it goes back into sunlight. So Long and his team genetically modified the plant to turn that protection system off and on faster. Two different plants in the experiment increased leaf growth by 20 percent and a third by 14 percent. Long said he used tobacco because it is easy to manipulate the genetics, but there is no reason it can't work with rice, corn and other seed-oriented foods. Maybe the yield increase would be only 10 percent, he said. University of Nebraska-Lincoln agriculture professor Tala Awanda said the study makes sense, but cautioned the yield might not be quite so high for conventional food crops. Still, he added in an email, ""this study remains a breakthrough."" ___ Online: Science: http://www.sciencemag.org/ ___ Follow Seth Borenstein at http://twitter.com/borenbears and his work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/seth-borenstein Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Tobin knows well what lies ahead: As archbishop of Indianapolis, Tobin publicly challenged Trump's vice president-elect, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, over his order to prevent aid groups from helping resettle Syrian refugees in the state. Tobin refused, and last year the archdiocese settled the Syrian family -- followed by 52 other refugees. In an interview with The Associated Press, Tobin said the U.S. church has been helping resettle migrants for over a century. He said that priority ""is going to be challenging in the next four years and hopefully we will meet the challenge.""  ""The ethical reflection of a nation isn't reduced to the government,"" he added, saying what counts is its people. ""I have a lot of faith in the American people."" Tobin was in Rome for the ceremony Saturday during which Pope Francis will formally make him a member of the College of Cardinals, the churchmen who will one day elect his successor. Tobin is one of 17 new cardinals, three of them Americans, who will get their red hats. His nomination was a surprise, given that Indianapolis has never had a cardinal and that the U.S. church had been passed over in Francis' previous consistories. Francis compounded the shock by recently appointing Tobin to take over in Newark, New Jersey, which has been roiled by the leadership of its retiring archbishop, John Myers. Tobin, the oldest of 13 children raised largely by a single mother after his father died young, confesses he doesn't know what exactly Francis saw in him to entrust such weighty responsibilities. Others, however, know why.  ""He's not pompous and he cares about the peripheries,"" said John Carr, who headed the justice and peace section of the U.S. bishops' conference for more than two decades before founding a program at Georgetown University on Catholic social thought. ""He's a pastor, not a prince."" In that way, Tobin is very much a Francis-style bishop. In addition to pressing the pope's top concern for the plight of refugees, Tobin was nearly alone at a recent meeting of American bishops in urging the U.S. church hierarchy to focus on prioritizing Francis' environmental message.  ""Joe Tobin is a pastor after the pope's heart,"" said Michael Sean Winters, a columnist at the National Catholic Reporter. Francis has made the plight of refugees one of the hallmarks of his papacy, even bringing a dozen Syrian refugees home with him from Lesbos, Greece. He has asserted that anyone who wants to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep out migrants -- as President-elect Trump has proposed -- is ""not Christian."" Pence had been among dozens of governors from mostly Republican states who attempted to block Syrian refugees following the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris, saying there were questions about the federal government's refugee screening process. During the confrontation, Tobin brought an Iraqi refugee with him to a meeting with the governor to explain the church's position. Tobin said Pence received his Iraqi friend ""with great respect"" and said he thought Pence's position was more political strategy than personal conviction.  ""I'd like to believe that the governor himself felt caught, because I think that there was an overarching political interest in this thing, the governors banding together against the administration,"" Tobin said. ""And I think Gov. Pence, who takes his Christianity seriously, felt conflicted by it."" Tobin considers Francis a teacher, and says he has styled his ministry on what he observed in visiting the Argentine members of his Redemptorist religious order while he was superior general. His priests liked Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, the archbishop of Buenos Aires, and so did his mother. Tobin tells the story of how he and Bergoglio, the future pope, first met during a 2005 bishops meeting at the Vatican just a few months after Pope Benedict XVI was elected. During a coffee break, Tobin told Bergoglio that his mother had actually been rooting for Bergoglio to be elected pope instead since she had read that he picked up after himself, cooked his own food and did the dishes.  ""I said 'Frankly, she's had it up to here with the princes of the church,'"" Tobin recalled telling the future pope. ""He's never forgot that. And I'm hoping because she's here, perhaps on Saturday or Sunday, they'll get a chance to meet."" ___ Follow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield ___ This version corrects that Pence is still governor.

""Ugh,"" huffed Reena Shukla. ""I'm terrified."" Donald Trump as leader of the nation is hard enough for the nearly 63 million Americans who voted for Hillary Clinton to swallow. (Her popular vote count is now 1 million higher than Trump, despite his electoral college victory.) But the idea of Trump moving into one of the United States' liberal strongholds -- with its advocacy workers and activists, food trucks, yoga studios, legal pot, SoulCycle and dog parks -- is a total disconnect. It's Archie Bunker moving into the penthouse of the Jefferson's building. Ralph Kramden moving to Carrie Bradshaw's street.   Aniekan Udofia teams with MuralsDC to pay tribute to President Obama on the side of Ben's Chili Bowl in 2012. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)  Trump is suing the city he's about to move to, for heaven's sake, over the tax bill for his fancy new hotel just down the street from the White House. And he's displacing a president deeply beloved by residents of the nation's capital. The Obama family didn't just occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. They moved into this town and made it their town.  [The Obamas: Refusing to give in to the haters after years of threats and abuse]  For the millennials who've been fueling the District's growth by the thousands these past eight years, the town's identity is deeply connected to the Obama family. The president was a regular at school sporting events; he did his Christmas shopping at local bookstores; the first couple went to D.C.'s hottest restaurants for their Friday date nights. ""Being here, growing up with this family here? It has been such an amazing experience,"" said Gege Okon, 19, a sophomore at Howard University, who decided to go there partly because she'd be living in the first African American president's city. ""I grew up in a pretty white town in Pennsylvania, so coming here at this time in history was a positive experience,"" the Harrisburg native said. She's close to the Obama girls' ages. She'll always remember the day the family was elected. ""Seeing them in the White House has changed how we see each other.""   In January 2009, President-elect Barack Obama pays for a chili half smoke with a side of shredded cheese at Ben's Chili Bowl. (Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg News)  Plus, she used to work at the sandwich shop where President Obama liked to stop in every once in a while. And a couple weeks ago, she was standing, like, two feet away from Michelle Obama. How cool is that? This vibrant city? Nothing more than a swamp to Trump.  [They existed in a girls-can-do-anything world. Then Donald Trump won the White House. ]  ""We were just saying other day, what would happen to all this once he's here?"" said Angela Kung, sweeping her arms around the streetscape. She's 35, a lawyer, liberal and loves the District. The neighborhood at 14th and U streets where I met Kung is the epicenter of Washington's gilded age. Not gilded a la Trump's take on Louis XVI. Gilded today means endless condominiums, Bikeshare stations, $14 craft cocktails, sushi burritos, doggy day care. The Obama aesthetic -- diverse, progressive, fashionable -- is part of the city's contemporary fabric. ""We were in China Chilcano the other night and the Secret Service came in and started doing their sweep. We got so excited,"" Kung said. Obama-sightings are sport in Washington. This kind of interaction probably won't happen with Trump, who has already hinted that he'd rather run the country from his pink-and-gold Versailles in New York. Plus, China Chilcano does not serve Trump Steaks. (Oops, they exist no more, like Trump Taj Mahal and Trump University.) I mean, steak well-done, Trump-style. And we all know where China Chilcano's owner, renowned Washington chef Jose Andres, stands with Trump. (He's being sued by the president-elect for refusing to open a restaurant in Trump International Hotel after the candidate slammed undocumented Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers and promised to deport them.) Does the occupant of the White House influence the rest of the city? Before Obama, George W. Bush rarely dipped his toes into the D.C. swamp. His big adventure -- they still remember the chair he sat in -- was a night out at Cactus Cantina in Northwest Washington. His dad didn't do much better, favoring a strip mall Chinese place in Northern Virginia. Bill Clinton's jogging excursions to McDonald's were famous. The Kennedys were Georgetown denizens. And Richard M. Nixon even had a favorite booth in Martin's Tavern in Georgetown. Abraham Lincoln was an infamous insomniac who paced the city streets. But what will Trump do? Probably nothing good for the District. We're not just a company town. We're an art town, a music town, a food town. We're a sanctuary city for immigrants, something the Trump family -- I mean, administration -- is already threatening to end. Kung and her husband, Stephen Lei, 35, a Web producer, who were picking up their pups from doggy day care when we talked, said Trump's election is the first time they've considered leaving the city. Shukla, 34, who works for USAID and came back to the United States from her last foreign posting specifically to get a taste of living in the thriving capital, said that she hopes the threat of Trump will galvanize the 93 percent of D.C. voters who didn't vote Trump. ""A lot of people are pissed off and riled up,"" she said. ""So this may also bring people together."" Maybe. But you know what? Before the yoga mats, yerba mates and Obamas, the District was already cool. U Street was known as Black Broadway. Howard Theatre -- where Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, the Supremes held forth -- opened before the Apollo in New York even existed. Down the street, Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Billie Holiday and Pearl Bailey played at the Lincoln Theatre. This city is home to Duke Ellington, Marvin Gaye and Roberta Flack. It's the land of go-go (long live Chuck Brown) and punk rock (Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Henry Rollins and Fugazi). And many of the musicians who played U Street went to Ben's Chili Bowl for a half-smoke after their shows. Obama stopped by almost eight years ago to sample the city's larger and spicier version of a hot dog. ""We serve everyone at the bowl,"" said Virginia Ali, matriarch of the Ali family and owner of the place for 58 years. Ali's eyes didn't sparkle when I mentioned the mogul about to move into our town; she prefers to stay out of politics. ""Well, the election is over. What's done is done,"" Ali said. ""But we've always served everyone here, everyone is welcome."" On a recent night, Ali posed for pictures with diners. A pair of tourists from the Netherlands came to pay homage to the place that survived the 1968 riots, Harding, Coolidge, Nixon, Reagan and not one, but two Bushes. The District is used to the changing of the guard. Presidents and their hordes of political appointees come and go.  This is the place where Yarrow Mamout, a freed black man and devout Muslim, earned enough from his hauling business to buy a house in Georgetown in 1800. It's where Carter G. Woodson edited ""The Journal of Negro History,"" where abolitionist Frederick Douglass was a U.S. Marshal, where Alice Paul ran the suffragette movement, where black feminist Mary Eliza Church Terrell became head of the D.C. Board of Education way back in 1895, where gay rights pioneer Frank Kameny ran the Mattachine Society, and where civil rights firebrand Stokely Carmichael studied.

Home construction soared 25.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted 1.3 million in October, the Commerce Department said Thursday . That is the biggest gain since July 1982. New construction is also at the highest level since August 2007, months before the Great Recession began. Americans are clamoring to buy homes, but there are few properties on the market. That has driven up prices. Mortgage rates remain low, despite a big increase this week, making more homes affordable. Steady hiring and some signs that pay gains are picking up have bolstered demand for housing. Younger Americans, buoyed by higher pay, are moving out on their own, renting apartments or seeking to buy houses. Sales of new and existing homes have picked up in recent months.  ""With improved employment and income prospects, millennials are an expanding portion of housing demand, as they move out of their parents' homes,"" David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide, said. The jump in construction was driven by a 75 percent leap in apartment building, a notoriously volatile category. That was the biggest gain in five years. Single-family home construction rose 10.7 percent. Still, the future is a bit cloudy for housing. Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election has led to higher interest rates on government bonds, a sign investors expect higher inflation in the coming years. Those increases have lifted mortgage rates from very low levels. The average rate nationwide on a 30-year fixed mortgage jumped to 3.94 percent this week, from just 3.57 percent last week. Trump's policies could affect housing in different ways. Restrictions on immigration could limit the supply of available workers for construction firms, which have already complained for years of labor shortages. Yet Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at data provider Trulia, points out that Trump could loosen regulations on banks and reform mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, potentially increasing the flow of mortgage lending. Sales of new homes climbed 13 percent in September from a year earlier. Yet the supply of new properties was equivalent to just 4.8 months of sales, down from 5.8 months a year ago. And sales of existing homes bumped up 3.2 percent in September from the previous month. But supply is tight there as well: The number of existing homes for sale was barely above 2 million, 6.8 percent lower than a year earlier. Those shortages are likely fueling more construction. Homebuilding rose strongly last month in the Northeast, where new construction has lagged for months and is up just 2.2 percent in the past year. The increase was also strong in the Midwest, followed by steady gains in the West and South. Applications for building permits, a good sign of future activity, barely rose to 1.23 million, the highest in a year. Still, that followed a much larger 6.3 percent gain in the previous month. Employers are adding an average of about 175,000 jobs a month, and the unemployment rate fell to a low 4.9 percent in October. Average hourly pay rose in the past year by the fastest pace since before the recession began, boosting the confidence of would-be buyers. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)  Donald Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani said ""there's no perfect way"" for the president-elect to deal with his billions in business assets, but on Sunday he encouraged Trump to put his money in a blind trust ""for the good of the country."" No matter what Trump does, Giuliani said, ""there will be a wall"" between Trump's decisions as president and his financial interests. Trump says he's worth $8 billion, although Forbes magazine says the amount is closer to $3.7 billion. His business empire is made up of more than 500 companies around the globe, including more than 250 bearing his name, according to ABC News. Critics say that makes him susceptible to conflicts of interest.   [Kellyanne Conway: It's up to Clinton, Obama to calm anti-Trump protesters]   ""For the good of the country, and the fact you don't want a question coming up every time there's a decision made, he should basically take himself out of it and just be a passive participant in the sense that he has no decision-making, no involvement,"" Giuliani said on ABC News's ""This Week."" ""And those decisions get made separate from him, which is the way it's done for most cabinet offices."" On the campaign trail, Trump said he would turn over his business interests to his children if elected. But Jake Tapper grilled Giuliani on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" saying that wasn't enough separation, especially because Trump's children were still advising him on political matters. ""It's kind of unrealistic to say that you're going to take the business away,"" Giuliani responded. ""You'll have to fashion something that is very comfortable, very fair. ... Even if he turns it over to an independent trustee, there's no perfect way to do this.""   [Gov. Andrew Cuomo: New York a 'refuge' for minorities, immigrants]   Giuliani said Trump's wealth may be the biggest deterrent to any conflicts of interest. ""This man didn't want to run for president to try to get rich. He's rich already,"" the former New York mayor said. On Sunday, Giuliani also touched on Trump's immigration plan. In December, after the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attacks, Trump called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on."" But Giuliani said Trump's stance had softened during the campaign. For most countries, Giuliani said, ""it wouldn't be a ban, it would be extreme vetting."" He said Muslims would be allowed into the United States if their home countries let immigration officials thoroughly examine the migrants. Giuliani told Tapper that there are six countries -- Pakistan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen -- with regard to which ""we have to be very careful."" Giuliani said that with Pakistan and Egypt ""we could probably do some pretty good vetting. Yemen is a lot more volatile."" Syrian refugees would face the toughest hurdles, Giuliani said, because they are difficult to vet and could be terrorist operatives. ""The problem with the Syrian refugees is not just that you can't vet them . . . The problem is also that [Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi] has said that he's going to put terrorist operatives among the refugees,"" Giuliani said. ""We would be foolish to allow these people to come into the United States. We are being warned that he is going to send people here to attack us.""

A few college professors stood up to a tidal wave of prevailing thought to separately predict for months that the New York billionaire and reality TV star would pull off one of the biggest shockers in American political history. A political scientist at New York's Stony Brook University based his prediction on a formula using primary results and his ""pendulum of change"" theory. A Yale professor tied his pick to economic factors. And a history professor at American University relied on a formula he developed in the 1980s.  ""I had a lot of people saying, 'This isn't going to work. You're going to fall on your face.' I got emails berating me for being an idiot and irresponsible,"" says Helmut Norpoth, a longtime political science professor at Stony Brook. Norpoth has successfully predicted every presidential winner since developing the formula for the 1996 presidential race. He also used his formula to review every presidential election since 1912, and found the indicators would have accurately predicted the outcome every time except 1960. He acknowledged he harbored some private doubts as this year's contentious campaign raged on, he never wavered publicly, even doubling down on the pick after Trump's explosive ""Access Hollywood"" video came out.  ""I put up a good face,"" he says. ""But deep down I got a little uneasy, I can't deny that."" Norpoth says his model is based, in part, on the idea that candidates who excel in primaries tend to do better in the general election. He says Trump's victory and Clinton's defeat at the hands of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the New Hampshire primary was a key indicator for him of the Republican's strength. He also factored in that Barack Obama had held the White House for two terms and estimated the pendulum could swing Republican. The only time in the past 30 years that either party won three straight presidential elections was in 1988, when Republican George H.W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis. Also successfully predicting a Republican victory was Yale University professor Ray Fair. He used economic factors -- GDP growth and inflation -- and not the vagaries of either candidate's personality in his prognostication. American University professor Alan Lichtman said he uses 13 factors to assess the performance of the party in power to determine whether it will keep the White House. He examined presidential elections from 1860 to 1980 to establish the factors to develop his study. He said the factors this year narrowly showed a Republican would prevail. Lichtman's success comes with an asterisk. He has accurately calculated the winner of the popular vote in every election since 1984, but Al Gore actually lost in the electoral college in 2000, as it appears has happened to Clinton this year.  ""I feel vindicated in a sense, but I had issued a qualification because in Donald Trump you had a history-smashing candidate,"" Lichtman says. ___ Follow Eltman on Twitter at @feltman41 Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The party's leader is at best indifferent to, and often is hostile to, much of the party's recent catechism: limited government, the rule of law, a restrained executive, fiscal probity, entitlement reforms, free trade, the general efficiency and equity of markets allocating wealth and opportunity, and -- this matters especially -- the importance of decorousness in political discourse.  Americans standing on scorched earth that is still smoldering need a respite from furiousness. Andrew Jackson was, until last Tuesday, the only person elected president who was defined by his anger. He seems to have been constantly angry after 1780, when at age 13 he carried messages for the patriots fighting the British at the Battle of Hanging Rock in South Carolina. He was taken prisoner, and a British officer ordered him to clean the officer's boots. When Jackson refused, the officer swung his sword, gashing Jackson's head and fingers.  Today, many Americans seem to relish being furious. An indignation industry has battened on the Republican Party, feeding this addiction. This industry is inimical to conservatism's health.  A veteran baseball coach once said baseball is not a game you can play with your teeth clenched. The sport of the long season requires emotional equipoise, a continuous combination of concentration and relaxation. As does democratic politics, which is an unending exercise in patient persuasion.  Furthermore, in politics, style and substance are braided. Many things, and all the most important ones, cannot be effectively advocated at the top of the advocates' lungs. Try to shout a persuasive argument for caring about the separation of powers, or why the judiciary should be actively engaged in countering the excesses of the majoritarian branches.  Critics will respond: Most voters do not give a tinker's damn about such matters. This is true, which is precisely why persuasion is necessary to temper the public's instinctive aversion to the patience that politics requires -- the public's proclivity for disparaging institutional impediments to immediate gratification. Only conservatives will undertake such persuasion.  Indeed, making difficult constitutional arguments is central to conservatism's raison d'etre. This is particularly urgent now that conservatism is identified with the president-elect, a conservative-of-convenience who expresses his adopted convictions as though he recently purchased a Rosetta Stone program for quick fluency in speaking conservatism.  People who have been conservative since before 2015 should, in considering how to relate to the president-elect, ask themselves some questions, such as: What are we saying if we say we are against free trade? Protectionism is comprehensive government intervention in economic life. It supplants commercial calculations with political considerations. Using tariffs, which are taxes imposed at the border, government imposes its judgment of what Americans should be permitted to purchase, in what quantities and at what prices. If conservatism can embrace such statism, can it distinguish itself from progressivism -- the doctrine that government experts are wiser than markets in determining individuals' choices and directing the efficient use of labor and capital?  Progressives think -- or did until last Tuesday -- as Woodrow Wilson did about the delights of unconstrained presidential power. In 1887, Professor Wilson of Bryn Mawr College regretted that America had excessively ""studied the art of curbing executive power to the constant neglect of the art of perfecting executive methods."" It exasperated him that America ""has been more concerned to render government just and moderate than to make it facile, well-ordered and effective."" Progressives may regret Donald Trump's executive methods if he emulates Barack Obama's ""just try to stop me"" approach to presidential enforcement (or non-enforcement) and regulatory (or deregulatory) actions. Before the election, Trump's more thoughtful supporters conceded his comprehensive unfamiliarity with governance but insisted that he would be sufficiently wise to surround himself with seasoned people and sufficiently humble to heed them. He could make these suppositions more plausible by nominating Kelly Ayotte to be attorney general.  A former attorney general of New Hampshire, Sen. Ayotte distanced herself from Trump during her unsuccessful reelection campaign this autumn. But the Justice Department has been politically tainted by, among other things, its lassitude regarding the IRS's abuses against conservative advocacy groups. It needs a steely but amiable leader, not someone with a recent record of hysterical partisanship (e.g., Rudy Giuliani). With such Cabinet choices, President-elect Donald Trump can begin to present a persona more measured and less bellicose than that of candidate Trump.   Read more from George F.
