Some who voluntarily returned to Somalia from Dadaab camp told The Associated Press they are now facing hunger despite promises that they would be assisted. Kenya's government announced in May that Dadaab, with more than 280,000 residents, will be closed at the end of this month, saying the camp was creating security problems. The Kenyan government is forcing Dadaab residents to go back to Somalia without adequate support, Amnesty said in its report. Its researchers visited Dadaab in August, where they interviewed 56 refugees individually and held group discussions.  ""The refugees are caught between a rock and a hard place. Kenyan government officials are telling them they must leave by the end of the month (November) or they will be forced to leave without any assistance,"" said Michelle Kagari, Amnesty International's deputy director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.  ""These actions contravene the Kenyan government's assurances to the international community that it would ensure all refugee repatriations are voluntary and carried out in safety and dignity,"" she said. Halimo Abdow, a mother of nine who returned to Somalia from Dadaab in August, told The Associated Press she was given a 10-day deadline to leave the camp by Kenyan security agents who threatened that they would forcibly evict her if she did not leave.  ""When you are a foreigner, you have no choice ... you must listen to them. We notified the U.N. and other agencies about that problem, but they ignored our pleas to intervene,"" she said by phone from Afgoye, an agricultural town 30 kilometers (18miles) north of Mogadishu, Somalia's capital. Abdow initially arrived in Mogadishu to stay at a refugee camp but moved back to her hometown, complaining of a lack of assistance by aid agencies.  ""In Dadaab, we had peace and daily rations of food, but here Somalia we get none of those things. We are dying of starvation,"" said Amina Nur, a mother of six, sitting under an acacia tree near the Somali capital.  ""I volunteered to return home because aid workers told us that we'd get resettlement, daily food and water. But no one has come to our assistance,"" she said. Some Somali refugees have been living in Dadaab in eastern Kenya for more than 20 years, since Somalia descended into chaos following the 1991 ouster of longtime dictator Siad Barre by warlords who then turned on each other. The Amnesty report includes the accounts of two brothers, aged 15 and 18, who left Dadaab for Somalia in January 2016 but then returned to the camp four months later. They said when they got to Somalia, their father was killed in front of them and they were forced to join al-Shabab. The brothers eventually escaped from the extremists and made it back to Dadaab. The reports that Kenya is forcing refugees to leave Dadaab contradicts Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's assurances that the returns will be voluntary. ""Kenya continues to work toward the safe and dignified repatriation of refugees from the Dadaab camp,"" Kenyatta told U.S. President Barack Obama in a telephone conversation in September, according to Kenyatta's press office. Kenya has said the closure of Dadaab is necessary because the sprawling camp is a recruitment ground for al-Shabab and a base for the extremist group to launch attacks on Kenya. Al-Shabab has carried out several attacks on Kenya, which sent troops to Somalia in 2011 to fight the militants who are waging an insurgency against the country's weak western-backed government. Al-Shabab's attacks on Kenyan targets include the September 21, 2013 attack on Westgate mall that killed 67 people and last year's attack on Garissa University that left 148 people, mostly students, dead. But officials have not provided conclusive proof that the camp is a staging ground for extremist attacks. Some Kenyan officials have said the Westgate attackers came from Dadaab but investigators later said they came from a different refugee camp, Kakuma, which is mostly populated by South Sudanese refugees in northern Kenya. ___ Guled reported from Mogadishu, Somalia Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Despite being rivals in the GOP primaries, Carson has become a close confidant of the president-elect. (Mark J. Terrill/AP)  Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has been a confidant to President-elect Donald Trump since the end of the Republican primaries, is unlikely to join the administration but will remain an informal adviser. ""The way I'm leaning is to work from the outside and not from the inside,"" Carson said in an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post. ""I want to have the freedom to work on many issues and not be pigeonholed into one particular area."" Carson, who is Trump's most high-profile African American supporter, has been under consideration for several positions in Trump's Cabinet, including secretary of health and human services. Carson said he has made his decision clear to Trump in several private conversations in recent days. ""I've said that if it came to a point where he absolutely needs me, I'd reconsider. But I don't think that's the situation with these positions,"" he said. ""My view is that if some people and the media are going to hate him, then he's going to need allies on the outside to be there, to be there to move the country forward. I don't care about a position.' He added with a chuckle, ""Having me as a federal bureaucrat would be like a fish out of water, quite frankly.""      Ben Carson endorsed Donald Trump for president in March, but hasn't been a great surrogate in televised appearances since then. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   When asked whether he was formally offered a specific post, Carson said, ""I was offered things, there's no question about that. I don't want to go into the details."" Carson said he expects to continue public speaking and media appearances and visiting with Trump, especially when the president-elect travels to Florida, where Carson lives most of the year. ""He's just around the corner from where I am,"" Carson said, referring to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Armstrong Williams, Carson's business manager, said, ""Trump is a brother to Dr. Carson and they've formed a formidable bond. I've never seen Dr. Carson agonize so much over something. But it's what's best for everyone."" Williams said that Carson will continue to work with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence on the transition and to share policy and personnel suggestions. Carson noted that he has a strong working relationship with Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's controversial pick to be chief strategist at the White House. Bannon is ""a very smart and wise counselor,"" Carson said. ""He's the big-picture person."" Carson's decision to not accept a Cabinet post was first reported by Circa, a news website.

The National Prosecutor's Office, which ordered the autopsies, said a team of experts performed computer tomography and that samples were being taken for genetic, toxicology, chemical and other tests. The team includes 14 forensic experts from Poland, Switzerland, Portugal and Denmark. The tests are needed to allow experts to determine ""the injuries the victims had suffered and the cause of their deaths, as well as for the reconstruction of the course of the crash"" of the Soviet-made Tu-154M plane, the prosecutor's office said in a statement. The plane crashed on April 10, 2010, on approach to a sporadically-used military airport in Smolensk, Russia. Separate investigations by both Polish and Russian experts blamed pilot error in bad weather conditions. The crash killed a huge swathe of Poland's political and military elite. The new probe was ordered by Poland's conservative ruling party, Law and Justice, which is led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the late president's twin brother, who questions the previous findings. The autopsies are an attempt to establish whether the crash was an accident or an assassination, as some Kaczynski followers believe. A total of 83 bodies are to be exhumed and examined through 2017. Families of 17 of the victims are protesting the exhumations as needless and cruel. Among other things, experts will be looking for traces of explosives and injuries that could result from an explosion. The bodies of the presidential couple are to be returned Friday to their tomb at the Wawel Cathedral in the southern city of Krakow in a private ceremony, the prosecutor's statement said.

"      The Fix's Chris Cillizza explains how Donald Trump beat expectations in rural areas and among Latino and black voters, propelling him to a surprising election win. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)   America is divided. America is always divided, of course, with our reds and our blues and so on. But America seems particularly divided now, thanks to a presidential election that starred two unpopular candidates and ended in a near-tie. Since Donald Trump won, there's been a lot of hand-wringing about the extent to which people in different parts of the country might not understand one another. Does some jerk in New York City really get what life is like for, say, an orange rancher in Central California? (I hope so to some extent, since he's my brother-in-law.) Does someone in rural Minnesota know what motivates people in our nation's capital? It's hard to say. Interestingly, our political opposites aren't always very far away geographically. There are places a short drive away from you right now that voted the exact opposite of where you live, for whatever reason. And should you want to do your part to erase the divides in America, we made a tool that lets you find those places. Enter your county (or any county) below and search to find the counties that voted most like and unlike that county in last week's election. More to the point, it will also return the county that's both close and different from the county for which you searched. (You can also have the tool locate where you are right now -- click ""Find me"" -- but you'll need to click ""Allow"" when prompted to let it do so. We don't store this information, obviously.) What should you do with this information? You should drive to the place that voted differently than where you live and make some friends. Hear people out. Do your part to eliminate the divides in American politics. Or you should enter different counties and see what comes up while not going anywhere. That is also fun.  FYI, nerds: The mapping system is powered by Mapzen, an open source mapping tool."

""Where is Melania Trump?"" he asked, going on to offer an answer: The potential first lady was reportedly having a nervous breakdown after her controversial GOP convention speech and her fears that a secret past would be revealed. ""It is also widely known that Melania was not a working model but rather a high end escort,"" wrote Webster Tarpley in a blog post that would come to be quoted in court filings. Tarpley, a Princeton University graduate, has also asserted that President Obama is a puppet of Wall Street and that the 9/11 attacks were a ""false-flag"" operation. Tarpley's claims about Melania Trump, posted in the heat of the campaign, were followed by similar allegations published in the Daily Mail, a British tabloid. Both pieces attracted the attention of Melania Trump and her attorneys, and both publications posted retractions. On Sept. 1, in Montgomery County Circuit Court, Melania Trump sued Tarpley and the Daily Mail for defamation. Her attorneys cited a series of published allegations, including those made in Tarpley's blog post, according to court records. Now, as Melania Trump readies to become first lady, the lawsuit shows no signs of slowing down.   Webster Tarpley (Obtained by The Washington Post)  ""These are some of the most inflammatory allegations possible,"" her attorneys wrote in their most recent filing. ""Tarpley acted with reckless disregard for the truth."" Tarpley declined to comment for this article.  His neighbor, Sam Rosenbloom, said Thursday that he has known Tarpley for more than 10 years and described him as a pleasant person. ""Clearly, political history is never far from his thoughts,"" said Rosenbloom, a Trump supporter who recently spray-painted ""Make America Great Again"" on the back of his own silver SUV. ""I don't think he thought what he wrote would be so hurtful,"" Rosenbloom said of Tarpley's blog post. ""And obviously, he wasn't sensitive to the reach of Donald Trump.""   Earlier: Tarpley fires back and Melania Trump   In a statement to The Washington Post, one of Tarpley's attorneys, John Owen, said: ""Mr. Tarpley is a political blogger who desires to engage his readers in a meaningful discourse on matters of public significance. In this instance, he shared information that was available on other media outlets, as he felt it important that there be a public dialogue regarding the rumored background of the prospective First Lady of the United States.""   Sam Rosenbloom, a Donald Trump backer who shows his support on his SUV, is a neighbor of blogger Webster Tarpley. (Dan Morse/TWP)  Charles Harder, an attorney for Melania Trump, declined to comment Friday. According to documents filed so far, the case could turn on the question of how far a publication can advance claims that it does not know to be true.  Tarpley has addressed the matter on his blog, saying he did not defame Melania Trump and he had simply passed on rumors and innuendo of others in his Aug. 2 ""Morning Briefing"" post. ""While the tarpley.net editors, writers and contributors did not generate said rumors, the briefing in question was not diligent in fact-checking or maintaining a healthy distance between innuendo and fact,"" Tarpley wrote in his retraction and apology. But on that stance, Melania Trump, through her attorneys, said that when read as a whole, Tarpley's Aug. 2 posting asserted a series of bogus claims as fact. This is how the blog post began: ""Where is Melania Trump? This question is being asked in elite parties at the roped-off clubs in Manhattan's meatpacking district and other haunts of the gotham financier class. It is widely known among the jet set crowd that Melania never wanted Donald to run for president."" It was then that Tarpley wrote, without attribution, that it was ""widely known"" that Melania Trump had once worked as a ""high end escort."" As the 29-paragraph post continued, Tarpley offered what he said were various sources for his information that included ""unconfirmed reports,"" ""a knowledgable observer"" and allegations ""scattered across the internet."" Tarpley's attorneys, in court papers filed last month, asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, saying Tarpley wasn't necessarily advancing the assertions as truth. ""A pure expression of opinion is protected because it fails to assert an actual fact,"" attorney Danielle D. Giroux wrote. ""Likewise, rhetorical hyperbole might appear to make an assertion, but a reasonable reader or listener would not construe that assertion seriously.""   Earlier: Melania Trump sues Tarpley and British tabloid   Tarpley's attorneys also took issue with eight specific passages that the Trump side said were false and defamatory. None of those statements, Tarpley's lawyers wrote, accused Melania Trump of committing a crime, having a disease or ""engaging in conduct, characteristics or a condition that would adversely affect her fitness for the proper conduct of her lawful business, trade or profession."" In response, Melania Trump's attorneys said the matter should proceed to trial, because the blog post involved more direct assertions than opinion or hyperbole. ""Publishing, or republishing, defamatory allegations which, in addition to being false, clearly have no basis other than as unsubstantiated rumor, and doing so without even checking the veracity of the information,"" they wrote, ""easily clears the threshold of reckless disregard for the truth."" The lawyers also said the allegations were damaging. ""Tarpley has the audacity to argue that calling someone a prostitute who had a mental breakdown does not constitute defamation as a matter of law and that such a complaint can be dismissed at the pleading stage. To state this argument is to refute it,"" wrote attorneys Harder and Donna E. McBride. The Montgomery Circuit Judge assigned to the case, Sharon Burrell, has yet to rule on the motions. "

"    President Obama arrives for a private game of basketball at Fort McNair in Washington on Nov. 8. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)   He already voted early back home in Chicago, so all that was left for President Obama on Election Day was to take part in the ritual he had observed with his own name on the ballot -- a pickup basketball game -- and to make a final pitch to the electorate. ""Go vote. It's up to you,"" Obama said Tuesday, pointing at television news cameras during a stroll along the White House colonnade after returning from the game at Fort McNair. A reporter asked the president, who has campaigned intensively for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, whether he was nervous about the outcome.  [Live updates: Election 2016 and race results]  ""As long as the American people vote, I think we'll do a good job,"" he replied. ""I hope everybody's voted early. If not, get out there."" Obama then disappeared into the White House, but his last-minute get-out-the-vote effort had not yet finished. Aides said he taped interviews with six radio stations in three swing states -- Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio -- imploring people to get to the polls.      President Obama brought his tried-and-true campaign slogans and humor-filled attacks on Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton's defense in the final days of the presidential campaign. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   As the election results began to come in Tuesday night, however, it appeared that Obama's frantic final campaigning for Clinton might not be enough to avoid a monumental upset to Republican nominee Donald Trump. Called upon as a chief surrogate for a candidate who has struggled to make a personal connection with voters, Obama had put his suddenly robust approval ratings and star power to work for Clinton with increasing urgency in the final weeks in a bid to boost Democratic turnout with his own legacy on the line. But the early election results told another story. First Florida, which Obama had won in 2008 and 2012, fell out of Clinton's grasp. Then North Carolina, where Obama, who won in 2008 before narrowly losing in 2012, had warned supporters just last week that ""the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders.""  Late into the night, Wisconsin looked grim for Clinton, and even Michigan, in which Obama had bragged of bailing out the auto industry during an emergency campaign stop Monday in Ann Arbor, was in danger. It was a stunning twist of fortune for Clinton, but also for the president.  Obama had pounded the lectern and wagged his finger, given stern instructions and laughed easily, introduced new lines and brought back old ones. When the crowds have called, ""We love you!"" he still has said, ""Love you back"" -- but has made quite clear he has an ask. ""Tomorrow, you will choose whether we continue this journey of progress,"" he told the crowd at the University of Michigan, ""or whether it all goes out the window."" Sixteen times over the past two months, Obama had delivered his stump speech for Clinton -- including three times on Monday in a final swing through Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. He and his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, had fanned out across the radio and television airways for dozens of interviews, many with stations targeting African American audiences. All told, the president attended 72 fundraising events over two years on behalf of Clinton and the Democratic Party, according to party operatives. ""I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election,"" Obama told a Congressional Black Caucus gala in a fiery speech in September. ""You want to give me a good send-off? Go vote.""  [Obama's Legacy: An interactive museum of his presidency]  For Obama, who said during his State of the Union address in January that his chief regret is that political polarization has become worse, the campaign appearances offered him a final chance to convince the public that his brand of political optimism would outlast the bitterness and ugly tone of the 2016 campaign season.      Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win View Graphic     Choose your own electoral adventure: Map out the ways Clinton or Trump could win  But the president acknowledged the skepticism that it would not. At a rally with 33,000 Clinton supporters on Philadelphia's Independence Mall on Monday night, Obama told the crowd that a journalist had asked him last week whether he still believed in the politics of ""hope"" on which he campaigned in 2008. ""Maybe your vision was misguided -- or at least very naive,"" the reporter had suggested, according to Obama. The president considered the question out loud for a moment, ruminating over a social-media discourse that sows partisanship and an unbalanced economic system that has left many Americans more skeptical about their futures. ""Despite all that, I told him the answer is, 'Yes, I still believe in hope,' "" Obama declared. ""I'm still as optimistic as ever."" It has not been an easy sell. Obama's personal approval ratings, comfortably above 50 percent, are at some of the highest levels since his first year in office. But Clinton and Trump are saddled with far worse approval ratings and even lower levels of public trust. Which is why Obama's last campaign had been, at heart, less about Clinton and more about his personal connection with the supporters who propelled his unlikely rise. ""I have seen again and again your goodness and your strength and your heart,"" Obama told the crowd in Philadelphia. ""In 2008, you gave me a chance -- a skinny guy with a funny name. . . . America, I'm betting on you one more time.""  [Changing demographics could decide election result]  Obama used his final barnstorming trip as a chance to thank his supporters and remind them of the high stakes, and he did so with notes of defiance about the prospect of a Trump presidency, and a touch of nostalgia about his own waning tenure in the White House. ""I'm feeling a little sentimental,"" Obama told a crowd of 9,000 on his first stop, at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

More than eight years after they crowded into staff vans to canvass for votes in rural Iowa, several long-serving White House senior aides joined the president aboard Air Force One for one more get-out-the-vote effort. ""The election of the next president is the clearest, most tangible sign that this presidency is about to end,"" said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who knocked on doors for Obama in Iowa in 2007. ""It's a moment for reflection."" The nostalgia was flowing heavily in both directions. On Obama's second stop Monday, at the University of New Hampshire, a supporter in the crowd of 7,600 held up a blue sign from the president's 2012 reelection campaign. ""Four more years!"" someone else shouted. Others, especially in the African American community, have urged Michelle Obama to consider a run for political office. She has demurred. But the mother of two teenage daughters has become perhaps the Democratic Party's most potent messenger in making a personal case against Trump as a dangerous role model. Her use of the Obama family motto -- ""When they go low, we go high"" -- during the Democratic National Convention in July became a rallying cry.  [Long lines, intimidation and machine breakdowns reported across the country]  The president told his college audiences that the election amounted to a referendum on the progress of the past eight years. ""C'mon, man,"" he declared sarcastically on several occasions in exasperation at the notion that Trump could be taken seriously, given his lewd comments about women and insults against racial minorities. Offering a refresher course for students who were perhaps too young to remember much about the state of the nation when he took office, Obama recited a litany of accomplishments: rescuing the economy from the Great Recession, bailing out the auto industry, passing a landmark health-care law, killing al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. When the crowd booed a mention of Trump, the president recycled a 2012 campaign refrain: ""Don't boo -- vote!"" Trump ""can't hear you boo, but he can hear you vote,"" the president said, jabbing a finger in the air. Throughout the campaign, the president warned against complacency. Winding up his remarks in New Hampshire, Obama retold the story of how he was inspired during a low moment in his 2008 campaign by the chant of a diminutive county council member in Greenwood, S.C., named Edith Childs who was known to energize a room by shouting, ""Fired up! Ready to go!""    First lady Michelle Obama, President Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton greet supporters during a campaign rally on Independence Mall in Philadelphia. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  Emphasizing the power of a single voice to make a difference, Obama implored his audience to go to the polls: ""Let's go finish what we started."" But, before it was time to vote, there was one final stop in Philadelphia, where a sea of supporters was waiting for a final glimpse of the first couple. The Obamas did not disappoint. The first lady took a moment to tell the crowd ""how proud I am of all that he has done for this country,"" and the president responded by calling her ""my partner, my love, my rock."" Before long, however, they ceded the stage to Clinton. And when the rally was over, and the Democratic nominee headed off to another rally in North Carolina, the Obamas did not go with her. The presidential motorcade returned to the airport and the first couple ascended the stairs of Air Force One, which lifted into the night sky, leaving the crowds behind.
