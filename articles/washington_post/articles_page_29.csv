Activists are circulating online petitions and using social media in hopes of influencing Republican electors to cast their ballots for someone other than President-elect Donald Trump and deprive him of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the next occupant of the White House.  ""Yes, I think it's a longshot, but I also think we're living in strange times,"" said Daniel Brezenoff, who created a petition in favor of Hillary Clinton and is asking signers to lobby electors by email or phone. ""If it was ever plausible, it's this year."" Trump has won 290 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, with Michigan undecided, but Clinton is on pace to win the popular vote by at least 1 million ballots. Trump's opponents are motivated by the outcome of the popular vote and by their contention that the businessman and reality TV star is unfit to serve as commander in chief. Just one elector so far has wavered publicly on supporting Trump. Texas Republican Art Sisneros says he has reservations about the president-elect, but not because of the national popular vote. He told The Associated Press he won't vote for Clinton under any circumstance.  ""As a Christian, I came to the conclusion that Mr. Trump is not biblically qualified for that office,"" he said. He said he has heard from ecstatic Clinton supporters and even supportive Republicans, but also from outraged Trump backers writing ""threatening and vile things."" Sisneros signed a state party pledge to support the GOP's standard-bearer, but that was before Trump was the official nominee. He said one of his options is to resign, allowing the state party to choose another elector. Electors are chosen by party officials and are typically the party's most loyal members. Presidential electors are not required to vote for a particular candidate under the Constitution. Even so, the National Archives says more than 99 percent of electors have voted as pledged throughout the nation's history. Some state laws call for fines against ""faithless electors,"" while others open them to possible felony charges, although the National Archives says no elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged. In North Carolina, a faithless elector's vote is canceled, and he or she must immediately resign and be replaced. Layne Bangerter and Melinda Smyser, two of Idaho's four Republican electors, said they have been flooded with emails, telephone calls and Facebook messages from strangers urging them to reconsider their vote.  ""It's just not going to work,"" Bangerter said. ""I hope it dies down, but I don't see that happening."" The volume and tone of the messages caught the attention of Idaho's secretary of state, who urged the public to remain civil as electors prepare to cast their ballots on Dec. 19 while meeting in their states. Republican Party officials in Georgia and Michigan said their electors also have been bombarded with messages, and Iowa reported increased public interest in obtaining contact information for electors. Michael Banerian, 22, one of Michigan's 16 Republican electors, said he has received death threats from people who do not want him to vote for Trump. But he said he is undeterred.  ""It's mostly just a lot of angry people who don't completely understand how the process works,"" said Banerian, a political science major at Oakland University. P. Bret Chiafalo, a Democratic elector in Washington state, said he and a small group of other electors from the party are working to contact their Republican counterparts and ask them to vote for any GOP candidate besides Trump, preferably Mitt Romney or John Kasich. Under the Constitution, the House -- currently under Republican control -- decides the presidency if no candidate reaches the required electoral vote majority. House members choose from the top three contenders. This isn't the first time electors have faced pressure to undo the results of Election Day. Carole Jean Jordan, a GOP elector from Florida in 2000, recalled the ""unbelievably ugly"" aftermath of the recount battle between George W. Bush and then-vice president Al Gore, a dispute that ended with the U.S. Supreme Court leaving Bush's slim margin intact and handing him the presidency. Jordan said Florida's electors were inundated with nasty letters from people saying they should not vote for Bush. Police kept watch over her home until the electors convened in Tallahassee to cast their votes. They stayed at the same hotel, guarded by security officers who also escorted them to cast their ballots at the state Capitol. ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta. ___ Follow Kimberlee Kruesi at https://twitter.com/kkruesi and Bill Barrow at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Chuck Schumer of New York will succeed Harry Reid as Democratic Party leader in the Senate. In a statement, Schumer vowed to go 'toe to toe against the president-elect whenever our values or the progress we've made is under assault.' (The Washington Post)   Democrats face a profound question right now: What's the most effective way to oppose the Trump administration and the Republican Congress? How energetic should their opposition be? Should they support Republican bills they find somewhat worthwhile? Should they give Donald Trump a chance to show that he can govern responsibly? What, in practice, does it mean to fight him? It looks as though Trump is going to test that opposition by making one of his first big legislative initiatives an infrastructure bill, something Democrats have long advocated and which President Obama has been pushing for years, but which congressional Republicans refused even to consider on the grounds that it would increase the deficit. (As we know, Republican concern about the deficit is utterly and completely phony; it evaporates in a puff of smoke the moment a Republican president takes office.) And there's at least some evidence that Democrats are considering joining with Republicans to pass it. That would be a terrible mistake. This is from a report in today's New York Times by Jennifer Steinhauer:  Congressional Democrats, divided and struggling for a path from the electoral wilderness, are constructing an agenda to align with many proposals of President-elect Donald J. Trump that put him at odds with his own party. On infrastructure spending, child tax credits, paid maternity leave and dismantling trade agreements, Democrats are looking for ways they can work with Mr. Trump and force Republican leaders to choose between their new president and their small-government, free-market principles. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, elected Wednesday as the new Democratic minority leader, has spoken with Mr. Trump several times, and Democrats in coming weeks plan to announce populist economic and ethics initiatives they think Mr. Trump might like. Now, this is just one reporter's interpretation of what's going on. It's entirely possible that Schumer has a multi-phase strategy: Say at the outset that you're willing to work with the White House, sow some division between Trump and the GOP leadership in Congress, then withdraw your support and condemn the whole thing.       President Obama said during a news conference Monday that it's ""healthy"" for the Democratic Party to go through reflection. ""When your team loses, everyone gets deflated,"" Obama said. (The Washington Post)   If that's the strategy, it might not a be a bad one, and it would at least be a strategy. But knowing Democrats, it's more likely that there's no strategy at all, at least not a long-term one that everyone on their side can understand and get behind. As a general matter, there are two reasons that Democrats might support a Republican effort on something like infrastructure. The first is that their support produces something good for the country that wouldn't have happened otherwise. The second is that it provides some political advantage for them. And it's hard to see either of those things happening. On the first point, from what we can tell, Trump's infrastructure plan consists mostly of tax breaks for private companies to build roads and bridges that they can then charge tolls on. This leaves out enormous needs, particularly the maintenance and repair that are vitally important and will return great benefits but that aren't as easy for private companies to monetize. It's possible that by joining the effort, Democrats might be able to persuade Republicans to make their infrastructure bill more effective. But the truth is that Republicans don't need Democratic votes and are just as likely to say, ""Thanks for your input, but we're going to do it our way.""  If that's true and Democrats can't extract major substantive concessions, do they get political benefit from joining Republicans on this bill? That brings us to what Republicans did eight years ago. You may remember that literally on the day Barack Obama was inaugurated, Republican leaders got together for dinner and decided on a strategy of total opposition: Don't work with him on anything, fight to make every initiative fail, and generally make his life miserable in the hope they could take back Congress and keep him from winning reelection. Though Obama got reelected, otherwise the strategy was a tremendous success. It grew from some critical insights Mitch McConnell in particular had about the way the public interprets what goes on in Washington, beginning with the understanding that the overwhelming majority of voters have only a superficial sense of what's going on and only pay attention sporadically. That means that things that might seem important in the capital -- like whether you got condemned by the Times and the Post editorial pages this morning for some act of obstruction -- have very little practical impact, and you can endure the criticism if you're getting something you want. In fact, obstruction is generally something you're unlikely to pay a price for, because most voters will decide that ""Washington"" isn't working, and put blame on the party that holds the White House, even if the fact that it isn't working is completely the other party's fault. McConnell also understood that as part of that strategy, it's important for the opposition to remain unified. As he told the Times in 2010 while discussing the Affordable Care Act, ""It was absolutely critical that everybody be together because if the proponents of the bill were able to say it was bipartisan, it tended to convey to the public that this is O.K., they must have figured it out.""  For Republicans, it wasn't all that hard to keep to a strategy of unified opposition. They despised Obama with a burning passion and were quite happy to grind government to a halt when they had the chance. Democrats, on the other hand, are going to be harder to keep together. They're possessed by an impulse to be, and to be seen to be, responsible and reasonable, eager to get things done and make things work. But politically speaking, that gains you nothing. And given that Republicans don't actually need them to pass anything (depending on what they do with the filibuster in the Senate, a topic I'll take up later on), all their support does is put a bipartisan veneer on what Republicans were going to do anyway. To be clear, I'm not advocating anything with genuine practical consequences, such as shutting down the government or threatening to default on our debt. What I'm talking about is how you oppose the administration and the congressional majority when they have all the power. It's important that Democrats keep reminding the American public, every day for the next four years, of who's sitting in the White House and what that means. Trump ran one of most vile presidential campaigns in American history, one based on racial and religious hatred, resentment and fear. He sought to normalize toxic misogyny. He celebrated violence. He mainstreamed white supremacy. His election has spurred a wave of racist intimidation and hate crimes, as bigots across the country have become emboldened by his victory to act out their most despicable impulses. He's a demagogue and a dangerous fool, and while Democrats aren't going to question the legitimacy of his presidency the way Republicans did with Obama, he shouldn't ever be treated like an ordinary president with whom Democrats just have some substantive disagreements. So, absent an incredibly powerful reason to cooperate with him on any particular bill, the last thing Trump should get from Democrats is a clean slate and a hand extended in cooperation. "

The land transfer announced Thursday caps years of negotiation between the U.S. Army and Children's National Health System, which includes a flagship hospital on Michigan Avenue NW in D.C. as well as medical facilities throughout the District and in Virginia and Maryland. ""This is a big deal for Children's, and we think it's a big deal for the city and the region and even the nation,"" said Kurt Newman, hospital president and chief executive. ""It's more than just the land and the buildings. It's really a vision for creating a center of research around pediatric medicine."" No money will change hands, though hospital officials anticipate spending hundreds of millions of dollars redeveloping the property. Just under $100 million of that amount has been budgeted for the coming years, according to Charles Weinstein, executive vice president and chief real estate and facilities officer at Children's National.    The campus of the Walter Reed U.S. Army Medical Center, shown in 2012. (Astrid Riecken/FOR THE WASHINGTON POST)  The parcel, which Army officials are scheduled to formally hand over Thursday, includes several existing buildings, most notably the former Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Weinstein said the hospital intends to use the property for research, treating patients and administrative work, but will not begin fleshing out its plans until next year. Newman said the new facilities will allow the hospital to expand its work in promising fields of pediatric research, such as genetics, neuroscience, immunology and cancer studies. He said he also envisions the site as a home to other medical institutions or pharmaceutical and biotech firms seeking to locate near the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As recently as last year, hospital officials were unsure whether they would be able to acquire the property, part of a larger campus vacated by Walter Reed in 2011 when the Army's medical facilities were merged with the expansive National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda. Children's National faced a rival in the U.S. State Department, which was also interested in the land. ""This was a real dogfight, but we were finally able to get this land for a public-health benefit,"" said D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), adding that the hospital's acquisition of the property would benefit ""the entire region."" "

""We will eliminate this terrorist organization before it harms Pakistan,"" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech at Pakistan's parliament before lawmakers, the prime minister and the military leadership. Turkey has waged a wide-scale crackdown against followers of Fethullah Gulen, a self-exiled U.S.-based cleric whose organization runs a global network of charities, business groups, schools and hospitals, including a network of charter schools in the U.S. Turkey has arrested tens of thousands of people since July's failed coup and dismissed more than 100,000 civil servants suspected of ties to Gulen. Erdogan's visit to Pakistan comes as Islamabad ordered 400 Turkish nationals, mostly schoolteachers and their families, to leave the country within 72 hours. They have petitioned a court against the move, and the students have held protests. Those who face expulsion include staff at the PakTurk International Schools and Colleges and their families. Ankara accuses the chain of links to Gulen. PakTurk denied the allegations in a statement posted on its website, saying it has ""no affiliation or connection with any political individual or any movement or organization."" The Islamabad High Court, which took up the petition by the Turkish nationals, heard arguments from the school's lawyer before a break in the proceedings, according to court official Faheem Rizvi. The petition said the expulsion would adversely affect 11,000 students in 28 branches of the school across the country. It requested that the orders be rescinded and that the school's expatriate staff be allowed to continue to work in Pakistan, he said. Meanwhile, more than 150 PakTurk students rallied in Islamabad as the Turkish leader arrived at parliament. In the eastern city of Lahore, hundreds of students blocked a main road to protest the expulsion orders, said Pakistani police officer Adnan Naseer.  ""Don't play with our future,"" student Tariq Ahmad told Pakistani Capital News TV. Amnesty International expressed concern over the ""politically motivated"" expulsion of the schoolteachers. The Britain-based rights group said the decision would hurt Pakistani children. At a joint press conference, Erdogan and Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pledged to enhance bilateral cooperation, share their experience in fighting terrorism and complete a free trade agreement by the end of 2017. Erdogan thanked Pakistan for taking action against the alleged Gulen supporters, and said that PakTurk students would not suffer. Turkey has demanded the United States extradite Gulen, who has lived a reclusive life on a compound in the Poconos for more than 15 years. Gulen denies any involvement in the coup and has condemned it. The U.S. is reviewing Turkey's request. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

While inaugurating Parliament's new legislative period Thursday, Felipe said Spaniards had set an example of maturity and good sense and that it's now the turn of politicians to live up to expectations. Felipe, accompanied by Queen Letizia and their two princess daughters, was greeted with resounding applause by lawmakers on entering the chamber. Spain's political impasse ended last month when conservative leader Mariano Rajoy finally managed to win Parliament's approval to head a minority government.

Outside the human rights activist's bedroom window, a Mexican marine in a black mask and helmet trained a rifle on him. ""Drop the phone or I'll shoot,"" he said. The marines blindfolded him, bound him and took him with four relatives and friends to a dimly lit, windowless warehouse. Then hours of torture began, Soni says -- beatings, electric shocks, asphyxiation, sexual abuse. He heard his teenage nephew scream as they applied electric shocks to the boy's ribs. Soni's tormenter said, ""This is going to make you not want to defend rights anymore."" In the face of strong international condemnation, Mexico says it is taking steps to stop the use of torture by its security forces. After $5 million was withheld on account of Mexico's human rights record, the U.S. State Department in September recommended to Congress that full funding be restored. However, there is still widespread impunity. From December 2006 through October 2014, the Attorney General's Office registered 4,055 complaints of torture, nearly one-third of them against the military. Yet over almost the same period, only 13 police and soldiers were sentenced for torture, and nobody has been charged in Soni's case. Even in its own assessment, the U.S. State Department notes that ""there continue to be serious, ongoing challenges in Mexico, including reports of law enforcement and military involvement in forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, the reported use of torture, impunity and violence and threats against journalists and human rights defenders."" The Mexican marines and defense department did not respond to requests for an interview. Mexico's Interior Department deputy secretary for human rights, Roberto Campa, said eradicating the use of torture is a top human rights priority for the government, and he expects to see a significant increase in sentences against those responsible. At times through tears, Soni and the others recounted what happened to them in the garden of his home, now surrounded by a tall fence and numerous surveillance cameras paid for by the government. Soni had far more resources than most victims of torture. He had a politically active family and connections in the human rights world. November 9, 2013, was not the first time marines visited his home. Almost five months earlier, Soni was driving home from teaching in the early afternoon when his sister called to tell him to stay away; marines and federal police were at the house. That day they grabbed Luis Enrique Biu Gonzalez, Soni's gardener, who also lived at his home. They beat him and asphyxiated him with a plastic bag, Biu says. A marine pointed a pistol at his head, asked if he was gay and threatened sexual violence, all the time demanding to know where Soni was. The marines took Soni's computers, which held records of human rights cases he documented. They returned in the middle of the night. With the house empty, they grabbed whatever they had not carried off in the first raid. Soni does not know exactly why the marines targeted him. It could have been the human rights complaints he helped people file against them and other security forces in the area. Or somebody with influence might have perceived him as a political threat. Soon after the June raid, Soni sought advice from his contacts at the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. They told him to get help from the Mexican government's protection program. Soni was enrolled in the program as of June 26, 2013, government records show. He had assurances from the Attorney General's Office there would be no more trouble. The government programmed an emergency ""panic"" number into his cell phone.  ""It gave me some peace of mind,"" he recalls thinking. On the morning he was taken, Soni was trying to find the panic number. It was too late. As the marines led Soni away, he asked to pause before a wooden figure of Jesus outside his front door. Steered toward its base, Soni knelt, kissed its feet and prayed: ""Lord, only you know where they are taking me. Help me return well."" Then a marine shouted, ""Enough already, bastard!"" and dragged him to his feet by a handful of his long hair. Later, Soni told his captors, ""I have government protection.... You're making a mistake.""  ""Yes, you're very influential, you son of a bitch,"" came the response. In the warehouse, they were forced to kneel on the concrete floor, he recalls. The marines rubbed a gel on their hands and told the men to touch some baggies and metal objects -- apparently setting them up to have their fingerprints on weapons and drugs. When the men resisted, they were punched and kicked. Biu, who was also taken, recalls the Marines giving them electric shocks, especially when they got to Soni.  ""Now we're going to give it to fatty to see if he can take it,"" one marine said in reference to Soni.  ""No more! No more!"" Biu heard him scream. ""Tell the truth,"" the marine shouted back. They held the probes near Biu's ear so he could hear the humming current. Even today, there has been no justice for Soni and the others. They were held on weapons and drug charges. They spent more than a year in prison without trial until a judge in March 2015 threw out the case. From the day of their arrest through the day their release was signed, the men never once saw the judge. Soni hopes that this will change under Mexico's new justice system, where both sides will have to present arguments and evidence in open court. His case is now being handled by a special unit created a year ago to investigate torture. Soni's older nephew, Evanibaldo Larraga Galvan, still has a lump on his neck where a marine grabbed and choked him that morning. And Luis Edgardo Charnichart Ortega, a teacher and childhood friend of Soni's who was sleeping over that night, asks, ""Is there even sufficient punishment to pay for all the damage done?"" Charnichart has struggled to work since his release.  ""My mind, the psychologists say, they still have it,"" he recounts. ""After they take you, nothing of you can remain. That is their objective, make you disappear, plant death inside you and leave it to consume you until the end of your days."" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)  Vice President Biden is right. ""No administration is ready on Day 1,"" Biden said after he, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and their wives had lunch at the vice president's Naval Observatory residence Wednesday. To help President-elect Donald Trump get ready, a herculean task given his qualifications and temperament, the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) released a new edition of The Prune Book during an evening panel discussion. It lists ""the 40 toughest management jobs in government."" Dan Blair, NAPA's president and chief executive and a former acting Office of Personnel Management (OPM) director, said the lineup ""offers a road map as to which jobs are management priorities and the skill sets to look for. The Academy's Transition 2016 steering committee carefully reviewed hundreds of management jobs to synthesize the toughest ones which have a direct effect on citizens and will be critical for the success of a new president's management agenda."" Notice the emphasis on management, not policy. ""Policy without implementation is useless,"" said Ed DeSeve, a former special adviser to President Obama and former deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). ""It may even be counterproductive."" But as Paul Posner, director of the Graduate Public Administration Program at George Mason University, added about policy versus management: ""You have to do both at the same time."" ""It doesn't matter what priorities you have,"" said Posner, a former Government Accountability Office official. ""You will fall apart if you don't pay attention to the management concerns."" So, if you are among the minority of voters who picked Trump over Hillary Clinton as the next president and if you want a big gig in his administration, here is the Prune Book's list of government's most powerful management positions, divided into five categories:   Governmentwide Managers Director, OMB Director, OPM Deputy director for management, OMB Administrator, General Services Administration Deputy treasury secretary   Deputy Secretaries Deputy secretary of agriculture Deputy secretary of energy Deputy secretary of interior Deputy secretary of commerce Deputy secretary of transportation Deputy secretary of defense Undersecretary for management, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Undersecretary for management, State Department Deputy secretary of education Deputy secretary of health and human services Deputy secretary of housing and urban development Deputy secretary of veterans affairs Deputy secretary of labor   Managing Natural Resources, Information, and Infrastructure Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Director, U.S. Census Bureau Director, U.S. Patent and Trademark office Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration   Managing National and Homeland Security Director, Central Intelligence Agency Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director, Office of the Director of National Intelligence Undersecretary of Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence Undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics Director, Defense Operational Test and Evaluation Administrator, National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator, United States Agency for International Development Assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security and director of the office of foreign missions   Managing Health, Education, and Income Security Programs Chief operating officer, Office of Financial Student Aid, Department of Education Administrator, Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Food and Drug Administration Director, Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Undersecretary for health, Veterans Health Administration Undersecretary for benefits, Veterans Benefits Administration Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service Commissioner, Social Security Administration   Certainly, there are others jobs that could have made the list. My suggestion -- deputy attorney general. ""We had tough time debating on these top 40 jobs,"" said Janice Lachance, an OPM director under President Bill Clinton. She and others pointed to the importance of political appointees respecting career federal employees. After all, they were in place before the appointees and will be there when the appointees are gone. ""The sooner the political appointees can recognize the wealth of talent, information and experience of civil servants,"" Lachance said, ""the more successful they (appointees) will be."" David Chu, a former undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, agreed, saying it is important for political appointees to demonstrate faith in staffers, particularly the top career managers. ""A key issue for this transition,"" he said, ""is for agencies to signal that they trust senior civil servants."" But with Trump's promise to impose a hiring freeze in his first 100 days in office as a means of fighting corruption and his plans to fire feds faster in VA if not across the government, the question is -- will most career workers trust him?

(Andrew Harnik/Associated Press)  In the short time since Donald Trump's election to the U.S. presidency, several NBA coaches have openly expressed dismay at it. Now a report claims that multiple teams in the league are making what could be construed as similar statements -- by avoiding hotels with the ""Trump"" name while on road trips.   [Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich discusses Trump's election: 'My big fear is -- we are Rome.']   On Tuesday, ESPN's Marc Stein and Zach Lowe identified the Dallas Mavericks, Milwaukee Bucks and Memphis Grizzlies as having ""moved away from Trump hotels in New York City and Chicago, which bear Donald Trump's name through a licensing agreement."" In addition, the pair reported that another, unidentified Eastern Conference team has decided to stay elsewhere after its contract with New York's Trump SoHo hotel expires at the end of the season. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was an outspoken critic of Trump during the latter's presidential campaign. Earlier this year, Cuban said, ""Trump scares me,"" and he called the then-GOP nominee ""bat[crap] crazy."" In September, Cuban attended the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton as a guest of the Democratic nominee, and afterward, he took issue with Trump's assertion that doing whatever he could do avoid paying taxes was ""smart."" ""You have to realize that this is a country that's been great to us and you can't just take, take, take, take, take, take take,"" Cuban said. In addition to being extremely wealthy business executives, both Cuban and Trump have had success as the stars of prime-time reality TV shows (""Shark Tank"" and ""The Apprentice,"" respectively). A co-owner of the Bucks, Marc Lasry, was a top fundraiser for Clinton's campaign, as he was for Barack Obama's campaigns in 2008 and 2012. His son, Alexander, worked in the Obama White House for a time as an assistant to senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. At one point, the hedge-fund manager was also chairman of Trump Entertainment Resorts, Inc., after Trump extricated himself from ownership of several Atlantic City properties.   [NFL player, who knelt in protest of Trump's election, pledges to stand for anthem again]   It is less clear what the political leanings are of the Grizzlies' owner, Robert Pera, a 38-year-old Internet technology entrepreneur who became the youngest NBA owner when he purchased the team in 2012. A member of Pera's ownership group, albeit with a very small stake, was former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford Jr. A ""Guide to Evil NBA Owners"" published in 2014 by Mother Jones had little to say about Pera, other than noting that the former high school basketball player had challenged the owner of the Hornets -- that would be Michael Jordan -- to a game of one-on-one, with proceeds of $1 million going to charity. From ESPN's report: ESPN contacted all 30 teams this week to ask about their travel plans in New York and other NBA cities that feature Trump-branded hotels, which include Chicago, Miami, Toronto and Washington. Several teams that have stayed at the Trump SoHo in particular in the past told ESPN that they are not staying there this season but did not specifically attribute the switch to any political reason. Several more said that they've never stayed at Trump-branded hotels. Trump's election has roiled the world of the NBA, one in which several stars, such as LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, have increased their focuses on social issues in recent years. In October, James formally endorsed Clinton for president, and he later introduced her at a rally in Cleveland. Following the election, James's Cavaliers teammate, J.R. Smith, described Trump as a ""racist, sexist person"" on Instagram. ""The things that [Trump] said, the things that he represented, that's the way that the majority of this nation feels,"" the Warriors' David West told reporters after the election. ""I think he just emboldened them because he's able to say it publicly. He got the platform. It is kind of unnerving and unsettling.""   ['The message was loud and clear': In NBA and NFL, a struggle to accept Trump's election]   Pistons Coach Stan Van Gundy offered perhaps the most pointed comments from any prominent NBA figure. ""I don't think anybody can deny this guy is openly and brazenly racist and misogynistic and ethnic-centric,"" he said of Trump. ""We should be ashamed for what we stand for as the United States today."" ""It's tough when you want there to be some respect and dignity, and there hasn't been any,"" Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said. ""And then you walk into a room with your daughter and your wife, who have basically been insulted by his comments, and they're distraught."" ""I'm just sick to my stomach,"" Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich said last week. ""Not basically because the Republicans won or anything, but the disgusting tenure and tone and all of the comments that have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic."" Fewer NBA figures have been vocal about their pro-Trump leanings. One is Hornets center Spencer Hawes, who wore a ""Hillary for prison 2016"" shirt on the night of the election."

Trump named Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, as his chief of staff. In appointing Priebus, 44, Trump has brought into his White House a Washington insider who is viewed as broadly acceptable by vast swaths of the party, and he signaled a willingness to work within the establishment he assailed on the campaign trail. But the president-elect sent an opposing signal by tapping Stephen K. Bannon, his combative campaign chief and former head of the incendiary Breitbart News, as his chief strategist and senior counselor. Bannon, 62, has openly attacked congressional leadership, taking particular aim at House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) -- who recommended Priebus for his new job. ""I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.""    Bannon's appointment was blasted by Jewish groups and political operatives on both sides of the aisle who said he is too close to the alt-right and white nationalism. Bannon once called Breitbart ""the platform of the alt-right,"" a conservative movement that is a hotbed of white nationalist and anti-Semitic sentiment.      During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in D.C. and rid the federal government of political elites and lobbyists. But just days into his transition to president, Trump seems to be doing the opposite. (Deirdra O'Regan/The Washington Post)    Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said via Twitter on Sunday night: ""We at @ADL_National oppose the appt of Steve Bannon to sr role at @WhiteHouse bc he & his alt-right are so hostile to core American values.""  The Bannon announcement came as Trump highlighted some of his first priorities in an interview on CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" vowing to ""immediately"" deport up to 3 million immigrants who are in the country illegally after he is inaugurated and to simultaneously repeal and replace President Obama's Affordable Care Act. He also repeated his remark that he knows more about the Islamic State than U.S. generals do, saying, ""I probably do, because look at the job they've done."" Trump's top two advisers could help him achieve different objectives. Priebus could help Trump notch early legislative victories in a Republican-led Congress and ingratiate himself with the insiders he claims to loathe but who dominate his transition team. A longtime lawyer and Wisconsin political operative, Priebus will work to smooth over residual friction from a campaign during which a number of Republicans refused to endorse Trump, reversed their endorsements or stepped away from him after a 2005 tape surfaced in which Trump is heard saying that he could force himself on women because he was a ""star."" Bannon will be the other voice on Trump's shoulder: He helped shape Trump's message on the campaign trail and relishes combativeness. The former Navy officer and investment banker has said the campaign was the American version of worldwide populist movements such as the British vote to sever ties with the European Union. Bannon's appointment drew sharp criticism from political operatives on both sides of the aisle who see Bannon as being too close to the alt-right and white nationalism. Breitbart has published stories with headlines stating that women faced with harassment online should ""log off"" and called Republican Bill Kristol a ""renegade Jew.""  [New Trump campaign chief faces scrutiny over voter registration, anti-Semitism]  Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said in a statement: ""President-elect Trump's choice of Steve Bannon as his top aide signals that White Supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump's White House.""      It's not just the Cabinet: Trump's transition team needs to find nearly 4,000 appointees View Graphic     It's not just the Cabinet: Trump's transition team needs to find nearly 4,000 appointees  The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate-watch group, blasted the choice of Bannon. It called him ""the main driver behind Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill"" and cited Breitbart headlines that included a call to hoist the Confederate flag weeks after shootings at a black Charleston, S.C., church and another that said that political correctness ""protects Muslim rape culture.""  Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence against his former wife more than 20 years ago; the charges included trying to prevent a victim or witness of crime from reporting, inflicting injury and battery. Bannon was never convicted and the case was dismissed. His former wife also accused him of making anti-Semitic remarks, according to a court statement obtained by the New York Daily News.    Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich blasted the idea Sunday that Trump's campaign catered to the alt-right,   calling it ""garbage.""   In a statement, Bannon said he and Priebus had a ""very successful partnership"" on the campaign trail. ""We will have that same partnership in working to help President-elect Trump achieve his agenda,"" Bannon said. Priebus gave a preview of some of the administration's policy priorities. ""I am very grateful to the president-elect for this opportunity to serve him and this nation as we work to create an economy that works for everyone, secure our borders, repeal and replace Obamacare and destroy radical Islamic terrorism. He will be a great president for all Americans,"" Priebus said. The personnel announcement comes as the contours of the Trump administration are starting to take shape and as he and his team pivot from campaign rhetoric to the nuts and bolts of governing. Trump and his advisers continue to paint a mixed picture of what the administration will look like, and they have been giving answers often at odds with Trump's campaign rhetoric, which included pledges to fully repeal the ACA and get Mexico to pay for a wall along the southern border, and crowd chants of ""Lock her up!"" about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.  [Trump and advisers hedge on major pledges, including Obamacare and the wall]  On undocumented immigrants, Trump said on ""60 Minutes"" that his administration will ""get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million. We are getting them out of our country, or we are going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country; they're here illegally."" The remarks are another sign of retreat from Trump's vows throughout much of the presidential campaign to remove all of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. By focusing on criminals only, Trump would be mirroring current Obama administration priorities, and experts say his numbers are highly inflated. Trump also built his campaign around a pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, but he said Sunday he would accept the plan of some congressional Republicans to build a fence in specific places -- something he told MSNBC in February would be acceptable for part of the border because of natural barriers. Trump again said Sunday that he will probably keep in place parts of the Obama health-care law, including provisions that allow children to stay on their parents' health plans until the person turns 26 and prevent insurers from refusing coverage for preexisting conditions. He said his administration would work to repeal and replace the law simultaneously; he said in a different interview Friday that the law might simply be amended. ""And it'll be great health care for much less money. So it'll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination,"" he told CBS's Lesley Stahl on Sunday. Trump has said that he would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion and, in Vice President-elect Mike Pence, he will be bringing one of the nation's most antiabortion politicians into the White House. When asked by Stahl if he plans to appoint a justice who will overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump said whomever he names will be ""very pro-life"" and that ""if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states."" Trump also said he is ""fine"" with same-sex marriage being legal. Trump, who did not release his tax returns during the campaign, told ""60 Minutes"" he will make them public ""at the appropriate time."" Trump said he believes that some of the protesters involved in demonstrations that have taken place in major cities since Trump's victory are ""professional protesters"" and that people shouldn't be scared of his administration. ""Don't be afraid,"" Trump said. ""We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don't be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time."" When asked of reports of racial slurs, harassment and personal threats against African Americans, gay people, Latinos and Muslims and others by some of his supporters, Trump said he didn't hear it but that he ""hates"" to hear that.  ""I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, 'Stop it.' If it -- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: 'Stop it,' "" he said.  [Donors and lobbyists already shaping Trump's 'drain the swamp' administration]  Trump's personnel announcements are emblematic of the conflicting signals the new administration has sent since Tuesday's upset victory, in which Trump won the electoral college by sweeping a number of Rust Belt states even as he lost the popular vote. Trump vowed to ""drain the swamp"" of Washington, but numerous lobbyists and big-pocketed donors are appearing in the power structure he is erecting. Trump defended himself on ""60 Minutes,"" saying that these people ""know the system right now"" but that it is going to be phased out.  Trump's surrogates also gave conflicting statements on Sunday. Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said on ABC's ""This Week"" that Trump should put his assets in a blind trust ""for the good of the country,"" but on CNN that putting the Trump companies into a blind trust would ""basically put his children out of work."" The president-elect appears to have resumed full use of his Twitter account, which was restricted leading up to Election Day. He took aim at the New York Times, suggesting that a letter sent to subscribers amounted to the paper ""apologizing for their BAD coverage of me."" The letter did not apologize for bad coverage.  He also tweeted, ""The @nytimes states today that DJT believes 'more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.' How dishonest are they. I never said this!"" Trump said during the campaign that perhaps South Korea and other countries should have nuclear weapons. Trump suggested on ""60 Minutes"" that he might not tweet as much when he occupies the Oval Office -- or just not in the way the world has gotten used to. ""I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication,"" he said.  Trump's team also continued to tangle Sunday with Reid, who said in a statement Thursday that Trump has ""emboldened the forces of hatred and bigotry in America."" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Reid should be ""very careful about characterizing somebody in a legal sense."" Conway said she is not suggesting Trump will sue Reid but that she is ""calling for responsibility and maturity and decency for somebody who has held one of the highest positions in our government."" Reid's office swung back in a statement: ""Instead of rising to the responsibility of his office, Trump is hiding behind his Twitter account and sending his staff on TV to threaten his critics."" "

Pence's ascension is in line with a recent trend toward influential vice presidents and appears similar to the last vice president who was handed the keys to a presidential transition: Dick Cheney. As the nation was embroiled in the recount after the 2000 election, George W. Bush informally entrusted Cheney to begin building the government even before the outcome was settled in favor of the Republican ticket. Some of the work was done sitting around Cheney's kitchen table in McLean, Virginia, remembered Ari Fleischer, who became Bush's first press secretary.  ""This is a big test for Pence,"" Fleischer told The Associated Press. ""If it goes well, it will portend a bigger job for him in the White House."" Cheney clearly passed that test and became one of the most powerful vice presidents in recent memory, particularly during Bush's first term. Cheney not only ran Bush's vice presidential search team -- eventually picking himself -- he stocked the administration with veteran Republicans, many of whom he had known for years.  ""The vice president was so influential he barely spoke in meetings because he knew he would see the president alone and could convey his thoughts privately,"" said Fleischer. ""Only the truly powerful can be that silent. And when he did talk, it was pretty impactful."" It is far too soon to say if Pence will have a similar voice in Trump's White House, but naming him the chairman of the transition team broadcasts to others in Washington that he will be a key player.  ""If you're given an important role in the transition, it sends a signal to other people that you matter,"" said Joel K. Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University who is widely considered one of the nation's leading experts on the sometimes obscure history of the vice presidency. ""Other political actors want to deal with you due to your perceived access and influence to the president."" It also gives the vice president a chance to put his own stamp on the administration. While Trump ran as a political outsider and was not shy in burning bridges to establishment Washington, Pence is a popular GOP figure who may opt to select longtime allies for key roles.  ""Those who get new jobs may feel beholden to the vice president and feel responsive to him,"" said Goldstein. ""It's a way of guaranteeing a degree of loyalty."" Unlike Bush and Cheney, who were friends for years, or Bill Clinton and Al Gore, who were both of the same generation of moderate Southern Democrats, Trump and Pence did not have much of a relationship before the celebrity businessman selected the Indiana governor to be his running mate. Trump then waffled, having second thoughts about the choice and asking aides if he could replace him. But those close to Trump say he and Pence, a dyed-in-the-wool social conservative who also served in Congress, have forged a friendship and there is little doubt that the selection of the Indiana governor -- as opposed to embattled New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- sent a reassuring signal to some mainstream Republicans who previously been ill at ease about the incendiary nominee. Pence's closing argument was that it was time ""for Republicans to come home"" and Trump won a higher percentage of Republican votes than his opponent Hillary Clinton did from Democrats, according to exit polls. There has also been speculation that Trump would view the presidency as a CEO role and delegate some of the decision-making elsewhere. Aides to Ohio Gov. John Kasich said that Trump's eldest son had suggested over the summer that the future vice-president would do much of the heavy lifting on both foreign and domestic policy while Trump would be in charge of ""Making America Great Again,"" a claim the Trump camp later denied. It seems likely that Pence will play a key role. For decades, vice-presidents were mere window dressing, given largely ceremonial tasks and left out of key decisions. That changed in 1976 when Jimmy Carter elevated Walter Mondale's role -- Mondale also ran the transition -- and vice-presidents since have large staffs, are often placed in charge of key administrative priorities and frequently become the administration's liaison to Capitol Hill. President Barack Obama tasked Vice President Joe Biden with several administration priorities, including its recent anti-cancer ""moonshot,"" and considers his running mate one of his closest friends.  ""Trump has learned to trust Pence and Pence has years of experience in Congress,"" said Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""I think it's dawning on Trump that he's now got enormous responsibilities and needs the help of every experienced, competent person he can find."" ____ Reach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
