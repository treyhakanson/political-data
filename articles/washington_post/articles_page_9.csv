Saturday was the fifth day of renewed assaults by Syrian warplanes on eastern Aleppo districts, a rebel-held enclave of 275,000 people. The onslaught began Tuesday, when Syria's ally Russia announced its own offensive on the northern rebel-controlled Idlib province and Homs province in central Syria. The bombing on Saturday came after a day of airstrikes that hit four hospitals in east Aleppo. A statement issued late Friday by the opposition's Aleppo Health Directorate said that all hospitals in east Aleppo are out of service because of the bombing over the past days.  ""The intentional destruction of infrastructure for survival has made the besieged steadfast people, including children, elderly and men and women, without medical facilities to treat them,"" the statement said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said not all hospitals in east Aleppo neighborhoods are out of service but people are finding difficulties reaching them because of the intensity of the shelling. The White House meanwhile demanded an immediate halt to Syrian strikes on eastern Aleppo. White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice said the U.S. is tracking reports about health conditions. Speaking in Peru, Rice said the U.S. condemns the ""horrific attacks"" against hospitals and aid workers ""in the strongest possible terms"". Rice added there was ""no excuse"" for the attacks. The White House is putting the onus on Russia to lower the violence and help humanitarian aid get to besieged Syrians. It says President Barack Obama joins other leaders in Europe, and those gathering for an Asia economic summit in Peru over the weekend, in demanding a halt to bombings. Opposition activists said Saturday's death toll has been the worst since the aerial campaign resumed on Tuesday. Residents said hundreds of artillery shells and dozens of airstrikes have hit the city, increasing the misery of its residents who have been suffering from lack of food and medicine because of the siege imposed by government forces and their allies in July.  ""Aleppo is being wiped out in front of the eyes of the world,"" medical official Mohammed Abu Rajab said in an audio message to The Associated Press from inside the city. ""It's not only hospitals that are out of service. All liberated areas in Aleppo are out of service.""  ""Entire buildings have been completely destroyed,"" Abu Rajab said. The Observatory said Syrian government warplanes and artillery struck more than 20 neighborhoods in east Aleppo killing 27 people and wounding many others. The Aleppo Media Council, an activist collective, said 20 people, including children, were killed in Saturday's violence in the country's largest city and former commercial center. Pro-government media, meanwhile, reported rebel shelling on government-held parts of the city, saying they killed two and wounded others. The latest deaths raise to more than 130 the number of people killed in northern Syria since Tuesday. The U.N. said in a statement released in Damascus that it ""is extremely saddened and appalled by the recent escalation in fighting"" in several parts of Syria, calling on all sides to cease indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructures. It said the U.N stands ready to assist people in east Aleppo ""as soon as access is granted by all parties."" It said it has shared with all parties to the conflict in Aleppo and concerned member states a detailed humanitarian plan to provide urgently needed assistance to the inhabitants of east Aleppo, and conduct medical evacuations for the ill and injured"" confirmed both Syria Humanitarian Coordinator Ali Al-Za'tari and the Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis Kevin Kennedy.  ""It is imperative all parties agree to the plan and allow us to secure immediate, safe and unimpeded access to provide relief to those most in need in east Aleppo, but equally in all other parts of Syria,"" they said. Meanwhile, an aircraft believed to be American killed late Friday a senior official with al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria known as Fatah al-Sham Front northwest of the country along with two other people, according to the Observatory and jihadi websites. A militant website and jihadis said the man was Egyptian citizen Abu Abdullah al-Muhajer, an Afghanistan fighting veteran who has been recently working closely with Fatah al-Sham Front's leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani. Al-Muhajer, whose real name was Abdul-Rahman Ali, joined the early jihad and then subsequent infighting in Afghanistan, according to the website, which provided a profile. It said he went on to Pakistan to study for a post-graduate degree in Sharia law and fled again to Afghanistan after being sought by Pakistani police. He worked as a preacher there and was close to the late al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and his successor Ayman al-Zawahri. After the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, he fled to Iran and spent several years in prison before he was released. The Observatory confirmed that an Egyptian commander with the al-Qaida affiliate was killed along with two people when their vehicle was struck with a missile fired from an aircraft. The U.S. has killed several top al-Qaida officials in Syria since the start of 2015. Last month, a drone attack killed top Egyptian al-Qaida veteran Ahmed Salama Mabrouk. ___ Associated Press writer Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this report.

Many passages are dramatic accounts of his role in Afghan policy as a U.S. official after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. One describes him challenging then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who advised him to ""take your hand off the bicycle seat"" and let Afghans figure things out on their own. In exasperation, Khalilzad says he replied, ""Mr. Secretary, there is no bicycle!"" No one in the Afghan capital needs to be reminded of the ambitious swath that the Afghan native, now 65, cut through the nation's politics when he arrived here as Washington's envoy in 2003. Khalilzad had strong ideas about how to build a new civilian government after the fall of the Taliban regime -- and the forceful personality to help push them through.  [Afghan security worries envoy]  His two-year tenure was controversial, in part because he became openly enmeshed in the maneuvering that led to Hamid Karzai becoming president, and also because he urged Karzai to welcome a rogue's gallery of anti-Taliban warlords into the fold -- a legacy that challenges Afghanistan's political stability to this day. In the process, he became known as the American ""viceroy."" Today, though, Khalilzad -- who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for secretary of state, or more likely a lower-profile adviser on foreign policy in the Trump administration -- seems to many Afghans like a potential lifeline to an unpredictable new government in Washington, following years of reliable U.S. economic and military aid to his impoverished and war-wracked country. ""He has a deep attachment to the U.S. and Afghanistan, and he is someone who can bring balance and success to U.S. policy in this part of the world,"" said Abdul Hamid Mobarez, a writer and former information official under Karzai. He said Khalilzad had ""played a major role in the new postwar order in Afghanistan,"" a difficult process that he said included ""some faults"" in the empowerment of former strongmen. But like several other Afghan experts and former officials, Mobarez said he hoped Khalilzad could help tilt U.S. policy away from Pakistan, a U.S. anti-terrorism partner next door that many Afghans view as the source of their country's insurgent problem. Such an approach, he said, would ""lead to stability in Afghanistan and be beneficial for America."" Mohammed Daud Kalakani, a legislator from Kabul, said Afghans ""would generally hail"" Khalilzad's appointment to a foreign policy role in Washington, calling him ""a person with initiative, knowledge and vast understanding of the region's issues"" as well as having a close familiarity with all Afghan factions. He, too, suggested approvingly that Khalilzad would be a strong critic of Pakistan for ""giving shelter and arms to terrorists."" Some experts here suggested that this might be wishful thinking, given that U.S. policymakers have to balance complex regional relationships and that Pakistan is an important if not always reliable ally in U.S. anti-terrorism efforts. They also noted that Afghanistan played almost no part in the U.S. election campaign and is unlikely to be high on the new administration's agenda.  But Ahmed Rashid, a Pakistani expert on Afghanistan and the Taliban, said he expected that Trump would be attuned to international concerns about Pakistan because of its support for the Taliban. In a recent interview, he said Trump ""will be quite tough on Pakistan, perhaps tougher than the Obama administration."" The United States still has about 10,000 troops here, and many Afghans are worried that the Trump administration will pull them out, robbing the country's defense forces of valuable support and training as they take over the fight against the Taliban. If Khalilzad were in a position to do so, they assume he would argue in favor of keeping a military presence here.  [Latest Afghan attack raises perplexing questions on security]  During his campaign, however, Trump did say he would probably keep the troops here, calling Afghanistan ""the one place we should have gone in the Middle East,"" because it is ""right next to Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons."" In an interview with Fox News in the spring, he added: ""I think you have to stay and do the best you can. Not that it's ever going to be great, but I don't think we have much of a choice."" Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, whose administration has been close to the Obama administration, warmly congratulated Trump on his victory, saying that the U.S. government is an ""essential and important strategic partner"" and that he hopes for ""close cooperation with the new president."" While Khalilzad's views might fit in with the new administration's, he is considered a long shot at best to become the top U.S. diplomat. Although he was one of the few senior figures in the foreign policy establishment to endorse Donald Trump and has held numerous positions in past Republican administrations, he also has been criticized as a lone operator who ""freelanced"" or skirted official limits as a diplomat. He also reportedly considered running for president of Afghanistan in 2009 and 2014. Khalilzad is also a Sunni Muslim immigrant, a category of people that Trump has said he would consider barring from the United States or subjecting to special vetting. In addition, some foreign-policy aides to Trump have warned that the executive branch is riddled with Muslim extremist sympathizers. Some of Khalilzad's fiercest critics have been fellow Republicans, including Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who accused him of meddling in Afghan politics, shaping the new constitution and promoting Karzai. In a 2012 open letter to Khalilzad, Rohrabacher charged that he and U.N. officials had ""aggressively interfered"" in Afghan affairs to ensure that Karzai came to power. But some Afghans recall that time differently, saying Khalilzad's activism made a positive contribution to a tense and unsettled situation. One is Mirza Yarmand, a former deputy minister who worked with Khalilzad in Kabul. He described the former envoy as ""an intellectual, sage person"" who would be an ""ideal"" top U.S. diplomat. ""His involvement was not interference,"" Yarmand said. ""It was a kind of cooperation and contribution to the new Afghanistan.""

(Michael Reaves/Getty Images)  New York Knicks star Derrick Rose isn't about to let politics or peer pressure bend him into making any rash real estate decisions. On Friday, the former Bulls guard said he plans to keep his condo in Chicago's Trump International Hotel and Tower, despite growing criticism of president-elect Donald Trump among NBA teams and personalities.   [Multiple NBA teams are reportedly avoiding Trump hotels on road trips]   ""I stay out of the political world,"" Rose told the New York Post. ""His beliefs are his beliefs."" Rose said he ""gets"" the controversy surrounding Trump, ""as far as (some people) not wanting to associate themselves with that name."" ""But my situation is a little bit different,"" he continued. ""I bought my place well before he became (a presidential) candidate. And I felt like nobody could tell me to sell my property."" Rose paid $2.8 million for his three bedroom, four-bath, 3,102-square-foot condo on the 84th floor of the Trump building in downtown Chicago just before he signed a $95 million contract extension with the Bulls in 2012, according to county records obtained by Chicago Business. ""It's definitely an unbelievable feeling just being up there,"" Rose said (via Chicago Business) shortly after the purchase. ""The view is nice and I don't take it for granted. It's a blessing.""   [Jury clears NBA star Derrick Rose and two friends in rape case]   Rose's ""blessing,"" however, had not appreciated the way he hoped by this summer when he got traded to the Knicks. While he originally wanted to sell the property, Rose told the New York Post that a soft real estate market changed his mind. ""The market isn't good,"" he said, not specifying whether he was referring to a general or Trump-specific slump. ""I don't know if a lot of people want to be part of it."" But ""who knows,"" the 28-year-old added. ""In a year or two, it may triple the price. I'm not selling it (now) because I don't want to feel I'm being forced to. It's an investment."" Rose's decision to sit on his Trump property comes in the wake of at least three NBA teams reportedly avoiding Trump hotels this season. Among those teams are the Milwaukee Bucks, Memphis Grizzlies and the Dallas Mavericks, which are owned by longtime Trump critic Mark Cuban. He told the Associated Press this week the decision for the Mavericks to avoid Trump hotels ""was made months ago."" Memphis coach David Fizdale, meanwhile, denied the Grizzlies' decision to avoid Trump properties had anything to do with the election. ""We didn't stay in Trump hotels when I was in Miami either,"" Fizdale, who coached the Heat from 2008 through last season, told the AP. ""So when I came here I wanted to stay in places I was familiar with. It had nothing to do with (the president elect)."" The Bucks, meanwhile, have not commented on the decision to avoid Trump hotels, which was first reported by ESPN's Marc Stein and Zach Lowe.   ['The message was loud and clear': In NBA and NFL, a struggle to accept Trump's election]   In contrast, several NBA personalities have come out strongly against the election of Trump, which they view as hazardous to the country. Among those critics are Pistons Coach Stan Van Gundy, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr and Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich, who offered some of the most scathing remarks. ""I'm just sick to my stomach,"" he said. ""Not basically because the Republicans won or anything, but the disgusting tenor and tone and all of the comments that have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic. ... My final conclusion is, my big fear is -- we are Rome."""

But that doesn’t mean her job is secure.	   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency)  Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan announced yesterday that he would challenge Nancy Pelosi as House minority leader. This was not entirely surprising: Many had speculated that Ryan would run after elections to the party's top leadership posts were unexpectedly delayed. But does Ryan have a chance at winning? History suggests that his odds of success are low. Contested elections against incumbent party leaders are seldom successful. Of the 23 that have taken place since 1960, only six succeeded. (Five were in the GOP, which has historically been more prone to revolt.) No top House party leader has been ousted in a contested election in over five decades.   [Rep. Tim Ryan launches long-shot challenge to Pelosi as Democrats struggle with postelection strategy]   The high failure rate of these revolts makes intuitive sense. Incumbent leaders tend to have strong ties to their colleagues, cultivated over many years through personal favors and party service. Furthermore, there is always the danger of retaliation: Even though ballots in leadership elections are secret, vengeful incumbents are usually quite skilled at figuring out who has voted against them. And Pelosi is reputed to lead with a strong hand. Another way of estimating Ryan's chances is to look at factors that predict vote choice in leadership elections. Our research has identified several key factors, including whether members are from the same state as a candidate and whether they have served on the same committees as the candidates, as well as the candidates' gender, ideology and campaign contributions to colleagues. These factors suggest that Ryan is at a distinct disadvantage. Ryan does serve on two major committees (Appropriations and Budget) with 26 other returning Democrats, a potentially rich reservoir of votes for the Ohioan. But nearly half of those Democrats are women, a key base of support for Pelosi, and Pelosi still has important ties to Appropriations, a committee on which she served prior to joining leadership. In addition, Pelosi can probably count of the votes of most, if not all, of the 37 Democrats from California, while Ryan is one of only four Democratic lawmakers who represent Ohio. Ideologically, Ryan is slightly more centrist than Pelosi (as measured by alpha-NOMINATE scores), which puts him at a disadvantage in the liberal-leaning caucus. In the last Congress, 97 Democrats were further to the left of Pelosi -- and presumably more willing to support her over Ryan -- while only 70 Democrats were further to Ryan's right. Finally, Pelosi has been a far more generous contributor than Ryan. The most recent data from the Center for Responsive Politics show that, in the 2015-16 election cycle, Pelosi's leadership PAC gave over $200,000 to 26 returning Democrats.  By contrast, Ryan's leadership PAC gave less than $5,000 to four Democrats who will serve in the 115th Congress. Although Pelosi is the prohibitive favorite, her victory is not guaranteed. Ryan may benefit from other factors.  For instance, we have found that seniority sometimes influences vote choice in leadership elections, and more junior Democrats (of which there are a growing number) may prefer Ryan over Pelosi. In addition, legislators who only narrowly won reelection may also be more inclined to support a change in party leadership, given the unexpectedly poor electoral performance of Democrats. Such was the case when Gerald Ford toppled Republican leader Charlie Halleck after the GOP's disappointing showing in the 1964 elections. More importantly, even if Pelosi wins, Ryan's challenge could portend bigger problems for Pelosi and her fellow leaders in the future. Contested leadership elections can both reveal and widen cracks in support for the incumbent leader. For instance, in 1969 nearly a quarter of House Democrats voted for Morris Udall in his failed challenge against incumbent speaker John McCormack. A weakened McCormack announced his retirement from Congress a year later. In short, if Ryan fails to defeat Pelosi but still wins a sizable number of votes, it could be an omen that the minority leader's days in leadership are numbered. Matthew Green is an associate professor of politics at Catholic University.  Douglas Harris is a professor of political science at the Loyola University Maryland.  They are writing a book about party leadership elections in the U.S. House of Representatives.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  I'm often accused of running way too many items about both Chris Cooley and politics. This is an accurate complaint. Anyhow, here's another item featuring both Chris Cooley and politics. Sorry, this is just too good. As America's pundit class continues to grapple with its faulty assumption that Hillary Clinton would win the presidential election, here's one pundit who doesn't have to grapple with anything: former Redskins tight end and current ESPN 980 host Chris Cooley. On the day before the election -- when Clinton remained a heavy betting favorite and most political experts saw a favorable path toward an Electoral College triumph -- Cooley made an out-of-left-field prediction on his morning radio show: that Trump would win comfortably.   [How covering the Redskins name debate prepared me for Donald Trump's win]   ""I think a lot of the blue states are going to be way more competitive [than predicted], and my you heard it here first on the election is that this is a landslide,"" he said. ""This isn't even going to be that close."" Come again? ""It's not necessarily because I'm addressing my political agenda, because I'm not,"" Cooley said. ""I'm not a party guy. I'm a non-partisan independent, I'm-gonna-vote-at-the-last-minute type of guy. But my thought in talking to lots of people, spending lots of time listening to radio [is that Trump] will win in a massive landslide."" I'm not sure whether Trump's win counts as a massive landslide, although the Electoral College margin isn't narrow. And Cooley's argument may not have been perfect: He maintained that the final polls would overstate Clinton's support because of so-called shy Trump voters being embarrassed to say who they supported. In fact, the final national polls seem to have been fairly accurate, although the state polls in places such as Wisconsin and Michigan were not.   [Reminder: Metro won't run late after the Redskins' 'Sunday Night Football' game]   Still, Cooley said the election would ""come down to Pennsylavania, North Carolina, Ohio, Florida ... states that could really swing this thing, that Democrats have won the last few years."" He said that Michigan ""is a toss-up state, 50-50."" He predicted that Virginia would be closer than people thought. And he again argued ""that it isn't even close, because I think the vast majority of the middle class in America will probably vote for Donald Trump; they just won't say they're going to."" Not saying it was a perfect prediction, and not saying Cooley should leave his day job. Just saying, you could find plenty of less accurate predictions about this election."

While most of the continent's extreme forces have taken pains to steer clear of Nazi imagery, Slovakia's answer to the trend celebrates it. Kotleba -- The People's Party Our Slovakia -- won almost 10 percent of the seats in Parliament in March. It openly admires the Nazi puppet state which the country was during the World War II. Party members use Nazi salutes, blame Roma for crime in deprived areas, consider NATO a terror group and want the country out of the alliance and the European Union. The party takes its name from its leader, Marian Kotleba, previously chairman of the banned neo-Nazi Slovak Togetherness-National Party, which organized anti-Roma rallies and admired Nazi rule in Slovakia. Thousands have signed a petition demanding that the party be banned. Analysts say the party's popularity could grow even further. Its simple slogan -- ""With courage against the system!"" -- attracts young people fed up with corruption and the inability of mainstream parties to deal effectively with the post-communist country's problems. In contrast to most of Europe's far-right groups, ""it's truly neo-Nazi, it advocates the legacy of the Nazi war state,"" says Eduard Chmelar, a Slovak political analyst. Miroslav Mares, an expert on extremism from the Masaryk University in the Czech city of Brno, said the party belongs to the ""hard core of right-wing extremism"" in Europe. He said it has only some features similar to Greece's Golden Dawn party and to Hungary's Jobbik at its beginning. What they have in common is targeting the mainstream politics.  ""The parties like that are not looking for solutions, it's all about protests,"" Chmelar said. ""You can see it globally. It's the same with Donald Trump, it's the same with (Marine) Le Pen in France. What's important is to be against the system. They're all riding on a wave of public dissatisfaction that has been growing."" These parties ""communicate and cooperate with each other, and that dramatically changes the situation in Europe, and that's dangerous,"" Chmelar said. ""So far, there's no recipe to stop them."" Kotleba's new party made news by launching patrols on trains in April in a reaction to a robbery blamed on a member of the Roma minority. Parliament banned such activities in October. The party has proposed legislation to label non-governmental organizations that receive funding from abroad as foreign agents, and is trying to get the 350,000 signatures needed to force nationwide referendums on the country's membership in NATO and the European Union.  ""Among our major goals is above all a creation of an independent and self-sufficient Slovakia, that is Slovakia which has an autonomous foreign policy that is not dictated by any foreign structure, such as the European Union,"" Milan Uhrik, a deputy chairman of the party, told The Associated Press in a rare interview. Kotleba refuses to talk to foreign media, The AP was told. Speaking in the Parliament building, Uhrik said the EU has been turning into a super state with Brussels in power. ""What's the worst is that EU legislation is above Slovak law,"" he said. NATO is another target.  ""It's important for Slovakia to leave NATO because we consider NATO a terrorist organization. It doesn't bring peace to the world, quite the contrary,"" Uhrik said.  ""NATO is in fact a military organization of the United States and we are militarily subordinated to the United States."" A celebration of wartime Slovakia remains particularly controversial, but Uhrik says it is not about fascism.  ""As nationalists, we cannot reject the first independent Slovak state,"" he argued. ""We recognize the Slovak (war) state because it was the first Slovak state, not because it was a fascist state."" On Oct. 13, party members celebrated the 129th anniversary of the birth of Jozef Tiso, a Catholic priest and politician who was Slovakia's war president. During his rule, some 60,000 Slovak Jews were transported to Nazi death camps. He was sentenced to death and hanged in 1947. Rights activists have submitted a petition with 20,000 signatures calling for the party to be banned. Prosecutors are reviewing that request.  ""Racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Holocaust denials and other such things have no place in democracy,"" said Peter Weisenbacher from Bratislava's Human Rights Institute. Kotleba is not a newcomer on Slovakia's political scene. In 2013, he was elected the head of a regional government, campaigning on a strong anti-Roma ticket. He promised to have a recipe to solve problems with the embattled minority, calling its members ""Gypsy parasites."" He defeated a candidate of the ruling leftist Smer-Social Democracy party in a runoff vote despite that party's chairman, Prime Minister Robert Fico, claiming that ""a bag of potatoes"" would beat Kotleba.  ""It was a shock for me when (Kotleba) won the regional election,"" said Ingrid Kosova, a Roma activist. ""I remember people were calling me every day saying that they were ridiculed on the streets, they were not allowed to board buses, they were really afraid. Later on the situation calmed down but until now they live with worries and fears."" In a region hit by unemployment around 15 percent, and over 25 percent in one county, Kosova said Kotleba succeeded in poor areas where the problems with the Roma minority are felt, and ""which he misused to get to power."" When the party won seats in Parliament, ""I was abroad in the Czech Republic and I was considering staying there for good,"" Kosova said. During the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising against the Nazi rule in 2014, with foreign presidents and other dignitaries in the central city of Banska Bystrica, the seat of Kotleba's region, Kotleba was flying a black flag from his office and unveiled banners saying ""Yankees go home!"" and ""Stop NATO!"" The Uprising is considered a defining moment of the Slovak history, and for most Slovaks a source of national pride because they stood against the Nazi rule. Peter Gogola was mayor there at the time.  ""I can't forgive him that,"" Gogola said. ""My grandpa was forced to fight in the Hungarian fascist army and died at Stalingrad. I can't stand fascism."" Martin Slosiarik, the head of Bratislava-based pollster Focus, said 70 percent of those who voted for Kotleba are under 40. He said most of them voted for him not because they would share his extremist views but because he promised ""to deal with the Roma and get rid of corruption.""  ""They've learned how to work with the public opinion to create a picture that they're the only force ready to challenge the current corrupt system,"" Chmelar said. He predicted the party could reach more than 10 percent of the popular vote at the next election. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Tim Ryan says he'll challenge Nancy Pelosi for the party's top House leadership position, saying ""what we are doing right now is not working"" after a shellacking in last week's election. Ryan announced his run in a letter to colleagues Thursday. House Democrats will hold leadership elections Nov. 30. In the letter, Ryan noted that over the past 18 years, Democrats have only been in the majority in the House for two terms, and ""last week's election results set us back even further,"" he said. Pelosi is well-known for her ability to count votes. She said Wednesday she has the backing of two-thirds of the caucus. Ryan has dismissed that claim. House Democrats gained a handful of seats in last week's election, not nearly as many as Pelosi had predicted. ___ 10:35 a.m. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says a letter by FBI Director James Comey announcing a probe into additional emails related to the bureau's investigation of Hillary Clinton was a ""foul deed"" that cost Democrats the election. The California Democrat told reporters that Comey's letter ""really just changed everything"" and ""was dispositive of the election."" Pelosi noted that Comey declined to talk about the hacking by the Russians of the emails of Clinton Campaign chair John Podesta and other Democrats because of a bureau policy of avoiding statements that could affect the election. ___ 10:52 a.m. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan is strongly hinting that he'll challenge Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Ryan said Thursday that he would make a decision soon and he believes he would have a chance to unseat the California lawmaker who has led her party for more than a decade. Some discontented Democrats have been clamoring for new leadership after their shellacking last week. The party lost the White House and only made small gains in the House and the Senate, leaving Democrats in the minority. Ryan says there's a lot of anxiety in the caucus and a lot of people want some change. He added: ""I would think it has to be at the top."" Democrats were supposed to vote on Thursday but postponed the vote to Nov. 30. ___ House Republicans leaders say President-elect Donald Trump wants a short-term spending bill to keep the government running through March of next year. The current stopgap spending bill runs out in less than a month, on Dec. 9. House and Senate negotiators are working on a bill they could pass before leaving for the holidays. House Republicans met Thursday behind closed doors with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Speaker Paul Ryan told them the new administration prefers a four-month extension of spending.

Tim Kaine looks ahead	" If the world didn't know that Sen. Tim Kaine had just lost the vice presidency, a crushing defeat for the man, the Democratic Party and millions of American voters, nothing about his demeanor would give it away. Smiling broadly, Kaine sat in his Senate office Thursday with the air of a man who had just won the lottery. ""I'm disappointed because I think I would have done a good job and I think Hillary would have been a great president, but I have a job to do here that in some ways may have gotten more important,"" he said, bluegrass music playing in the background. He ruled out a run for the White House in 2020 but will seek reelection in 2018, and Republicans are gunning for him. They are bolstered by a sense of dominance over American politics not felt since 1928 and believe they have a deep bench in Virginia. ""I'm assuming it's going to be the hardest race I've ever run,"" he said. ""Presidential elections we do well. Off-year elections are tough.""     While introducing Hillary Clinton at her concession speech on Nov. 9 in New York City, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) drew cheers and applause when he quoted William Faulkner's words, ""They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yit,"" as a way to encourage Democrats to move forward. (The Washington Post)   Pressed repeatedly, Kaine did not want to talk about what went wrong for Democrats this election.  ""While I have some thoughts, I'm not objective about it,"" he said. Joining the ticket just three months before Election Day, Kaine couldn't have had much say in strategy or the contours of the race. He said Hillary Clinton ran into historic head winds trying to be the first female president and noted that only two Democratic presidents were elected following a two-term Democratic presidency -- Martin Van Buren and Harry S. Truman.  Kaine, chosen in part because of his ability to communicate with Latino voters in fluent Spanish, offered no explanation for why the campaign didn't win more Hispanic votes, except to say that no minority group is monolithic. He said he understood why daily protests continue around the country more than a week after an election in which Clinton won the popular vote but Donald Trump won the office. ""I view it as people are afraid, and I think they have reason to be afraid,"" he said, adding that he will go to battle over what he called the ""normalization"" of bigotry that he sees in President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of Stephen K. Bannon as his chief strategist. Kaine said he had no advice for protesters other than to encourage them to get involved in politics at the state and local level. ""Look, civil disobedience has an important role in the history of this country,"" he said. ""I'm not encouraging folks, and I'm not discouraging them."" Kaine said he always thought there was a chance he and Clinton could lose, but on election night, the results from the conservative Richmond suburb of Chesterfield, where Trump had a relatively weak showing, convinced him that they would win. It hadn't occurred to him, he said, that Democrats could win Virginia by a bigger margin than President Obama did in 2012, and win the popular vote by more than 1 million votes, and still lose. Kaine moved to Virginia's capital city and served as Richmond's mayor, as well as lieutenant governor and governor, in hopes of making the state more progressive, he said. He had never lost an election. Kaine said he had felt an ""interesting set of emotions"" once it became clear that Trump was surging ahead in the electoral college count. Like much of the country, Kaine stayed awake past midnight to await the final results. Then he took a nap. Late the next morning, he introduced Clinton with hastily prepared notes scrawled on a piece of hotel stationery. After the speech, his wife, former Virginia secretary of education Anne Holton, kept the paper for their children to cherish. The William Faulkner quote he recited -- ""They kilt us, but they ain't whupped us yit,"" -- was one he clung to when he lost difficult cases during his 17 years as a civil rights lawyer. He and Holton spent the weekend in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where they ""kvetched"" a bit but mostly reflected on the good things in their lives, he said. They will celebrate their 32nd anniversary on Thanksgiving Day. On Tuesday, Kaine drove himself to Washington, returning to the predictable rhythms of the Senate and his Russell Building office. On Friday, he plans to travel with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and other lawmakers to a national security forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, a trip he has made every year as senator. Kaine sits on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, and although he's not officially part of the leadership, he said he plans to vigorously defend principles such as the constitutional powers of Congress, which could be crucial under Trump. Calling the Democratic Senate minority the ""only emergency brake"" on matters of fundamental values, Kaine said he is proud of his colleagues for focusing on Bannon and ""not allowing the appointment of someone who has connections to anti-Semitism and white nationalism to be just normalized."" But common ground could be found with the Trump administration over a sweeping infrastructure bill that was also a Clinton priority, he said. He has said he would like to fashion his Senate service after retired senator John Warner (R-Va.), who spent 30 years in office. Virginia Republicans had praised Kaine's bipartisanship in the past but criticized his presence on the national ticket and his comment Thursday that he will seek reelection. Virginia GOP Chairman John Whitbeck said the announcement suggests he's inappropriately mixing government service and politics.  After nonstop travel to 40 states, Kaine relishes his return to home life in Northside Richmond, ""where nobody calls me Senator."" The day after the election, he and Holton flew back to Richmond from New York on the campaign plane. After they said an emotional goodbye to the Secret Service officers with whom they had grown close, Kaine said, he climbed the back steps to his kitchen and puttered around for a few minutes before going into his home office. Peering out the window, he watched the government vehicles pull away one by one. A wave of emotion came over him, he said. It was relief. "

The son, an executive in his father's company, insisted the two wouldn't discuss the business if Dad ever got to the White House. Then Donald Jr. added two words: ""Trust me."" The American people may have little choice. The tradition stretching back to Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s is for presidents to put personal holdings such as stocks into a ""blind trust"" run by an independent trustee with no ties to the occupant of the Oval Office. But as with so many other areas of politics, Trump looks ready to upend this time-honored practice. Trump's plans to hand control of his Trump Organization to three of his adult children and not a trustee cannot be considered a blind trust, said Kenneth Gross, head of political law at the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Even if the president-elect were to appoint a trustee with no family ties, that would probably not remove the potential for Trump to use his new power over policy to enrich himself. Liquidating Trump's holdings would be difficult, and so he would always be aware of what assets he holds. Voters have long worried about elected officials using their power to line their pockets -- or those of business partners -- and shape policies to advance their private interests. But rarely has an incoming president represented such potential for conflicts of interest. No previous commander in chief has brought with him such a sprawling business empire with so much complexity, opaqueness and opportunity for self-dealing. Trump owns golf clubs, office towers and other properties in several countries. He holds ownership stakes in more than 500 companies. He has struck licensing deals for use of his name on hotels and other buildings around the world and has been landing new business in even more countries -- in the Middle East, India and South America. Gross calls Trump's holdings ""unprecedented"" in size and complexity for a president, a ""tangled web"" of potential conflicts that would be difficult to unravel. As it turns out, Trump doesn't even have to try. Presidents are not required to set up blind trusts. In fact, they can even run a business from the White House, though Trump has said he will not. Federal ethics rules put strict limits on nearly all government employees and elected officials to prevent self-dealing, but the rules do not apply to the president. One area where the public interest could clash with the personal involves Trump's influence over federal agencies whose decisions affect his businesses. In turning the government-owned Old Post Office into his new Washington hotel, Trump struck a complex rental and management deal with the General Services Administration. As president, he will appoint the head of the GSA. And one of Trump's lenders, Deutsche Bank, is in settlement talks with the Justice Department over its role in the mortgage blowup that sparked the 2008 financial crisis. Trump will appoint the head of that agency, too. For his part, Trump has dismissed the idea that he is even interested in his business now. In an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday, he said he was fully engaged in efforts to ""save our country.""  ""I don't care about hotel occupancy,"" he added. He called matters like that ""peanuts."" The Trump Organization said in a statement that it is ""vetting various structures"" with the goal of transferring management to three of Trump's children, along with a ""team of highly skilled executives."" Carter started the tradition of presidential blind trusts when he put his peanut farm in one. All the presidents who followed also set up one, according to Gross, save for Barack Obama, who mostly had holdings in plain-vanilla index funds. With a blind trust, owners can't control their portfolio and may not even know what's in it. Trustees sometimes sell off holdings and invest the money elsewhere without the owner's knowledge.  ""It's one thing to sell 1,500 shares of Procter & Gamble. You can do that easily,"" Gross said. ""It's another thing to sell a golf course in a foreign country or extricate from a branding contract."" In the 2012 presidential election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who had vast holdings from working at buyout firm Bain Capital, pledged to put his wealth in a blind trust certified by the Office of Government Ethics. On CNN on Sunday, Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani suggested the president-elect could set up a blind trust. Later he suggested a more flexible arrangement might be necessary given the role of Trump's children in his business. He called the situation ""very unusual.""  ""There's no perfect way to do this,"" Giuliani said. ""You have to have some confidence in the integrity of the president."" ___ Bernard Condon can be reached at http://twitter.com/BernardFCondon.

In a room decorated with posters and leftist slogans, Nabila Mounib is surrounded by activists who take selfies with her and wish her luck. She's keenly aware of the stakes. Mounib, a 56-year-old endocrinology professor, is Morocco's most high-profile female politician, and this election marks her debut on the national stage as a party leader. After two weeks of campaigning across the country in a cramped mini-bus, she will find out the next day if she has succeeded in getting her party into parliament and winning a seat herself. It's a moment she's worked for all her adult life, while raising three children. Even now, in the anxiety-tinged bustle, she's caught in the push-pull of a working mother. She excuses herself to rush home and help her 16-year-old son Haroune with his science homework. ______ EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of a series of profiles of Arab women fighting for change in different countries and areas of life. ______ Mounib is still a rarity in the Arab world -- a female politician in a leadership position. When it comes to the gender gap in politics, Morocco ranks 97th out of 145 countries, according to the World Economic Forum. Many Arab countries score even lower. Despite her relatively privileged upbringing as the daughter of a diplomat, Mounib says she learned early on that women have to outperform men to prove their worth. She is guarded about her personal life, but speaks passionately about the role of women.  ""Women have to struggle extra hard in every aspect of what they do,"" she says. ""The main reason I decided to pursue politics was to reach these heights, to reach these ceilings, and to shatter them for other women...I want to create an example, a historic example, a successful example."" _____ ON THE TRAIL Despite the hopes raised by the Arab Spring five years ago, women in the region still hold only 17.6 percent of seats in parliament. That's the second lowest regional score in the world, although still not far from the global average of 22.8 percent, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In Morocco, it's 20.5 percent, mainly because of a women's quota. In this election, Mounib's Unified Socialist Party is allied with two others to form the Federation of the Democratic Left. The alliance is a first for a notoriously fractured progressive movement that presents itself as an alternative to pro-monarchy and Islamist parties. The campaign kicks off in Marrakesh, the country's fourth largest city. Mounib is accompanied by four young volunteers, including her 25-year-old daughter Dounia. The white bus is covered with large posters of Mounib smiling confidently. Her work ethic shows, with meetings often running late into the night because she won't turn away supporters. During long rides, she conducts phone interviews with Moroccan and French media outlets. The mood is casual. Mounib insists that the driver eat with the team. He is almost instantly transformed from a random stranger into an ardent supporter, sitting in the front row when she delivers her daily stump speech. During stops, a smiling Mounib -- often dressed casually in jeans, a white campaign T-shirt and orange sneakers -- steps off the bus for photos. The crowd, almost all men, respectfully call her ""ustada,"" or professor. She calls women to the front. Her calm only rarely gives way to flashes of irritation, such as a raised voice, mostly over planning mishaps. Mounib routinely runs late to meetings or rallies because of bad roads and unforeseen stops. ""Honestly, I do feel this pressure,"" she later says about leading a national campaign. Success is far from a shoo-in. The Federation has struggled to extend its appeal beyond urban, educated Moroccans. It can't rely on the patronage networks of the pro-monarchy parties and lacks the Islamists' deep roots in poorer urban areas. Mounib tries to reach rural audiences with demands for social justice --narrow the wealth gap, fight nepotism, improve education. In Guelmim, a town of more than 100,000 people near the Western Sahara, the crowd of about 200 -- mostly men -- listens without heckling or interruptions, a display of politeness fairly typical at such rallies in Morocco. The audience bursts into applause when she alludes to sex scandals involving senior members of another party. The husky-voiced Mounib is lively and confident, gesturing as she delivers her speeches in earthy Darija, Morocco's colloquial language. In years of public speaking, she's learned to slip in a joke or jab at an opponent to reel back a drifting audience. She took up karate when she was younger -- a sport she says helped with concentration and public speaking.  ""Our society teaches us to be shy and keep to ourselves,"" she says of women in Morocco. ""I've always been outspoken."" ___ IN THE FAMILY Mounib grew up in Casablanca as the seventh of nine children. When she was 14, her father was assigned to a diplomatic posting in neighboring Algeria. There, she studied civics in school for the first time, a subject then not taught in Morocco. The six oldest siblings remained in Morocco to continue their studies. In Algeria, Mounib was now the oldest. It was a turning point. Her father encouraged her interest in politics, answering questions and giving her books. He also invited her to his office, where he received dignitaries. In a patriarchy, a supportive father is the key to a girl's confidence, she says. Her world view began to take shape. Mounib embraced socialism as a vehicle for change. After high school, she studied geology and biology in Morocco, and earned a doctorate in endocrinology at Montpellier University in France. After her return to Casablanca in the 1980s, she became a university lecturer, eventually rising to the leadership of the regional chapter of the professors' union. She also became active in leftist politics, joining precursors of what eventually became the PSU and the Federation. Daughter Dounia says there was no need to preach gender equality in her home because her parents lived it. Her father, 58-year-old Youssef Hajji, who works in insurance, often fixed meals as her mother dashed off to meetings. Some of her girlfriends, even in their upscale Anfa district, would often be asked to serve their brothers, Dounia says. Her older sister Imane, 30, also works in insurance, but Dounia caught the political bug. She ran in local elections last year and lost. Now the lanky, confident young woman in aviator glasses is in graduate school, studying political communication. Her mother is a role model, even if there's some friction. At one point on the trail, Mounib snaps at Dounia when she criticizes a decision on a social media post. The tension quickly dissipates.  ""Just the fact that you see this woman being in charge of something this big makes you believe in anything,"" says Dounia. ""You see yourself in her."" ___ A JOLT OF HOPE It's eight days until the election, and Mounib is campaigning in Outat Elhaj, a town of 20,000. Morocco does not allow polling during campaigns, so she has no idea how she is doing. In rural communities like this, where men control the public space, Mounib's presence gives a jolt of hope to women. She steps onto a stage overlooking a market street lined by male-only coffee shops. Chenna Hadhoum, a 38-year-old municipal clerk, watches from the sidelines. Many women in this community still have to ask their husbands for permission to leave the house, she says. She can come and go freely since her husband is educated and a PSU supporter, but she keeps her head down in public to avoid gossip, taking detours to stay clear of the coffee shops. Mounib ""gives strength to women because she is capable and equal to a man,"" Hadhoum says. After the rally, Hadhoum wrestles with her shyness, and then walks up to Mounib and asks for a photo. Later, she waits near the campaign bus to catch another glimpse of Mounib. She says it's been a day she will remember for a long time. Mounib says she has encountered sexism even in a progressive movement like her own, with a relatively high number of female activists.  ""Just because we were in the party as women, it does not mean they laid down the red carpet for us,"" she says. In her first year as party leader, she faced repeated challenges, mostly from male colleagues, and at times considered resigning. At one point, they tried to override her decision to consult the rank and file on a key issue, but she stood firm. At another time, they suggested she let one of the ostensibly more experienced men handle media interviews. Her standing improved after her first appearance on national media, which gave her higher visibility. She says she is no longer challenged, but the possibility of failure is clearly on her mind. She resolves not to seek re-election as party leader if the Federation does poorly.  ""If we fail, I'm going to go back and put on my sneakers, and get back to the grassroots,"" she says. She believes it's rare to see men willing to step aside voluntarily.  ""Men have made so many mistakes, and they have made disastrous decisions, and you still find them in the same positions,"" she says. Female lawmakers in the ruling Islamist party argue that it's been a more effective champion for women's advancement than secular groups, including by getting more women into parliament. Emna Ma Al Ainaine, an Islamist candidate and former high school philosophy teacher, dismisses the Federation as marginal and claims Mounib comes off as elitist.  ""We had debates,"" she says. ""Me, I am open, I am ready to listen to everyone .... But with Nabila, she believes she has the truth, just her, in Morocco."" Dounia says her mother has been skewered on Facebook for owning a pair of expensive sunglasses. And a French publication noted in a recent profile that Mounib drove to the interview in a Volvo. Campaign manager Nada Harif says such criticism reflects widespread misogyny.  ""She will be attacked because she has sunglasses and a good car, to avoid talking about the real subjects,"" Harif says. She adds that Mounib takes the sunglasses off when talking in poorer communities. ___ A REBIRTH? It's early on Oct. 8th, and the election results are starting to come in. At first, euphoria erupts at campaign headquarters, because the federation has secured two of 305 seats in district races. An additional 90 seats for women and candidates under 40 are chosen in a national vote, and those results won't be known for a few more hours. Mounib stands beside Mustapha Chennaoui, the winner in a Casablanca district, who has tears of joy in his eyes. She joins him in a victory chant: ""I'm neither sold nor bought. I'm a leftist and proud!"" But the two seats fall far short of the 10 to 12 Mounib had hoped for. And a few hours later, she hears on television that the federation did not cross the 3 percent threshold for the national vote. This means she won't get into parliament. The Islamists are once again the largest party in parliament, followed by a pro-monarchy faction. Mounib takes a few days to deal with the disappointment. She suspects widespread election fraud but cannot prove it. A week after the election, she's back at party headquarters. She won't resign from the party, but also -- as promised -- won't seek re-election as its leader. She hopes Morocco will one day be a parliamentary democracy that celebrates diversity.  ""I want a Morocco where equality between a man and a woman means that a woman can walk outside in a hijab or in shorts,"" she says, ""and be happy about being a woman.""
