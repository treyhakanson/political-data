Is this how Jared Kushner got in?	"   President-elect Donald Trump embraces son in law Jared Kushner, as his daughter Ivanka Trump stands nearby, after Trump delivered his acceptance speech on the morning of Nov. 9, following his election to the presidency. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)  Daniel Golden is the editor of ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. In 2004, he won the Pulitzer Prize for beat reporting for a series of Wall Street Journal articles exposing how some wealthy white families can use assets -- cash and political connections -- to get their children into top colleges and universities. Then in 2006, he wrote a book on the same subject, ""The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges -- and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates,"" adding to his earlier revelations about how elite institutions of higher education talk incessantly about merit-based admissions but don't always walk that walk. In the book, Golden told stories about how specific families maneuvered to get their children into schools they otherwise might not have gotten into without their names, bank accounts and access to power. This is from a Washington Post review of the book when it was published: A tough investigative reporter, Golden does not hesitate to name names -- not only of specific institutions (including Harvard, Duke, Brown, Notre Dame, the University of Virginia, Princeton, Stanford and Amherst) and administrators, but also of individual students (including the sons of Al Gore and Sen. Bill Frist) whom he deems to be beneficiaries of preferences for the privileged. The result is a disturbing expose of the influence that wealth and power still exert on admission to the nation's most prestigious universities. Another one of the families he writes about are the Kushners, which includes 35-year-old Jared Kushner, the husband of Ivanka Trump and confidant to his father-in-law, President-elect Donald Trump. In a new piece for ProPublica, Golden answers why the Kushners were part of the book and details why he believes Harvard accepted Jared Kushner. Golden notes: Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said in an email Thursday that ""the allegation"" that Charles Kushner's gift to Harvard was related to Jared's admission ""is and always has been false."" His parents, Charles and Seryl Kushner, ""are enormously generous and have donated over 100 million dollars to universities, hospitals and other charitable causes. Jared Kushner was an excellent student in high school and graduated from Harvard with honors."" (About 90 percent of Jared's 2003 class at Harvard also graduated with honors.) He also wrote this about his book: It reported that New Jersey real estate developer Charles Kushner had pledged $2.5 million to Harvard University in 1998, not long before his son Jared was admitted to the prestigious Ivy League school. At the time, Harvard accepted about one of every nine applicants. (Nowadays, it only takes one out of twenty.) I also quoted administrators at Jared's high school, who described him as a less than stellar student and expressed dismay at Harvard's decision. ""There was no way anybody in the administrative office of the school thought he would on the merits get into Harvard,"" a former official at The Frisch School in Paramus, New Jersey, told me. ""His GPA did not warrant it, his SAT scores did not warrant it. We thought for sure, there was no way this was going to happen. Then, lo and behold, Jared was accepted. It was a little bit disappointing because there were at the time other kids we thought should really get in on the merits, and they did not."" You can read Golden's full report, co-published with the Guardian, here. There are other reports, too, of how wealthy families attempt to buy admissions for their children into a top college or university. In 2015, the London Review of Books published a piece by Deborah Friedell about the release by WikiLeaks of hacked emails from Sony. She wrote: In 2014, a senior executive emailed an Ivy League vice-president of philanthropy: he'd like to endow a scholarship, anonymously, 'at the $1mm level'. In another email, he tells a development officer that his daughter is applying to the college as her first choice. It's all very decorous. The development staff arrange a 'customised' campus tour for his daughter and a meeting with the university's president; but he asks for no favours and nothing is promised. An email from the president says that his daughter's application will be looked at 'very closely'. She gets in. He writes to his sister: 'David... called me. he is obsessed with getting his eldest in Harvard next year.' She replies: 'If David wants to get his daughter in he should obviously start giving money.' Obviously.      Jared Kushner is President-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law but he's also one of his key advisers. Here's a closer look at the man who may play a central role in Trump's administration.

Antoni Macierewicz has repeatedly stressed that the nation's security has decreased amid neighboring Russia's assertiveness. He is strengthening various forms of national defense and recently added a new military force, the Territorial Defense, which should be operational early next year. Macierewicz insisted that the no-weapons self-defense courses for women have to do with their personal security and not with military defense. But he said that well-trained women will contribute to national security. The armed forces are sharing their expertise in order to ""increase the security of individual persons and of the state,"" he said. Macierewicz spoke in the central town of Tomaszow Mazowiecki, where the nationwide courses were launched with training for about 30 Polish women aged over 18. In jogging attire, they exercised with male and female army trainers to test defense grips and blows. One of them, Jadwiga Kotynia, said she would use the skills for the nation's benefit, if needed.  ""In the times we live in there might be such need. The more people are well-trained, the better for the country,"" she said. Macierewicz said that tens of thousands of women have signed up for such training in 30 cities, but there was no room for all of them. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The ministry said in a statement that Saturday's fire was set by some of the migrants. All rooms were vacated and the inmates were brought to an assembly area, from where 123 people fled during the ensuing chaos. Authorities have detained 20 runaways and are searching for the rest. Three foreigners who were hospitalized after the fire are all in good condition. An investigation has been launched into the employees who allowed flammable materials in the center, and they have been suspended.

When all the returns are in, Hillary Clinton will emerge with a popular vote lead of some 1.5 million to 2 million votes, according to estimates by both Nate Cohn of the New York Times and Henry Olsen, a conservative voting analyst whose pre-election predictions were close to the actual results. Given what Trump has said in the past about the electoral college, we know what he would say if the roles were reversed. To point out Clinton's popular-vote advantage is not a form of liberal denial. It's a way of beginning to build a barricade against right-wing triumphalism -- and of reminding immigrants, Muslims, African Americans, Latinos and, yes, our daughters that most Americans stood with them on Election Day. It is also not true that the emerging political coalition that elected President Obama died on Nov. 8. That alliance maintained its national advantage, as the popular vote shows, and came within a whisker in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan of delivering the election to Clinton despite an onslaught of partisan congressional investigations, Russian meddling and the last-minute political intervention of the FBI.      Members of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team as well as Democratic officials on Nov. 13 responded to protesters marching in several cities against Trump's election. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   We dare not forget the power that was arrayed behind Trump because it is that power that must be resisted over the next four years. Obama and Clinton both did the expected thing in wishing Trump well, and Lord knows, nothing would make me happier than for Trump to surprise us by being a pragmatist who said a lot of stuff he didn't believe to win the presidency. If he governs reasonably, we will all be better off.  That wish, however, does not absolve us of the obligation to vigilance against the other possibility: that the real Trump is the man we actually watched, many of us in horror, month after month.  But there is one piece of the post-election conventional wisdom that is importantly right, yet in ways more complicated than we progressives might wish. Those who touted the power of the Obama coalition made the grave miscalculation of forgetting that white working-class voters were essential to making the new alliance work.  Obama's base was made up of Americans of color, the young, and whites from large metropolitan areas. But he was put over the top, as some of us insisted at the time , by securing a significant share of the white working-class vote, particularly in the Midwestern states where in 2012 he won 40 percent or more from whites without a college degree. In Wisconsin, for example, Obama won 45 percent of those voters; Clinton was backed by only 34 percent of them this year. And Clinton lost Wisconsin by just 27,000 votes.  Clinton counted on doing better with white working-class women than she did (they went for Trump by a remarkable 62 percent to  34 percent) and also with college-educated white men, who went 54 percent to 39 percent for Trump.  Democrats sorely need to recover ground with white working-class voters, especially after learning that even a candidate as troubling as Trump could not sufficiently loosen the Republican loyalties of many among the college educated -- particularly men. Still, progressives hoping that a heavy dose of populism will be enough to win back the working class must not be under the illusion that the Trump constituency was motivated solely by economics. In fact, Trump's immigration stand (he won 86 percent of voters who want to build a wall on the Mexican border, according to CNN's exit polls ) and his law-and-order appeal (he won 74 percent among those who rejected the idea that the criminal justice system treats black Americans unfairly) were key to his victory. When exit pollsters asked voters to name the most important issue facing the country, he won among those who listed immigration or terrorism; he lost among those who cited the economy. Trump's hard-edged social conservatism, not just a general anti- establishment appeal, drove up white turnout in many key counties. Finally, lest anyone doubt that the outsized attention given to the matter of Clinton's use of a private server was decisive, consider that 45 percent of voters said that her use of private email bothered them ""a lot,"" and they voted better than 12-to-1 for Trump.  It's too late now, but does anyone in the media (or FBI Director James B. Comey) really believe the email story was more vital to our country's future than the many revelations about Trump, his scapegoating of so many of our fellow citizens, or the radicalism of his program? Congressional Republicans did all they could to destroy Clinton by spending 20 months pushing this issue. They succeeded, and gave us Trump.   Read more from E.J.

At 71, he had just cast his first Republican vote for president. ""Don't tell my wife,"" he joked, as he told anyone within earshot why he'd backed Donald Trump. ""We need a change in everything, and I hope he can do it,"" said Oldani, who'd retired after years as a machinist. ""This guy's a billionaire, so I'm thinking he can say, 'Hey, let's just get the job done. I don't need your money.' "" The rebuttals started flying. What about the leaked tax forms that showed Trump's writing off nearly a billion dollars? ""More power to him. He ain't in jail, right?"" What about the Access Hollywood tape?     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump View Graphic     These former Obama strongholds sealed the election for Trump  ""As far as these rumors with the girls, and all of that -- if you do your job, who cares?"" A few miles away, outside a Culver's near Kenosha's sprawling and anonymous business park, Joe Schmaling and Oscar Corona were taking a break from their landscaping business. Schmaling, 32, said that work had been steady -- ""maybe because Obama's on the way out"" -- and that Trump, in the words of his campaign, would ""drain the swamp"" of Washington. ""If we put up with Obama, we can put up with four years of this guy,"" said Schmaling. ""I'm excited to see him blow the place up. He stands on his own, so he can throw the middle finger up."" Corona, 30, was born in Mexico but lives in the United States with a green card. They'd just been joking about whether Trump would kick him out of the country, fully confident that he wouldn't. ""He's not rash,"" Schmaling said. In interviews on Wednesday, again and again, voters in Kenosha said that they had gotten behind Donald Trump. Often, they had not cast a vote for a Republican presidential nominee before. More often, they said that the past eight years had gone well for them -- although, tellingly, the city had been better in the times they dimly remembered. Trump, the first Republican to win the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin since the 1980s, did so by narrow margins. Michigan has not been called but with all the results in Trump has 2,279,210 votes to Clinton's 2,267,373, according to Associated Press figures. Rural voters broke decisively his way. Trump's last-minute campaign swing through Eau Claire, a western Wisconsin city that shares a largely rural media market with parts of Minnesota, confounded Democrats who saw him losing in polls. It made more sense when massive Trump margins in rural Wisconsin gave him the state.      How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea View Graphic     How Trump redrew the electoral map, from sea to shining sea  Kenosha, south of Milwaukee and north of the Chicago suburbs where Hillary Clinton was raised, was telling of the threat that sneaked up on Democrats. The industrial economy had been replaced by tourism, but the county was growing. No one would have picked it for a travelogue of trade-racked America. And it had voted for Democrats. It voted for Barack Obama, twice. It voted against George W. Bush, twice, and for Bill Clinton, twice. It helped Michael Dukakis carry the state in 1988 and, four years earlier, gave Walter Mondale a five-percentage-point victory over Ronald Reagan. No Democrat had lost since 1972. Hillary Clinton lost it; in retrospect, the trend was obvious. In her 2008 loss to Barack Obama, Clinton lost Kenosha County by just three points, as she lost by 18 points statewide. In the 2016 Democratic primaries, Clinton lost the county to Sen. Bernie Sanders by 15 points -- despite a closer result across the state. She carried heavily black Milwaukee County, and Sanders carried everything else. ""White working-class people are deserting the Democratic Party in droves,"" Sanders said in an interview Thursday. The 2016 election was Wisconsin's first since the Supreme Court's ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, which undid part of the Voting Rights Act; the first since Gov. Scott Walker (R) signed voter ID legislation; the first since Walker pushed through right-to-work legislation. Each domino, Democrats warned, was falling on their party by design. An estimated 300,000 people lacked voter IDs on Election Day, and private-sector unions had shrunk and consolidated since 2015. ""We had to go to our membership and ask specifically, 'Are you able to donate ten cents per hour?' "" said Randy Bryce, a local organizer and one-time Democratic candidate for state Senate, describing how a series of laws had weakened the labor movement. ""With the economy now, that's impossible to do. So any money we had [at] the start of the process was all we'd have for the rest of our existence."" Yet on Wednesday, sitting around a table in their downtown Kenosha headquarters, local leaders of the Democratic Party said the voter-ID issue had not stuck. Approaching the election, it seemed that they were mobilizing the party's loyal voters. ""It was just that 'Make America Great Again' turned out to be genius,"" said Karen Kempinen, 67, a retired teacher. ""That resonated. They didn't need to think any further than those words."" In 2012, 21 percent of Wisconsin voters told exit pollsters that they or a family member belonged to a union. They broke for Barack Obama by 33 percentage points. This year, just as many voters said they were in union households -- and Clinton won them by just 10 points. The numbers and the swoon were similar in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Early on, Clinton's campaign had waved off the idea of a backlash. After her victory in Ohio's primary, campaign pollster Joel Benenson, an Obama veteran, wrote confidently that white working-class voters had paid attention to her real trade record. ""Democrats in states hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs are looking for more than anger and accusations, and stopping abuse by foreign countries,"" he wrote. ""They're looking for real plans and a broad economic agenda.""  But to the bafflement of Democrats here, the late Clinton push into the state -- a series of ads that began in late October -- did not mirror the economic messaging of the local labor unions. One played back Trump's worst remarks about women; another, his mocking of a reporter with a physical disability; the last, a warning from a nuclear technician who worried that a reckless President Trump would start a war. In 2012, when Democrats fought for Wisconsin all cycle, there had been clear economic messaging. One Obama ad dramatized Mitt Romney's plan to ""give millionaires another tax break"" with a photo of him walking past Donald Trump's plane. Romney lost Kenosha despite tapping Paul D. Ryan, who represented the district in Congress, as his running mate. But in midterm years, and in the historic 2012 recall that took place before the general election, Kenosha voted for Walker, the governor. Walker's popularity had slipped since then, but his style had stuck with people. After work on Wednesday, a retiree named Larry Ancona, 61, bitterly pointed out the rows of homes that stood where there used to be an American Motors plant powering the city's economy. ""I know people that get $800 a month in food stamps, lied to get that, lied to get the medical benefits. And here we are -- we're paying for it,"" he said. Angelo Tenuta, 51, politely argued with his friend. Ancona, sporting a knockoff Make America Great Again hat with a stitched Trump signature, kept calling the Obama presidency a disaster. That seemed to go too far. ""He got a war in Iraq without a price tag,"" Tenuta said. ""I voted for Bush twice, but Obama inherited a mess from that guy."" But Tenuta was more optimistic about Trump. For one, he had broken the old, bad Republican Party -- ""He was on his own from day one."" For another, he seemed ready to break legislative stalemates where Obama never could. ""It's pathetic,"" he said. ""You got to go to Congress to get anything done. It's hindering sales. It's hindering business."" In Wisconsin, with a Republican majority that need not worry about a filibuster, this thinking was self-evident. Washington stumbled and failed and offered nothing; Trump offered brisk if unspecified change. It still made little sense to Democrats. ""I was going to be one of the electors this year for Hillary,"" Bryce said. ""I thought it was a done deal. I could not imagine anyone voting for the man, based on the things that were coming out of his mouth.""   Correction: An earlier version of this story said that Trump had carried Michigan. That state has not been called for Trump, but with all the results in, he leads Clinton.    John Wagner contributed to this report.  "

That will have to end, pronto. He has entrusted his operations to a tight, tiny circle of executives, a handful at most. That circle will expand, greatly. He has always demanded round-the-clock work and total availability from his staff. That will fit right in. He has always bristled -- and often lashed out -- when staffers push back against his decisions. That could damage his presidency. The people who have worked most closely with Donald Trump say he will bring a distinctly different style of management and leadership to the White House.     The Post's Marc Fisher explains how some of President-elect Donald Trump's traits could inform his leadership style when he takes office. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)   He reads little and rules by his gut. He picks people by first impressions, sometimes without even talking to them. He is laser-focused on how he is perceived and what people say about him. ""Donald has to make a huge transition from Trump World to the United States of America,"" said Louise Sunshine, the first executive Trump hired when he started out in the real estate business. Sunshine, Trump's closest sidekick from 1971 to 1987, said her former boss ""has to put his own needs aside -- his needs for approval and acknowledgment, his inclination to use social media. He has to graduate to a huger universe. It's going to be challenging, but he will do it."" To govern a nation of 320 million people, Trump will have to absorb enormous amounts of information about issues he has never confronted and controversies that blow up in moments. His former executives say that's something he does well. ""He is a quick study,"" said Barbara Res, who spent 18 years as Trump's top construction executive. ""You don't have to give him a long story. He picks it right up."" But the Washington bureaucracy and Congress will have to get accustomed to a president who can't stand long meetings and has little patience for complexity, according to Trump's aides through the years. ""He'll have someone read the reports for him and give them to him orally, real short,"" Res said. ""He brags that he's never read a book all the way through. He doesn't have the patience to sit in meetings. We always had a hard time keeping his attention during the prep for a deposition or something like that. The flip side is that he can scan something and get it quickly."" ""The guy doesn't read,"" said Jack O'Donnell, who served as president of the Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City at the height of Trump's casino empire in the late 1980s. ""He reacts to what he sees and hears in the moment; he is a poor listener."" To correct for those qualities, O'Donnell said, Trump learned to delegate much of his work and give managers broad authority. But those who have worked with him say that Trump's delegating requires extreme loyalty, and if anything goes amiss, the boss will explode. ""He gets frustrated and impatient,"" said Sunshine, who said she thinks Trump will quickly adapt to the vast size and scope of the federal government. ""But he is relentless. When Donald puts his eye on a goal, there's no distracting him."" By Trump's own account, he ""took my eye off the ball"" in the 1990s, when his casino empire in Atlantic City suffered through six corporate bankruptcies. At the time, he blamed his executives for the failures, which led some of his closest aides to lose faith in him. Trump describes his leadership style as acting as an ""army of one"" -- relying mainly on his own judgment. In his book ""Think Like a Billionaire,"" he called himself a ""screamer"" who doesn't hesitate to berate associates. That will be nothing new in the Oval Office, where Bill Clinton, for example, was often heard venting at aides who had disappointed him. But Trump will follow four consecutive presidents who took considerable pride in the depth of their understanding of policy details. President Obama has joked that he knows many areas of policy better than his aides do. President George W. Bush, who had an MBA from Harvard Business School, instituted firm top-down controls and insisted on crisp, clear lines of authority. He ran tight meetings and used his vice president, Richard B. Cheney, as a chief operating officer. President Clinton was so detail-oriented that he often engaged aides in lengthy debates that they said felt more like seminars than decision meetings. Trump, in contrast, ""rarely followed a schedule and never prepared for meetings,"" Res said. ""When you brought him an issue, you had to tell him how great he was and how his way was right. But if you could get him to think your idea was really his idea, then you could usually get what you wanted."" Several of Trump's former executives said staffers knew that the last person to talk to the boss about an issue would usually get what he or she wanted. That trait was so reliable that at least one executive, who asked not to be named because he still advises Trump, said he would camp out in Trump's office in the final hours ahead of key deadlines, making certain that his would be the last word the boss heard before making his decision. Trump has never claimed to be interested in deep levels of detail. In ""Think Like a Billionaire,"" he wrote that when he's making big decisions, ""I try to step back and remember my first shallow reaction. The day I realized it can be smart to be shallow was, for me, a deep experience."" In the same book, he wrote that narcissism ""can be a useful quality. . . . A narcissist does not hear the naysayers. At the Trump Organization, I listen to people, but my vision is my own."" In service of his vision, Trump will outwork even the most industrious young staffer. ""He will work longer hours than any president simply because he doesn't sleep,"" O'Donnell said. ""The White House staff is going to have a different kind of guy. They will see him wandering around at 3 or 4 in the morning, because that is what he does."" ""There was no down time for them,"" Sunshine said. ""No down time. It was always go, go, go."" As Trump's first executive, when he was first breaking away from his father to develop real estate in Manhattan, Sunshine would spend days bombing around the island with the boss in his black limousine, scouting properties. ""When Donald is on a mission, when his eye is on the ball, when he has a clear-cut goal, he gets there,"" she said. ""Donald is extremely brilliant, and he doesn't take any bullsh--. He gives out a lot of it, but he doesn't take it. He sees right through it, so he does not respect people who are disloyal or who try to get at him publicly. He doesn't like that at all."" Trump enforced loyalty by requiring top employees to sign non-disclosure agreements that limited their ability to talk about their work. ""Loyalty was prized,"" said Randal Pinkett, who won the 2005 season of Trump's reality TV show, ""The Apprentice,"" and then oversaw the renovation of Trump's casino properties in Atlantic City. ""People who do well there are people who are willing to follow his lead and remain loyal to him."" Those who do, tend to stay. Trump's inner circle has long included people who have worked for him for three or four decades. His chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, originally worked for the president-elect's father, Fred, and has been with the Trump family for almost 40 years. Weisselberg is the man Trump's closest aides point to as the consummate Trump executive: Good at his work, secretive, press-shy, fiercely loyal, expert at managing the boss. ""I'm sure Donald will keep some of his own people around him,"" Sunshine said. ""Loyalty matters, and Donald is accustomed to working with just four people around him."" Although Res and Sunshine disagree on how well Trump will adapt to the White House -- Res says it will be a hard pivot; Sunshine thinks her former boss will figure it out on the fly -- they agree he is likely to surround himself with a hard-charging staff with mostly women in charge. ""He totally believed that women work harder and are stronger,"" Res said. ""He called them 'killers,' and that's his highest compliment. And he didn't feel like he had to compete with them because he was a man and we were women."" Trump also likes to hire people who have opposed or blocked him. ""Donald would hire lawyers who opposed him on certain projects just so they couldn't oppose him on the next one,"" Res said. ""He'd say, 'Keep your enemies close.' "" Such hires weren't just put on ice; several became important figures in Trump projects. Trump sometimes brings aboard people who he thinks just look the part. In 1981, he saw a security guard at the U.S. Open tennis championships who did a nice job of ejecting some hecklers. Trump asked Res to hire the man. ""But you've never even met him!"" she protested. Trump said he liked how the man handled the situation. That security guard, Matthew Calamari, has worked for Trump for 35 years and is now chief operating officer of Trump Properties. (His son, Matthew Calamari Jr., started with Trump five years ago as a security guard and is now the Trump Organization's director of surveillance.) Ultimately, however, Trump's former executives say he confides only in his adult children, and especially his older daughter. ""He doesn't have friends he can totally trust,"" Res said. ""He trusts Ivanka."" In the public imagination, courtesy of Trump's catchphrase on ""The Apprentice,"" the new president will summarily fire staffers who displease him. But in reality, although Trump did not hesitate to sack people he considered disloyal or incompetent, he did not do so cavalierly, former aides said. They said he would be sensitive to public reaction to a president who suffered rapid turnover in his senior staff. Trump has also used the threat of lawsuits as a cudgel against those who block his way or criticize him in public; that's an avenue he won't have as president, though he has said he wants to dilute First Amendment protections of free speech.  ""He will probably find he can't do nearly as much in Washington as he thinks,"" said Dave Shiflett, co-author of Trump's book ""The America We Deserve,"" which was published to set up a possible presidential campaign in 2000. ""He wants to drain the swamp, but he is going to find there is a lot of quicksand in the swamp. A lot of people in his party don't like him, and a lot of Democrats don't like him. He paid a price for running that kind of campaign.""  The new president will have to decide whether to maintain his fiery, divisive campaign rhetoric or work more quietly to cut deals, said Leon Panetta, President Clinton's chief of staff and defense secretary. Trump could ""create a real crisis"" if he tries to build a wall and deport all illegal immigrants, Panetta said, or the 45th president could turn to the more conciliatory approach he described in his victory speech Wednesday morning. Trump ""is not a Republican, and he is not a Democrat,"" Panetta said. ""He really does have the opportunity to create an interesting coalition if he wants to take the time to do it.""

But on a night when Clinton fell short of expectations nationwide, the margin was far closer than polling had suggested. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton had 48.5 percent of the statewide vote, compared with 46.2 percent for Trump -- a margin of less than 83,000 votes out of more than 3.4 million total. Clinton was aided in winning the state's 13 electoral votes by her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, a well-liked former Virginia governor who got his start 20 years ago on the Richmond City Council. Trump and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, drew heavy support among rural and white voters, but the Democrats were stronger in the more diverse urban and suburban areas around Northern Virginia, parts of Hampton Roads and Richmond. On its surface, the win seems to confirm the evolution of Virginia from red state to blue. It was the only Southern state that went for Clinton. But the reality is more complicated: Trump was seen by many voters as a unique candidate, and other Republicans in congressional races fared better than he did.         1 of 23       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                     Skip Ad   x           What Election Day looks like in the D.C. area      View Photos   Washington Post photographers capture the region's residents as they cast their votes.

Barbara Comstock managed a comfortable victory over Democratic challenger LuAnn Bennett in the 10th District. With 94 percent of precincts reporting, Comstock outdueled Bennett 54 percent to 46 percent in what had been a hard-fought race. The Trump candidacy highlighted a growing division among voters in Virginia, as large numbers of white residents, particularly those without a college education, saw Trump as the one political figure who captured their anger and frustration with a system that seemed indifferent to them. What happens next, with Virginia facing a gubernatorial race next year and the Republican Party divided between Trump supporters and mainstream candidates who had distanced themselves from him, will be a high-profile test of how the party regroups. The question is especially fraught because of how close Trump came to winning in the Old Dominion. As results trickled in and Trump pulled out to an early and persistent lead, Clinton supporters began to fear the worst. At the victory party held by state Democrats in Falls Church, the crowd at the State Theatre grew quieter, and hugs turned to reassuring pats on the back. Relief over the statewide victory was tempered by Clinton's weaker-than-expected showing around the country. ""We've done a great job with new Americans, with Latinos, with women,"" said Rep. Don Beyer, who easily won reelection to his Northern Virginia seat. ""But the white working-class voter without a high school education that has been the core of our party have gone over to Donald Trump. What are we going to do to bring them back?""  Polling places reported heavy turnout and few glitches.

View Graphic      Gov. Terry McAuliffe, one of Clinton's closest friends and biggest boosters, tried to reassure the crowd at the State Theatre. ""We are a blue state tonight,"" McAuliffe shouted to the assembled Democrats. ""Virginia went for Clinton!"" Before dawn on Tuesday, Kaine had been optimistic as he cast his ballot at his family's longtime polling place in Richmond. ""It's kind of like we've done all we can do, and now it's in the hands of voters,"" the senator said. ""But we feel really comfortable about it. And it's so nice to be back here in the neighborhood.""  Virginia has become politically sexy in recent years after shedding its longtime Republican status to support President Obama in 2008 and 2012. The state that had gone for every GOP nominee since Richard Nixon won in 1968 was suddenly in play, and in 2016 it ranked as one of the hottest swing states in the country. Clinton's choice of Kaine as her running mate was a sign of how crucial the state was to Democrats. But once Trump became the Republican nominee, polls suggested that the Old Dominion looked less like a battleground and more like a win for Clinton. By late summer, the Democrats even held off on TV spending. Early exit polls on Tuesday suggested that more Democrats than Republicans came out to vote in Virginia -- a trend that began in 2008 with Obama's first election after five straight elections of bigger GOP turnout. Trump, who owns a golf course and a winery in Virginia, was especially strong in the central and southwest parts of the state. But in recent weeks his campaign seemed in disarray. In October, Trump axed his Virginia campaign chairman, Corey Stewart, after Stewart complained about a lack of resources. Later, when Clinton began to fade in the polls, the Trump campaign said it would ramp up spending in Virginia. And Trump himself made a dramatic midnight appearance in Loudoun County the Saturday before Election Day.  [Campaigns make last-minute sprint]  That prompted the Clinton camp to send Kaine and Vice President Biden to George Mason University on Monday night. McAuliffe also took a more-visible role, spending the final weekend firing up campaign workers at stops around Richmond, Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia. Trump's campaign always had problems with women and nonwhite voters in Virginia. Exit polls Tuesday suggested that women favored Clinton by a wide margin, and nonwhite voters went for the Democrat by even more. ""As a woman and as a Muslim, he is very offensive,"" Nezha Selloum, 38, said after casting her vote for Clinton at Francis Scott Key Elementary School in Arlington. Northern Virginia precincts reported particularly heavy turnout among immigrant and nonwhite voters. A much smaller group that made its presence felt in the election: convicted felons who had their voting rights restored by McAuliffe. That move was challenged all the way to the Supreme Court of Virginia by state Republicans and lambasted by Trump on the campaign trail.  [Legal win for McAuliffe on felon voting rights]  One of those new voters was Sylvester Hall, who spent a year in jail in 1979 for buying $25 worth of cigarettes with another man's bank check. Hall was chauffeured by friends to the polling place at Bailey's Community Center. Grinning from ear to ear, he cast his ballot for Clinton, his aunt cheering him in the background, fists in the air. The feeling was ""hard to describe,"" Hall said. ""It's been beautiful."" Hispanic voters also are emerging as an important voting bloc in Virginia. In Woodbridge, Marie Vargas, 72, said she had recently become a citizen so she could vote for Clinton. Her granddaughter, Jesenia Gomez, 19, also chose Clinton with her first vote after growing fed up with Trump's criticism of Latinos. ""It's time for a change and I don't think separating people is what we need right now, "" Gomez said.  [Latino voters turn out for Clinton]  The Republican candidate's problems with such groups had raised the question of whether the ""Trump effect"" would hinder Republicans running for Congress in Virginia. It did not, as Comstock sailed to a win and other races played out as expected. In the newly redrawn 4th District, A. Donald McEachin, a Democrat who represents Henrico County in the state Senate, became only the second African American to represent Virginia in Congress since Reconstruction. Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott, the other African American in the state's delegation, was never in much danger in the 3rd District. Whatever drama surrounding the federal races in Virginia, nothing quite matched the sideshow quality of the mayoral race in the state capital, Richmond. In a crowded field, former state delegate Joseph Morrissey continually led in the polls -- despite having pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor for his relationship with his office assistant, who was 17 at the time. But Morrissey, 59, fell far short of projections Tuesday and conceded the race as polls closed.

The Democrats asked for restraining orders to prevent what they characterized as ballot-box vigilantism by Trump's Republican presidential campaign and his friend Roger Stone's political organization, Stop the Steal. But the Supreme Court issued a one-page denial in a case out of Ohio, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noting that state law already forbids voter intimidation. And the Democrats' arguments in federal courts in Pennsylvania and North Carolina fell flat in those crucial battlegrounds, too. Warning repeatedly that the election is about to be stolen from him, Trump has called on his supporters to act as election observers in parts of the country to prevent fraud. That has stirred fears of minority voters being confronted and challenged by self-appointed poll watchers. In North Carolina, U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles said she saw insufficient evidence the state's Republicans and Trump want supporters to intimidate minorities on Tuesday. But she said she will keep an eye on the balloting and could revisit the case quickly if there's evidence of a conspiracy to suppress voting.  ""These are difficult times,"" Eagles said at a hearing. In Pennsylvania, U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond denied a request to pre-emptively ban Republicans from polling places, saying that Democrats had not produced any evidence there would be problems. He faulted the effort as a last-minute ""mad scramble"" and said it would be wrong to ask the Pennsylvania GOP chairman to travel across the state on a day's notice for the hearing. A federal court in Nevada also planned a hearing Monday in a similar dispute. Last week, a federal judge in Cleveland issued a temporary restraining order warning that anyone, regardless of political affiliation, who engages in intimidation or harassment near or inside polling places will face contempt of court charges. But a federal appeals court blocked the order on Sunday after the Trump campaign argued that it tramples on the First Amendment right to free speech and was issued without evidence of voter intimidation during the early balloting that has been going on in Ohio for weeks. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to reinstate the restraining order. Ginsburg criticized Trump over the summer before apologizing for her remarks. Her comments raised questions about her impartiality and whether she would participate in election disputes involving Trump. ___ Associated Press writers Emery Dalesio in Greensboro, North Carolina; Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia; and Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.

And even if she wins, Hillary Clinton will still be feeling the effects of the multiyear campaign waged by Republicans in Congress to destroy her. The evidence suggests that her GOP foes will try to end her presidency prematurely by colluding with an implacably hostile conservative media and, it now seems, right-wing agents inside the FBI.  Clinton got good news on Sunday when FBI Director James B. Comey announced that his decision not to charge her would remain unchanged after the agency's review of newly discovered emails.  But Comey's announcement only underscored his own recklessness in issuing his Oct. 28 letter announcing the existence of the emails before the FBI even knew what was in them. His letter poisoned the political atmosphere against Clinton without any justification -- to the great advantage of Trump and the glee of her congressional critics. So while I celebrate the conclusion of the most abysmal campaign of my lifetime, I fear that this will not end the division, aggression and rancid prejudice Trump has nurtured.     Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said, ""Hillary Clinton is guilty,"" at a Nov. 6 rally in Sterling Heights, Mich., after FBI Director James B. Comey said the bureau won't recommend charges against Hillary Clinton after reviewing newly discovered emails. (The Washington Post)    [Here's the America Trump doesn't get]  A Trump victory would unleash the furies. But even a Trump loss will not advance the cause of social peace and mutual tolerance unless the majority of Americans who still believe in making our experiment in self-government work insist on the need for Congress to govern, not obstruct. Abraham Lincoln had little use for political grudges: ""I am in favor of short statutes of limitations in politics."" His successors in the Republican Party would no doubt declare him a sellout for harboring such sentiments. After all we have learned about Trump's selfishness, indiscipline, mendacity, greed, misogyny, vindictiveness and intellectual laziness, it should not be necessary to continue to make a case against him. The man who opened his campaign by declaring that many immigrants to our country from Mexico are ""rapists""  has legitimized far-right politics and the open expression of bigotry. White nationalism has flourished in the garden of Trumpism. Voters know about his treatment of women, his shortchanging those who worked for him, his warm statements about authoritarian leaders, his readiness to be assisted by Vladimir Putin's minions, his denigration of a Gold Star family and a heroic POW, and his open promises to use the instruments of government to punish his enemies. Long ago, all this should have reduced his share of the vote to single digits. The fact that Trump, on the contrary, still has a chance of victory speaks to a profound distemper in the country. Our deep divides along lines of party, race, class, gender and region guarantee even a man as deeply flawed as Trump a firm foundation of support. And many of our fellow citizens, shaken by economic and social changes, are hurting so much that they have embraced the opportunity to use Trump as a way of expressing their rage.  Trump's rise challenges both sides of politics. The massive support for Trump among white working-class voters suggests that they do not find the economic promises of progressive politicians sufficiently persuasive or believable to entice them away from the riskiest vote they will ever cast in their lives. Liberals have much work to do.   [The real national embarrassment]      Voters in Pennsylvania and Ohio weigh in on FBI Director James Comey's decision to send a letter to members of Congress informing them that newly discovered emails were either duplicates or personal emails that were not related to government business from Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state. (Peter Stevenson,Erin Patrick O'Connor,Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)   But the true disgrace is the timidity and opportunism of Republican leaders. By supporting Trump, legions of Republican officeholders, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have signaled that this preposterous candidate's endorsement of their ideological agenda of tax cuts and deregulation matters far more to them than his authoritarian tendencies or his intolerance. History has not been kind to pro-business conservatives who in the past tried to use far-right demagogues to crush enemies to their left. And the end of the campaign has found Trump in close alliance with Clinton's Republican tormentors in Congress. Reps. Jason Chaffetz (Utah), Darrell Issa (Calif.), Trey Gowdy (S.C.) and their allies have spent years hurling charges and driving up Clinton's unpopularity.  They gave Trump his talking points in the final days, with a major and outrageously misleading assist from the FBI. Comey's second letter could not undo the gratuitous damage he caused Clinton or her party by abruptly altering the trajectory of the campaign. One does not have to overlook her mistakes or her failings to insist that nothing Clinton has done justifies the hatred that has come her way. She is one of the most prepared and disciplined Americans ever to seek the presidency. She has devoted her life to public service, and her record as a senator and secretary of state won her high favorable ratings -- which Congress's taxpayer-financed investigation machine systematically set about to bring down. If Clinton does prevail, the country will need to back up its rejection of Trump with a rebuke to those who would use Trumpian tactics to deny her legitimacy and stymie the government's ability to function. Unending investigations that manufacture accusations based on preconceived conclusions is not Congress's mission. The vile spirit of this campaign cannot be allowed to contaminate the next four years.   Read more from E.J. Dionne's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
